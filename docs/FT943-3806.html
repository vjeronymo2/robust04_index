			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (4): Democracy heals divisions - Politics: Mr Ramos is gaining confidence in his use of power, Amid bickering between diverse political groups, Mr Fidel Ramos, who won the presidential election in May 1992 in a field of seven candidates, has mustered broad support for a reform-oriented economic programme. He has pursued a reformist agenda under a democracy - an exception among the east Asian 'economic tigers' bred under authoritarian forms of government. Mr Ramos declared soon after taking office that, after the country's traumatic experience with authoritarian rule (under former president Ferdinand Marcos), his administration would try to duplicate the neighbouring countries' success stories, but with a democratic government that would attempt to reconcile the often unwieldy political culture with an oligarchical economy. That the economy has grown substantially since he took over indicates that his strategy is on course. However, the wide gap between rich and poor, a raucous compilation of politicians often guided by material rather than ideological aims, and widespread corruption in the bureaucracy remain formidable obstacles to the Ramos government's programme. These problems have been fodder for the local communist insurgency and its right-wing counterpart; though, with a programme that appears to have succeeded in dividing radicals and moderates within the rebel movements, the government has been able to slow their momentum. Since the passage of a law early in the Ramos term, which legalised the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), its size has dwindled owing to attrition and the reduced attraction of joining the movement. From more than 25,000 armed regulars in 1986, the communist ranks had shrunk to some 7,500-8,000 by 1993. The number of violent incidents involving the CPP's armed unit, the New People's Army, had also slumped from about 3,600 in 1989 to about 1,500 in 1993. With the exception of one area in northern Mindanao, all regions in the country registered sharply lower insurgent activity in 1993. As the strength of the communists declines, due partly to the improving economic conditions at home and the growing irrevelance of communism abroad, conflicts rack the decimated forces of the Philippine rebels. In this situation, the government has been able to drive top communist leaders, living in exile in the Netherlands, to the negotiating table. This division has translated to weaker communist fronts in the labour sector. Left-wing militants were able to instigate strikes with impunity nearly a decade ago, but their appeal has largely worn off. Last year, the number of strikes was down to 121 from 182 in 1991, with the number of workers involved down by by 20,000 to 35,000. The peace negotiations are expected to continue the decline in the communist ranks. Military officers believe that the emaciated movement can only be capable now of limited terrorist actions in urban centres, though these can have jarring effects on the business sector. Moslem secessionist groups in the southern island of Mindanao have also been participating in peace dialogues with the government. A ceasefire expected soon, to be supervised by the Organisation of Islamic Conference through Indonesia, could set the scene for a government initiative to end the 20-year conflict. The two main Moslem groups, the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, are said to have a combined armed following of over 18,300. A third group, the extremist Abu Sayyaf, has become more identified with kidnap and extortion activities, however, and a government offensive on its main camp in July was believed to have severely crippled its strength. Talks between the government and the Moslem groups, late last year in Jakarta, have led to an agreement to continue the dialogue, even though violations of the truce have occurred occasionally in recent months. Meanwhile, the ultra-right rebels, after the attempted coup d'etat in late 1989, have broken up, reportedly into at least four groups. Some of the leaders have been recruited to the political parties, with a few even fielded as candidates in the 1992 elections for Congress seats. None won any of the national positions, but a few were elected at local-government level. More of the former military rebels are being groomed for the 1995 elections. As these favourable developments ease the demands on the military, the armed forces have begun to take on such esoteric assignments as 'community development' and 'environment protection.' These, acording to Mr Ramos, 'possess the attributes most conducive to economic development and nation building.' The task of maintaining internal security, including the fight against insurgency, is to be turned over to the Philippine National Police (PNP), though this move is being delayed by debates at various levels, indicating its political sensitivity. The recent alliance forged by Mr Ramos's ruling coalition, the Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD), with the largest opposition party, Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Struggle of the Democratic Filipino), is intended mainly to bolster each group's bid for the 1995 elections for Congress seats; though it could also be exploited by the Ramos administration to secure speedy approval for priority bills under its reform agenda, before the election campaign starts in earnest early next year. In the Senate, many of the government's legislative initiatives have had a rough time. The national budget has in recent years been put through the wringer, after speedy passage through the House of Representatives. In December, when Mr Ramos learned about drastic reorientation of certain financing programmes, he initiatted discussions on a shift in the present presidential system of government, with a bicameral legislature, into a unicameral body. The initiative died after wide public disapproval of the plan, which was seen as a ploy to return to authoritarian rule. Since then, he has resorted to frequent direct dialogues with members of the two chambers to get his priority bills moving. The excruciatingly long process on the Expanded Value-added Tax proposal is an example of how that type of partnership could be made to work. Sceptics fear that the Laban-Lakas alliance could deepen the wedge already separating various contending factions in many parts of the country. And with local elections tending to be more emotional, some analysts are worried that the 1995 elections could be accompanied by violence. Nevertheless, Mr Ramos appears to have gained more confidence in his use of political power, unlike his predecessor's awkward hold on the reins. He has been able to prove that democracy can actually avoid constitutional gridlock and pursue reforms, some of which require politically unpleasant policies. His primary concern now is to craft 'a level of political will and national capacity' to spur his nation towards sustained economic growth. "Our democracy is far from perfect,' Mr Ramos has acknowledged, 'but it works well enough for us to be able to move it away from the politics of patronage, guns, goons and gold.' If he can achieve that, the Philippines could become a new model for modernisation in a region of strongmen and garrison states.</p>

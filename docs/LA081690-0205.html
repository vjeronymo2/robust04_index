			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY WON'T BACK BILL ON CABLE TV RULES  </P> <P> Seal Beach will not join 10 other Orange County cities in urging Congress to  pass a bill that would inject new competition into the cable television  industry while giving cities a stronger hand in regulating local cable  operators.  </P> <P> Congress is considering legislation aimed at reducing cable television rates by  breaking up local cable monopolies, which have flourished under conditions  created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. Cities also would  regain the power to regulate rates.  </P> <P> The City Council voted Monday not to support the proposed changes to the act  because the legislation could allow telephone companies to enter the cable  business.  </P> <P> Council members expressed concern that it would be harder for the city to deal  with General Telephone than with Comcast Cable, the city's sole cable provider,  which has a regional office next door to city hall.  </P> <P> "I don't think they can operate at the local level," said councilman Joe Hunt  of large telephone companies such as GTE, which currently are prohibited from  offering cable services.  </P> <P> Comcast offers extensive local programming, including broadcasts of City  Council and Planning Commission meetings, a weekly crime prevention and  interview program hosted by a police officer, and a number of programs produced  by local residents. Council members said they doubted that GTE could duplicate  such service.  </P> <P> A GTE spokesman disagreed, saying "I don't see that any of these things would  ever be lost" if the telephone company was allowed to compete with Comcast in  Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Further, phone companies will be able to offer high-tech services that cable  companies cannot match when fiber optic cable replaces copper wire in the next  five to 10 years, said Thomas Facon, a GTE district manager.  </P> <P> Families would be able to use their television and telephone together to shop  at home, instantly transmit a video of their child's first steps to a relative,  and choose movie videos from a menu on their screen and watch them any time, he  said.  </P> <P> GTE is experimenting with such "two-way television" services in a pilot project  in Cypress.  </P> <P> City officials also worried that allowing GTE to offer cable services could  reduce the franchise fees that Seal Beach receives because GTE could use its  telephone business revenue to subsidize its cable service. The city collects  five cents from Comcast for every dollar the company receives from subscribers.  Lower cable rates would mean less revenue for the city.  </P> <P> Facon said GTE, even if it wanted to, would not be able to keep its cable rates  artificially low by charging telephone customers more because telephone rates  are regulated by the Public Utilities Commission.

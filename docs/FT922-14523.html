			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Voters seem resigned to a hung parliament BRITAIN appears set for a hung parliament after Thursday's election but there is little enthusiasm for the prospect among the voters. The message of the latest batch of opinion polls is that the two central elements in the Conservative strategy - tax and Mr John Major's leadership - have failed to close the narrow lead which Labour established at the outset of the campaign. Late swings in past elections - in 1970 and February 1974 - have seen bigger leads overturned, but senior cabinet ministers were among those Conservatives who were suggesting yesterday that the best Mr Major could now hope for was to emerge as the leader of the largest party in a hung parliament. The health service, un-employment and education rather than taxation remain overwhelmingly the issues which the voters say are uppermost in their minds, while Mr Major's soapbox performances around the country have failed to prevent a further erosion in his personal lead over Mr Neil Kinnock. The FT's poll of polls (which excludes yesterday's two panel surveys) puts Labour at 39.4 per cent against the Conservatives on 37.1 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 19.4 per cent. Translated into representation at Westminster that would give Labour 307 seats, 19 short of an overall majority, while the Conservatives would be on 296. That would leave the Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power. Two polls published yesterday signal that the voters have been persuaded that neither of the main parties is likely to win an overall majority. Gallup for the Sunday Telegraph suggests that 71 per cent expect a hung parliament. Only 18 per cent welcome the prospect, 50 per cent are unhappy with the idea and the remainder are unconcerned either way. NOP for the Mail on Sunday found that 40 per cent of the electorate think a coalition government would be 'bad' for Britain, while 38 per cent were in favour. The surveys point to a continuing slide in Mr Major's lead over Mr Kinnock as the most competent party leader. A Mori panel survey for The Sunday Times says that the 26-point lead in satisfaction ratings with which Mr Major started the campaign had by last week shrunk to nothing. Both leaders enjoyed a net rating (the satisfieds minus the dissatisfieds) of 2 per cent. An ICM poll for the Sunday Express found that 38 per cent of voters said Mr Major would make a better prime minister than his rivals. Mr Kinnock scores 25 per cent and Mr Paddy Ashdown 19 per cent. Mori suggests that the Conservatives' sustained onslaught on Labour's tax policies has yet to persuade the electorate that tax is the issue on which they should decide their vote. Although they may change their minds in the privacy of the voting booth, the survey suggests only 13 per cent regard their tax bills as the central issue, while 59 per cent highlight the health service as a deciding factor. The Tories could lose the marginal Birmingham seat of Selly Oak, according to an opinion poll. It would mean the disappearance from Westminster of Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark, one of the most vocal of Tory backbenchers. A Quality Fieldwork poll for the Birmingham Post newspaper put Labour eight points ahead of the Conservatives. In 1987 Mr Beaumont-Dark retained the seat with a majority of 2,584 over Labour in a four-cornered contest. Quality Fieldwork interviewed 921 voters in the constituency on March 31 and April 1.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Last night's        Latest opinion      Betting        Futures FT forecast              poll             odds         trading  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative 296 seats    35%             2/1          293 Labour       307 seats    41%             4/11         307 Liberal/Dem   23 seats    20%           400/1           27                  (NOP/Mail on Sunday)  Ladbrokes     Dealing on the                        Field date  (for most seats)  number of seats                         April 3-4                 (IG index mid-prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

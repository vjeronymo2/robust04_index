Talking to journalists in the State Duma Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy assumed that the president "evidently brought  together those who did not meet with Richard Nixon."    He said Yeltsin's public refusal to receive the former  American president now staying in Moscow on a private visit,  after Nixon met several opposition leaders, the ban on Nixon's  meetings with the government and the head of the presidential  administration Sergey Filatov, "have nothing even to do with the  slightest ideas of democracy, loyalty, tolerance or diplomacy."    Yavlinskiy also said that the contents of his  hour-and-a-half  conversation with the former American head of state on March 8  "gave no grounds for such a demonstration."    According to Yavlinskiy, during their meeting, Nixon  mentioned that the list of his meetings in Russia had been  agreed upon with President Clinton. Yavlinskiy said the former  American president also disagreed with claims that Yeltsin is  oppressive and undemocratic because Nixon could meet with  opposition leaders. Nixon said this shows the president is  confident and is quite broad-minded.</p>

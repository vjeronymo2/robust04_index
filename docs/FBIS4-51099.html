			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial industrial and commercial  administration, provincial grain department, provincial trade  department, provincial supply and marketing cooperative,  provincial public health department, and provincial  technological supervision bureau recently issued a joint  circular to urge all localities to strengthen management of  edible salt markets and resolutely prevent uniodized salt from  entering iodine deficient areas so as to ensure people's  physical and mental health and consolidate and improve the  achievements in preventing and treating the diseases resulting  from lack of iodine.    The circular calls for continued efforts to implement the  "methods of Jilin Province for management of the salt industry."  Salt administrative bureaus at all levels are administrative  departments for salt industry to take charge of the unified  distribution of the salt used for various purposes. No units or  individuals are permitted to engage in the production, retail  sales, or wholesales of salt without approval. We should ensure  the quality, supply, and marketing of iodized salt. The units  and individuals who sell and supply substandard iodized salt,  uniodized salt, and low-quality salt to disease areas or  breweries and livestock breeders will be sternly dealt with  according to law in the same way as we deal with sellers of fake  medicines. Wholesales of marketable salt are managed by salt  industry companies at all levels in a unified manner, and a  business license is needed. The provincial salt administrative  bureau will verify and issue "permission for salt business" to  Jilin's salt wholesales units before 31 May, which should than  register with local industrial and commercial administrations  and obtain new business licenses. State-owned (collective)  grain enterprises, commercial units, and supply and marketing  cooperatives engaged in the retail sales of edible salt (iodized  salt) should purchase from designated salt whole sellers, and  they are not permitted to purchase from unlicensed units.  Individual industrial and commercial households which sell  edible salt (iodized salt) on a commission basis should hold the  "permission for retail sales of edible salt by individual  industrial and commercial households" issued by salt industry  administrative departments at and above the county level.  Industrial and commercial administrations, salt administrative  departments, public health departments, and technological  supervision departments should work in close coordination to  strictly deal with the units and individuals who violate the  laws, regulations, and circulars on the salt industry.</p>

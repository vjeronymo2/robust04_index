			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Du Pont plans large textiles restructuring DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said yesterday it is planning a major restructuring of its textile organisation. However, the Wilmington-based group failed to provide any details except to announce a handful of mid-level management changes and to say that the restructuring plan reflected 'the increasing size, scope and market focus of the company's global textile business'. A statement from Du Pont said that Mr Paul Gillease, head of the group's textiles business, would move to Europe in order to take charge of integrating the nylon fibre businesses of Du Pont and of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). Du Pont recently received European Commission approv-al to go ahead with the planned swap of its acrylics business for ICI's European nylons activities. It is now waiting for US approval. Du Pont's fibres division made Dollars 166m of after-tax operating income in the third quarter of 1992, against Dollars 150m a year ago.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK PSBR It is just as well that sterling's recovery and the falling mortgage rate have left the gilts market in reasonably cheerful mood. Otherwise yesterday's PSBR figures could not have been shrugged off so lightly. The most immediately unnerving part is the fall in corporation tax receipts to little more than half their level of a year ago. That bodes ill for the PSBR in January, normally a heavy month for corporation tax payments. It also suggests the government's Pounds 10.5bn target for the full year will be exceeded by a fair margin. The Bank of England's funding position suddenly seems a trifle less comfortable, especially if it wants to stock up for 1992-93 ahead of the election. In the slightly longer term, the worry concerns the way the cycle is still biting deeply into both tax receipts and spending. Against a background of weak recovery at best, the 1992-3 PSBR now also looks also likely to exceed the Pounds 19.8bn City consensus at the turn of the year. That puts the total into the range where a little bit extra here or there does not seem to matter. Thus, the prospect of vote-winning tax reductions in the budget stirs little comment about fiscal rectitude. The same goes for Labour's talk about phasing in its tax and national insurance changes while increasing pensions and child benefit immediately. Each of these would add the odd billion to an already high PSBR; not enough to restore it to the real levels of the crisis-ridden 1970s, but sufficient to cramp the post-election style of the lucky winner. Pledges of higher spending on the infrastructure need to be taken with an ever larger pinch salt. So do promises of tax cuts from a party which still professes commitment to a balanced budget over the cycle.</p>

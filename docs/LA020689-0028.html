			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS WELCOME ATTENTION;  </P> <P> BUSH'S PERSONAL TOUCHES PROMOTE BIPARTISAN SPIRIT  </P> <P> It was a scene to conjure with -- Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the  baronial chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, bouncing on the Lincoln bed  in the upper reaches of the White House with his wife, Peatsy, while President  Bush snapped their picture.  </P> <P> His honeymoon with Congress may be short-lived, but at least for now, George  Bush's skillful use of such personal touches -- coupled with a barrage of  disarming rhetoric -- has some of the most powerful congressional Democrats all  but eating out of his hand. And the capital is caught up in a new spirit of  bipartisanship not seen for a decade or more.  </P> <P> "The personal touch makes a real difference," said Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia,  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "It doesn't change folks'  positions, but it makes them willing to sit down and talk with an open mind."  </P> <P> Massachusetts' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a leader of the Democrats' liberal wing,  said Bush "is building up respect for a willingness to listen and that goes a  long way. We have our differences, but he is helping us try to find middle  ground."  </P> <P> Few expect the new bipartisanship to last indefinitely or eliminate the  all-too-real disagreements that exist on critical national issues. Some wonder  whether it can even survive past next Thursday, when Bush lays out his policy  agenda and the details of his position on the federal budget before a joint  session of Congress.  </P> <P> But after 12 years of often-rocky relations with the Ronald Reagan and Jimmy  Carter administrations, congressional leaders appear to welcome the possibility  of less confrontational dealings with the executive branch.  </P> <P> In particular, Democrats said they are relieved to be dealing with a President  who shows interest in them and their work and understands Congress as an  institution. Bush's background as a former Texas congressman is seen as giving  him a degree of understanding and respect for the role of Congress that many of  his predecessors lacked.  </P> <P> The new atmosphere on Capitol Hill "is for real," said Nunn, "because we've got  somebody in the White House now who's listening to people in Congress and that  makes a difference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demonstrates Interest  </P> <P> Calling Bush's approach "beyond bipartisanship," Kennedy said the President  "has demonstrated an accessibility and an interest in Congress and an  understanding of it as an institution that we haven't seen in a long time -- at  least since President Ford."  </P> <P> Gerald R. Ford had been a member of Congress, of course, and Carter and Reagan  are, as Kennedy pointed out, "not of Congress."  </P> <P> Although Bush has sometimes portrayed his appeals for bipartisanship as a  return to traditional values, bipartisanship as "a big idea" in American  politics did not take hold until President Franklin D. Roosevelt's appeals to  Congress for cooperation during the Great Depression of the 1930s, according to  James David Barber, a presidential scholar at Duke University.  </P> <P> The economic crisis of the Depression was so severe and Roosevelt so  persuasive, Barber said, that House members shouted, "vote, vote" and quickly  passed the economic measures Roosevelt sent to Capitol Hill. Otherwise,  bipartisanship has seldom taken hold on domestic issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Goal Seldom Realized  </P> <P> It prevailed in foreign affairs during World War II and afterward during much  of Harry S. Truman's second Administration, but even in the sensitive area of  foreign affairs bipartisanship has been a goal presidents have more often  expressed than fully realized.  </P> <P> On the foreign relations front, however, Bush's call for bipartisanship may  already be paying some concrete dividends. While declining to reveal specifics,  Nunn said the President's private sessions with Democratic senators has brought  the Administration a step closer to achieving a consensus on the thorny problem  of South Africa's system of apartheid.  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas has spoken of "earnestly" sharing Bush's goal  of a bipartisan foreign policy and has announced several initiatives to show  "good faith" on the Democrats' part. And he has expressed optimism about  reaching a bipartisan consensus on how to end the bloody conflict in Nicaragua,  which was the source of bitterly partisan fights during the eight-year Reagan  presidency.  </P> <P> The new atmosphere was reflected at a dinner party hosted by Kennedy at his  spacious home in nearby Maclean, Va., several nights ago.  </P> <P> Attended by leaders of both parties, the dinner was a tribute to a man who  personifies bipartisanship: Max M. Kampelman, a longtime Democrat who is  retiring after serving as the Reagan Administration's chief arms negotiator.  </P> <P> Among the guests: Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker  III, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and Senate Democratic  Whip Alan Cranston of California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baker Consults Cranston  </P> <P> At one point during the party, Baker pulled Cranston aside to assure him that  the Administration agreed with his strong statements denouncing right-wing  death squads in El Salvador and the recurrence of violence against leftist  opposition leaders there.  </P> <P> Baker told Cranston, who was obviously pleased at being consulted, that Vice  President Quayle, who was leaving the next morning on a trip to Latin America,  would carry "a very strong message" about the violence to military leaders in  El Salvador.  </P> <P> At the dinner, Kennedy, Cranston and other Democratic leaders raved about the  red-carpet treatment Bush had rolled out at the White House for officials of  both parties at a reception earlier in the evening.  </P> <P> The guided tour of the White House for leaders of both parties and their wives,  conducted by Bush and his wife, Barbara, gave a grateful Cranston the first  look he had had of upstairs at the White House in his 20 years in Washington.  </P> <P> For an equally grateful Kennedy, it was his first view of the residential  quarters since his brother John was President in 1963.  </P> <P> Bush, speaking with business leaders invited to the White House for lunch  Friday, pointed out that he is "the product of Congress in some ways" and said  he realizes he will have differences with Congress when he outlines his  proposals on Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sending Confusing Signals'  </P> <P> But he said he is serious about consulting and listening to Congress because  "it'll be good for domestic policy, and I'm absolutely convinced that it is  vital for foreign policy because we've been sending confusing signals around  the world of two major branches of government that can't ever quite get  together on something important."  </P> <P> While wooing Democrats, Bush also has felt compelled to stroke the feathers of  right-wing members of his own party in the House who have served notice they  will not support the President on policies that veer from conservative  philosophy.  </P> <P> Bush will "remain true to conservative ideas," insisted Frederick D. McClure,  the President's assistant for congressional liaison, while also continuing to  reach out to "all spectrums" on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> McClure conceded that Bush's proposals on Thursday may be a serious test for  his bipartisanship campaign, but added: "I wouldn't say all hell's going to  break loose because while he's going to make some tough choices, he's going to  try to keep his approach as bipartisan as he can."  </P> <P> Several senators contrasted Bush's approach to Congress with that of Carter and  Reagan, who they felt never fully understood or appreciated the institution.  </P> <P> Carter, who had fought constantly with the Legislature when he served as  governor of Georgia, ran into difficulty from the outset of his presidency,  fulfilling a prophecy of a longtime aide who expressed concern Carter would  treat Congress like it was the Georgia Legislature and Congress would treat him  like he was Georgia's governor.  </P> <P> Although Reagan parlayed his popularity with voters into congressional support  for his economics program early in his first term, he and Congress were  constantly at loggerheads in the second term. In the first term, Reagan charmed  key members of Congress with a great deal of personal attention, but when  things turned sour in the second term he began to ignore them and frequently  attacked Congress on domestic and foreign issues.  </P> <P> Bush does not mind giving credit to Congress for the vital role it plays in  government, according to several senators. "I think it was Woodrow Wilson,"  said Kennedy, "who said, 'There's no end to what can be achieved in this city  if one is willing to give credit to others.' Bush understands that."  </P> <P> Not all Democratic leaders are so sanguine about Bush's overtures to Congress.  Hollings expressed concern that Democrats are "so intoxicated with this  honeymoon that Bush may believe he can finesse the budget situation for another  four years the way Ronald Reagan did for eight years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talk of Tour  </P> <P> Hollings and his wife enjoyed the White House tour. At Kennedy's dinner party  they talked enthusiastically of how Bush snapped their photo as they bounced on  the bed where Abraham Lincoln slept.  </P> <P> But the senator said the way he sees it, "this stroking by Bush is just to get  us to go along with this charade of saying no new taxes when we know we have to  have new revenue to solve our budget problems."  </P> <P> And Senate Majority Leader Mitchell insisted Congress will not "be lulled by  the current relations and atmosphere."  </P> <P> "The atmosphere will be better throughout the Bush term because he's a  different person from Reagan and much more likely to sustain a positive  relationship with the Congress," Mitchell said, "although there will certainly  be substantial differences on specific issues."  </P></p>

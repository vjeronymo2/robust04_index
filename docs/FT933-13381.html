			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Tough Gatt message on concessions MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is in Washington this week delivering a tough message on the need for concessions to win a Uruguay Round deal. Not even the US could unilaterally impose its will on others, he warned. He placed the blame for the slow world trade negotiations squarely on the industrialised countries, which 'have not been delivering on crucial areas' where the poor countries can compete, while the developing world has been taking more liberal positions. Just as bluntly Mr Sutherland said the governments of the developing countries must be prepared to open their textile and clothing markets to gain access for their textiles and apparel in wealthy industrialised countries. On his first trip to the US since taking the helm of Gatt, Mr Sutherland is telling administration, congressional and business leaders that December 15 is the 'immutable' deadline and that he is prepared to act 'the honest broker' to get necessary concessions. He stressed that the US had to get support from other nations if it wanted to rewrite the current negotiating text. 'If there are changes sought, it's for the country to determine that there's substantive support for them,' he said. 'Any conclusion in this Round requires everybody to take into account that they're not the only people in the world.' He saw no reason for US fears about losing its sovereignty to the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation. Negotiators in Geneva are trying to 'flesh out' the agreement reached by the industrialised countries at the Tokyo economic summit. During August the parties will be asked to obtain instructions from their governments and at the end of the month there will be a work programme to 'map out milestones which will give us various levels of agreements that have to be reached by particular dates'.</p>

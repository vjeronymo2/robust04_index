			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Rationed and restless: FT writers ask if the state's grip on people in North Korea is weakening Pyongyang has 'a distinct and native life of its own and is known (in Korea) as one of the wickedest cities of ancient and modern times', wrote US diplomat William Franklin Sands a century ago. That description could apply today. The city retains its 'wicked' image as the capital of North Korea, which appears to be heading for an international showdown over its suspected nuclear weapons programme. Next week the UN will consider imposing economic sanctions, if North Korea does not open up its nuclear facilities to inspection, while the US agreed this week to the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. The 'distinct and native life' in North Korea consists of a political culture that has transformed its 'Great Leader', Mr Kim Il-sung, into a demi-god and has cowed a frightened population. Life there is difficult and is becoming more so. The collapse of the Soviet bloc cut off previous supplies of food and energy, while the high level of defence spending has restricted investment in industrial and infrastructure development. Conditions are particularly tough in the countryside, where food shortages are reportedly widespread. Growing food has never been easy in mountainous North Korea. In the 1980s, it was able to feed its population of 21m through intensive agricultural measures, which depended on heavy use of chemical fertilisers. But since then, energy shortages have reduced fertiliser production. Falling oil imports and dwindling supplies of domestic brown coal, as mines have become exhausted, have forced factories to operate at about a third of capacity. Electricity power blackouts are becoming common. The government has encouraged people to use bicycles - some sent by charities in Japan - instead of trolley buses, to save fuel. Electrical appliances have to be registered with local authorities, which stipulate the times they can be used. The picture is not uniform, however. In Pyongyang, supplies of food and goods are more plentiful. The city's 2m residents are members of the country's elite, and are frequently vetted for their political loyalty. Those who do not make the grade must leave. 'There is a big gap between life in Pyongyang and life in the rural areas. Pyongyang is a shop window for the rest of the world,' said Mr Masao Okonogi, a professor of law at Tokyo's Keio University, who has visited North Korea. In the country as a whole, the state has needed a 'carrot and stick' policy to retain public loyalty. The carrot comprises a comprehensive welfare system that includes free housing, medical aid and education. The stick consists of intrusive political controls, including the rationing of food and clothing, and mandatory indoctrination in classes on the country's juche, or self-reliance ideology. There is also an extensive network of informers. 'There is an atmosphere of fear in North Korea, because everyone knows someone who has been packed off to a labour camp for a political crime,' said Mr Michael Breen of Merit Consulting, an investment consultancy in Seoul, who has travelled in North Korea. But there are signs that the government's controls are disintegrating as the economic situation worsens. 'Corruption has become widespread among bureaucrats since the mid-1980s and people resort to bribes to avoid punishment,' said Mr Bradley Martin, a Fulbright scholar who is writing a book on North Korea. 'The society is not as regimented as we once thought.' Mr Toshio Miyazuka, a North Korean specialist at Japan's Yamanashi Gakuin University, said the government had not been able to prevent the spread of criminal gangs. Thefts and rapes are rising. Black markets in food and other goods have emerged. The lack of food has forced factories, which are responsible for feeding their workers, to rely on them to supplement rations. 'A factory official travels the country to find new supplies. These officials could eventually become the country's first generation of businessmen, since they have acquired an expertise in trading,' said Mr Martin. The black markets have also helped to pierce the information vacuum imposed by the government. 'People know what's going on in the outside world by listening to radios bought on black markets run by Korean Chinese', who smuggle them in, said Mr Miyazuka. In spite of such knowledge, older people who grew up during the Korean war in the 1950s appear relatively committed to the government. They recall the sacrifices they made to reconstruct the economy after the war. 'North Koreans now realise that South Korea is richer, but they possess a moral rectitude because they believe that the South has sold its soul to the US,' explained Mr Anthony Michell, president of Euro-Asian Business Consultancy in Seoul and a frequent visitor to North Korea. The younger generation, however, tended to complain more about the lack of consumer goods and bureaucratic restrictions, said Mr Michell. Few dare criticise Kim Il-sung, who appears to have the genuine respect of the public for his armed resistance to Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s and 1940s - a period emphasised in school textbooks. 'Even North Korean defectors I've interviewed have expressed admiration for Kim,' said Mr Martin. Instead, domestic opposition appears directed at his son and heir apparent, Mr Kim Jong-il, the 'Dear Leader' and the head of the armed forces. He is blamed for most of the country's problems, because he came to prominence just as the economy was starting to deteriorate in the mid-1980s. There is also resentment within the North Korean government that the Kims have reserved most of the top administrative positions for their relatives. 'The situation is getting desperate in North Korea and it is highly plausible that there is growing discontent against the Kim dynasty at both the grassroots and top levels of government,' said Mr Adian Foster-Carter, director of Korean studies at the University of Leeds. Given that the foundations of North Korea's system appear so shaky, the US may prefer to wait and see whether the government survives, rather than invite a confrontation that could lead to war.

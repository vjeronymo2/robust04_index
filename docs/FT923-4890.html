			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Another suicide in Milan scandal ITALY'S growing political corruption scandal has claimed another victim with the suicide of Mr Sergio Moroni, a Socialist member of parliament under investigation by magistrates in Milan. Mr Moroni, 45, is the most senior and politically prominent of the three men linked with the investigations who have now taken their lives. Mr Renato Amorese, the secretary of the Socialist party in Lodi, near Milan, killed himself three months ago, and Mr Mario Majocchi, deputy chairman of Italy's builders' federation, took his life in July. The corruption scandal yesterday also saw the arrest of another prominent businessman, Mr Paolo Rinaldi, chief executive of the recently privatised Cementir cement group. He was formerly managing director of the Caltagirone group's construction arm. The investigations took a new turn this week with the appearance of prominent industrialists before magistrates in Milan. On Tuesday, lawyers for Mr Giuseppe Garofano, deputy chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, one of Italy's biggest private-sector groups, said he had paid L200m-L300m (Pounds 94,000-Pounds 140,000) to the Christian Democrat party in Lombardy in 1990. They said the payments were a personal gift, rather than an undeclared, and therefore illegal, contribution by the Ferruzzi-Montedison group to the party. Swiss police last week arrested Mr Raffaele Politano, long-serving private secretary of Mr Paolo Pillitteri, the former Socialist mayor of Milan. Mr Politano had been sought by police in Milan for two months on charges relating to the corruption investigation.</p>

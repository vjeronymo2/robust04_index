			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- The approach of spring field work  has not changed the situation in Russia in industries working  for the the agroindustrial complex; their enterprises are  continuing to reduce their output. Agriculture Ministry experts  believe that the drop in effective demand is the main reason  holding back production of output for the agricultural sector of  the economy. Prices for industrial products which are purchased  by the agroindustrial complex are rising more quickly -- 11.4  times last year -- than the prices for agricultural produce,  which rose only 8.4 times.    Since the beginning of the year many plants have virtually  been inoperative. According to Russia's State Committee for  Statistics, in January production of mineral fertilizers was  halted by the Belorechensk "Minudobreniya" association and the  Uvarovo chemical works, and the manufacture of flax harvesting  combines ceased even earlier at "Bezhetskselmash," the only  manufacturer of this equipment in the country. Things are no  better in the workforces which are continuing to work. For  instance, at the start of the year the "Rostselmash" association  produced only 0.6 percent of the January 1993 level of grain  harvesting combines.    A no less alarming situation has arisen in the production of  components and subassemblies which are used for making up  complete units and in repairing equipment. A lack of spare  parts has resulted in the fact that in the past year the number  of tractor and combine engines repaired at enterprises of the  Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation fell by  one-quarter, of tractors and grain harvesting combines by  one-third, and of potato harvesting combines by half.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guinness will pay pension to Saunders MR ANTHONY Tennant, out-going chairman of Guinness, the UK-based international drinks group, yesterday confirmed that the company was prepared to pay a pension to Mr Ernest Saunders, its former chairman and chief executive who was jailed for theft and false accounting. But he refused to be drawn on the size of the pay-out, which is still being negotiated. It is understood Mr Saunders, 57, will be paid between Pounds 70,000 and Pounds 80,000 a year. This compares with his salary before he was dismissed in January 1987 of Pounds 225,000. Mr Tennant, replying to a shareholder's question at the company's annual meeting, said: 'Mr Saunders is entitled to a pension in respect of his period of service with the company. He is also entitled to apply for early payment. It is company policy that the details are confidential as far as the company is concerned.' Mr Tennant gave a mixed forecast for the current trading year. He repeated cautious comments made with the preliminary results on slower profits growth, but said Latin America and south-east Asia would grow rapidly in the next five to ten years. The shares fell 18p to 567p as the market seemed to overstate Mr Tennant's caution. They later recovered to 576p. In Mexico, United Distillers, its spirits arm, had continued the process of acquiring distributors with the purchase of Inter-American Holdings, distributor for the Johnny Walker, Old Parr and Buchanan whisky brands. Mr Tennant, who was brought in from Grand Metropolitan to restore the group's reputation following the fall of Mr Saunders, is to retire at the end of this year. He will be replaced by Mr Tony Greener. Yesterday also marked the ending of an era as the Earl of Iveagh, the only remaining member of the Guinness family on the board, retired. It is the first time in the company's 233 year history the family has not been represented.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F> on 24 June; place not given -- recorded, in Russian]    [Text] Dear compatriots!    I thank you for the courage and civicmindedness that you  displayed in the first round of presidential elections, having  given me over 45 percent of your votes. Notwithstanding  systematic provocations and a stiff embargo on information, my  team and I have felt your constant support. After 23 June, the  distribution of forces in the political arena has fundamentally  changed, since you not simply voted for the first president, but  actually passed a vote of no confidence in the policy of the  current Belarusian Government and local bureaucratic  authorities. It is a turning point in the development of our  society on the path toward democracy. I am sure that we will  complete our task. There are only a few days left, and you will  acquire the power which you want, in which you have believed,  and which will not cheat you. I believe that the second round  of voting will confirm your will.    I appeal to all who voted for other candidates in the first  round to determine -- with whom do you stand? Are you defending  the old corrupt authority, which has lost touch with the people,  or are you supporting a resolute renovation of our state? I  appeal to you to go jointly on the path of honesty for the good  of every one of you, my dear compatriots. I am sure that  together we can preserve the peace and civic accord during these  difficult times, and these will become a guarantee of Belarus'  future flourishing.</p>

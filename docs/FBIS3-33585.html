According to the bishops, dialogue is the most important  tool  for understanding because it will lead to a better  interpretation of people's needs "because we know that  radicalized positions of opposing interests always lead to  violent confrontations and will increasingly deteriorate our  fragile democratic coexistence."    The note says that the best efforts must be made to acquire  and develop attitudes and actions seeking the moral cleansing of  our institutions, companies, and individual behavior.    The note also says that institutions and state powers must  have a quota of power and responsibility to be able to seek,  promote, and administer the common good in democratic ways, and  particularly respecting the poor.    "An adequate economic order requires a permanent review in  accordance with dynamic criteria of social justice. Everyone,  and particularly Christians, in labor as well as managerial  leadership positions must have a deep and clear view of our  common good. This is the best tool for fighting the corruption  that corrodes democratic ideals and hinders social and human  progress," the Paraguayan bishops' letter says.    The document adds that the problems now surfacing in diverse  demonstrations have been there for a long time: land needs,  better prices for agricultural products, and better salaries.  These problems are not isolated or circumstantial, but they  affect the entire country. This means that solutions have not  yet been proposed for these problems, which grow worse every day  and risk producing a generalized social outburst.    The document says that the much-yearned-for democratic  political institutions, which have been in place for some years,  cannot offer a satisfactory answer on their own to the needs of  the poorest sectors of the population in order to achieve social  coexistence and the enjoyment of an authentic peace.    It is therefore evident that state institutions have a  special responsibility to promote immediate initiatives seeking  just solutions to these problems, something that cannot continue  to be postponed.    "As believers, we must look at these problems through God's  eyes and understand them according to the wishes of our merciful  father," the note adds.    The bishops conclude by exhorting people to trust and pray,  knowing that the light we need to act according to God's wishes  comes from Him, who is a father full of mercy.</p>

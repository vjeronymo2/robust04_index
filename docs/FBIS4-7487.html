			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SLD Press Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski </F> by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on  the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, spokesman for the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD]. Good morning to you, sir.    [Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too.    [Woyciechowski] Could you explain to everybody in two or  three sentences--well, five at the most--what is currently  happening in Poland?    [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] I mean, we are definitely  dealing here with some form of political crisis associated with  the fact that the president refuses to approve the candidate for  finance minister and deputy prime minister, whose name had been  submitted by the prime minister--that is, Professor Rosati. For  that reason, discussions are becoming lengthy, and also there is  the fact that Poland continues to go without a finance minister.    [Woyciechowski] Why does the president refuse to approve of  Rosati? What do you think of this? What is your assessment?    [Siemiatkowski] I mean, of course an official [hesitating]  explanation was provided by the president. I will just echo  what Mr. Rosati has said: These accusations that were levied  against him are ridiculous, and I think we are dealing here with  a political game being played by the president, the goal of  which is to destabilize the current political arrangement and to  disavow the existing coalition majority, and perhaps the  president hopes, through these measures, to break the coalition  and perhaps lead to other types of political configurations. It  is a well-known fact that the president always feels very  comfortable with situations of political instability. At such  times, his activity is always on the increase. But, in periods  of hard and peaceful work by cabinets, the president's activity  kind of slows down. At any rate, that is no coincidence: If  one were to trace the whole period of President Walesa's term,  one would see that, more or less three or four months into each  cabinet's term, the president decides to launch a  counteroffensive. Of course, that is not a good sign for the  future of the political situation because every cabinet,  including this one and this coalition, is then forced to deal  with issues of third- or even fourth-order importance from the  standpoint of goals and tasks for which the Cabinet and the  coalition were established. This way, we cannot focus our  attention on fundamental tasks, such as the current issue of  budget implementation and the implementation of economic  policies and the big social reforms, which we want to continue.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Sejm Deputy, does the president want to  break the coalition?    [Siemiatkowski] I think the president's goal in this case is  perhaps to find differences in the existing coalition. Every  coalition is composed of two parties that have their own  identities and their own interests, and a coalition is always  based on compromise, and, in this case, the coalition between  the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is also a compromise.    [Woyciechowski] So can one say that President Walesa wants  to set the coalition members at odds. Can one put it this way?  Could you put it in a short phrase [words indistinct]?    [Siemiatkowski] We thought that was the president's goal at  the beginning of his measures, except that he came across a  reaction that he probably could not have predicted--namely, a  unanimous position by the PSL and the SLD, as well as the tough  position of the prime minister, who in a very persistent manner  confirmed that Mr. Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's candidate for  finance minister, is also the prime minister's candidate, and we  highly respect Prime Minister Pawlak for his position. Mr.  Rosati is also a candidate for the prime minister's deputy for  economic affairs, and, despite resistance from the Belweder, the  prime minister confirmed several times that Mr. Rosati is his  candidate. So, if the president did indeed have the goal of  setting us at odds, he failed to achieve it.    [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati returned to  Warsaw yesterday?    [Siemiatkowski] Yes, it is. He returned for the Easter  holiday.    [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati withdrew his  candidacy?    [Siemiatkowski] After yesterday's conversation with  Aleksander Kwasniewski, Mr. Rosati upholds his willingness to be  a candidate for the post. He made a decision to be completely  at the SLD's disposal, and also at that of the entire coalition  and the prime minister himself. We respect Mr. Rosati very much  for his behavior because we can appreciate the very difficult  situation he is in. Anyone else in his shoes, when faced with  such attacks and accusations by the president and his closest  aides, would perhaps withdraw. But still, Mr. Rosati decided  that, because he is supported by concerted action by the entire  Cabinet, the prime minister, the coalition, and Aleksander  Kwasniewski, it would be inappropriate if he were to withdraw at  this stage of the negotiations.    [Woyciechowski] Do you think it is still politically  possible at this point for Rosati to be appointed deputy prime  minister, after everything that has been said about him?    [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and gentlemen, both the SLD and the  prime minister decided to make efforts to convene a meeting with  the president himself. It is our view that, during such a  direct meeting and conversation, when we will present once again  all of the arguments in favor of Mr. Rosati's candidacy and in  favor of the need to end this situation of temporariness that  exists in the Finance Ministry, we think that, during the  meeting, President Walesa will perhaps hear us out and change  his mind because it is our view that the opposition should not  be ambition driven, on both the part of the president and the  coalition. What should prevail is thinking along substantive  lines, and, in that regard, we think and are convinced that Mr.  Rosati fulfills all of the criteria that should be met by the  best candidate for finance minister. It is our view that he is  the best candidate for finance minister right now. Poland cannot  afford to once again see such talent and such a professional go  to waste.    [Woyciechowski] You mentioned the Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski  summit meeting. When will it take place? Will it be before  Easter?    [Siemiatkowski] I mean, it is the president who has the  initiative in that regard. For our part, we have submitted--and  that was something agreed upon by the coalition--that the prime  minister play the role of an intermediary in these talks. The  prime minister has such powers; it would be hard to expect  Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is just a faction chief and has not  been authorized to [words indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does that mean that the prime  minister has addressed the president and asked for such a  meeting and is now awaiting a reply?    [Siemiatkowski] According to information we received  yesterday, the prime minister has indeed asked that a date for  the meeting be set.    [Woyciechowski] Could the meeting take place today,  tomorrow, or over the next few days?    [Siemiatkowski] Of course, it is up to the person who makes  the invitations to the talks--that is to say, President Walesa.    [Woyciechowski] So you, gentlemen, are simply waiting for  [words indistinct]....    [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Yes, we are waiting. Right  now, the situation is somewhat impractical because Mr.  Aleksander Kwasniewski could not [hesitating] wait yesterday,  and today, a Sejm delegation with Speaker Oleksy is coming from  Moscow.    [Woyciechowski] Today he is meeting Yeltsin.    [Siemiatkowski] Yesterday, he [Kwasniewski] met the Russian  prime minister, and a meeting with Russian President Yeltsin has  been announced for tomorrow....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then we will have Easter, so  the meeting will probably take place after that.    [Siemiatkowski] He is coming back on Friday [1 April]--we  will regard Saturday as a holiday--so, realistically speaking,  one can expect such a meeting at the beginning of next week.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, can the president dissolve  parliament? He did mention such a possibility yesterday.    [Siemiatkowski] He certainly can dissolve it if three  conditions, which are very precisely defined by the Small  Constitution, are met. The president has already once taken  advantage of such a possibility....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, what are these  conditions? Can you tell us about them? Is it the budget....    [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] It is the budget....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, this is no longer  possible....    [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] No, it is no longer possible  because the Sejm has managed to do this within three months;  right now the [word indistinct] is in the hands of the  president....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The second possibility?    [Siemiatkowski] The second possibility is when the Sejm  cannot form the government. However, the government has already  been formed. Finally, the third possibility appears if a  nonconstructive no-confidence vote is submitted, for this  reason....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If it is submitted and passed,  that is?    [Siemiatkowski] Certainly, if it is passed.    [Woyciechowski] Now, such a veto cannot really be passed in  today's Sejm. It is hard to imagine....    [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Of course. If we considered  something like that at all, it would be a constructive  no-confidence vote. This Sejm has drawn conclusions from the  experiences of its predecessor....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And it does not want to allow  itself to be dissolved?    [Siemiatkowski] It is not that it does not want that.  Simply, it would not serve Poland at the moment if we entered a  new stage of the campaign. Incidentally, we believe that what  the president is doing today is the beginning of the  presidential campaign, a year and a half before the actual vote.    [Woyciechowski] I will ask my question once again: Can the  president dissolve today's Sejm?    [Siemiatkowski] I believe that this is unrealistic and  impossible, with the majority and the strong will of political  action in the Sejm.    [Woyciechowski] Is then another situation possible, which is  for the time being only tentatively mentioned by the  commentators of some dailies, that the SLD might leave the  coalition? Do you take such a possibility into consideration?    [Siemiatkowski] Well, we defined this very precisely in the  coalition agreement. For the SLD, the condition that must be  met is the positive influence on the economic processes going on  in our country. We can exert this positive influence on those  processes by participating in the Cabinet and being in control  of the economic ministries--that is, having our own finance  minister, ownership transformations minister, chairman of the  Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers [KERM]. In  another case, the SLD could not see the possibility of  functioning in any other governments because we realize that, in  such a situation, our role would be merely a decorative one.    [Woyciechowski] However, if you were to boil this all down  to just a few simple words, if the SLD could not appoint its own  finance minister, we would deal with a situation that the SLD  would leave the coalition.    [Siemiatkowski] We would find it hard to justify our further  participation in the cabinet of any coalition if we lost real  influence on the economic processes. We can even say more: We  can proudly say that, under the SLD leadership in those economic  ministries, economic processes are going on exceedingly  positively. It is worth recalling that, in the first quarter of  the year, the inflation index is at the 5-percent level. In  both January and February, we recorded increases in the GDP on  the level of over 4 percent. At the same time, the state's  revenues are bigger than expected in the Budget Law.    [Woyciechowski] All of this was achieved without a finance  minister. Maybe, then, we do not need a finance minister?    [Siemiatkowski] I would certainly not draw such far-reaching  conclusions. Of course, this was made possible by the fact that  the budget was prepared as it was, by the budget-related laws  passed by the Sejm. It was also made possible by the economic  team, which was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and  people who stayed in the leadership of the Finance Ministry and  KERM after Mr. Borowski resigned. Finally, these achievements  result from the efforts made by the entire Cabinet of Mr.  Waldemar Pawlak and Prime Minister Pawlak himself, as well as  all of the ministers responsible for the economy--the industry  minister, the foreign economic cooperation minister, and the  ownership transformations minister. It is all the result of the  work of the entire Cabinet.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, what will happen if President  Walesa does not sign the budget? What will be the  constitutional fate of this budget?    [Siemiatkowski] It will, of course, return to the Sejm, and  I believe that the Sejm is able and efficient enough to override  the president's veto by a two-thirds majority vote. I would....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, the coalition does  not have such a majority in the Sejm today?    [Siemiatkowski] Well, yes it does. This can be very  precisely calculated. Even the four people who are no longer  members of the SLD club announced when the budget was being read  for the second time that, if the president vetoed the bill, they  would vote for rejecting this veto. So, even in such a  situation....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that you would have  to be backed by someone from the parties that does not belong to  the coalition, such as the Union of Labor or the Democratic  Union? The coalition would still need a few votes, would it not?    [Siemiatkowski] Well, it would not. Exactly  two-thirds....[pauses] I do not have the data now, but it has  been calculated that the coalition is able to achieve this  threshold of two-thirds of the votes. I believe that, in such  an extreme situation, we would be backed by many votes from  noncoalition parties, which would help us override the  president's veto. However, I would rather be inclined to agree  with the commentators who, commenting on yesterday's statements  by President Walesa, write in today's press that the president  will not decide to veto the Budget Law. He would be in a very  difficult situation. He must take into account international  opinion....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You believe, then, that,  despite all that, the president will sign the budget?    [Siemiatkowski] Yes, I do, because this is a  development-oriented budget. It continues the positive trends in  our economy that became visible toward the end of last year.  This budget was favorably received by international economic  circles. I believe that quite significant was the decision by  the London Club, which annulled a substantial part of the Polish  debt. If there had not been such a budget, if it had not  contained such prodevelopment and growth-oriented indicators,  the club's decision would have been different. The president,  who has so far been regarded practically everywhere as a  supporter of reforms and a man who sees to it very rigorously  that economic reforms in Poland are continued, would have to  negate the activities that he has pursued so far. I believe  that the economists the president wants to ask for advice should  tell the president very clearly all the political and economic  costs that Poland, and the president himself, will incur if he  decides to oppose the trends outlined in this budget.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, I am sure you have heard this  rumor, which everyone has heard, that Aleksander Kwasniewski  might be appointed deputy prime minister.    [Siemiatkowski] For today--I will use the expression of  President Walesa--our candidate for the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister is Mr. Dariusz Rosati.    [Woyciechowski] How about tomorrow?    [Siemiatkowski] This will definitely call for a new  discussion in the coalition.    [Woyciechowski] Is the candidacy of Paga at all possible?    [Siemiatkowski] It would be rather awkward if we accepted  candidacies proposed to us from outside.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.</p>

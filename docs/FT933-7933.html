			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / British Gas may be broken up by UK government BRITISH GAS, one of Europe's largest energy companies, would be forced to sell its trading activities and see the eventual abolition of its monopoly over household supply if the UK government adopts recommendations made yesterday by the country's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The report proposed a nine-year timetable for the introduction of competition into the entire UK gas market. The proposals were much more far-reaching than had been expected in the gas industry. If accepted by the government, they would lead to the largest corporate break-up ever seen in the UK, and bring about a complete transformation of gas transportation and supply. British Gas, which was privatised by the UK government in 1986, had turnover approaching Pounds 10.3bn (Dollars 15bn) in 1992, of which Pounds 8.1bn arose from UK gas supply. The introduction of full competition into household gas supply would go further than any other country, including the US, in freeing up the market for domestic customers. British Gas said the proposals would result in the loss of at least 20,000 jobs at the company and keep its profits below the levels achieved in recent years. But the company's shares rose 4p to 328p on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said the report's recommendations should allow the company to plan ahead with greater certainty. However, he said it would place British Gas under financial strain, forcing a stringent review of its entire investment programme. The monopoly authority sug-gested a phased introduction of more competition into the gas market with a partial opening up on March 31 1997. The company's trading arm would have to be sold off by then to remove any conflicts of interest between its marketing activities and its operation of the pipelines network. A complex pricing formula which governs the charges British Gas can levy on households should also be eased slightly, the commission suggested. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will have to decide whether to enshrine the commission's recommendations into law. The government could shy away from changes which could lead to higher prices for domestic customers. Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer affairs minister, said the government had not reached a view on the commission's findings. The government may want to push ahead with the introduction of competition more quickly. Ofgas, the industry regulator, said it believed the commission had been 'overly cautious' in its proposals for freeing up the market. Ofgas and many of British Gas's rivals which supply industrial customers would like to see the gas market freed up at the same time as electricity supply, scheduled for 1998. The monopolies inquiry was called a year ago after a series of rows between British Gas and its regulator. Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, wanted the Commission to set a rate of return that British Gas should be allowed to earn from its pipeline operations. Mr Brown, however, requested a full review of the company's activities. British Gas was last subject to a Monopolies Commission investigation in 1988 because competition in the industrial supply market had been slow to develop since privatisation. The inquiry concluded that this resulted from lack of access to gas supplies and recommended that British Gas buy no more than 90 per cent of gas from new North Sea fields. British Gas yesterday said the government should consider setting up a body to regulate Britain's regulators after the Monopolies Commission rejected a request by it and other companies for an examination of the overall system of regulation.</p>

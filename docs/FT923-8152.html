			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: UN cannot respond to crisis in Somalia if it is starved of funds Sir, There are many good proposals in the article by Julian Ozanne (Personal View: 'Hard lessons of Somalia's suffering', August 10) and one can only hope that it will be carefully read by those in a position to help. There are, however, two weaknesses in his proposals. In the first place, while he blames the United Nations - which in his view 'has failed to respond adequately to the crisis' - he himself later on points to a major reason for this, ie lack of resources. When talking of the need for a 'massive and costly airlift' he says that 'so far the funding for it has not been pledged'. There's the rub. Major industrial countries have for a long time systematically marginalised the UN for any economic and social activities. The US in particular is not even paying its current contribution for the UN's normal work, let alone such costly new challenges. In the second place, he gives sound advice for governments to be selective in donations of food and to avoid high-value commodities, such as rice and vegetable oil, which often attract violence and looting. The trouble is that even the low-cost food which he wants sent  - ie wheat, maize and sorghum - also invites violence and looting in the desperate situation where everything is scarce and any kind of food becomes a weapon of war. The only alternative would be to saturate the country with the simple foods so that it is not worth fighting about any more. But this raises the question of resources for such saturation and does not deal with the problem of looting the food to starve your enemy. Mr Ozanne says, addressing Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, one of the warlords, that 'this type of obstruction must stop'. Does Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed read the FT?

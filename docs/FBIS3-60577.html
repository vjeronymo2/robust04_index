So far,  the number of cases has reached 105, which is about one-seventh  of the total number of registered syphilis cases in the country.  Of these, 78 persons attending the outpatients department for  skin and venereal diseases are residents from the town of Ruse.    The figures show that 52 of the patients are unemployed,  while 11 are women who are suspected of practicing the world's  oldest profession. The patients vary in age from 11 to 80  years. Despite the fact that a regional office for combating  venereal diseases was set up at the end of October with the help  of the local administration, specialist doctors, and police  officers, the problem continues to arouse worry and evidently  requires a different approach.</p>

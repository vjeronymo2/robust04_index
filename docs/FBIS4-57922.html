			<p>BFN     [Text] Asuncion ROMPRES, 20/5/1994 -- The documents that  are going to be signed during this visit "will become the first  instruments proving a friendship just being born," said  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy at a ceremony at the  Lopez Palace wherein the Romanian prime minister was awarded the  national order of merit ranked as "Great Cross Extraordinary."    Another ceremony took place at the Asuncion mayorship  wherein  the Romanian premier was declared "illustrious guest" and was  given the key to the city.    The string of protocolar meetings included Premier  Vacaroiu's  attending a solemn session of the National Congress, the  Paraguayan Parliament.    The fact obviously came to the fore from these protocolar  ceremonies that Premier Vacaroiu's current visit, the first at  such a level made by a delegation from Central and Eastern  Europe, represented an opportunity for the development of  bilateral relations.    Referring to the meeting between President Wasmosy and  Premier Vacaroiu, the secretary-general of the Romanian  Government, Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is accompanying the Romanian  prime minister, said "the talks have proved the usefulness of  the Romanian delegation's visit in assisting the Romanian  businesses to penetrate these markets.    Prime Minister Vacaroiu delivered to the Uruguayan President  Wasmosy an invitation to visit Romania on behalf of the Romanian  president.    The meeting focussed on economic matters, opportunities of  cooperation in various domains, especially power engineering and  transport. Also, considering the very big Paraguayan deposits  of phosphates and methane and the cotton resources, cooperation  will be possible in chemistry, fertilizers, urea and ammonia,  cement, light industry and furniture.    The same forms of cooperation were referred to also during  the talks of the Romanian ministers of industries and trade with  their Paraguayan counterparts, who also analyzed the possibility  of new multilateral actions. Paraguay may become for Romania a  turntable to the countries in the region. It is a member of the  Mercosur [Common Market of the South], an economic space  counting over 200 million consumers. In this context, the  opening is planned for next year of a Romanian trade office in  Asuncion.</p>

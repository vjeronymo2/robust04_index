			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKIES TOP U.S. AVERAGE IN INCOME GROWTH;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE FIGURES REFLECT STRENGTH IN MANUFACTURING AND MINING, AND A  SLOWDOWN IN DEFENSE INDUSTRIES IN NEW ENGLAND.  </P> <P> Personal income growth in the Rocky Mountain region topped the national average  for the first time in six years in the third quarter of 1989, while it slowed  in New England, the Commerce Department reported.  </P> <P> The department also said the Plains states registered the fastest growth rate,  9.2%, followed by a 9.1% advance in the Far West.  </P> <P> The department said Rocky Mountain income in the July-September quarter grew  8.7% over the same period of 1988, compared to a national growth rate of 8.5%.  </P> <P> It was the first time the Rockies registered above the national average since  1983 and reflected increasing strength in manufacturing and mining, the  department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the department said income growth in New England declined  during the third quarter to an 8.2% rate from an 8.6% rate in the second  quarter and 9.6% in the first.  </P> <P> The deceleration was blamed on slowdowns in the growth of construction and  service payrolls.  </P> <P> Joining New England with growth rates below the national average were the  Mid-Atlantic region, up 8.4%; the Southeast, up 8.3%; the Southwest, up 8.2%,  and the Great Lakes, up 8.1%.  </P> <P> And, because of the effects of Hurricane Hugo last September, South Carolina  posted the first decline in any state's non-farm personal income growth since  Nebraska and North and South Dakota recorded negatives in the fourth quarter of  1988 at the end of that year's drought.  </P> <P> Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina the hardest, also affected income  growth in neighboring states because of extensive damage to rental properties.  Excluding the effects of the storm's damage, personal income would have  increased 9.4% in South Carolina and 8.9% in the Southeast region.  </P> <P> Rudolph E. DePass, an economist for the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said  automation has replaced much of the antiquated durable manufacturing and mining  infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain region, making those industries more  efficient and competitive.  </P> <P> But, he said, New England, which in recent years had built up defense-related  high-tech industries, has been hit by the slowdown in defense spending. In  addition, he said, there is a shortage of skilled workers in the region because  of high-priced housing.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, DePass said New England still has a relatively high growth rate  compared to other regions.  </P> <P> The Plains income growth was attributed to rebounding farm income after the  drought and to strong durable and non-durable manufacturing. In the Far West,  the report said, growth reflected strength in manufacturing, service industries  and construction.  </P> <P> On the other hand, in both the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions, weakness  in durable and non-durable manufacturing dampened growth. Weakness in motor  vehicle production in Michigan particularly affected the Great Lakes region,  the report said.  </P> <P> The Southwest suffered slow growth in payrolls of most major industries, with  advances in service industries slower than in any other region.  </P> <P> States with the fastest growth in personal income were: North Dakota, 16.9%;  Alaska, 15.3%; South Dakota, 13.4%; Nevada, 13.3%; Washington State and Hawaii,  11.1% each; Utah, 10.6%, and Minnesota, Florida and Iowa, 10.3% each.  </P> <P> States with the slowest growth, in addition to South Carolina, were: Wyoming,  5.4%; West Virginia, 6%; Oklahoma, 6.8%; Arkansas, 6.9%; Michigan, 7.2%;  Louisiana, 7.3%; Nebraska, 7.4%; Kansas, 7.5%, and Ohio, 7.6%.  </P> <P> PERSONAL INCOME GROWTH BY STATE  </P> <P> Percent increase from third quarter, 1988, to third quarter, 1989 *  </P> <P> HIGHEST  </P> <P> 1.

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / SMMT names Ford man as chief THE SOCIETY of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will shortly announce that Mr Ernie Thompson, sales director of Ford of Britain, is to become its chief executive, Kevin Done writes. The appointment follows an eight-month search for a successor to Sir Hal Miller, the former Conservative MP who left the society in March after only 16 months as chief executive. Mr Thompson has spent all his business career at Ford. His appointment will mark a sharp change of direction by the society after the controversial appointment of Sir Hal, which had been designed to give the industry a more powerful political presence and to improve its Whitehall lobbying. Sir Hal had been joint chairman of the House of Commons all-party motor industry group.</p>

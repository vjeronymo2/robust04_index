			<p>CSO     [Text] Effective 1 July, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MOPT] will increase to 300 the number of  post offices handling foreign exchange conversions, an increase  of 40. The change represents one phase of the MOPT's  globalization strategy and its aim is to boost customer services  in competition with privately operated banks. The post offices  providing the new services will convert currencies between the  Japanese yen and seven other currencies, including U.S. dollar,  French franc, and British pound; they are also scheduled to sell  and cash travelers' checks in eight currencies, including the  yen.    Based on a 12-region breakdown of the country, post offices  newly designated to provide the money-conversion services  include 10 each for Kanto and Tokyo, seven for Kinki, and six  for Tokai, mostly in urban areas. Others included one each for  Hokkaido, Tohoku, Shinetsu, Hokuriku, Chugoku, Shikoku, and  Kyushu, and none for Okinawa. Sources at the International  Operations Section of the Postal Savings Bureau explain, "These  figures reflect the selection of post offices on the basis of  the number of people who travel overseas, demand for currency  conversion, and regional balance."    According to the MOPT, the majority of individuals who need  to convert foreign currencies or to buy or cash travelers'  checks are about 20 years old, but few of them have an occasion  to use a post office. The goal for the increase in the number of  post offices handling foreign exchange services is to boost the  patronage of post offices by individuals in that age category.  Privately operated banks doubled the number of bank branches  offering such services on a nationwide basis to about 8,500 in  the four-year period ending in 1992 and the MOPT decided to  increase the number of post offices handling the services from a  total of 100 three years ago.    The MOPT not only plans to increase the number of post  offices offering foreign exchange conversion services, but to  expand its international remittance services.</p>

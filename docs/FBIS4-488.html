			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- The arrival of  additional high-ranking observers from more than 30 member  countries makes the Commonwealth Observer Group to South Africa  (COGSA) the largest election observer group yet assembled by the  Commonwealth.    COGSA will be headed by former Jamaican Prime Minister  Michael Manley and will include political figures,  parliamentarians and election experts.    The group's deputy chairman, former New Zealand Governor  General Sir Paul Reeves, told reporters in Johannesburg on  Monday COGSA would concentrate its efforts on the Natal and PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions -- the two ?reas  most likely to be problematic during the election.    Sir Paul said COGSA's main task would be to submit a report  on whether or not the election was free and fair. A core group  of 60 additional observers would join Commonwealth personnel  already on the ground, including members of the Commonwealth  Observer Mission to South Africa.    According to a statement issued at Monday's informal news  briefing, COGSA would "observe all relevant aspects of the  organisation and conduct of the elections in accordance with the  law".    The group would act "impartially and independently" to form  "an independent judgement as to whether conditions exist for a  free expression of will by the electors and if the result of the  election reflects the wishes of the people".    A preliminary COGSA report would be submitted before the  announcement of the election results whereafter a final report  on its findings would be submitted to Commonwealth Secretary  General Chief Emeka Anyaoku. The final report would be  forwarded to the South African Government, political parties and  commonwealth heads of governments.</p>

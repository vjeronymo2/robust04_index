			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- In the wake of the Lake  Qiandao disaster, Mainland China has agreed to a Taiwan request  to hold talks on the protection of Taiwan tourists, investors  and their property on the mainland as soon as possible,  according to vice chairman and secretary-general Chiao Jen-ho of  the Straits Exchange Foundation.    Twenty-four Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and  crew members were found dead in a lower deck cabin of a tour  boat on Lake Qiandao in the coastal Province of Zhejiang on  March 31. The incident prompted waves of protest in Taiwan  because of Beijing's obstruction into investigation of the  matter by relatives of the victims and Taiwan reporters.    Tang Shubei, Standing Vice Chairman of the mainland's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and  SEF Deputy Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping reached the decision  in a meeting Tuesday [12 April] in Beijing.    The SEF and ARATS are authorized by Taipei and Beijing to  handle cross-strait exchanges.    Tang also agreed that Beijing would more thoroughly  investigate the incident. The mainland had earlier claimed the  disaster was accidental, but later said sabotage was possible.    Tang expressed the hope that both sides would take necessary  measures to minimize the negative impact on cross-strait  exchanges brought about by the incident. Taipei on Tuesday  announced the suspension of cultural and trade exchanges with  the mainland over the tragedy. Many tour agents also announced  a boycott of mainland trips.    He said after the meeting that Beijing was concerned about  how the investigation into the matter was being handled, and has  instructed relevant agencies, including the Taiwan Affairs  Council and Zhejiang Province authorities, to probe more deeply  into the case.</p>

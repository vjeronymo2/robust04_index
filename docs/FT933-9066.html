			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Funds 'at risk' in opt-out schools PUBLIC MONEY is at risk in grant-maintained schools because of inadequate audit arrangements, the Audit Commission says in its annual report today. The claim by the local-government spending watchdog sparked a row yesterday when it was denied by the government, and Labour called for the Commons public accounts committee to investigate the allegation. In England and Wales, grant-maintained schools - which opt out of local authority control - are allowed to appoint their own external auditors. Sir David Cooksey, commission chairman, described this arrangement as 'unprecedented in the public sector'. Although it is accepted practice for companies to appoint their own auditors, Sir David said extra 'checks and balances' were necessary in the public sector because boards of governors were not answerable to shareholders. He said: 'Large sums of money are being given to those who have little experience of handling public finance. In some cases funds may be misused or even misappropriated. 'The rights of the public to challenge things which are going wrong and have auditors to issue public-interest reports have been withdrawn.' He said external auditors should be appointed independently, and audits should include value-for-money reports. Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, responded: 'The audit arrangements of grant-maintained schools are entirely appropriate and proper.' He said opted-out schools had annual external audits, while the Funding Agency for Schools, the government body created by this year's Education Act, would be able to commission value-for-money studies from the Audit Commission. The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, also has to report to parliament on the schools, he said. Mr Forth suggested that the commission was looking to create more work for itself. He said: 'There appears to be a certain amount of 'vested interest' here. The Audit Commission is, perhaps understandably, disappointed that its bid for a monopoly role in (grant-maintained) schools was rejected by parliament during consideration of the recent education bill.' Sir David denied that the commission wanted a monopoly role. He said his concern was that auditors for schools should be externally appointed. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that the schools should have been made answerable to statutory audit procedures. GCSEs, introduced to replace O-levels and CSEs in England and Wales in 1988, have been 'on the whole, fair and successful', the Schools Examination and Assessment Council said yesterday. It said in a report that implementation of the qualifications had improved during the past five years. But it queried whether all the examining bodies were applying the same standards.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: BHP seeks approval for takeover of NZ Steel BHP, Australia's largest company, is seeking statutory approval to mount a full takeover of New Zealand Steel, from authorities in both countries. NZ Steel is a world leader in advanced technology to convert iron to steel. A previous bid by BHP met with opposition in both countries on monopoly grounds. BHP is the only significant steel producer in Australasia. This is the latest twist in a lengthy battle for control of the plant, which was expanded by the National government in the early 1980s as part of a 'think big' strategy to make New Zealand industrially independent and create jobs. One of the Labour government's first acts in 1985 was to announce it was selling its controlling shareholding. It had to write off NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 822m) before selling the Glenbrok mill to Equiticorp for NZDollars 327m in 1987. NZ Steel was then sold to a joint venture between BHP and various New Zealand-based interests for NZDollars 323m, against opposition from Fletcher Challenge. To secure control of NZ Steel, BHP is again seeking approval from the Australian Trade Practices Commission which opposed BHP gaining a shareholding in 1989 on the grounds that NZ Steel was one of BHP's few competitors in the Australian market. It took court action to secure a compromise with BHP who undertook not to inhibit NZ Steel from marketing steel products in Australia and to seek approval before seeking to increase its shareholding. The New Zealand Commerce Commission approved the takeover. The commission said that BHP effectively controlled New Zealand Steel through a joint venture with Steel and Tube, a New Zealand-based metals concern which was part of the consortium making the bid, and which in turn was controlled by another BHP subsidiary Tubemakers of Australia. The other members of the consortium are Fisher and Paykel and the ANZ Banking Group. Mr Scott Kerr, managing director of BHP Trading in New Zealand, said that NZ Steel needed an injection of capital which the other shareholders were not in a position to contribute. BHP wanted to finance capital spending at the mill, he said. This would lead to economies within the company with opportunities to rationalise exporting and freight costs, he added.</p>

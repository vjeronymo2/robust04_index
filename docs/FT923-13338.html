			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Iraq spurns UN oil trade terms THE Iraqi leadership has decided to turn down the latest United Nations terms for the resumption of limited export sales of its oil, the influential energy newsletter Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. MEES said the decision was reached after several meetings in Baghdad between Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, and Iraq's negotiators headed by Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari. Iraq's main objection was to the UN's insistence that oil exports should be channelled through Turkey to the Mediterranean terminal of Ceyhan, rather than through Iraq's Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr, MEES said.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Watchdog to probe complaints against taxman AN INDEPENDENT adjudicator is to be appointed to consider complaints about tax officials who are rude, slow or make mistakes. The move is part of a new package of Citizen's Charter proposals unveiled after a Downing Street seminar chaired by Mr John Major yesterday morning. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said an adjudicator, to be appointed by May, will have a remit to scrutinise complaints about how the Revenue handles individuals' tax affairs, but will not trespass on areas covered by existing rights of appeal. The Revenue received 15,000 complaints last year, of which 100 were referred to the government's ombudsman. Yesterday it said it expected the adjudicator to handle 20 to 50 complaints a month. Mr Dorrell said the adjudicator would be 'a person of standing' from outside the Revenue, and described the new procedure as a readily available 'safety valve'. Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue board, said the appointment of the adjudicator would give taxpayers the assurance of an impartial review and give tax officials greater protection against unfair complaints. The Revenue expects that most complaints will still be dealt with locally but says that the new arrangements, which will apply to tax matters arising after the beginning of April, will help to improve its standards of service. The adjudicator's work will also cover the Valuation Office, and he or she will publish a report annually to the Inland Revenue board, which will be intended to draw general lessons for the service as well as redressing individual grievances. At the same time, the Revenue published three codes of conduct based on existing practice, covering investigations, inspection of employers' PAYE records, and dealing with its own mistakes. The third six-monthly Downing Street seminar, intended to ensure that the impetus behind the Citizen's Charter is not lost, also yielded a trickle of other moves forward. Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said publication of comparative information would be extended into areas such as hospitals and further-education institutions. Other initiatives for the seminar include a promise of a charter for the new Child Support Agency; the introduction of a lay element into the police inspectorate; and a commitment that charter standards would be included in the contracts for holders of rail franchises under privatisation plans.</p>

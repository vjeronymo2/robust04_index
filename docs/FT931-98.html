			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney considers plan to ease debt burden EURO DISNEY, the leisure group that has incurred heavy losses since opening the EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April, plans to try to alleviate its difficulties by restructuring its finances. Mr Robert Forsgren, finance director, said the group was 'doing a lot of thinking and considering a number of different options' to reduce the cost of servicing its FFr18bn (Dollars 3.2bn) net debt. Euro Disney, which on Monday announced it had attracted 10m visitors to EuroDisneyland since the opening, pays fixed interest rates on FFr8.5bn of its debt and floating rates on the remaining FFr9.5bn. Interest payments have been significantly higher than the group forecast because of the unexpectedly high level of French interest rates. Bank base rates in France are now 10 per cent, with inflation running at an annualised rate of just over 2 per cent. Mr Forsgren said Euro Disney was making additional interest payments of FFr200m a year. Although French interest rates are expected to fall, Mr Forsgren said the group was still keen to renegotiate the terms of its debt repayments. Euro Disney, which made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m in its last full financial year to September 30 and lost FFr492m in the first quarter of the current year, has confirmed that it will stay in the red for the full financial year. Mr Forsgren said the company expected to reduce its losses next year, but that he 'could not predict' the outcome thereafter. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects Euro Disney to produce a loss of FFr650m in the second quarter of this year and a profit of FFr375m in the second half, reducing its projected loss for the full financial year to FFr769m.</p>

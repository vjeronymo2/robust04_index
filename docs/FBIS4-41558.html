			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that  his country's military doctrine is directed at no country.  However, the country has its own national interest and an  efficient army must defend them, General Grachev said.    He was speaking at Tula, a city southward of Moscow.  Addressing cadets of the Military Artillery School, General  Grachev said that Russia's Armed Forces would be reduced from 3  million to 1.5 million men, but the forces would be more mobile  and strong.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The North-Western Christian Democrats have decided  not to contest the election because of intimidation of  prospective candidates. The party had been granted an extension  until eight this morning to submit its adjusted list of  candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] but  failed to do so.    The chairman of the party, Mr. Sampie Styger, said he'd  received a telephone call from the party leader, Dr. Lucas  Mangope, informing that it was not possible to draw up the list  of candidates as people were afraid to stand because of  intimidation. A spokesman for the IEC said the commission was  still awaiting official communication from the party. Until  then their initial registration would stand. If advised of the  intimidation the IEC would ask their monitors to investigate and  report to the commission.</p>

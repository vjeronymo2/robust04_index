			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Beware: unexploded bombs - Consultant's viewpoint: In forecasting, clever-looking spreadsheets often present an air of correctness that would never apply to a simple column of figures. The risks involved LOTUS 1-2-3 macros 'are like unexploded bombs all over British industry' says a computer expert at one of the companies that the FT has visited for Software At Work. How true is this view? Frighteningly true. Modern spreadsheets have an incredibly rich programming language called the macro. Under Microsoft Excel, a macro can erase all the files on a hard disk, reformat it and then crash the system. Yet, almost no companies have any control over the programming that goes on across the organisation. There are two sorts of risks in using spreadsheet macros: Firstly, the results they produce may be wrong. Secondly, the macros quickly become impenetrable to anyone except the original author. Spreadsheets are often used by financial staff such as accountants who are trained to look critically at the way that numbers are presented and analysed. Sadly, they rarely apply the same criteria to their own creations. It is rare to see a spreadsheet that has full cross-checking of the figures used. For example, in a table of figures, the rows and columns should be totalled separately and the results compared. This maximises the chances of detecting simple errors that often occur, (see table, above right). In addition, the way that spreadsheets operate makes it easy for an error to percolate throughout an entire calculation; and a small error may produce a very large effect. Spreadsheets often give an air of correctness that would never apply to a simple column of figures. The workings are all hidden beneath the surface. Much as with opinion polls, opinion rapidly becomes presented as fact, once glossed with the spreadsheet mystique. The classic example occurs in forecasting for which spreadsheets are often used. The sales team sit with their trusty 1-2-3 system and try to estimate the sales for the next 12 months. They put their 'gut feel' figures into the sheet and look at the effect. Often, a figure is used and then assumed to grow at a given rate (say, by 10 per cent a month). If the spreadsheet shows that the company will make a profit at this level, the more cautious forecaster will try other figures (say nine per cent or, perhaps, 11 per cent). It is rarely questioned whether the sales will really grow in this fashion - and, in fact, they very rarely do. The sales director then presents the plan to the board showing how sales 'will' follow this pattern. Only the bolder managing director will question how the original figures were derived, or how the growth rates were calculated. The key issue, therefore, is 'the margin of error.' If the original margin of error was plus or minus five per cent and the monthly growth rate was plus or minus five per cent, then the figure in 12 months' time may be as much as 80 per cent wrong. Errors in forecasting are like compound interest. And experience indicates that these errors are rarely on the favourable side. The other danger lies in the creation of sheets which are complex mathematical models by people with no programming discipline. They tend to ignore structure and commenting and rarely have any idea of the design. Spreadsheets tend to grow organically, with new bits being tacked on as required. The result is a mess, even if it is a mess that appears to work. However, no company remains static for long and the model will require updating. This may be difficult or even impossible, if the original writer has moved on. The solutions to these problems are not simple. It is unrealistic to expect staff to leave all macro-writing to gurus in information technology. The best solution is to train relevant employees in the correct use of programming methods in macro-writing. This can be summed up in two words: 'comments' and 'design.' If staff can only manage one, they should aim for comments. It is easier to understand a badly designed sheet that has copious comments explaining each stage, than a well-designed macro where there is no trace of the rationale behind the design. As a minimum, insist that columns and rows should self-check wherever possible. Above all, ask for the margin of error in any forecasts. Companies should develop (or buy) guidelines for macro-writing which spell out the essentials of good practice. These should be distributed as part of the training and regularly reviewed and modified in the light of experience. They must also be enforced by periodic reviews of macros in use. A peer level review is usually sufficient and can be a valuable team-building exercise in itself. Where macros exist that are important but too dangerous to touch, get a professional in to deal with them. This will usually involve examining the sheet and documenting what it does - and how. It can then be re-written in a correct style and proper provision can be made for future growth. Spreadsheets can be an excellent tool and a valuable business aid if properly used. They need to be recognised as programming tools and subject to the same development criteria. Managers must remember that the results are no better that the original data and to query the assumptions that underly any forecast. Perhaps Mark Twain's famous saying about lies and statistics in 1924 could now be updated . . . 'There are three kinds of lies - lies, damned lies . . . and spreadsheets.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     DETECTING SIMPLE ERRORS IN SPREADSHEET DATA (LOTUS 1-2-3 FORMAT)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A              B       C       D             E 1.

Simply by cross-checking the row totals with the column totals, the error can be identified. It is relatively simple to add a cell with a line like the following: IF (E7=E8, E7, @ERR). This will display the total if the two values match, otherwise it will display an error.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

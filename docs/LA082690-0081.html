			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> A PENETRATING GAZE;  </P> <P> VISUAL ARTISTS, MANY OF WHOM CONSIDER THEMSELVES OUTSIDERS, FOCUS ON THE GAPS  BETWEEN CULTURES  </P> <P> The "outsider" viewpoints of people who don't feel at home within a dominant  culture are at the heart of the visual arts component of the Los Angeles  Festival.  </P> <P> Some of these artists are looking at each other's Pacific Rim cultures with a  coolly dissecting eye, allowing Eastern and Western ideas and images to invade  one another and raise more questions than they answer.  </P> <P> Other artists are in some sense strangers to their own societies -- because of  cultural roots, sexual orientation or a rejection of the consumer-oriented  practices of the contemporary art world.  </P> <P> At the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach (Friday through Dec. 2),  Chinese artist Wenda Gu will create a site-specificinstallation, "Red, Black,  White, Desert." The work will involve the juxtaposition of raincoats made of  woven palm bark -- the type worn by rural Chinese workers -- with minimalist  abstract canvases painted in alternating fields of red, black and white.  </P> <P> Behind this work lies an idiosyncratic way of viewing the world that, for all  its brash contemporaneity, stems from the tradition of the great  "individualist" artists of the Yuan and early Ch'ing Dynasties -- maverick  artists like Hung-jen and Chu Ta, who retired from the world during tumultuous  periods of Chinese history and cultivated eccentric signature styles. The  difference is that Gu remains very much a part of the world, making art that is  political by implication, if not in overt ways.  </P> <P> Gu, who now lives in New York, was born in Shanghai in 1955. As a child of the  Cultural Revolution, he painted propaganda posters before attending the School  of Arts and Crafts in his native city and studying the traditional arts of  (wooden) seal carving and landscape painting.  </P> <P> An obsessive reader and philosophizer, in the tradition of the literati  painters of Chinese history, Gu became interested in the writings of such  vastly disparate Western philosophers as Friedrich Nietzsche and Ludwig  Wittgenstein and the works of such modern Western artists as Marcel Duchamp,  Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys.  </P> <P> He began to see his work as a way of stirring up the caldron of past and  present -- of combining slogans he saw on the street with ancient poems and  making mutant seals in which the calligraphy was fractured and rearranged.  Slamming together bits and pieces of diverse eras, lifestyles and cultures in  his installations, he finds conflict more fruitful than the aura of tranquility  generally associated with Asian art.  </P> <P> Delighting in paradoxes and riddles, he is a black humorist with a strong  mystic streak. Describing a 1987 performance piece of his involving bloody  gloves, red tubes and a small house structure made of mixed media paintings, Gu  wrote, "The atmosphere was very sexual and painful. Only my desire was  present."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Traversals: Instructions to the Double"  (today through Sept. 30) is a program of nine videotapes assembled by guest  curator Peter Callas. The works in the show are all by Pacific Rim artists who  have visited other cultures and responded not with travelogues but with  open-ended, highly subjective meditations. Unconventional editing and  post-production work emphasizes the rhythms and layers of imagery the artists  perceived in their travels.  </P> <P> In Edin Velez's "Meaning of the Interval" (18 minutes, 1987), the subject is  empty space. Known as ma in Japan, prolonged intervals -- of space or time --  are considered a source of harmonic energy. They exist everywhere: in  buildings, paintings, even on the slow-moving Noh theater stage.  </P> <P> Puerto Rico-born Velez (who now lives in New York) looks at the large and small  manifestations of ma in Japan: from the distance between one subway station and  another to a stark white line that divides in half -- revealed as the space  between the two pillars of a Shinto temple gateway. Using post-production  wizardry to alter the sizes and positions of his imagery, Velez also emphasizes  peculiar juxtapositions of conservative and outre behavior in modern-day Japan.  These are the "spaces" that separate different pockets of life in a  hierarchical and superficially orderly society.  </P> <P> Naoko Kurotsuka's "The Palm" (5 minutes, 1985) was shot at a long-abandoned  temple arch in the ruins of Ayuttheya in Thailand -- a site at once familiar to  a Japanese (because of the countries' shared Buddhist culture) and undeniably  foreign. Static shots focus on details of the natural world that continues to  flourish despite the lack of human presence. To begin and end each shot, the  Japanese artist cupped her hands over the lens, as if helping each image to be  born and to die.  </P> <P> Although Westerners consider ancient, unchanging landscape as the essence of  timelessness, Kurotsuka writes, in the East, timelessness is equivalent to "the  ever-changing state of temporary nature."  </P> <P> Other video artists represented in the show are Geoffrey Weary, Robert Cahen,  Ko Nakajima, Tony Conrad, Steina Vasulka, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto and Callas.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Photography Center, "Golden Pool" (Sept. 4 through Oct. 14)  brings together the photographic work of 12 artists -- some established, some  emerging -- who live in Southern California and explore different aspects of  Asian and Asian-American cultural experience.  </P> <P> Betty Lee blows up stills from Chinese movies of the '20s, '30s and '40s to  "big screen" size and adds statements reflecting her ironic take on the  contemporary status of Chinese-American women. Carol Nye's black-and-white  photographs investigate the ways minority groups in China adapt to the dominant  culture. Other artists in the exhibit include May Sun, Patrick Nagatani and  Alan Cheung.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" at the Wight Art Gallery,  UCLA (Sept. 9 through Dec. 9) is a huge show, the largest ever assembled  specifically on the art of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. (as distinct from  Latino, Hispanic or Latin American art). This emphasis is on the relationship  of the art to el movimiento, the Chicano civil rights movement of the '60s and  '70s, which focused on demands for workers' rights, bilingual education, the  abolition of racist cultural barriers, and the return of land to the  descendants of original land-grant holders.  </P> <P> The more than 130 paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures are the work of  90 artists from across the U.S., chosen by a national advisory committee. It  remains to be seen whether the show -- which unfortunately does not include  performance or installation art -- will make a compelling case for individually  distinctive voices of members of a minority group, or sink under the weight of  curatorship-by-committee.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> David Wojnarowicz's "Tongues of Flame," at the Santa Monica Museum of Art  (through Sept. 5) is an exhibit of the artist's passionate and motley pieces  from the past decade, which all deal in some way with his life as a gay man.  Wojnarowicz -- who suffers from complications of AIDS and who endured a  shockingly brutal and loveless youth -- works from the position of radical  social outcast. By turns darkly fantastic and coldly nihilistic, his imagery of  death, decay, violence, male sexuality and technological malfunction is  virtually guaranteed to raise bourgeois hackles.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Robbie Conal's brand of guerrilla warfare is a kinder, gentler phenomenon,  notable mostly for the dogged persistance with which he plasters thousands of  his political posters throughout the U.S. Organized by the Pasadena Art  Alliance, "Unauthorized History: Robbie Conal's Portraits of Power" at the  Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena (Sept. 8 through Nov. 9), includes his  deliberately unflattering images of such Reagan-Bush era figures as Jim and  Tammy Bakker, John Poindexter, Jesse Helms and Ronald, Nancy and George.  </P></p>

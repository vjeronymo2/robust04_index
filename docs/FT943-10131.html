			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Understanding French funds In 1983 my wife inherited shares in a small French Sicav (offshore fund) whose portfolio comprises international stock and shares. If these were sold would any gain since January 1, 1984 be treated by the Inland Revenue as income under the legislation set-up to deal with roll-up funds? Although the annual income is paid to shareholders and my wife reports this to her tax inspector, there are few, if any, other shareholders and the Sicav managers have almost certainly not sought distributor status. Is there anything my wife can do to mitigate the taxation position? The first step is for your wife to ask the Revenue whether the Sicav has been certified as a distributing fund. If the Sicav managers have not applied for certification, and your wife is consequently assessed to income tax on part of the gain realised upon a sale of part (or all) of her holding, she can serve a notice under paragraph 18(1) of schedule 27 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988: 'Without prejudice to paragraph 17 . . . (see below), in any case where no application has been made under paragraph 15 above in respect of an account period of an offshore fund, any person who is assessed to tax for which he would not be liable if the offshore fund were certified as a distributing fund in respect of that period may by notice in writing require the Board (of Inland Revenue) to take action under this paragraph with a view to determining whether the fund should be so certified.' Paragraph 17 says: 'No appeal may be brought against an assessment to tax on the grounds that an offshore fund should have been certified as a distributing fund in respect of an account period of the fund.' On the other hand, paragraph 19 gives your wife the right to apply to postpone payment of part of the tax assessed (subject to the risk of an ultimate charge to interest if certification is eventually refused), by giving notice to her tax inspector - after giving the notice under paragraph 18(1) but within 30 days of the date of issue of the notice of assessment - specifying the amount of tax which she believes has been overcharged, with a calculation to support that figure, and saying briefly why she believes that the Sicav qualifies for certification in respect of each account period since 1983. Failure to qualify for just one account period carries the same consequences as a complete failure to qualify: MPs decided against making the rules equitable, since the primary purpose of the rules is to raise money for the Treasury. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- [Egyptian] Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa has explained that Serbia was not invited to the  Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] foreign ministers conference in  accordance with an agreement between the Movement's chairman,  Indonesia, and Egypt. He noted that this issue had not been  raised by any member, either during general meetings or at  committee meetings or consultations.    Musa was replying to a question by a MENA correspondent on  why Serbia was not invited. He said: As chairman of the NAM  foreign ministers conference, Egypt is bound by the measures  decided upon in the New York coordination office and during  consultations in Jakarta and agreed upon by NAM members.  According to these measures, Serbia will not attend NAM  meetings unless a matter relating to its own entity is being  discussed, Musa explained. Only in such a case can Serbia be  invited to give its opinion on the matter, he said.    Musa affirmed that there is a consensus on banning Serbia's  and Montenegro's participation in NAM meetings.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / VW and Ford to end joint venture in Latin America Volkswagen and Ford are to break up their partnership in Autolatina, Latin America's biggest carmaker and one of the biggest joint ventures in the world auto industry. The two companies announced yesterday that they had agreed on 'a gradual separation process leading toward dissolution' within a year of the Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and Argentina. The joint venture, which was formed in 1987, is owned 51 per cent by Germany's VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, and 49 per cent by Ford of the US, the world's second-largest vehicle maker. Mr Wayne Booker, executive vice-president for Ford's international automotive operations, said Ford believed that it would 'be better able to compete effectively in these two markets by operating on its own'. In the second half of the 1980s, 'difficult market and economic conditions' had made the co-operation a good strategy, but conditions were now 'significantly different in both countries'. Autolatina Brasil was the country's largest private-sector company last year with sales of Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.4bn) and production of 612,000 vehicles. The separation had been expected for some time. In August, Autolatina Brasil, which has 47,000 workers in Brazil, said it would no longer launch new hybrid models built on shared production platforms, but instead use the world platforms supplied by the parent companies. The decision was partly triggered by pressure from VW car dealers, who were reluctant to turn over the platform for the new model of Brazil's best-selling Gol car to Ford, and by a realisation that consumer brand awareness was suffering. The companies had been concerned that Autolatina's structure was holding back their growth in Brazil's booming car market. Since 1990, Ford's market share has slumped from 18.8 to 12 per cent while VW is down from 37.4 to 33.6 per cent. During the same period Fiat's subsidiary has nearly doubled its market share to 26.2 per cent. Autolatina executives say the dissolution was the result of Brazil's move from a closed economy to an increasingly open one as well as the increased globalisation of the car industry. When the holding company was created in 1987, Brazil's economy was generally closed to international competition and car sales were depressed. Joining forces allowed Ford and VW to pool investment and production costs. But since 1990 the economy has been gradually opened, leading to growing competition from imports, and in the last two years Brazil's car market has boomed thanks to lower prices sparked by falling taxes and higher productivity. Brazilian vehicle production soared from 1.07m vehicles in 1992 to a probable 1.6m this year. Disentangling VW and Ford from Autolatina is likely to be a long and complicated process. In Brazil they jointly operate seven plants, six of which are in the state of Sao Paulo, making engines, transmission systems and other parts. They also operate jointly in areas such as purchasing, administration, finance and legal services.</p>

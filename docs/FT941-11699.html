			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Rise in official reserves prompts sales speculation The UK's official reserves rose by Dollars 521m in January, or by Dollars 205m on an underlying basis. The larger-than-expected increase prompted some speculation in the markets that the Bank of England had been selling pounds in order to counter the strength of sterling. However, intervention on such a small scale would have had little effect on the pound's value, given that much larger sales of foreign currency failed to prevent sterling's devaluation in September 1992. The overall level of reserves at end-January was Dollars 43,447m, or Pounds 28,983m at the January 31 exchange rate. The underlying change excludes factors such as dealings with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, which accounted for Dollars 298m of the rise. The government continued to repay the revolving credit facility it took out to help defend the pound when sterling was in the European exchange rate mechanism. Just under Pounds 1.17bn of the facility was repaid in January.</p>

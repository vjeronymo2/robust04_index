			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Japanese price probe into cosmetics maker JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission has launched an investigation into alleged price-fixing by subsidiaries of Shiseido, a leading cosmetics maker. The anti-monopoly watchdog has been increasing the number of probes under the new administration of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who has been calling for an increase in consumer benefits. The commission's move is expected to accelerate the unravelling of Japan's rigid retail and distribution systems, which have helped maintain high retail prices. FTC investigators raided distribution subsidiaries of Shiseido yesterday, following claims by Kawachiya, a Tokyo-based discount retailer, that the company had refused to sell it cosmetics. Japan's leading cosmetics makers have maintained a tight grip on retail pricing through affiliated wholesalers and retail networks. Although resale price maintenance on cosmetics products was reduced to 24 items last year, retailers continue to sell products at the manufacturers' suggested prices due to the fear of shipment cancellations. The investigation could affect prices of imported cosmetics, which have also been sold at higher prices because of the overall price level of Japan's cosmetics market. The sharp appreciation of the yen is increasing pressure for import brands to be sold at lower prices. The prolonged downturn in the economy has forced a growing number of Japanese consumers to turn to discount retailers. Manufacturers, on the other hand, are growing increasingly wary that excessive discounting could damage their products' image and change consumer perceptions about 'acceptable' retail prices. Shiseido denies trying to prevent Kawachiya from selling its products at a discount price, and alleges the retailer was wholesaling cosmetics rather than selling to retail customers. The FTC is expected to make similar investigations at Kanebo and Kao, cosmetics makers which Kawachiya also claims had cut shipments.</p>

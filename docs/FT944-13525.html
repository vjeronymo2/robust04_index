			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Personal pensions - predictions, incentives, and now a compensation loop? (4) Sir, In the current debate on the sale of personal pensions to members of occupational pension schemes, two important facts seem to be overlooked. First, at the time of the introduction of personal pensions, the government offered apparently significant incentives in the form of rebate of contributions to the state earnings-related scheme (SERPS), to encourage people to make their own personal pension provision. It was this rebate, as I recall, which was a major feature in the selling propositions of personal pensions advisers. Second, the 'better value' offered by many occupational schemes rests largely or solely on the fact that today the majority of companies which run their own such schemes still offer significantly higher remuneration (in the form of employer pension contributions) to employees prepared to join the company scheme than to those who prefer to make their own arrangements. This anachronism can surely not be justified on any objective or rational grounds. A E N Buckley, principal consultant, PA Consulting Group, 6 Highfield Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 3DJ</p>

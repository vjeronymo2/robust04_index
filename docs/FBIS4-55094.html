			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, May 9 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and  eight other Central and Eastern European countries were today  granted associate membership of the Western European Union  (WEU). This allows the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,  Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia access  to the regular twice monthly WEU delegates' meetings in Brussels  and to send soldiers to peace keeping operations, but does not  give them security guarantees or the right of veto.    The Czech Republic was represented at today's ceremony by  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys. At the meeting Zieleniec said he welcomed the fact that  after the NATO summit (at which the Partnership for Peace  project was approved) the WEU had come up with an initiative  that would bring the Czech Republic closer to the process of  building an European defense identity. The Czech Republic felt  the same responsibility for the safety of the continent as the  West did, he added.    He later told journalists that from now on contacts with the  WEU would stop being merely diplomatic and would take on a  working character. The WEU was gradually changing into the  military pillar of Europe, Zieleniec said.    After the ceremony Zieleniec met his French counterpart  Alain  Juppe. They exchanged views on the preparation for the  forthcoming meeting on the proposed stability pact in Paris,  agreeing that it was vitally important that the meeting should  take place and produce positive results for European security.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> CULTURE FESTIVAL TO COMPLEMENT ART EXHIBITION  </P> <P> When the mammoth art exhibition "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" hits  town next fall, it will be accompanied by a host of film, visual and performing  arts events called the Artes de Mexico festival.  </P> <P> The Mexico exhibition, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from Oct. 6 to  Dec. 29, 1991, features 400 works from 1000 BC to 1950 and is being billed as  the most comprehensive survey of Mexican art to be mounted in 50 years. It will  be divided into four periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, 19th Century, and the  first half of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> "What we're looking to do with this exhibition is to create an appreciation and  awareness for all the art of Mexico and its cultural diversity," said Miguel  Angel Corzo, president of the Los Angeles-based Friends of the Arts of Mexico,  which is sponsoring the exhibition.  </P> <P> "Some people's perception about Mexico is based only on the things you hear  about, like the drugs and the corruption . . . but that's not what Mexico has  to offer to the world. It's got much more, and that's its arts and culture,"  Corzo said.  </P> <P> "For Mexican-Americans, it will bring a pride in their past, and a better  perception of their own roots. And for others, it will expose them to these  traditions, maybe for the first time. The exhibition presents a facet of  Mexico, linked through 3,000 years, that shows imagination, creativity, a will  to do things, and high aesthetic quality."  </P> <P> Artes de Mexico, scheduled to run from mid-September through December, will  feature about 16 locally produced exhibitions and events and about 20  additional programs with groups and individuals brought in from Mexico itself,  according to Armando Duron, president of the festival committee.  </P> <P> In addition, other local groups and artists will be invited to produce  accompanying programs in a manner similar to the Los Angeles Festival's Open  Festival, said committee member Samuel Mark.  </P> <P> Although the festival is still a year away, a number of events are already  confirmed, Duron said. Among them:  </P> <P> * A new theatrical adaptation of Mariano Azuela's classic Mexican novel "Los de  Abajo," o be staged at the Bilingual Foundation for the Arts Sept. 24-Nov. 17.  </P> <P> * Three November weekends of screenings -- at historic Broadway movie theaters  downtown, in East Los Angeles and at USC -- of mostly contemporary film and  video works by Mexican and Mexican-American filmmakers, plus a one-day  conference at USC for filmmakers from both sides of the border.  </P> <P> * A display of little-known Revolution-era photographs on "Mexican Life and  Culture During the Porfiriato: The Photography of C. B. Waite, 1898-1913," at  Southwest Museum, Sept. 12-Nov. 17.  </P> <P> * The prestigious "Folk Treasures of Mexico: Highlights From the Nelson A.  Rockefeller Collection of the San Antonio Museum of Art" at the Craft and Folk  Art Museum, Sept. 8-Dec. 19.  </P> <P> * Four performances of traditional regional Mexican dance by the Tonantzin  Dance Group.  </P> <P> * Three public mural-painting sessions by the Latino muralist group East Los  Streetscapers.  </P> <P> * A daylong fiesta of family-oriented activities, workshops, and performances  in Hancock Park in October.  </P> <P> * Lectures and concerts at various locations on "African Influences in the  Music of Mexico" and a newly mounted exhibition tracing the influences of  Mexican artists on African-American artists at the California Afro-American  Museum.  </P> <P> "We are also searching for contemporary theater and dance from Mexico to bring  in," Duron said, noting that more than half of the programming is still to be  confirmed.  </P> <P> Although the organizers are already billing it as a festival highlight, "Women  in Mexico," a visual art exhibit featuring about 120 modern and contemporary  works by 22 female artists, is one of the events not yet confirmed, according  to Selma Holo, director of USC's Fisher Gallery, which hopes to present the  exhibition.  </P> <P> Holo said final plans for the show were put off when the Rockefeller Foundation  decided to delay its decision on her application for a $20,000 start-up grant  for "Women in Mexico." The Rockefeller Foundation has already donated about  $175,000 toward the Artes de Mexico Festival, which is budgeted for $450,000,  Mark said.  </P> <P> "We frankly can't do it unless we get the grant; we're just not in a position  to do it ourselves," said Holo, noting that the foundation's staff had told her  they were waiting to ascertain how the exhibition is being received in New  York, where it is currently at Manhattan's National Academy of Design.  </P> <P> "I've left a spot open for it, and now I'm in limbo; I'm frankly a little  annoyed," Holo said. "It's as good a show as you can get of that material, and  it includes a good selection by Frida Kahlo. She is not only the best woman  artist in Mexico, but she may even be the best artist, and that's why I really  want to do the show."  </P> <P> Duron agreed that the "Women in Mexico" show is vital to the festival. It,  along with two other still-unconfirmed contemporary visual art shows, would be  able to fill in the post-1950 gap left unrepresented by "Mexico: Splendors of  Thirty Centuries," which, Duron said, "kind of comes to a screeching halt with  (Rufino) Tamayo." Thus additional visual art exhibitions are needed, he said,  to bring the main exhibition "up to date."  </P> <P> One highlight of the festival should be "Folk Treasures of Mexico," which will  serve to extend even further the topics brought up by LACMA's massive "Mexico"  exhibition by addressing the "more popular issues," according to Patrick Ela,  director of the Craft and Folk Art Museum.  </P> <P> Still another component of Artes de Mexico, Duron said, will be educational  programming. Committee members have been meeting with officials of the Los  Angeles Unified School District to develop a program and materials related to  the festival's offerings. In addition, he said he hopes to find corporate  sponsors to underwrite tours for schoolchildren to various festival shows.  </P> <P> Although events similar to the Artes de Mexico festival are also being held in  New York (where "Thirty Centuries" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through  Jan. 13) and San Antonio (where the exhibition will be at the San Antonio  Museum of Art from April 6-Aug. 1), Los Angeles' festival will be of a  different, more up-to-date flavor, according to committee member Mark.  </P> <P> The emphasis in New York is on pre-Columbian Mexican arts and in San Antonio on  colonial Mexican arts, he noted. The festival will be "much more contemporary  here and be much more Mexican-American in focus," said Mark, assistant vice  president of civic and community relations at USC.  </P> <P> Duron, an attorney in family law who is also involved with several arts groups,  said, "I think a greater understanding among people is the clearest  accomplishment we can hope to make here -- a greater understanding among  non-Latinos of Latinos, and a greater understanding among Latinos of  themselves, and particularly of Mexicans."  </P></p>

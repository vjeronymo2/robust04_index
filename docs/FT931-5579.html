			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour decision on water welcomed WATER COMPANIES yes-terday welcomed confirmation that the Labour party has 'reluctantly' turned its back on renationalisation of the industry, in the words of Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman. 'If I had to choose between buying back Thames Water and building 30 hospitals I would build 30 hospitals,' he told the industry journal of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 water and sewerage companies quoted on the stock market. However, Labour still opposes privatisation of Scottish water, set to be one of this year's political battlegrounds. Yesterday Mr Smith said the statement did not represent a U-turn as the party manifesto in the general election last April had accepted private ownership of the industry. 'If you ask me is (government ownership) a long term aim I would say yes but we recognise there is no short term prospect that a government could afford it'. He argued that the manifesto, which said that companies should be brought back under public control, referred to the need for greater regulation. 'The one good thing that came out of the water privatisation (in December 1989) was the establishment of the National Rivers Authority as an independent regulator, but more is needed to protect the customers,' he said.</p>

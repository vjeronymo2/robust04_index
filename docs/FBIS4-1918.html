			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zheng Weifu (6774 4580 1381): "Strengthen and </F> Improve Organization and Personnel Work To Ensure a Rapid  Economic Development in Tibet"]    [Text] Lu Huimin, member of the Standing Committee and  director of the organization department of the Tibet Regional  CPC Committee, addressed a regional organization and personnel  work meeting on 3 March. He pointed out: Under the new  situation, we should step up party building and strengthen and  improve the organization and personnel work to provide a strong  organizational guarantee for the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure. This is a major task of Tibet's  organization and personnel departments this year, and for a  considerable period henceforth, and we should strive to  accomplish it.    In 1993, our organization and personnel work was done in a  situation in which we thoroughly implemented the guidelines of  the 14th Party National Congress and the fourth enlarged plenary  meeting of the Fourth Tibet Regional CPC Committee, and we  further accelerated reform, opening up, and economic  construction in this region. Under the direct leadership of the  regional party committee and the regional government, and with  the attention and guidance of the Central Organization  Department and the Ministry of Personnel, the cadres and workers  of the autonomous region's organization and personnel  departments, seriously implementing the party's basic line and  displaying a reform spirit and realistic attitude, worked hard  and successfully accomplished their tasks.    To clarify the concept and tasks, and to make organization  and personnel work better in the new year, Comrade Lu Huimin  pointed out: In organization and personnel work, we should pay  attention to six aspects this year. (1) It is necessary to arm  the whole party ideologically with the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and improve the overall  quality of the party members and cadres. Under the new  situation, the basic task of the party's ideological education  is to organize the vast number of party members and cadres to  thoroughly study Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," and arm themselves ideologically with the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary  to persistently integrate theory with practice and pay attention  to applying in practical work what we have studied. It is  necessary to enhance the cadres' ability of engaging in and  managing socialist market economy. (2) It is necessary to  vigorously strengthen the leading groups at all levels, with  emphasis on improvement of their thinking and work style. First  of all, we should raise the awareness of the leading members at  all levels in the need to practice democratic centralism, so as  to ensure a high degree of unity in party organization and  action. We should make efforts to further enhance the ability  of the leading groups in solving their own problems,  particularly their unity problem. The efforts to improve  cadres' thinking and work style should be combined with the  anti-corruption struggle, and with the efforts to promote  ethical integrity and diligence among party and government  cadres, as well as with relevant measures adopted by the party  organizations. In strengthening the leading groups, another  task this year is to readjust and strengthen some leading groups  according to the requirements of the socialist market economic  structure. (3) Attention should be paid to training and  selecting reserve cadres and to stepping up the training of  outstanding, young, cross-century cadres. In the training and  selection of young and middle-aged reserve cadres, we must do  away with outmoded hiring concepts, and we must select talent  without sticking to one pattern. We must correctly understand  the relationship between "employment" and "retirement," and  handle well the relationship between the treatment of priorities  and the treatment of routines. We should pay special attention  to the training and selection of the "number one man" of the  party and the government. (4) It is necessary to meet the needs  of deepening reforms and accelerating development, and  strengthen primary party organizations. The primary party  organizations are the grass-roots organizations for our party to  exercise strong leadership over the socialist modernization  drive and to consolidate its ruling party status. In  strengthening the primary party organizations in rural and  pastoral areas, the stress of our work this year is put on  continuing to rectify backward party branches, enhance the  cohesiveness and fighting power of the primary party  organizations in Tibet, and make them play a greater fighting  bastion role in light of their own characteristics and tasks  under the new situation. The primary party organizations should  be concerned about the wellbeing of party members and make them  feel the warmth of party organizations. (5) We should actively  and steadily advance the reform of government organizations and  the reform of the cadre and personnel systems, and gradually  establish a new system for administering cadres and personnel  that meets the needs of a socialist market economic structure.  This year the reform of government organizations in the region  will be carried out in all spheres. In carrying out the reform  of government organizations, we should aim at meeting the  requirements for the development of a socialist market economy,  focus on the crucial matter of transforming government functions  and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, improve  relationships among various sectors, strengthen the grassroots  units, and heighten efficiency. On the basis of the reform of  the wage system and the reform of government organizations, we  should concentrate on the concrete implementation of the public  service system. While energetically pushing forward these three  reforms, this year we will, on the basis of carrying out and  improving our existing reform measures, expand the reform of the  cadre and personnel systems. (6) We will strengthen  investigation and study in connection with policies and overall  guidance, and improve the policy-making process of  organizational and personnel departments. We will do a good job  in conducting investigation and study in connection with our  region's organizational and personnel policies for the new  situation, attach importance to resolving practical issues, and  pay attention to practical results. Lu Huimin called on  comrades on the region's organizational and personnel fronts to  take note of the situation, to work hard with a high sense of  political responsibility and political enthusiasm, and strive to  bring about a marked improvement in the region's existing  organizational and personnel work.</p>

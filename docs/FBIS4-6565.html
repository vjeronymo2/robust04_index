			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Game is Prince Ranariddh Playing?"] </F>   [Text] Looking back into the past, we cannot believe that  the four warring Cambodian factions killed one another to the  brink of extinction. A man whose life was saved by Thai  soldiers during the Khmer Rouge offensive at Choam border pass  near Surin Province is Prince Ranariddh, who is now a co-prime  minister of Cambodia. Had the Thai artillery unit failed to  rescue him from danger at Choam battlefield, the prince would  not have become the prime minister nor would he have had the  chance to behave so arrogantly as he is doing today.    As Prince Ranariddh and certain ministers of the Cambodian  Government are making numerous slanderous accusations against  Thailand to discredit our country in the eyes of the  international community, we are pleased with the actions taken  by our prime minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Armed  Forces in the defense of our nation's image and prestige. We  hail their tremendous tolerance and patience, otherwise we would  have fallen into the trap set by the Cambodians.    Considering the situation, we can see that Prince Ranarridh  is no different from the Bosnian Serbs who believe in national  reunification through war with the intention of keeping other  factions under their thumb and detesting national  reconciliation. As a matter of fact, if the Cambodians want to  prolong their genocidal war, that is their business, not ours.  In reality, things turn out differently. Thailand has been  accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It believes that Prince  Ranariddh wants to use Thailand as the target of criticism to  divert the attention of the Cambodian people away from other  domestic difficulties.    Our government and Armed Forces must be patient in dealing  with this problem. We know well that the Cambodian Government  is now very weak. Soldiers and policemen have not received  their salaries for several months and are living in agony. They  can rise up against the government at any time. The longer the  war drags on, the weaker the government will be due to depleting  financial resources. Hence, the same old trick is employed to  divert the people's attention to something outside the country  so that they will not be aware of internal shortcomings.    From another point of view, Prince Ranariddh and several  countries now investing in Cambodia are not happy with  Thailand's growing economic and cultural influence in Cambodia.  At the instruction of former colonialists, Prince Ranariddh  deems it necessary to do something to eliminate the Thai clamp  on Cambodia in exchange for military and economic assistance  from other countries. Prince Ranariddh and his colleagues might  be misled by old information and pictures provided by  intelligence units of certain countries and blindly use them to  substantiate his charges against Thailand.    The repetition of groundless accusations against Thailand is  causing many countries to wonder about the truth of such  allegations. Moreover, Cambodia reacts indifferently to  Thailand's protests in this regard. Optimistically speaking,  the Cambodians might now come to realize that they have made a  mistake. Therefore, we must act wisely in order to assert our  maturity. Let them continue killing one another as they wish.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun--Another artificial Earth satellite,  Foton, designed for continued study of the properties of  materials in space, was launched on 14 June 1994 from the  Plesetsk cosmodrome by means of a Soyuz booster rocket.    Its 18-day flight program envisages experiments on the  production of semiconductors, optical glass with a variable  refractive index, and biologically active substances in  microgravitation, as well as the development of technologies for  their experimental industrial production.    In accordance with a commercial agreement, a Biopan  container  with equipment designed by German specialists has been placed on  board the Foton satellite.    The satellite has been placed in orbit with the following  parameters:    --initial period of revolution--90.4 mins;    --apogee--385 km;    --perigee--229 km;    --orbital inclination 62.8 degrees.    The apparatus on board the satellite is working normally.</p>

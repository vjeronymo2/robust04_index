			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Audi links with Porsche to produce sports vehicle AUDI, the Volkswagen group's quality car subsidiary, will shortly launch a model developed and built in collaboration with Porsche, the sports car specialist. The newcomer would be unveiled in September with deliveries starting next year, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, Audi chief executive said yesterday. The venture would help to stabilise lossmaking Porsche, but association with such a high-quality manufacturer would help Audi to establish itself alongside Mercedes-Benz and BMW as a top marque. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chief executive, is a member of the family which controls Porsche. Last week, he unveiled a DM1.25bn (Dollars 781m) first-quarter loss for the group. He was head of Audi until the end of last year. Audi had fallen into loss in the first quarter, Mr Kortum said, during which production had been slashed 42 per cent to 76,000 cars. But in contrast to the parent, which is aiming to break even in the full 12 months, Audi was well placed to show a profit, he said. Deliveries to customers in the first three months of this year, down 31 per cent at 95,000 vehicles had been partly maintained from stocks built up after the downturn in the second half of 1992. Sales in Germany were so far down 37 per cent at 43,000 units and turnover had fallen 36 per cent to DM2.8bn. Full 1992 figures, released yesterday, showed net profits down to DM172m from DM370m on record turnover of DM16.7bn and peak deliveries of 490,000 cars. For this year, Audi expected to benefit from lower input costs from co-ordinated buying and job cuts. Some 4,000 of the 37,700 workers are expected to go, bringing the workforce down to levels last seen 10 years ago, when the company made 380,000 cars a year. 'The joint venture with Porsche makes it self-evident that we are talking about a very sporty vehicle,' Mr Kortum added. The car will be sold under the Audi badge and based on an existing production model.</p>

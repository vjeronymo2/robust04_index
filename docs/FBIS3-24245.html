Mezova, under rubric </F> "Politics": "Zaurbi Nakhushev: It's No Easy Life for the  Speaker...: Interview With the Chairman of the Council of the  Republic, of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Parliament"]    [Text] [Mezova] Well, Zaurbi Akhmedovich, like the Council  of the Republic, which you head, Parliament has been working for  one and a half months. That's a short period of time, but  certainly something has already been done. Precisely what?    [Nakhushev] We were elected as deputies on 12 December, but  have been working less than a month. That is linked basically  with installing Parliament. Naturally, not much has been done so  far. We are basically working for ourselves: we adopted  Provisional Regulations, confirmed the makeup of commissions,  and elected their chairmen. There is also another important  document in our assets: KBR Law entitled "The Making of  Amendments and Additions to the KBR Constitution (Basic Law)."  The plan for the legislative activity of the Council of the  Republic for the next two months is almost ready, so the house  is approaching the finishing line for creating legislation.    Within the near future a commission to develop the draft of  the KBR Constitution will be created. It would be a rather good  idea to publish the draft in October in the mass media, and  then, in November-December, to submit it for review by  parliament. We are also engaged in preparing the republic's  symbols -- the seal, anthem, and flag. We already have final  versions of the seal and flag for submittal to the President.    [Mezova] As an invited individual, you were present at the  first session of the Council of the Federation. What were your  impressions?    [Nakhushev] Yes, for two days I was at sessions of the  Council of the Federation. To tell the truth, it did not seem to  me that discussions about the fact that the Council of the  Federation is Boris Yeltsin's agency have sufficient foundation.  The people who gathered in the house were the administrators of  major enterprises in the defense industry, administration heads  of krays and oblasts, Presidents, and well-known academicians --  in general, people who can make their own judgments with regard  to all questions pertaining to the vital activity of the Russian  state, people who are strong personalities, professionally  speaking. The fact that Shumeyko headed the Council of the  Federation has a positive role. The house immediately went to  work. Also, he has an excellent knowledge of the government's  kitchen, so to speak, from the inside. It will be easier to  cooperate with him.    [Mezova] Everyone says that the reforms will be rolled up.  Is  that correct?    [Nakhushev] He (Vladimir Shumeyko) has stated frankly that  we  need supporters of the reforms that are being carried out by the  government. In general, one thing is clear: the interaction  between the Council of the Federation and the government will be  good and stable.    [Mezova] Since we have touched upon this topic, you  apparently know that both the RF [Russian Federation] Parliament  and the KBR are predicting the fate of the pocket parliament.  What do you think such suppositions are based on? What is your  attitude toward them?    [Nakhushev] I have already said that the Council of the  Federation produced a favorable impression on me. It seems to me  that it will scarcely be a pocket parliament. Its makeup  includes deputies who are rather independent and strong.    Nevertheless I agree that they definitely are predicting.  These discussions are occurring and probably contain a share of  truth. But still the present Parliament is really not the  Supreme Soviet, which used to engage in all state matters, and  sometimes also usurped the functions of the executive power. It  seems to me that these discussions are based on the fact that  there has been a fundamental change in the functions and powers  of the representative authority. Parliament will engage in the  creation of legislation. It has retained the function of  monitoring the execution of the laws and the executive power. In  particular, it possesses powers concerning the expression of  confidence or lack of confidence in Parliament. The budget is  also in the joint jurisdiction of the houses.    [Mezova] Are you saddened that Parliament's powers have been  narrowed?    [Nakhushev] In the broad sense Parliament actually does not  possess the previous completeness of power. But that is what the  division of powers is. Currently it is simply that people have  not yet become accustomed to this, but in two or three years, I  am convinced, this situation will not surprise anyone.    Yes, we actually have been limited to a definite framework.  Nevertheless, the Council of the Republic, like Parliament as a  whole, will not be a pocket organization. I do not think that  anyone, including the President, has an interest in this. We do  not intend to cause any frictions in the interrelations with the  other authorities. Each has its own functions and its own duties.    [Mezova] You probably are already rather well acquainted  with  the deputies in your house. Are you pleased with the makeup of  the house? What would you change if that depended on you? What  kind of specialists (or individuals) would you prefer to have  more of in the Council of the Republic?    [Nakhushev] I cannot say that this acquaintance is as  profound or complete as I would like, but I am satisfied with  the deputy corps. People of different ages, with different  knowledge and work experience, are represented in it. There are  lawyers, entrepreneurs, three former school directors... I view  their working ability optimistically. I hope that in a year our  deputies who are working on a professional basis will actually  become professionals. If, of course, we work...    [Mezova] Do you mean that Parliament might be broken up or  disbanded?..    [Nakhushev] No, no. If we work on ourselves.    [Mezova] In the house there actually are people who evoke  curiosity. But am I correct in saying that it does not contain,  for example, any clearly expressed radicals?    [Nakhushev] Apparently not. But I am completely happy with  this makeup, although we do not have any people who are as well  known in the republic as the Council of Representatives has.  However, we do have people who are very interesting, and who  evoke, as you have said, genuine curiosity.    [Mezova] In general, how do you imagine the ideal  parliamentarian? Do you see him in any concrete way -- in the  present makeup of the Parliament or the former VS [Supreme  Soviet], the present or former Parliament of the RF, or even the  USSR?    [Nakhushev] I am not confident that I am speaking about the  finished image of the ideal parliamentarian, but, in my view, he  is a restrained individual, who is very tactful and highly  cultivated. It is not mandatory that he have several higher  degrees. But he must also be consistent, competent, and be able  to speak laconically and expressively. He must be a democrat in  the true sense of the word, and an aristocrat at heart.  Incidentally, in our house I see several persons who promise to  become this kind of parliamentarian in the future.    [Mezova] Could you name them?    [Nakhushev] I shall not anticipate events. Nor shall I name  real ones who have already distinguished themselves. Although,  to tell the truth, I was not enraptured either by Sobchak or  Popov, or even Sakharov, even at those times when everyone was  delighted by them. At first I was irritated even by Yevdokiya  Gayer. Do you remember that small woman? Then I learned to  respect her, because it was obvious that she was speaking in a  meaningful way and was genuinely experiencing what she was  talking about and what she felt for her people.    [Mezova] There have been a lot of discussions about the  powers assigned to the houses. For example, certain deputies of  the Council of Representatives assume that it would make sense  to return to a division of them. What do you think? Which powers  that are, in your opinion, the prerogative of the Council of the  Republic have gone to the other house, or vice versa?    [Nakhushev] When each deputy was elected, he knew about his  powers according to the Statute that had been confirmed by the  President of the republic. Each one know where he would be going  and what he would engage in. Today people cannot engage in  pulling the blankets over themselves. God willing, each one will  be able to cope with his powers. I feel that our house has not  been insulted by anyone. We have even shared a lot of them with  the Council of Representatives with regard to confidence or lack  of confidence in the Government. We also discuss the budget  jointly. We have the responsibility for its initial review.  There have been recommendations concerning the creation of joint  commissions. They are, of course, necessary, but not too many of  them. Why, then, was it necessary to divide parliament into two  houses? Especially since that house is operating on an  unrelieved basis, and it will not be convenient to convoke them  each time. Everyone, so to speak, has his job to do, so let each  person pull his own wagon honestly.    [Mezova] People say that the parliament is being specially  evicted from Government House allegedly to emphasize that the  representative power is currently out of favor and is no match  for the executive power. How would you comment of that?    [Nakhushev] First, no one is evicting us. Second, I do not  know that it is mandatory anywhere for the powers to be situated  together. I do not think that it is worse for Parliament to have  its own accommodations...    [Mezova] Rather nice...    [Nakhushev] If not fashionable. The building that housed the  former Nalchik Gorkom of the CPSU, and that is being offered to  us, is the second building in prestige after Government House.  True, it will be slightly crowded for Parliament, and therefore  a plan for expanding the building has been prepared.    As for whether or not the representative power is a match  for  the executive, I have already said earlier that everyone should  engage in his own job, and the better he performs it, the more  everyone wins.    [Mezova] The British Parliament, which is the ancestor of  many parliamentary traditions, also gave birth to the job of  speaker, which is already more than 600 years old. At first the  speaker acted there in the role of the mouthpiece of the House  of Commons. His basic purpose was to regulate order in  conducting debates and in guaranteeing justice. In our  conditions the speaker is assigned several other powers. What do  you think they should consist of?    [Nakhushev] I shall answer your question this way: the role  of the speaker today is identical to the role of Parliament, and  we have already touched upon that topic. Another important  factor is the specifics that pertain to our republic. In  general, at the present time, having worked a certain period of  time, I can say that it's no easy life for the speaker, just as,  incidentally, it's no easy life for the deputy.    [Mezova] Do you think that the two houses of the KBR  Parliament will maintain stable, even, professional  interrelations?    [Nakhushev] I feel that we have nothing to divide. Our tasks  have been defined, and now it's simply a matter of executing  them. Each house has been given its powers. The two chairmen are  equal and independent of each other. I repeat that there will  not be any frictions. We shall not allow them.    [Mezova] What kind of house would you like to see in a year  or two? A professional one?    [Nakhushev] A professional one that is self-assured. This  also pertains to the chairman. I think that we shall grow  together.    [Mezova] Just yesterday, speaking figuratively, you were not  the last person in the system of the executive power. But today  that power allows itself to look at you condescendingly. Doesn't  this offend you? Can you say that you have won by changing your  place of work?    [Nakhushev] It surprises and... yes, it offends me. But, you  know, I am not the kind of person who allows others to look at  him condescendingly. I will growl, but if that becomes part of  the system, I will simply leave...    To tell the truth, I do not know whether or not I won as a  result of the new job. Time will tell...</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY CONGRESSMEN ARE SWORN IN  </P> <P> Orange County's two new Republican congressmen, C. Christopher Cox of Newport  Beach and Dana Rohrabacher of Lomita, were sworn in Tuesday in a Capitol  ceremony nearly 2 centuries old.  </P> <P> Cox, 36, a former White House lawyer, said he was feeling grateful as he rose  from his seat in the House of Representatives and raised his hand to take the  brief oath of office along with his new colleagues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Shot Bid  </P> <P> "You think of all the people who are responsible for putting you where you  are," Cox said of the supporters for his long-shot bid to represent the 40th  District, one of the nation's most securely Republican. "You don't feel like  someone who set a new record in a track event because you didn't do it by  yourself."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, 41, said the thought going through his mind was: "This is it, and  I'm ready!" He said he had viewed Congress from California as a journalist and  from the White House as a speech writer for President Reagan and now found it  "not just exciting but fascinating to get the view from inside, from the other  end of Pennsylvania Avenue."  </P> <P> The two men took the oath amid a telegenic sea of red ties, white shirts and  dark suits punctuated by an occasional bright red or royal blue dress worn by  one of the few women members of the House. Also on the floor were many children  who, wearing floor passes tied around their necks with bright red ribbons, were  allowed to join their parents for this one special occasion.  </P> <P> Cox and Rohrabacher, both bachelors, each defeated a wide field of GOP  candidates to win their party's nominations in their districts, which are so  predominantly Republican that the winner of the June primary easily wins the  general election. Both positioned themselves to the right of their competitors  and, as a trump card, brought in retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a  hero to conservatives despite his indictment in the Iran-Contra scandal, to  campaign for them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cox Replaces Badham  </P> <P> Cox replaces Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach) of the 40th District,  which stretches inland from Newport Beach, and Rohrabacher succeeds Daniel E.  Lungren (R-Long Beach) of the 42nd District, which straddles Orange and Los  Angeles counties.  </P> <P> Badham, who served on the House Armed Services Committee, retired after 12  years to be a private consultant to defense firms. Lungren, who was first  elected to the House in 1978, left office after Gov. George Deukmejian chose  him as state treasurer to replace Jesse M. Unruh, who died in 1987. Lungren  failed to be confirmed by the state Legislature and now is returning to private  practice as a lawyer.  </P> <P> At noon here, in brisk sunshine, Cox and Rohrabacher began their first day in  Congress by walking from their new offices in the Cannon and Longworth House  office buildings across the street to the Capitol. The 2-hour session began  with an invocation and moved to the first vote of the 101st Congress: the  election of Speaker of the House.  </P> <P> At 12:42 p.m., Cox cast the first vote of his congressional career for House  Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois. Eighteen minutes later, in the  alphabetical roll call vote, Rohrabacher followed suit. But the outcome of the  vote was predetermined in the Democrat-controlled House, which reelected Jim  Wright of Texas 253 to 170.  </P> <P> As the hourlong speakership vote took place, Cox and Rohrabacher joined in the  general hubbub, meeting members of Congress on the Republican side of the aisle  whom they did not know and greeting those they had previously met. At several  points, the commotion from this shared activity became so rambunctious that the  gavel was struck in vain efforts to restore order.  </P> <P> When the vote was completed, Wright delivered a message in which he made a  strong plea for bipartisanship, especially in foreign matters. He then asked  the members of the 101st Congress to raise their hands to swear their  dedication to their country and their duties for the next 2 years.  </P> <P> Also sworn in were Orange County's three other congressmen, Robert K. Dornan of  Garden Grove, Ron C. Packard of Carlsbad and William E. Dannemeyer of  Fullerton.  </P> <P> As he took the oath, and during the previous 2 hours, Dornan carried around the  sometimes-sleeping Haley Olivia Dornan, his granddaughter. Dornan later  reported that the child, who will be a year old in a few days, took her first  step on the Speaker's table.  </P> <P> After the ceremony, Rep. Cox returned to his newly occupied office, still  strewn with unopened boxes and stacked with furniture, for a reception for  about 40 friends that included many of his co-workers from his 2 years as  senior associate counsel in the White House. They congratulated him while  munching on turkey and ham sandwiches and drinking coffee and soft drinks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joined by Parents  </P> <P> Joining in the celebration was Rohrabacher and his parents, Doris (Fluff) and  Don Rohrabacher of Temecula, and girlfriend Paula Dobriansky, a deputy  assistant secretary of state for human rights whom he met while writing  speeches in the White House.  </P> <P> Cox said his family, including his parents and four sisters and their families,  most of whom live in Minnesota, will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, thus they  did not make the trip to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.  </P> <P> Still ahead for the two new congressmen are vying for committee assignments and  organizing their staffs in both Washington and their home districts. But  Tuesday was mostly a day to enjoy the fruits of victory.  </P> <P> Cox, pointing to the round red lapel pin of the 101st Congress, said what  struck him the most about his first day was "the entire experience of being  clearly identified as a member of Congress by this badge and being treated as  such by all of my colleagues."  </P> <P> He added: "It was nice to be on the job."  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan offers advice to President-elect George Bush on dealing  with the AIDS epidemic: A just-say-no campaign to sex. (Part II, Page 4.)  </P></p>

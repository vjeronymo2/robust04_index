			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / People: Hay Davison's week for chairmanships Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse and former chief executive of Lloyd's, is this week picking up two widely contrasting non-executive chairmanships, that of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, and, as expected, of Newspaper Publishing, publishers of The Independent newspaper. Davison, 61, who admits he has in the past too often been associated with 'disasters' - Lloyd's, which was ' a hefty struggle' and Storehouse which was in trouble when he took it on - says he is attracted by MDIS as ' a good-looking little company' that is young and growing. He points out that he has the advantage of a computer background - his first job with Arthur Andersen having been as the firm's 'computer expert'. MDIS was formed in a management buyout from the US aerospace group earlier this year. Hay Davison says the company hopes to go public, though not before next year at the earliest. Hay Davison is keen to stress how 'sensitive' he is to the possible charge of accepting too many non-executive directorships - he is on the board of Chloride, CIBA-Geigy and Cadbury Schweppes - and claims, as a consequence, to have turned down several other offers to make time to do the MDIS job. He predicts an announcement about his chairmanship of The Independent, where he has been a non-executive director since its inception, at a board meeting on Thurs-day. He replaces Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, who recently resigned partly because he opposed plans to buy The Observer, but also because of disagreements about the management style of Andreas Whittam Smith, who combines the role of editor and chief executive. Hay Davison claims to have been in favour of The Observer acquisition. 'It would have been very helpful', he says. See Observer</p>

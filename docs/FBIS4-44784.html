			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maintaining Position in Top Group on </F> World Market"; "About the (Difficult) Position of German Machine  Tool Industry"]    [Text] When victims of the already long lasting  worldwide weak economy are listed, then the German machine tool  industry will appear on top. What was already apparent at the  9th EMO [World Machine Tool Fair] in Paris 1991 and became even  more so at the 10th EMO in Hannover last September could now  have reached its bottom and, under favorable conditions, could  possibly recover. The first signs indicate a slight improvement,  which will perhaps translate into the concrete form of orders  placed at the 1994 Metav in Duesseldorf. In anticipation of this  so much hoped for "Metal Processing Market," the Association of  German Machine Tool Manufacturing Plants (VDW) drew up a balance  sheet which, for lack of requisite official 1993 statistics, is  based on official semiannual figures and on the Association's  own projections.    The year 1993 was painful to the German machine tool  manufacturers, a direct consequence of the already third  downward trend seen in all the relevant indicators:    --Production decreased to an about 5 million DM lower level  (-25%) by midyear and then to an about 10 billion DM lower  level (-29%) level by the year's end, thus to the level  which  the old Federal States had last time reached in 1985.    --In foreign trade imports decreased, owing to a weaker  domestic demand, by 42% (in the first half-year period of  1993)  and thus even more than did exports (-20%). The foreign  trade  figures for 1993 must be interpreted with caution, however,  because conversion to European Community covering statistics  results in an underestimation of especially the import volume.    In the import structure all the 15 main seller countries,  except the People's Republic of China, post only minus figures.  Imports from the three top ranking seller countries --  Switzerland, Italy, Japan -- still head the list, as they have  before, and may even claim larger shares of the total imports  (55% as of now). The larger than 50% decline of  imports from  competitors in the Far East reflects a downfall of Japanese  sales on the German market.    In the export structure, although minus figures prevail here  too, there can be detected some encouraging signs. During the  first half-year period of 1993 the top position among the  largest foreign markets for the German machine tool industry was  taken over by Italy, following a huge order from the Italian  automobile industry. Most of all metal cutting machine tools are  being delivered to the People's Republic of China, which has in  the meantime fallen into the third position behind the U.S. on  the list of the largest foreign markets. Particularly high  growth rates were last reported here for processing centers,  transfer lines, lathes, and gear cutting machines. Taking this  development into consideration, the Association of German  Machine Tool Manufacturers (VDW) has in August 1993 opened a  liaison office in Peking so as to ensure their constant presence  in this important growth market.    The unusually large increase of exports to the Portuguese  market, attributable to delivery of presses to the automobile  industry, should be regarded as a once occurring phenomenon  rather than a sign of a continuing market growth. It has to do  with the Ford-Volkswagen joint "AutoEuropa" venture in Palmela  near Setubal, rated as the largest investment made in Portugal  in its entire history.    When the evaluation of market opportunities is based on  orders received from foreign countries, then those which had  come (by the end of September 1993) from the U.S., the People's  Republic of China, CIS countries, France, Italy, and South Korea  top the list. The total orders from abroad, though, had remained  weak at a 25% lower level than during the corresponding  period  of the previous year. Then, however, first increases (+  9%) in  foreign orders took place during the August-October 1993 period:    --The decline of orders to a 50% level since 1991  unmistakenly characterizes the prevailing conditions in this  industry.    --With a 4.6 months' long lead time for filling orders, a  nearly constant level was reached during the last few months  which, however, must be viewed against the background of quite  visibly reduced capacity levels. The same applies to matching  under-full capacity levels, which last (end of September 1993)  was 73% and thus 10% lower than in the previous  year.    --The employment level in German machine tool manufacture  follows the same trend, despite efforts by enterprises to hold  the line: the number of people employed in this industry  nationwide having been necessarily cut from over 89,000 by 30  December 1992 to about 75,000 by end of September 1993 and  likely continuing to be cut.    Under these circumstances there is nothing to conceal or  embellish. Two years ago, in anticipation of the 1992 Metav, an  analysis had been made by the Enterprise Consultants in Munich  (UBM) and its results then published in a brochure under the  title "Small Cause -- Large Effect: Why Millions of Jobs  Nationwide Depend on a Few Thousand Jobs in Machine Tool  Manufacture" for distribution at the 1993 Hannover EMO and for  thus educating the broad public. Publication of these facts has,  indeed, raised the awareness above all among politicians and  bankers as well as trade unions and employers. The extent of  changes which within the past two years have taken place in the  German machine tool industry was unprecedented since the end of  the war. The machine tool manufacturers do everything they can  to avoid further cutbacks. Unfortunately, the demand for  short-term effective capital subsidies provided for in the  enacted "Stability and Growth" Law is falling on deaf ears in  Bonn. This so because slumps which are only "moderate" in terms  of the national economy do not open the eyes of politicians to  the fact that there is a connection between the decline of the  German machine tool industry and a not only quality-wise but  also already dangerous threat to Germany's production status. On  the contrary: the strictest export control in Europe is now, as  before, practiced in Germany and its bureaucratic procedures  additionally burden the machine tool industry. These  restrictions and changed currency exchange rates, have  additionally impaired the position of German manufacturers on  the international market and thus also their overall status in  1993.</p>

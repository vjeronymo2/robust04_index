			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Severn Trent to make pollution payments Severn Trent, the privatised water utility, will make ex gratia payments totalling Pounds 600,000 to households in the Worcester area affected by a pollution alert, Mr Brian Duckworth, director of customer services, said yesterday. Meanwhile, the National Rivers Authority said it had traced the probable cause of the contamination, which resulted in about 100,000 people being advised not to drink tap water. The authority said it would consider this week whether to take legal action against the polluter. 'We usually prosecute when there has been pollution, except in very exceptional circumstances,' it said. Mr Duckworth said the Guaranteed Standards Scheme agreed between the industry and Ofwat, its regulator, included payments of Pounds 10 a day compensation when households had their water supply disconnected without proper notice. Although supplies had not been cut in Worcester, Severn Trent would make payments 'in the spirit of the scheme'. He added: 'We know, for example, that people bought bottled water.' He said about 30,000 households were affected by the scare which started on Friday when some people complained that their tap water smelled and tasted of paraffin. All signs of contamination would be gone early this week, Mr Duckworth promised. It was too early to estimate the full cost to Severn Trent - the main consideration so far had been to restore water supplies to normal - but it would not not be substantial. The company would cover all costs from revenue. Severn Trent reported pre-tax profits up 4.3 per cent to Pounds 140.8m on a turnover of Pounds 489.8m for the half-year to September 30. Health officials said there was no serious risk from the organic industrial solvent that contaminated the water. The NRA said there was little damage to the river Severn and river Roden and no sign of fish being killed. This made tracing the source of the pollution much more difficult - it was eventually traced to the Wem industrial estate in Shropshire. The NRA refused to name the suspected polluter. 'There are a huge number of discharges from this industrial estate and we will be looking at licenses this coming week to establish what is and what is not permitted.'</p>

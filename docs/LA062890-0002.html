			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The trick, of course, was to think cool. KRTH-FM did its best by spinning such  platters as Bing Crosby's "White Christmas," Johnny Mathis' "Winter  Wonderland," and Andy Williams' "Happy Holidays."  </P> <P> You had to keep telling yourself that at least it was dry. (Forget that a  microwave is dry, too.)  </P> <P> Ken Smith, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., pointed out that it actually  "doesn't feel as hot" as the temperature indicated.  </P> <P> "With the general humidity dropping below 20% in the afternoon, it creates a  heat-index temperature that is actually lower" than the stated temperature, he  said.  </P> <P> For instance, the mercury hit 109 Wednesday.  </P> <P> But the heat-index temperature was only 107.  </P> <P>  Jingle bells, jingle bells ...  </P> <P>  One bank in Pasadena didn't help matters, though. Pamela Warrick saw its  electronic time-and-temperature sign jump from 143 to 144. (But the heat index  wouldn't be more than 140.)  </P> <P> And then there was that morning spill of a load of barbecue sauce on the Pomona  Freeway, which prompted disc jockeys to joke that the red-hot pavement was  ready if any listeners felt like splashing down their steaks.  </P> <P>  Dashing through the snow ...  </P> <P>  Glen George of Pasadena faxed Only in L.A. a missive scolding us for jinxing  the city on Tuesday by noting in miscelLAny that the all-time high at the Civic  Center was 110. Old Sol, obviously feeling challenged, increased the mark to  112 that day.  </P> <P> "Don't ever again publish record temperatures," he said. "You probably should  avoid earthquake information while you're at it."  </P> <P> Let alone talk of "earthquake weather." (It's hot and windy, remember?)  </P> <P> We tried to make up for it today by running a nostalgic photo of the last  snowstorm to hit the Civic Center. It was just the other day: Jan. 11, 1949.  </P> <P> Jack Frost nipping at your nose ...  </P> <P>  Certainly, The Times took a positive attitude when the temperature in L.A. hit  109 not quite a century ago -- on Sept. 25, 1891.  </P> <P> Like other L.A. papers back then, The Times was sensitive about the frontier  pueblo's image back East. While "the day was 'warm,' " it allowed, "it should  be remembered that there was nothing in the shape of sunstroke or prostration  by heat, as would have been the case in any of the eastern cities with a  temperature of 90 degrees or even less, so that the California climate has  nothing to fear from having the whole truth told."  </P> <P>  Sleigh bells ring. Are ya listenin'?  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The average high temperature at Civic Center in the month of June is 78  degrees.  </P></p>

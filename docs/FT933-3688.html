			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Parties find their candidates HOPES that Germany's three main political parties would agree on a presidential candidate will collapse today when the governing Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party nominate their own candidates. But Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the outgoing president, said the dispute over his successor, and the presidential office itself, was being used by the political parties in the run-up to next year's federal elections. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will ask his CDU party conference in Berlin to endorse Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony. The choice of Mr Heitmann, 49, reflects Mr Kohl's determination to have as president an easterner, as well as someone who reflects conservative values aimed at attracting the hard-right wing of the CDU. Mr Heitmann has repeatedly stressed the importance of the role of the nation, security, and a return to traditional family values as a means of consolidating unification. Mr Heitmann was active in the Lutheran church, a focal point of the opposition under communist regimes, and is also seen by Mr Kohl as a man who embodies resistance and integrity, as if to compensate for the weak German resistance during the Nazi period. By contrast, the Social Democratic party will today endorse Mr Johannes Rau, the current prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia. Meanwhile, the Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, has urged Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, to become its candidate. Mr Genscher has refused but, if public opinion continues to swing in his favour, may not take much more persuading to accept. Mr Kohl would not welcome his former rival as a strong president. Opinion polls, carried out by the Ennid Institute, show that 56 per cent of Germans support Mr Genscher, with 67 per cent in the east backing him. Only 5 per cent of Germans support Mr Heitmann. Mr Rau is supported by 26 per cent of Germans, and but by only 14 per cent in the east.</p>

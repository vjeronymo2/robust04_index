			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures firmer FRENCH PIBOR futures were slightly firmer yesterday, buoyed by a stronger franc and news that the Bank of France was making progress in rebuilding reserves. Dealers reported that the shorter dated futures contracts had been oversold on fears that the central bank was failing to replenish its foreign currency reserves and would have to keep short dates high for longer, in order to attract funds. With these fears diminished, the March and June contracts bounced back. The March contract rose more than 12 basis points during the day, and the June contract was 14 basis points up at the close. The German debt market was generally firmer, but short-dated Euromark futures did not move significantly, trading in a very narrow range. There was some residual disappointment in the market after the Bundesbank left its key interest rates unchanged following its council meeting, even though this was expected. Although there are hopes for further early interest rate cuts by the German authorities, dealers reported that the market had already priced in the next round of easing. The June contract closed at around 92.90, unaltered on the day. The UK money markets were extremely quiet. The Bank of England posted a small shortage of Pounds 100m and did not operate in the morning. The forecast was then revised to a flat position and there were no afternoon operations. Period rates were mostly unchanged. The three-month interbank rate stayed at 6 1/4 per cent on the offered side. Short sterling contracts were steady for most of the day. A dealer said there was no particular reason for the market to change its view that the UK government would not cut rates at the Budget next month, particularly after yesterday's economic figures. These included higher than forecast bank lending, and a smaller rise in unemployment in January than in the prev-ious month. Another dealer commented: 'The revival of bank lending and the less than horrific unemployment figures point to the fact that the recovery has started somewhere. We have also had a fairly consistent fall in the pound.' Otherwise, yesterday's sluggish trading reflected a generally unfocused week. The market is looking ahead to next week when conditions are expected to be much tighter.</p>

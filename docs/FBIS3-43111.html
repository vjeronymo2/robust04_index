Dudin, Moscow; UDC 533.6.011.55+532.526] </F>   [Abstract] Hypersonic flow of a viscous gas over a plane  delta wing with finite length at a null angle of attack at a  given surface temperature with a symmetric wake is considered in  a Cartesian system of coordinates with an origin at the delta  wing vertex assuming that the characteristic Reynolds number is  large yet subcritical, so that the boundary layer and wake flow  is laminar, and it is further postulated that an intermediate  interaction regime is realized on the principal wing section and  in the wake, and that strong interaction areas form only in the  wing vertex and leading edge vicinity. The boundary value  problem is solved by the finite difference method. For  illustration, a plane delta wing in a flow is considered  allowing for the wake flow. The pressure distribution on the  wing (and, for comparison, that of a delta wing with a given  trailing edge pressure), the boundary layer displacement  thickness distribution, the friction stress coefficient  distribution in the longitudinal direction, the velocity and  enthalpy distribution on the wake axis, and the pressure  distribution along the wing span with an interaction parameter  of _ch_[.sup]*[/]=2 are plotted. The findings demonstrate that  the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing within a  0.5_ch_[.sup]*[/]3 interaction parameter range differ from   those of a wing in a flow with a given trailing edge pressure by  10-15%.

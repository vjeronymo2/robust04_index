			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: English &amp; Overseas English &amp; Overseas Properties is to pay its first interim dividend since 1991, after lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 353,000 for the six months to the end of June. The company, which saw turnover rise from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.84m, said the increase in profits came from two main areas: increased rental income, both from properties developed by the group and from properties bought last year, and the sale of an investment property in Gateshead. Investment properties are now valued at Pounds 26.8m in the balance sheet, compared with Pounds 1.43m at end-June 1993. Earnings per share worked through at 0.55p (0.05p); the interim dividend is 0.3p.</p>

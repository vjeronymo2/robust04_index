The parliament foreign commission also recommends  that the government should present to NATO Estonian proposals to  draw up an Estonian-NATO partnership program while also  consulting relevant parliament commissions.    The parliament foreign commission took this decision after  it  had familiarized itself with the documents of the NATO heads of  state and government leaders' conference. As is known the  meeting took place in Brussels on 10 and 11 January.</p>

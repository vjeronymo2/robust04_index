			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / CBI chief warns on wage inflation One of the strongest warnings about the potential danger to economic recovery from wage inflation was delivered yesterday by Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the Confederation of British Industry, Lisa Wood writes. In a speech to the west Midlands region of the CBI, Sir Bryan said: 'We have a bleak history of making competitive gains and then throwing them away needlessly. I am determined that this time we shall not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.' Sir Bryan highlighted sustainable non-inflationary growth as one of the three main priorities during his two-year term. Others were improving the overall competitiveness of industry and the creation of a deregulated business-friendly Europe. He singled out the City as needing particular restraint over inflationary pay arrangements. Recent labour-market statistics had disturbed his peace of mind, he said. 'Thanks to growth in average earnings in manufacturing of 4.75 per cent over the year to March and slower productivity growth of just 2.6 per cent, unit labour costs in manufacturing are increasing again at 2 per cent a year. 'That would have been a very respectable performance just a few years ago. But our competitors have regrouped and are achieving better results which we must match. Unit labour costs are now falling by 2 per cent a year in Germany and 3 per cent in the US.' Pay restraint in the public sector was one important component of an anti-inflationary strategy, he said. But private-sector employers needed to pay close attention to controlling the whole pay package, including bonuses, allowances and overtime. 'It is only too easy for earnings drift to occur without it being properly controlled, or even noticed, before it is too late,' he said.</p>

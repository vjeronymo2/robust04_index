			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sogeti trims losses at halfway stage Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS), the French-based computing services company, yesterday announced an improvement in first-half results, cutting net losses to FFr115m (Dollars 21.78m) compared with a deficit of FFr197m in the first six months of 1993. Mr Geoff Unwin, chief operating officer, said that the company had gained momentum towards recovery after losses of FFr430m last year. He said that the group, in which Daimler-Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, should return to profit in 1995. The first-half improvement reflected a radical reorganisation of the group's operations. Revenues were also helped by an improved economic environment in some of its principal markets. Total revenues slipped to FFr5.05bn in the first six months of 1994 from FFr5.53bn in the first half of 1993. Operating income climbed to FFr194m from FFr121m. According to Mr Unwin, the decline in revenues was reversed in the second quarter of the year and that improvement continued through July and August. He cited several positive factors, including the successful introduction of new service offerings such as information systems management. Profitability was improved through the merger of its loss-making German subsidiary, Cap Debis, with Debis Systemhaus, the software arm of Daimler-Benz. As a result, the 49 per cent stake of CGS in Cap Debis was reduced to 19.6 per cent in the merged company. Mr Unwin said the group's Genesis restructuring programme, launched in mid-1992, was beginning to yield results. The programme, which involved the creation of geographical business centres and the absorption of ambitious acquisitions made at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, has allowed the company to transfer expertise more rapidly to its various markets. CGS said its order book had strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year and that its financial position had been reinforced following a FFr1.5bn capital increase in May. But price competition remained fierce, partly reflecting the entry of computer hardware manufacturers into the sector.</p>

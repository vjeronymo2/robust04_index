			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR PEACE HOPES SEEN AS WISHFUL THINKING;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: KEY OBSTACLE IS REBEL INSISTENCE THAT 200 ARMY OFFICERS BE  PUNISHED FOR CRIMES. GUERRILLAS ARE EXPECTED TO SEEK POLITICAL CONTROL IN THEIR  STRONGHOLDS.  </P> <P> Despite optimistic reports of progress in the peace talks between the  Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, hopes  for a negotiated end to the 10-year-old civil war seem to be based not so much  on the evidence as on wishful thinking.  </P> <P> This is the view expressed by government officials, military figures, diplomats  and sources close to the guerrillas.  </P> <P> The insurmountable obstacle, as they see it, is the rebel FMLN's insistence  that the army dismiss and punish as many as 200 officers for human rights  abuses and war crimes.  </P> <P> "If the guerrillas put forth a list of 200 guys for removal, it just won't  happen," a Western diplomat with close contacts to the government and the  military said the other day. "There will be absolutely no sweeping removal of  officers or trials."  </P> <P> This hard-line view was echoed by a military source who said, "Even if there  are some corrupt or bad officers, no one can expect the institution to accept a  purge list from the enemy."  </P> <P> The best that could happen, diplomats and government sources say, is the  gradual removal of some of the officers identified by the FMLN, but  unofficially and without a schedule.  </P> <P> "A year from now," the diplomat said, "the most notorious bad eggs will be  gone. . . . I think there is a corps of officers seen as corrupt, abusers,  etc., the majority of whom will be gone before an agreement is reached. The  government won't want to be seen as giving in to the guerrilla demands."  </P> <P> While this may appear to be a reasonable response, not even those who say it  could happen believe that it will be acceptable to the rebels, even though they  have backed steadily away from their original demands of political  power-sharing and the dismantling of the entire military structure.  </P> <P> "I'm not assured that the guerrillas will accept what they can get in these  talks," the diplomat said.  </P> <P> An associate added, "After 10 years of fighting and thinking they can win or  transform the society, I don't see them accepting an agreement that only gives  them the right to take part in politics."  </P> <P> Sources close to the rebels agreed, and said it is particularly true if they  perceive that the government is not serious about full political participation.  </P> <P> "For instance," one source said, "the guerrillas want basically to take full  political control of the area where they are strongest (about a third of the  country). That means they don't want any military or central government  presence. That way they can build an organizing base for quick electoral  victories and later expansion."  </P> <P> Government officials and some military officers say this is unacceptable, and  Washington has made it clear that it will not provide any development or  economic aid to areas from which the government is excluded.  </P> <P> Although the FMLN has indicated that political participation is now a major  goal, the issue of military reform is the controlling factor with the guerrilla  leaders.  </P> <P> This view was stated most forcefully by Schafik Jorge Handal, one of the top  five FMLN commanders, in a radio debate earlier this month. The guerrilla  movement, he said, "will not sign a pact ending the hostilities while the army  continues giving refuge to the beasts who ordered the blood bath in El  Salvador."  </P> <P> A Latin American diplomat who is privy to FMLN thinking said: "This is not just  boasting or something for effect in the talks. The commanders think they have  given up more than enough."  </P> <P> In addition, he said, the rebels think the United States should support them  since the U.S. Embassy here has said repeatedly, although not publicly, that it  wants to see military reform and the removal of the same officers targeted by  the guerrillas.  </P> <P> U.S. officials deny any commonality of interests with the rebels. They say that  although some officers have abused their positions, it is unrealistic to expect  what the FMLN is demanding.  </P> <P> These officials point out that it has been more than a year since reports  surfaced that officers to whom the embassy objected would be removed, but that  with few exceptions nothing has happened, even though the civilian president,  Alfredo Cristiani, supposedly agreed with the American position.  </P> <P> The optimism developed after the second round of peace talks ended in late  June, in Mexico City, and has been fed by reports that the army is willing to  give way on other rebel demands in the peace talks that were resumed Friday in  Costa Rica.  </P> <P> The army, besides indicating a vague willingness to permit the FMLN full  political participation, including organizing unions and similar support  groups, is also leaking reports of agreement in theory to proposals to separate  the nation's various police forces from military control and to reduce the army  from its current force level of 57,000 men.  </P> <P> "What is going on here," a Salvadoran political expert said, "is a developing  momentum that is slowly reducing the FMLN's options as the government makes  concessions that really don't touch on the final issue, which is the role the  military will actually have if the war ends. Some people say this is the way  negotiations work as one side or the other takes advantage of its strength and  tries to protect its weakness. I think on the government side it is more a  question of deception masking a belief that if the rebels won't give in in the  talks, they can be defeated militarily."  </P> <P> No government official will publicly acknowledge that he believes this, but  European diplomats said that some officials, particularly some army leaders,  have indicated in private that they think the guerrillas were so badly hurt in  last November's offensive that they can no longer mount a serious military  operation.  </P> <P> Many diplomats agree that the rebels are going to be faced with an unpleasant  choice: accept a peace that does not meet their most basic demand or resume a  war that has not achieved anything resembling military success or political  power.  </P> <P> U.S. officials say they are not assuming that the guerrillas are beaten.  </P> <P> "They have the ability to fight, to cause damage for a long time," one said.  "But as time goes on, events are leading to a precluding of options."  </P> <P> "If that is what they believe," a source close to the guerrillas said, "they  are probably right, but that shouldn't lead to the conclusion that the FMLN  will give in. In fact, just the opposite. If you remove all their options  except surrender, they won't."  </P></p>

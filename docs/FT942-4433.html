			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Brown scares dollar Comments from Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, enlivened an otherwise quiet day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, write Philip Gawith and Motoko Rich. Speaking in Paris, Mr Brown told reporters that there was a 'serious problem' in the bilateral relationship between the US and Japan. His remarks caused the dollar to fall by nearly 60 basis points against the yen to Y103.60, and by about 30 basis points against the D-Mark to DM1.6680. It later recovered to finish in London at Y104.030 and DM1.6698, compared to Tuesday's Y105.235 and DM1.6695 close. In New York the dollar ended at Y103.95 and DM1.6684. In the UK, sterling finished little changed at DM2.5163 from DM2.5159 as European election worries offset a strong set of production figures. Elsewhere, concern about a possible 'no' vote in Sunday's Austrian referendum, on joining the European Union, weighed on the Swedish krona. Sweden is also hoping to join the EU. In Germany the Bundesbank cut the repo rate by five basis points to 5.10 per cent, while the Belgian central bank lowered its central rate to 5.10 per cent. Although the dollar finished the day firmly, the market's skittish response to Mr Brown's comments showed residual nervousness about the US currency. Coming the day after a combative statement from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, it aroused fears that the US administration might not have fully shaken off its 'dollar debasement' policy. Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays, said the officials' comments reminded the markets that they had overestimated the 'apparent relaxed attitude' of the US administration on trade with Japan. 'The markets got over-euphoric over the past couple of weeks,' he said. 'But the super 301 locomotive is still rolling slowly through and everything is not all hunky dory.' Supporting a bearish case for the dollar were reports that most Japanese traders who attended last week's Forex 94 conference in London were gloomy on dollar/yen. Mr David Sumners, a managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said there was a feeling Japanese exporters still had lots of dollars to sell, that short term speculators were all long of dollars, and that the Japanese trade surplus would not disappear in a hurry. But Ms Jane Edwards, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said real interest rate differentials between the dollar and the D-Mark could offer support to the US currency in coming weeks. She added that there were increasing stories of money flowing out of European bonds and into US Treasury bonds, and this capital inflow should lend support to the dollar. Underpinning these flows is the fact that Treasury bond yields remain fairly high, while second-quarter data on the demand side suggests the US economy might be slowing towards a non-inflationary rate of growth. If this is correct, US bond yields could fall and this would encourage a capital inflow. In Europe the main focus of attention was the upcoming Austrian referendum. Concern that the Austrians might vote 'no' has caused the Swedish krona to weaken recently. But the Swedish currency ended barely changed yesterday at SKr4.754 per D-Mark. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said the referendum should have 'very little direct implications' on the European currency markets. But Mr Luxton said fears of a 'no' vote in Austria were already making the Swedish krona vulnerable. He added that in anticipation of poor Swedish inflation figures being released today, the markets had 'geared up for a bit of a sell-off in the Swedish krona'. To some extent, though, the markets were knocking on an open door. The krona was already weak on market fears that the government, faced with an election in September, would not be able to apply the requisite mix of fiscal and monetary policies. Analysts say a fiscal tightening is necessary to curb the 10 per cent budget deficit, but this needs to be accompanied by lower interest rates if the recovery is not to be snuffed out. The government, however, finds itself boxed in because it is difficult to cut rates against the backdrop of a weakening currency. Ms Edwards commented: 'I do not see a way out that is under the control of the Swedes at the moment.' The futures markets were calmer after their recent gyrations. The December short sterling contract traded 29,000 lots to finish at 93.79 from 93.78. The December Euromark contract closed at 94.81 from 94.73. German call money rates eased to 5.05/5.15 per cent from 5.10/5.20 per cent after the repo. Traders are not, however, expecting any shift in official rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 357m liquidity after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. The overnight rate moved between 4 and 5 1/4 per cent.</p>

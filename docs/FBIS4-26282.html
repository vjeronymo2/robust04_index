			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First part of a serial report on the Nansha Islands, </F> entitled "The Pillboxes Are Linked With the Motherland," by  station reporters (An Jinglin) and (Xiong Zengyan); from the  "News and Press Review" program]    [Excerpts] [Begin station introduction] Dear listeners, the  Nansha [Spratley] Islands, located at the farthest end of the  vast expanse of China's maritime territory, are the southernmost  of the South Sea islands. The islands spread out about 400  nautical miles from east to west and 500 nautical miles from  south to north in the waters, and cover numerous coral reefs and  beaches as well as an enormous area totaling 820,000 square km,  about the size of eight Jiangsu Provinces. They form an  important passage linking the Indian Ocean with the Pacific  Ocean, and serve as China's largest tropical fishing ground as  well as treasure islands of petroleum and natural gas resources.  The Zengmuansha basin is reputed to be a second Persian Gulf.  As the Nanshas are close to the equator, fresh water is  extremely scarce on the islands. Not a single blade of grass  grows on the reefs; and the year-round scorching sun makes life  unbearable. There, officers and men of the Navy's South Sea  Fleet have overcome extraordinary obstacles and created the  Nansha spirit, an epitome of patriotism. Recently, a group of  station reporters went to Nansha on a news-gathering assignment.  They visited pillboxes where naval officers and men were  stationed and wrote a serial report in the form of travel notes.  Today, we will broadcast the first part, which is entitled "The  Pillboxes Are Linked With the Motherland" and is prepared by  station reporters (An Jinglin) and (Xiong Zengyan). [End  introduction]    Where are the Nansha Islands, and how far are they from the  mainland? The big transport ship that took us from Zhanjiang  Port on the Leizhou peninsula to the Nanshas sailed nonstop for  more than 50 hours. The South China Sea in April and May was  the honeymoon season of the year. The sea was as smooth as a  mirror. Only school after school of flying fish occasionally  jumping out of the water alongside the ship broke the monotony  of the vast expanse of water and sea. According to a naval  comrade who accompanied us, it was a rare good time of the year  because, in a few days, the South Sea could become stormy and  turbulent.    As we landed on the first island, the (Zhudi) reef, we saw a  Chinese map circled with six big characters reading "Motherland  in My Heart," in addition to rotating radar antennas atop white  pillboxes. A Chinese couplet written with red paint on the two  sides of the gate to pillboxes said: "Fulfill one's aspiration  in the remotest corner of the earth by safeguarding the (Zhudi)  reef; link one's heart to the motherland by forever defending  the national gate." The island, a terraced reef, did not have a  single inch of land above ground. Even at low tide, the terrace  is still partially submerged. Naval officers and men, who are  stationed year-round in the lone pillboxes surrounded by the  immense sea, can neither watch TV nor listen to radio; and even  a letter back home cannot be delivered smoothly. However, all  fighters were full of patriotic enthusiasm. The wall papers and  couplets put up in the pillboxes and flowers meticulously  planted by fighters revealed their sentiment of affection for  the reef, the sea, and the motherland.    Each and every reef stationed with officers and men had its  own couplet. One of the entries to a couplet contest sponsored  by the Fiery Cross Reef officers and men said: "The small reefs  should not be taken lightly as their safeguarding concerns 3  million square km of water; without the reefs, 200 million  households will (?become defenseless)." In this way, the  couplet revealed the lofty aspiration of officers and men in  safeguarding the motherland's territorial rights and interests  over the 3 million square km waters for the security of 200  million households throughout the country. To officers and men  guarding the reefs, the motherland is of paramount importance.  The (Chihua) reef officers and men nicknamed their daily  workout of running around the pillboxes the Nansha-Beijing  10,000-li run. Officers and men stationed on other reefs  responded by pledging to complete the distance of the run before  the 45th founding anniversary of the PRC.    Although what officers and men saw from the pillboxes were  a vast perennial expanse of sea, they never missed the solemn  flag-raising ceremony even for a single day. They raised their  hands in front of the flag and pledged to link the reefs with  the motherland and defend the flag on the reefs. Wall and board  papers put up inside the pillboxes were full poems written by  fighters describing their noble sentiments. [passage omitted]    On the Fiery Cross Reef, political commissar (Zhang Wanhua)  told us about martyr and first-class merit citation recipient  (He Zhenghui): On the eve of the Spring Festival in 1993, when a  squad was performing duty on the reef, the weather changed  suddenly. The wind was blowing hard and the wave surging up the  reef. Fighter (Zhang Yangmin), who was walking at the front,  tripped and was swept off by a giant wave, falling into a  trench. As (He) witnessed the scene, he bravely jumped into the  trench and dragged his comrade-in-arms out of danger. (Zhang)  was saved, but (He) was swept away by a strong wave into the  ocean. He died at the tender age of 20. While sorting out the  martyr's belongings, his comrades-in-arms discovered an  unfinished letter. The letter said: Father, if your son would  become a martyr for the motherland, you should use the pension  to seek treatment for your bronchitis and Mother's rheumatic  headache. The remaining money will definitely be not enough to  help Elder Brother find a bride, but can be used to repair the  roof.    As we listened to the soul-stirring story and saw the white  pillboxes standing erect above the sea, we searched for the true  meaning of patriotism in the Nansha Islands. The answer is  found in the pillboxes and the sea.</p>

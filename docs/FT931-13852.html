			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / German solidarity pact wins crucial support of IG Metall GERMAN chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans for drastic government savings and higher taxes to bolster the east German economy ran into a barrage of criticism from left and right yesterday. But his plans to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with employers and trade unions, centred on the savings package, appear to be on course, with crucial support coming from IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering workers' union. The federation of German industry (BDI) backed the cuts in public spending, but attacked plans for tax rises as creating new economic uncertainty. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and chief architect of the annual DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) cuts, is expected to present the deal to the Bundesbank today. While he warned against hopes of immediate interest rate cuts from the central bank, he said the package should have a 'positive' effect on future decisions. In another move seen as hopeful in negotiations on the solidarity pact, which would open the way for a relaxation in the bank's monetary policy, two leading state premiers agreed to co-ordinate their negotiating positions. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat leader in the eastern state of Saxony, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Social Democrat premier of the Saarland and deputy leader of the opposition party, agreed on a joint strategy at a surprise meeting in Dresden. As the rest of the Social Democrats, and most of the German media, expressed consternation at the government's proposed cuts in social spending, and abolition of tax allowances, as well as a DM10bn increase in the 1993 budget deficit, the insiders in the talks were far more sanguine. A spokesman for IG Metall welcomed several main concessions from the government, spelt out in the federal consolidation programme published on Tuesday. They include a willingness to preserve east German enterprises in order to restructure them, even if they cannot be sold by the Treuhand privatisation agency by the end of 1994, as well as an increase in investment subsidies for business in the east. Another important concession welcomed by the union was the agreement to raise oil taxes in 1994 to finance the debt burden of German railways. One element of the package was abandoned last night in talks with the parliamentary parties backing the government coalition, when Mr Waigel agreed to drop a plan to means test children's allowances, and instead cut 'education' payments made to all mothers of new babies. But leaders of the opposition SPD claimed that the package was still 'socially imbalanced'.

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Bush nominee advises against Iraq prosecutor THE retired former New Jersey judge hand-picked by the Bush administration to examine whether a special prosecutor should be named to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by administration officials in US dealings with Iraq yesterday said there was no need for such an appointment. Mr Frederick Lacey, a 72-year-old judge appointed to the bench under President Nixon, concluded there had been no wrongdoing in officials' handling of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal. The judge's conclusions ignited criticism by leading congressional Democrats, who called on President-elect Bill Clinton to investigate the 'Iraqgate' affair once in office. Judge Marvin Shoob, who presided over the BNL Atlanta case, yesterday said he was surprised and disappointed by Mr Lacey's recommendation because there was 'ample evidence not only of a cover-up, but of government participation that was improper'. In remarks that at times sounded like an apologia for the Bush administration, Mr Lacey claimed that 'many decent people have had their careers tarnished and their reputations stained by being charged with being part of a cover-up. These are baseless charges.' Mr Lacey, echoing the view of Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general who must decide on a special prosecutor, termed congressional charges of a cover-up 'arrant nonsense'. Judge Lacey's defence of the administration was curious as he informed Mr Barr on October 26 that there were 'sufficiently specific and credible allegations' to extend his inquiry. Instead, Mr Lacey yesterday blamed congressional Democrats and the media for being irresponsible. Mr Lacey, derided by some congressional critics as a 'patsy' for the Bush administration, also gave his verdict on admissions by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials that they deliberately concealed from prosecutors in Atlanta reports about the involvement of BNL's head office in Rome. He claimed these were 'a series of mistakes by well-meaning and well-intentioned persons'. Mr Lacey served until 1985 as a member of the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive body that makes decisions about authorising wiretaps and other intelligence matters. Mr Jack Brooks, the conservative Texas Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee which originally demanded a special prosecutor, yesterday called upon the new Clinton Administration 'to see that justice is done' in the investigation of US dealings with Iraq. During the presidential campaign Mr Clinton supported calls for a special prosecutor and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, said the Iraqgate affair was 'bigger than Watergate' and required investigation.</p>

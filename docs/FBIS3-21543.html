The federal government spokesman highly evaluated the  Ukrainian Supreme Council's decision and the trilateral  statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents which  cleared the way for Ukraine's nuclear-free future. Ivan  Piskovyy emphasized that Ukraine and its leadership now need  political, moral, and financial support which would make the  implementation of the nuclear disarmament program possible.    These purposes, the ambassador said, could be served, among  other things, by an international nuclear disarmament bank in  Ukraine, an idea which was once put forward by Ukraine President  Leonid Kravchuk. The German side was handed a draft agreement  on setting up such a fund.</p>

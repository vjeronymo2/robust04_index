			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Monday Interview: Venerable enemy of dogma - Teddy Kollek, mayor of Jerusalem, speaks to Hugh Carnegy In 1967, during the Six Day War, Teddy Kollek had to dodge artillery bombardments to visit anxious citizens. Then, as now, the mayor of Jerusalem, Kollek says he had little time to take in the momentous consequences of the unfolding battles of the war, which began and ended with such dazzling speed 25 years ago next month. It did not take long, though, for the euphoria of victory to infect Kollek and sweep the country. The war opened early on Monday June 6, when Israeli jets devastated the Egyptian air force in a series of lightning strikes. By the following Sunday, Israel had completed its stunning reply to months of threatening Arab rhetoric and actions by capturing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank and east Jerusalem from the Jordanians. A quarter of a century, six prime ministers and three wars later - more than half the life of the modern state of Israel has passed since - Israel still holds all but the Sinai. But the heady assurance of 1967 has long since dissipated. The expected peace never came. Instead, there was a bitter internal debate about whether to cede more 'land for peace', or hold on stubbornly to all the remaining territories in the face of Arab hostility and international condemnation. The debate goes on unresolved and unabated, the focus of the campaign for the June 23 general election between the ruling Likud party, which would give no ground, and the opposition Labour party which advocates compromise. But it is by now a weary, over-rehearsed argument. As the anniversary celebrations of the 1967 victory get under way, Teddy Kollek confesses that the desire for a simpler solution sometimes flashes through the mind of even a 'dove' like himself. 'You see, sometimes you think: 'Wouldn't it be a good idea to have another war to show them that they can't stand up to us.' You remember suddenly how in 1967 on every Arab house there was a white flag . . . Why not bring this back? You have to catch yourself and realise that this is a silly idea.' Now approaching his 81st birthday, Teddy Kollek is a venerable figure in Israeli public life. First elected mayor of the Jewish half of the then-divided city in 1965, he has outlasted many governments. He has signalled that he will step down at the end of his current term in 1994. But for the time being, he is the last senior public figure of the old Labour ruling establishment still in office, tilting angrily at the dogmatic policies of the Likud and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Teddy, as all Israelis chummily call him, is now so identified with Jerusalem that it is easy to overlook his previous roles at the heart of Israel's creation and development. An enthusiastic young Zionist in Vienna, where he was brought up, he emigrated to British mandated Palestine in the 1930s, where he became a Kibbutznik farmer on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. During the Second World War, he was an agent in Istanbul, receiving some of the first chilling intelligence about the Holocaust from contacts in Nazi Europe. He went on to head an illegal arms procurement operation in New York for the Zionist pioneers, sited over the Copacabana nightclub. In the 1950s, he headed the office of Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. Ben Gurion, the driving force of Israel's early years, was a towering figure to Kollek. The mayor tells a story to make a timely point about his abiding influence. A few days after the 1967 war, by which time he had retired, Ben Gurion visited the newly-recaptured western, or Wailing Wall, the holiest Jewish shrine in the Old City. At Kollek's apartment later, many guests were proclaiming that the Arabs would now surely capitulate to Israel. 'But Ben Gurion said immediately: 'The Arabs will not make peace. They are a proud nation. We cannot give them back Jerusalem. This is the history of the Jewish people. But everything else - or practically everything else - we should give back as quickly as possible.' Well, he didn't convince anybody.' Kollek regrets that few were listening. He has remained loyal to the Ben Gurion line throughout the past 25 years. 'We should hold on to what is absolutely necessary for our security and this is much less than we talk about. I'm for giving up land because I don't want to rule 1.7m Arabs. Not to rule this multitude is an advantage for us, not a disadvantage. We may do the Arabs a favour as well. There is no harm in that.' But what about Jerusalem itself, the tortured heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict? Here, perhaps, is Kollek's 'blind spot'. Unquestionably, through his personality and extraordinary range of international contacts, he has overseen a great wave of development since the wall fell in June 1967 and Israel annexed the east side. 'It is a better city now,' he insists. He has done much for the development of facilities for the city's 150,000 Arabs. He has tried - in vain - to persuade them to join the city council. Their votes have helped him stay in office. He has fought bitterly against provocative moves by Likud leaders to settle Jews in Arab areas of the Old City. Kollek is prepared to devolve more administrative power in the city to Arab 'boroughs'. But he will not countenance any compromise of Israel's claim to exclusive sovereignty over all Jerusalem, something very few in the international community have ever recognised, the Palestinians utterly reject and which has helped make the issue of the city a huge obstacle on the path to peace. In Jerusalem, Kollek speaks of the Arabs, who are heavily outnumbered by the city's 350,000 Jews, as a 'minority', denying that they are any longer part of the West Bank, and, by implication, part of a Palestinian people who would make up a Palestinian state. He can therefore say, contrary to conventional wisdom, that Jerusalem need not be a great stumbling block to peace. But Kollek's conviction that Israeli control of Jerusalem must never be shaken is perfectly in step with the thinking of the vast majority of Israelis. It is not seen by them as any kind of paradox with his views on what to do about the other occupied territories. 'What is happening now is against all our interests,' he says of the policies of Mr Shamir's government. 'The Jewish settlement activity of today (in the West Bank and Gaza) is not directed by the priority of how to settle immigrant Russians and Ethiopians and how to provide work for them. The first consideration is how to fulfil God's promise to Abraham. If we try to carry out that promise we will fail and we will fail in our desire to make peace.' Likud politicians are inclined to proclaim that the threat to Israel's existence is still a real one when they argue for holding on to the occupied lands. Kollek says there is still much genuine insecurity among Israelis as a result of the Holocaust experience. But he emphatically dismisses the notion that Israel could yet be wiped out. 'Not at all, not at all. But we shall still have very difficult times. I'm not certain that we shan't have another war.' He clearly believes the chances of that will be increased if Likud wins the election. He tells a cautionary tale about the Maronite Christians of Lebanon. 'I have a story, which you may know, the story of the Lebanon. Here you had a small Christian enclave and then along came the French. This Christian enclave felt superior to the Arabs and with the French they created Grand Liban, including the Druze and the Sunnis and the Shias and everybody. It was something exhilarating at the beginning. Here, suddenly, instead of a small enclave, was an important country which the French supported. And you saw what the results were. I think it is a lesson for Israel.'

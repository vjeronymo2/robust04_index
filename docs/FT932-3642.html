			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Better times at the Fairs - Off The Wall / A good week at Grosvenor House ONE OF the more diverting scenes of an English summer is to watch the queue of millionaires snaking outside London's Grosvenor House waiting for the doors to open for the private view of the annual Antiques Fair. Why they are in such a frenzy is hard to imagine. Are they really fighting over Constable's 'The Wheatfield', on offer at Agnews for Dollars 6m; or the life-sized statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Country Seat priced at Pounds 54,000; or a rare signed Book of Hours of 1310 that Sam Fogg is selling for Pounds 300,000? Well, yes, actually. The first man into the Fair rushed to the stand of new exhibitor Grace Wu Bruce and bought a Ming folding chair for Pounds 150,000. He was one of the many Far Eastern dealers and collectors in the throng, which was encouraging for the exhibitors since this is the the region that seems set to dominate the art market in the foreseeable future. First stop for the Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Hong Kong buyers in town was Eskenazi's new gallery of oriental art in Clifford Street ,where his exhibition of 'Early Chinese art from tombs and temples' was nearly cleaned out on the first day when 28 of the 48 items were sold, including four each priced at over Pounds 1m. By Thursday he had sold 32 objects valued at more than Pounds 10m. Oriental art still attracts traditional western buyers, too. So while a Japanese museum paid over Pounds 1m for a bronze and silver ox of around 350 BC, a marble votive stele of around 450 AD went to the Cleveland Museum for Pounds 1.3m. The grave goods that orientals are loath to buy, such as Tang horses, have western fans, such as the American collector who acquired one for over Pounds 1m. The first reactions from Grosvenor House dealers was that business this year, while still sedate, was a little brisker than last. Down the road at Olympia there was a surge of optimism when first day attendances clocked in 40 per cent higher than last year. Then came the hot weather, a falling off in numbers and a return to reason, but even so on Monday, when dealers re-stocked stands for the final six days, chairman Leslie Weller reckoned he supervised the biggest inflow of antiques since 1988. Trade is definitely picking up, but as one dealer who has just completed his financial year complained: 'My turnover is 20 per cent higher but my profits are still non-existent'. Buyers know they are in the driving seat. There are more signs of better times. The William Weston Gallery sold 24 of its 27 Matisse etchings in two days, and at this week's auctions, while there is little interest in the mundane, the exceptional fetched good prices. Sotheby's had its best total, Pounds 6m-plus, for a sale of Victorian pictures, and disposed of an Alma-Tadema for Pounds 1.4m. It also managed Pounds 925,500 from a Chinese bronze food vessel, and Pounds 496,500 yesterday from a Louis XV secretaire by van Riesenburgh. And yesterday Christie's put the cap on an encouraging week with a Victorian picture auction which brought in Pounds 5.8m and was 91 per cent sold. It set a new record for Alma-Tadema - Pounds 1.65m for his spectacular 'Roses of Heliogabalus', as well as artist records for Waterhouse, Strudwick, Meteyard and Marcus Stone. At last it looks as if the worst is over for the art world. * * * Down at London's Chelsea Harbour something is stirring at last. The place is being invaded not by shoppers, or diners, but by sculptures. The most important sculpture exhibition in the country for almost 20 years has brought 60 installations to the site, including works by Glynn Williams, Elisabeth Frink, Allen Jones, Lynn Chadwick, Michael Kenny and more. The massive exercise is being underwritten by P &amp; O, developers of the site. It has put up Pounds 250,000 towards the cost, making it one of the largest one-off sponsorships. As well as attempting to resuscitate Chelsea Harbour the exhibition is also lifting the Royal Society of British Sculptors off the floor. This distinguished body had fallen on hard times, with membership lapsing to under 200 working sculptors. Now an energetic president, Philomena Davidson Davis, is turning it round. The Canary Wharf show includes works by sculptors who should join the RBS - and might if its revival continues. Most of the pieces are for sale at prices ranging from Pounds 6,000 to the Pounds 160,000 for a jeu d'esprit by Niki de Saint Phalle. Compared with our morose painters, and their bleak vision, sculptors tend to be jolly people who are working well. Glynn Williams, head of sculpture at the Royal College of Arts, reckons all his 18 new graduates this year will be gainfully employed as sculptors, even if most of their commissions come from overseas. In total the output of UK sculptors has been valued at around Pounds 400m a year. Most of the work goes overseas. But there is a revival in outdoor sculpture in the UK. The biggest commission in London, three sculptures, valued at Pounds 250,000, to decorate the approaches to the Limehouse Link road to Docklands, has just been unveiled. All told there are now more than 40 pieces of public art in Docklands, and you can trace them through a new art map. Last week the Art in the City Sculpture trail opened in the City of London, and this week the Arts Council-British Gas Working for Cities awards were announced, in which the Art in Public Spaces prize went to the Wakefield Cathedral Precinct. Contemporary art may be hitting its head against a brick wall of popular indifference but sculptors, who have moved beyond the abstract, seem to be more in harmony with the public mood.</p>

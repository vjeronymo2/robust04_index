			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS ;  </P> <P> DOW OFF 5.49 FOR 7TH STRAIGHT DROP  </P> <P> Stock prices fell in slow uneventful trading Monday, as the market took a  breather to await fresh news on the economy.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 5.49 points to end the day at  2,376.47, its seventh consecutive decline. The blue chip indicator has lost  42.52 points since April 28.  </P> <P> The market opened lower on a carry-over from Friday's last-minute selloff and  in response to a weaker bond market ahead of this week's three-day Treasury  borrowing.  </P> <P> Prices drifted lower during the session as many big participants withdrew to  await new data on the economy.  </P> <P> "The market is resting, consolidating with a little profit taking," said  Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp. "It's waiting  for more evidence about what the economy is going to do."  </P> <P> The government is scheduled to report on retail sales and producer prices later  this week.  </P> <P> Analysts said the market is concerned that producer prices could show that  inflation is still a problem, which could lead to further credit tightening.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 969 issues down, 504 up and 485  unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.13 million shares, down from  180.81 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in  those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled  158.70 million shares.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks climbed to a sixth straight record close Monday. The Nikkei index  rose 180.25 points, or 0.53%, to a record close 34,135.24. It was the sixth  straight record close for the Nikkei average and the seventh straight gain.  </P> <P> In London, stocks skidded in late trading Monday to end the day with a loss.  </P> <P> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 13.2 points, or  0.6%, at 2,119.6, its lowest level of the day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar rose broadly in brisk U.S. trading as Federal Reserve intervention  proved ineffective in deterring buyers.  </P> <P> Gold prices fell in the United States, reversing course after rising modestly  overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at  $375.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $1.60 lower than Friday's late bid.  </P> <P> In U.S. trading, the dollar ended at 1.9097 marks, up from 1.8977 on Friday,  and piercing what was described as an important technical threshold of 1.90  marks. It was the highest closing level since August, 1988.  </P> <P> A variety of factors fed the dollar's advance. Key catalysts were comments by  the president of West Germany's central bank and the fact that the dollar  remained above levels identified as significant from a technical standpoint,  despite Fed intervention.  </P> <P> Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl indicated that the dollar's value against  other major currencies is a matter being decided by the markets and countries  that would have to live with the decision.  </P> <P> Speaking in Basel, Switzerland, after a regular meeting of the Group of 10  central bankers, he said the dollar's strength is remarkable given the trade  imbalances among leading industrialized countries.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers interpreted his remarks to imply that government  monetary authorities are unlikely to act aggressively to influence the dollar.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at  $376.90, down from $377.70 on Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Copper futures prices tumbled on New York's Commodity Exchange following an  unexpectedly large increase in warehouse stocks of copper reported by the  London Metal Exchange.  </P> <P> On other markets, palladium surged while gold and silver prices slipped; energy  futures plummeted; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; cattle futures  dipped, and pork prices advanced.  </P> <P> Copper settled 2.7 cents to 5.2 cents lower, with the spot contract for  delivery in May at $1.259 a pound and the most active contract, for July  delivery, at $1.216 a pound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> A strong dollar and a reassessment of the government's latest employment  figures pushed bond prices lower.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, or $3.75 for every $1,000  in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,  rose to 8.99% from 8.95% late Friday.  </P> <P> Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International Inc., said  the market declined on a belief that a government report showing civilian  unemployment up 0.3 percentage point at 5.3% was less positive than initially  interpreted.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 9.75%, up from 9.8125% late Friday.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 10.  </P></p>

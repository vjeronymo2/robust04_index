Korableva, Institute of Natural Resource </F> Management and Environmental Problems at the Ukrainian Academy  of Sciences, Dnepropetrovsk; UDC 574.5+502.3(282.2)]    [Abstract] Comprehensive uses of the Zaporozhye reservoir  accompanied by a heavy man-caused burden due to agroindustrial  agglomeration increase the urgency of the task of assessing the  ecosystem's capability of assimilating the ingress of  contaminants and determining the level of their environmentally  permissible concentrations. In particular emphasis must be  placed on assessing the constantly increasing intake of heavy  metals which accompany man-caused pollution due to their  mutagenic, teratogenic, and toxic effects. A formula for  calculating the environmentally permissible or critical  concentration of the contaminating elements is derived, and the  year-to-year dynamics of heavy metals in the Zaporozhye  reservoir, their Clark values, and concentration in the  water-soluble fraction, the year-to-year dynamics of bottom  sediment contamination in the Zaporozhye reservoir with heavy  metals and their Clark values, and concentration in the  water-soluble fraction, and a calculation of the ecologically  permissible copper concentration and assimilation capacity of  the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem for Cu are summarized. The  analytical critical Cu concentration of 9.0 g/l is lower  than  the commonly accepted MPC in the fishery industry (10.0). The  findings show that the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem is at the  limit of its ability to assimilate man-caused copper  contamination. Tables 3; references 35.</p>

Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition  government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now,  according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff,  22 terrorists were being arrested every day.    Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state  penitentiary would be moved to another prison.    He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions  in Turkish prisons.    He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in  the province where they were sentenced, the government should  increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas where terrorism  was most intense, because transferring prisoners was both  difficult and dangerous.

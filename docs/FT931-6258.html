			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthened by a sharp recovery in sterling GERMAN government bonds rose sharply yesterday on hopes of a cut in official interest rates by the Bundesbank on Thursday, dragging other European bond markets in their wake. UK government bonds were further helped by a sharp recovery in sterling, prompting longer-dated gilt price to rise by a point. The yield on 10-year bunds fell to 6.66 per cent as prices jumped by half a point. The yield had broken below 6.75 per cent only last Friday, having stood at 7 per cent two weeks ago. Comments made after the weekend meeting in London of G7 finance ministers were the cause of the continuing enthusiasm for German bonds, analysts said. The beneficial effects of the German wage round, completed at the end of last week, had already been reflected in market prices. However, several observers warned that the rally had been so strong in recent days that little short of a 50 basis point cut in official German interest rates this week, and a significant reduction in the Repurchase agreement rate, would meet the market's hopes. 'It's difficult to see what the Bundesbank can do to satisfy these expectations,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Global Markets. LONG-DATED gilts jumped by a point as sterling bounced from its recent lows, prompting speculation that foreign investors would soon start to return to the market. There was further encouragement from official figures which showed that banks and building societies in the UK increased their holdings of gilts by Pounds 2.9bn during January, to Pounds 11.4bn, as the steepening sterling yield curve made longer-dated bonds more attractive. This was likely to encourage the UK government to amend its funding rules to allow such purchases to count towards funding of the government's borrowing requirement, analysts said. The strong rise in gilts prompted the Bank of England to issue four further tranches of tap stock, weighted towards the longer end of the yield curve: Pounds 400m of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998, Pounds 250m of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002, Pounds 250m of 8 3/4 per cent bonds due 2017 and Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2013. With market observers generally revising down their forecasts of the current year's borrowing requirement in the wake of good figures for January, such sales are likely to eat further into next year's PSBR. OTHER European bond markets jumped on the hopes of a German rate cut and an easing of tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. French government bonds rose almost as sharply, though the yield spread between French and German bonds widened out slightly to around 90 basis points. With elections later this month, the political risk presented by French bonds was likely to keep the yield spread against Germany at least at current levels, analysts warned. An auction of French OATs later this week would also limit the gains on 10-year bonds, said Mr Philip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. US TREASURY prices moved broadly higher yesterday as the market paid more attention to the morning's purchasing manager's report than to Friday's explosion at the World Trade Center. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 higher at 103 21/32 , yielding 6.831 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 to yield 3.858 per cent. Volume, however, was light, reflecting the absence of the Cantor Fitzgerald inter-dealer broker screen, which was knocked out in Friday's bomb blast. In addition, some dealers reported having trouble settling Friday's trades Bond market investors were encouraged by a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management which showed a drop in the business activity index to 55.8 in February from 58 in January. The decline was steeper than expected.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Bluebeard's Castle and Erwartung - Opera in Toronto Bartok's one-acter and Schoenberg's 'monodrama' are both couple dramas, even if in Erwartung one member of the couple is missing presumed dead. Both, too, gradually reveal a past in which other people - specifically, other women - were involved. Both look back to that past across a chasm of incomprehension: they are crisis pieces, both dating from the time of musical crisis around 1910. And both are operas in which the essential action is interior. They fit together well, if, as in the Canadian Opera Company's new production at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto, the longer Bartok piece comes before the exploded, shattered Schoenberg. They also, as a pair, provide an apt and stimulating occasion for the operatic directing debut of Robert Lepage. The Bluebeard's Castle is not so unusual. The spoken introduction is wisely cut; instead there is a great gilt frame around the stage picture to tell us that what we are seeing is a parable, and to enforce a visual connection with the companion piece. The first images within the frame are striking: a miniature gothic castle rotating in darkness and distance, and then - once Bluebeard and Judith have gone into the picture after delivering their first lines from in front of the frame - an oppressively gloomy, severely square-sectioned tunnel or corridor, coming towards us from a faintly lit portcullis entrance, with the seven doors along the left wall and unbroken masonry along the right (designed by Michael Levine). So far, so good. But the stage inventions for the openings of the doors are disappointingly tepid: a patch of flame-like light for the torture chamber; for the jewel house, a handful of pearls which, in a limp gesture, Judith scatters; a projection of planet earth for Bluebeard's domain; a lake of tears that Judith can coyly dabble her hand in. Only for the final opening does the production heat up, as Bluebeard's three former wives seem to rise up through the tear lake, though what drenches their wedding gowns is blood. Here too the orchestra, under Richard Bradshaw, begins to sound excited, especially in the climactic passage where Judith takes her place with her predecessors. Before this the sound is dim and disconnected, and devalued in the domains sequence by a weedy organ. Yet the vocal performances are excellent: Jane Gilbert is a noble Judith, determined and always richly voiced, and Victor Braun sustains a grey lyricism as a Bluebeard scarred and numbed by experience, never believing he can escape his fate. If this Bluebeard could almost have been staged by anyone, the Erwartung comes at us observed by a very special eye. Mr Lepage takes advantage of having three supernumeraries for Bluebeard's earlier wives to increase the dramatis personae of Schoenberg's solo opera. When the performance starts, in silence, the unnamed Woman of the score is cowering by the bare wall left over from Bluebeard, while a man in a white coat sits ready to take notes. One's heart sinks at the prospect of an 'explanation' of Erwartung as a psychoanalytic session: that was where the piece began, in the experiences of the librettist Marie Pappenheim as a medical student in turn-of-the-century Vienna, not where it ended, or should end. However, the realism is only there to be turned into the chilled, poised surrealism of Lepage's production, which demands, and gets, feats of gymnastic control from his extras. The next time we see the psychiatrist - the set repeatedly darkens to focus on the Woman allowing nimble scene-shifting - he is calmly sitting sideways on, as if the wall were a floor, while another man, later identified as the Woman's lover, dangles alarmingly through a hole in the wall from one heel. The mesmerising glide from image to image takes account of what specific elements there are in the libretto, such as the Woman's reinterpretation of her lover's corpse as a log in the forest through which she imagines herself searching. There are also echoes of the Bluebeard staging: Judith rolls rapidly down the stage away from her husband; the lover's naked body makes the same journey slowly, anxiously followed by the Woman who has just lashed at him with a scythe. But more generally the response is to the strangeness and fluidity of the music, to its intensity, its sharp, glistening focus. Even though Schoenberg's own designs for the piece suggest something dark and indistinct, this clinically accurate askewness, this language of dreams, is right on target. Contact between the stage and the score is further assured by Rebecca Blankenship's imposing performance as the Woman, and by the orchestral playing, which is so much more alert than in the Bartok, and which, in its delicacy touches the lunar beauty of Schoenberg's music. The double bill goes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York this week, and to Edinburgh in the summer</p>

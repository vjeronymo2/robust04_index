			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Planned nuclear station 'a threat to coal industry' British Coal warns today that a planned nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast would displace up to 9m tonnes of coal a year, and it expresses strong doubts about the nuclear industry's ability to deliver electricity at the costs it promises. Nine million tonnes is a significant proportion of the coal industry likely to survive into the early years of the next century, the soonest the new station, Sizewell C, could come on stream. Some coal industry analysts believe that total output of the coal industry by 2000 is likely to be under 40m tonnes. British Coal's warning, in a submission to the government's nuclear review, represents a strong rebuff to Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two main nuclear generators. They have argued that the coal and nuclear industries are a good environmental fit and that gas-fired generation is the cause of coal's contraction. Nuclear Electric has already applied for planning permission to build Sizewell C, subject to the outcome of the nuclear review. Nuclear Electric argues that Sizewell C's electricity will replace power from Magnox nuclear stations, due to be retired over the next decade. British Coal says that past decisions to invest in nuclear power have been based on optimistic forecasts 'which were subsequently seen to have been misplaced'. Nuclear Electric, in its submission to the nuclear review, said it could produce electricity from the 2,600MW Sizewell C at 3.7p per unit assuming an 11 per cent return on capital. British Coal says the likely economic cost of Sizewell C could be 5p or 6p per kilowatt hour. 'Without government underwriting, risk-averse investors would undoubtedly seek a higher rate of return, even if they would invest at all. The resulting estimates of generating costs would be much higher (than 6p).' British Coal's analysis suggests that a new 'clean coal' power plant could offer a power cost of 3p to 4p a unit. Smaller stations could produce at less than that. British Coal argues that there are no compelling reasons for the government to back a new nuclear plant on grounds of diversity, security of supply or environmental considerations. The nuclear companies have conceded that new plants would need government support if they were to go ahead. British Coal argues that if the government departs from its free market principles it should defer any decision until the performance of Sizewell B, on which Sizewell C will be modelled, can be evaluated. Sizewell B is expected to start producing electricity later this year.</p>

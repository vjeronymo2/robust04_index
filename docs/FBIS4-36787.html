			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has expressed surprise at the interpellation submitted  by a People's Assembly member against him regarding violations  of human rights and maltreatment of citizens and lawyers.    In his answer to the interpellation by independent deputy  Kamal Khalid this evening, the interior minister said that Egypt  enjoys the brightest era of democracy and its prudent leadership  is now sponsoring a national dialogue to shape a safer, more  stable, and prosperous future. He noted that calls for the  protection of human rights are out of place in Egypt, adding  that those who make such calls are encouraged by foreign  quarters.    The interior minister pointed out that what the government  has done to provide security and safety cannot be ignored,  adding that preserving security and stability is our duty. He  noted that the government, using legal and decisive measures,  has confronted a conspiracy concocted by a group of wrongdoers  who have deviated from the correct path and thought that they  could undermine the people's accomplishments. The government  has succeeded in curbing the threat of terrorism, he added,  noting that the security agencies' measures against it has  reflected the will of the people and that the verdicts passed by  the Egyptian judiciary categorically condemned terrorism and all  those who advocate it.    The interior minister pointed out that in 1993 and the past  months of 1994 the Interior Ministry's agencies have thwarted a  serious threat against society, legitimacy, and the security of  the homeland and the people. During this period, he added, 257  terrorist cases involving 1,802 terrorists have been uncovered,  thanks to the sound scientific planning, high-level performance,  and extraordinary efforts of policemen. He noted that the  interpellator's claims of violations of human rights are a clear  omission of the facts and of the evils of extremism. He added:  Let me remind the interpellator of the guarantees provided in  the Constitution regarding human rights, the protection of the  people's security and stability, and the procedures followed in  prisons, which are under the full supervision and control of the  judicial authorities.    Minister al-Alfi referred to the statement issued by the  majority of members of the Lawyers Association in which they  denounced the attempt by a few members who belong to the Muslim  Brotherhood to control the association, adding that these  members support terrorism. He noted that the interpellation  refers to incidents involving some arrested lawyers. He added  that these incidents are being investigated by prosecutors, who  have decided to remand the defendants, 12 of whom are not  lawyers, in custody. He asked: Did the deputy submit his  interpellation because the government is doing its job in  implementing the law and respecting the judiciary? He added:  As for the question of the arrested lawyers, it falls within  the jurisdiction of the judiciary. Al-Alfi noted that the  memorandum attached to the interpellation elaborated about the  question of mediation between the government and terrorists.  The minister asked: What mediation does it refer to and why at  this particular time? He added: The question of mediation  between the government and terrorists has long since been  settled; there is no room for mediation between legitimacy and  illegitimacy. In the face of extremism and those supporting it,  there will be nothing but extremely firm legal confrontation  without hesitation, he added.    The interior minister spoke about the circumstances  surrounding the recent death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. He said  that investigations into and information about the explosions in  some banks proved that the dead lawyer played a major role in  the illicit activities and that he received organizational  instructions directly from the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam.  The prosecution issued a warrant for his arrest. The defendant  was arrested in his house in al-Haram and informed of the  prosecution's warrant. Upon searching his home in al-Haram, a  number of important papers were found.    He said that when the late lawyer was taken to his other  house for it to be searched, he suffered from difficulty in  breathing and was taken to al-Manyal Hospital for first aid  treatment; he died there. The diagnosis showed that the cause  of death was a severe asthmatic attack.    He noted that some defendants admitted the organizational  role the dead lawyer had played; he was the direct link with  Tal'at Yasin Hammam for transmitting orders among the leaders of  the organization from inside and outside prison. He exploited  the nature of his work as a lawyer.    He also received funding from the organization amounting to  45,000 Egyptian pounds, with $3,000 to spend for organizational  purposes.    The interior minister said that the brother of the dead  lawyer, Salah Madani, also belongs to the terrorist organization  and is a defendant in one of the terrorist cases.    On the action by the Lawyers' Association after the lawyer's  death, the interior minister said that we monitored some  suspicious moves by the association that increased day by day,  even after the official announcement about the circumstances  surrounding the death. In fact, some lawyers tried to contact  other associations for incitement purposes, but these did not  respond. Hasan al-Alfi added that we are sure that there was a  premeditated attempt to create sedition and riot. In  particular, a number of people who gathered on the streets threw  bricks and stones from behind the fences. After that, a number  of the people walked out on the street. In addition, the police  received information that some lawyers were armed.    The interior minister repeated that the security organs were  quite tolerant of all the practices that were considered wrong,  especially since most of the legitimate means were open to the  lawyers and association members to make their demands known and  pose their questions. But a small group of members violated  legitimacy by attacking the regime.    He pointed out that 48 individuals were arrested, 12 of whom  were not lawyers. The prosecution charged them with many  things, such as participating in a criminal act with the  objective to commit crimes of mobbing, demonstrating, attacking  the authorities, hampering them in performing their duties by  using force and intimidation, organizing a demonstration against  the law, as well as spreading false statements to disturb public  peace and possessing publications that incite demonstration.    The interior minister affirmed that no extraordinary  measures  were taken to confront the situation. The entire situation has  been presented to the investigating bodies. He added that no  one is above the law, despite the fact that the defendants are  lawyers. He clarified that there is no alternative to  legitimacy and that every violation will be firmly confronted  with force.    However, false allegations will not terrorize us and we will  not back down on our responsibilities before God and the people,  he added. We shall not hesitate because our unwavering option  is Egypt itself.    The interior minister noted that 120 defendants have been  arrested in connection with the terrorist organization connected  to the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam.    The People's Assembly then proceeded to discuss its agenda  upon a request signed by 35 members. The Interior Ministry was  thanked for its efforts.</p>

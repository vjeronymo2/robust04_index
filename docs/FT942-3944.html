			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Haiti declares emergency as UN sanctions tighten Haiti's army-backed government has declared a state of emergency after the tightening of economic sanctions against the Caribbean nation and amid intensified rumours of impending foreign military intervention to remove the military and reinstate Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president. The announcement of the emergency by Mr Emile Jonassaint, recently appointed head of the government by the army, coincided with an attempt by several thousand Haitians and hundreds of foreigners to leave the country before the termination of commercial flights, one of several new sanctions against Haiti, takes effect. The US and Canada say they will end commercial flights to Haiti on June 25 to increase pressure on the military rulers who took power in a coup 30 months ago. France is also expected to end commercial flights, but it is not yet known whether other countries which have air links to Haiti, including the Netherlands, Panama and the Dominican Republic, will do the same. In a further show of defiance, the Haitian military said it would close the country's main airport in Port au Prince, the capital, and several smaller airfields, five days before the new sanctions takes effect. Foreigners have been told by their governments to leave Haiti quickly, and several governments are also evacuating family members of their diplomatic staff. Most of the Haitians who have been purchasing tickets to leave the country are children and women who are being sent abroad as the tighter sanctions take effect. Concerns about public safety increased over the weekend after the military seized guns from several US marines entering the country. US officials said the marines were assigned to duties at the US embassy in Port au Prince, as part of a normal rotation of guards. The imposition of a state of emergency will not change the situation in the country. The military and its police arm have been exercising powers in a virtual state of siege since economic sanctions were put into effect soon after the coup. Diplomats in Port au Prince said yesterday the declaration of the emergency, and decision to close airports before the June 25 deadline, were part of the military government's display of defiance of efforts to have Mr Aristide returned.</p>

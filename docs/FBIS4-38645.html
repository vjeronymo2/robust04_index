			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga May 28 TASS -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs admitted his former contacts with the KGB. His  confession on 50 type-written pages is published by the DIENA  newspaper on Saturday.    It is mostly devoted to a story on the years of his studies  at school and Institute as well as of work in medicine and as  foreign minister since October 1992. Andrejevs gave "agreement  to supply limited information on his profession" to "a  recruiter" in 1963 when he was chief republican  anesthesiologist.    The confession is written in the form of an open letter to  voters, friends and legislators. Parliament suspended  Andrejevs' mandate after his name, as well as the names of other  lawmakers, were found in the catalogue of KGB agents.    Addressing the Sejm, Andrejevs asked it to vote for  preserving of annulling his mandate [as received]. He also  noted that the Sejm should express its attitude to the post he  holds: To leave him in the ministerial chair or to express  no-confidence.    The letter's author did not recognise himself guilty and  noted that, to his mind, "appropriate political forces in Russia  and, possibly in Latvia, did not wish his participation in the  signing ceremony of the intergovernment treaties in Moscow.    His negative attitude to the agreement on Russian war  pensioners "did not pass unnoticed by enemies in Latvia and in  the neighbourhood." According to Andrejevs' opinion, this is  one of the reasons for making public five names of lawmakers.       He said it is an absurdity that former leading statesmen  whose privileged position had precluded, at that time, a  possibility of their registration at KGB files, "can again, with  impunity, occupy top political posts and not only in the Sejm"  and seal the fate of other "suspects."</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Apartheid was officially banned in Namibia, keeping to a U.N. independence  timetable that designated May 13 as the day when South African-inspired laws  discriminating by race should be scrapped. However, South African and U.N.  officials say it will be about six weeks before all apartheid-related laws are  repealed. For example, town councils, school education, health services and the  national pension scheme are still racially segregated. Meanwhile, South  African-led army and paramilitary police forces returned to their bases, ending  searches for fighters of the South-West Africa People's Organization. The  rebels entered Namibia on April 1, just as the U.N.-backed independence plan  was getting under way.  </P></p>

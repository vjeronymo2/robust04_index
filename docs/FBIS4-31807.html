			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Colonel General Momcilo Perisic, </F> commander of the General Staff of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia Army, by Svetlana Petrusic; place and date not given  -- recorded]    [Text] [Petrusic] Good evening, esteemed viewers.  According to a decision of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's  [FRY] Supreme Command, 16 June has been proclaimed Yugoslav Army  Day and it will be celebrated for the first time this year.  Prompted by this, we asked Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff  Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic for an interview.    General, at the beginning of our conversation I would like  to  congratulate you on the holiday. August will mark the first  anniversary of your appointment as chief of general staff.  [Word indistinct] one of the youngest generals at the head of  the army, among the army leadership. Tell me, what are your war  experiences?    [Perisic] Yes, the war found me in Zadar, in the post of  commander of the Artillery Training Center. The Artillery  Training Center was situated in a facility that was not  convenient for training and molding future officers because  antagonism in the environment was evident to the extent that  freedom of movement was limited. Later, when the situation had  escalated, and when the Yugoslav Army, that is, the Yugoslav  People's Army [JNA] was proclaimed to be the occupying force in  the region of Croatia, clashes broke out which drew the army --  despite its wishes and will -- into the war. Of course, in  Zadar -- where we possessed immense knowledge, extremely capable  people, and top-of-the-line technology -- we had to accept this  war only after the lives of people who were there became  endangered. Since I headed the training center, and since I was  trained to nurture the greatest responsibility, the most humane  responsibility which involves caring for the people I am  responsible for, I -- together with these people -- had to  oppose them because their lives were in danger [sentence as  heard]. And of course, in the course of opposing them, since we  were far superior in terms of training and technology, we won  and forced the Ustasha units to comply with all the conditions  we had set them. They complied with these conditions, and even  engaged their people for many things [sentence as heard].  Therefore, we left Zadar together with all the hardware,  personal property, and the entire education material base  [nastavno materijalna baza] and mobile infrastructure. We did  not leave anything for the Ustashas. Of course, after leaving  Zadar, the Artillery Training Center was relocated to Sarajevo,  and after the new education center was installed, I was  transferred to eastern Herzegovina and appointed commander of  the Bileca Corps, which later evolved into the Herzegovina Corps.    Consequently, since I had already learned the war lesson, I  undertook a series of preventive measures to avoid putting the  people of eastern Herzegovina -- that is, the people who  accepted the JNA as their own -- in a position similar to the  one we had been in in Zadar, that is, in the region of Croatia.  Of course, thanks to the extremely high degree of awareness of  the Herzegovina people, the Montenegrin people, and the Serbian  people -- which at the time aided the armed struggle and  provided the material backing for it -- we succeeded in  defending the area from the onslaught of the Ustasha hordes, and  in saving material goods. I stayed there until the FRY was  constituted, and until the JNA was ordered to withdraw from  those areas to the FRY.    [Petrusic] Your friends say that you are a modest and  decisive man, which became evident in this war. With this  experience, you were appointed to head the Yugoslav Army General  Staff, at a time when Yugoslavia is in peace and is striving for  peace?    [Perisic] If professional soldiers were to decide in matters  of war and peace, they would always opt for peace, because it is  professionals who know best what war entails and what it takes  away, that is, how extensive material destruction can be.  Unfortunately, soldiers were never the ones to decide whether  there was or was not going to be war, and of course, as a  professional army, we carried out the orders of the state  structures and implemented political decisions.    [Petrusic] General, what forms the basis of the new process  of establishing the Yugoslav Army, the new Yugoslav Army, and  what is the doctrinal approach to the country's defense?    [Perisic] The transformation and the establishment of the  Yugoslav Army is primarily based on state control over national  defense, that is, All National Defense [Opste Narodna Odbrana],  and on the new military doctrine and all other positive  regulations. The essence is for us to remain masters in our own  home, which means defending the territorial integrity of the FRY  people, that is, Serbs and Montenegrins, and all other national  minorities because this is a civic state. It is important to  maximally develop the defense capability of society as a whole,  and particularly the combat readiness of the army, not in the  sense of deploying this army outside the FRY borders, but rather  as one of the possible ways of deterring any aggressor from  undertaking measures that would endanger the country's security.    [Petrusic] You mentioned the transformation of the army.  Tell me, in what phase it is now, and what is your view of the  transformation?    [Perisic] The transformation of the Yugoslav Army is based  on a series of realistic factors that we examined studiously and  then -- in terms of quality and quantity -- dimensioned the army  in such a way that it completely corresponds to our doctrines,  that is, so that it provides protection for our country's  population. We primarily had in mind the real danger  threatening us from abroad; furthermore, we had in mind our  realistic material potential, human resources, and birth rate.  In addition to this, we needed to dimension the JNA -- which  actually provided the basis for creating the Yugoslav Army -- in  such a way that, through organizational and structural changes,  in a new environment, we could create units that in peacetime  are capable of preventing surprises, yet at the same time  flexible enough to create, in wartime and in a short period of  time, a massive army. Of course, the transformation of the army  is an ongoing process, a process that encompasses everything  from organizational and structural changes, to the modernization  of weaponry and equipment and the army's visual identity.    [Petrusic] A good part of the military industry remained on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Could this present a  problem for us today, for the military industry of the FRY?    [Perisic] Certainly, the loss of territory and installations  of the military industry is a problem for the current Yugoslav  Army and the overall defense capabilities of society. However,  by carrying out an organized evacuation, we managed to retrieve  most facilities and to salvage all our technical documentation.  Thus, parallel to carrying out the transformation of the  Yugoslav Army, we are also securing conditions in domestic  companies for the manufacture of equipment vital for waging an  armed conflict.    [Petrusic] There was mention of our industry's new  weapons. Can you say something about this? What type of  weapons are we talking about?    [Perisic] Well, the modernization refers primarily to  modernization of the combat training system and supplying the  army with new hardware, that is, weapons and systems. In the  course of this period we managed to replace or substitute the  manufacture of equipment we used to have until recently, either  by modernizing or by utilizing collective scientific knowledge  in order to develop new systems that substitute the systems we  used to manufacture, but with far better features, that is, with  far better combat specifications.    [Petrusic] I believe that the need to defend the country is  greater than ever. Is the budget adequate to this need?    [Perisic] Since our country is under economic blockade, and  since a war was waged and is still being waged on the territory  of the former Yugoslavia, all this has had an adverse effect on  our general economic potential, and thus also on the Yugoslav  Army. Anyone who forgets the connection between the country's  economic potential and the financial resources earmarked for the  Army is being unrealistic. That is why the budget earmarked for  the Yugoslav Army precisely correlates to the amount society  could set aside and that is 7.43 percent of the estimated  national product.    [Petrusic] General, there has been criticism of the new  Yugoslav Army that it has retained certain features of the army  of the former Yugoslavia? What is the basis for such opinions?    [Perisic] Since our country has introduced a multiparty  system and since many leaders would like to have an army  tailored to their wishes, consequently, not all of these wishes  can be fulfilled. The most dangerous thing for the Army, any  army in a multiparty society, is to have a political party  interfering with the Army's personnel policy. Therefore, the  fiercest criticism is precisely directed at the fact that the  Army -- through the process of transformation -- has been  depoliticized, thus creating a barrier preventing parties from  influencing the Army's personnel policy. Moreover, we devote a  lot of attention to the Army's personnel policy and perhaps the  greatest contribution to the Army's transformation is that we  now appoint extremely capable people to command the units of the  Yugoslav Army -- people who posses a high quotient of knowledge,  capability, dignity, and pride, and who are ready and capable of  foreseeing events and making decisions appropriate to both the  combat readiness of their particular unit and our society's  overall potential.    [Petrusic] You once said that a good commander was one who  does not surrender and does not allow himself to be deceived?    [Perisic] One of the very important things in the education  and training of officers was, and still is, to ensure that they  are extremely honest toward their own people and their troops,  yet at the same time extremely cunning with respect to the  enemy. I usually say that you must have a multitude of faces  for the enemy, while you must have only one face for your own  soldier and your people. It is only in this way that an officer  can succeed in motivating and leading people in carrying out  orders, in peacetime and particularly in wartime. However,  unfortunately, owing to incorrect training of officers in the  JNA, all of their capability was directed at training them to  organize themselves and lead the army in a way designed to  defend the country from external enemies, not counting on the  possibility of an internal enemy. Because they were naive, many  of them acted in a way they should not have. Of course, in the  course of this civil war, starting with Slovenia through to  Bosnia, many officers were not up to their duties, and they got  what they deserved. I would like to stress that every unit of  the JNA that was headed by a capable officer lost neither  manpower, hardware, nor surrendered. Everything that the Croats  and Slovenes accomplished, they accomplished through deceit,  certainly not through armed combat.    [Petrusic] How much attention is devoted today to the  issue of patriotism?    [Perisic] Patriotism is a quality that develops and grows  throughout one's life. The extent to which this is developed in  the educational process is reflected in the Yugoslav Army. It  is a very important quality, I might even say virtue, in the  Yugoslav Army, without which an assignment cannot be  successfully carried out. Therefore, in some important aspects,  the officers -- and I particularly stress this -- must be proven  patriots. This means that an officer is ready to help his  people in their most difficult moments, that he is in a position  to share the people's fate, and that he is ready for the  greatest sacrifices. We have had many such officers throughout  our history. We had them in both World War I and II, and even  in this war, and -- owing to their high degree of patriotism --  they ultimately succeeded in defending the people who accepted  them as their own.    [Petrusic] How important is it for all of us -- not only the  Army -- to defend national interests? To contribute? Is this  generally the case in society today?    [Perisic] The degree to which the FRY's social structures  are ready to defend their country should be tested in practice,  yet that it impossible without war. Since we are fighting for  peace and not for war, we actually cannot discuss this without  drawing on the conclusions and experience gained by the people  in the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina in  the course of their resistance. Therefore, we know that there  is a high degree [of readiness to defend their country] over  there. The resistance encompasses all structures of society and  both armies; they succeeded in carrying out all tasks.  Unfortunately, many structures have, in a certain way, isolated  themselves because they resorted to the line of least  resistance, which is why we have a lot of people both from the  republic of Serbian Krajina and the Srpska republic, that have  moved to other areas, where they lead a comfortable life and  often boast that they are helping their people, yet the truth is  they would help them most if they were with them. This applies  equally to all structures, and particularly to intellectual  structures.    In addition to this, there is a number of relevant factors  that -- owing to ignorance or intentionally -- prompt people to  criticize their own army because they do not see it as their  own. They have forgotten the lesson of history that says that  it is always better to have and feed thousands of one's own  troops, than a single foreign troop.    [Petrusic] NATO and the United States troops are in close  proximity to our territory. As a military expert, can you give  me your interpretation of their presence, their presence in  close proximity to our territory? Can this presence threaten  our security, and to what extent?    [Perisic] You know that NATO is an alliance created to  protect the interests of its member states. Therefore, it  certainly ought to be in the service of all these countries  equally. However, it has opted for serving the interests of  only one country which is the architect of the new world order.  Theretofore, it is quite clear that it has been abused in a  certain sense, and after all, its raison d'etre after the  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact is pointless, unless it wishes  to continue doing what it is doing now.    Many NATO operatives have been stationed in the vicinity of  the FRY with the aim of supporting the forces that were actively  involved first in the disintegration of the Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, and are now actively involved in the  attack on the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Serbian  Republic. Since they are in the immediate vicinity -- I mean  the operatives -- they are indirectly threatening the security  of the FRY. However, we need to know that they have not come  here only to help the secessionist forces, but also to create  pressure on our country. Our country is under a multifold  blockade; on the one hand, it is under complete economic  blockade, and on the other hand, it is surrounded by NATO  vessels that are in a certain sense threatening the security of  the FRY.    [Perisic] We have lots of experience because, throughout  the four-year-long war fought by our fellow men outside the FRY,  we have been made aware that their presence can -- in a sudden  change of sorts -- bring into question the security of the FRY.  For this reason we have been implementing certain measures to  prevent any kind of surprise.    [Petrusic] NATO planes have been violating Yugoslav  airspace. After all, there are documents regarding this in the  United Nations. Tell me, what is the tolerance threshold and  your opinion on it. Why is this happening? They have been  warned.    [Perisic] The civil war on the territory of the SFRY  [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] started primarily due  to the influence from abroad, of course with a skillful  manipulation of internal contradictions. Since this civil war  is based primarily on religious, ethnic, and -- one would say --  other antagonisms, then the danger exists of it spreading to the  territory of the FRY according to a similar principle. Since  the creators of the new world order in their scheming had, of  course, not counted on the heroic resistance of the people in  the two Krajinas, they were in a way stopped, and that process  was thwarted. If we are united to the degree necessary for the  defense of one's own ethnic entity, then we can stop that  process. Bearing all this in mind, the FRY is optimally  committed to ending the war in Bosnia as soon as possible, and  in that respect is giving optimal support to all peace-loving  forces in the world toward preventing the spillover of the war  toward the East, that is, to this area.    [Petrusic] How do you assess the recent Navy exercises?    [Perisic] Although the Navy is going through extremely  difficult times because the infrastructure has remained on the  territory of Croatia, it has still managed in a relatively short  period of time to build enough of the infrastructure and  material base for a successful build-up of combat readiness.  Tactical exercises involving live ammunition were held to that  end, to test to what degree the Navy is capable and ready under  new conditions and with a new organization to defend the  territorial integrity of its theater of operations, that is, our  part of the coastline and territorial waters.    [Petrusic] Mr. General, they are constantly threatening us.  They have been threatening us with sanctions, they have been  threatening us with bombing. Is there any cause for fear?    [Perisic] Of course, when our social entity is endangered,  there has to be some kind of fear. However, we have been shown  throughout history and the present war fought by our fellow men  in the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Serb republic, under  extremely unfavorable circumstances, that for four years they  have been successfully defending their territorial integrity,  and that they have been resisting a far more numerous enemy  supported by the world media -- not only in the moral sense but  also logistically, even through the use of the air force. We  can conclude that in this region the Serbian and Montenegrin  soldiers and the Serbian and Montenegrin people, and other  ethnic minorities, are ready and capable of defending themselves  with, of course, the help of the Yugoslav Army.    [Petrusic] Vlada Popovski, defense minister of Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], has  recently said that the Yugoslav Army has been instigating  conflicts, and that the Yugoslav Army troops have been amassing  on the border. What kind of conflicts is this about?    [Perisic] As we know, Macedonia [as heard] has accepted on  its territory the UN forces, among which the U.S. troops are in  the majority. Of course, they are not there to protect the  Macedonian people but to form their own bases, and to help them  in securing the borders since the Macedonians have neither  troops enough nor material means enough to build a more modern  army. Quite frequently during this help in the border security  -- out of ignorance but most often out of misinformation as to  where the border exactly is, since the border is only  administrative, and not fixed -- the U.S. soldiers quiet often  stray and enter the territory of the FRY. Every such entry has  been registered, some have been prevented and even detained  without any incidents. However, since someone in the world  wants to turn any border violation into an incident, we have  often been accused of that. In that sense I have had several  meetings with the UN commander in Macedonia, warning him of the  frequent violations of the border, and he has been promising  that it would not happen again. However, I am not sure that  many of these violations are not deliberate. As for the  accusations that the Yugoslav Army has been amassing forces  along the border with Macedonia, that is a mere media lie.    [Petrusic] There have been similar accusations concerning  the border with Albania.    [Perisic] The border with Albania is somewhat different,  even though the borders with Albania and the western part of  Macedonia where the population is mostly Albanian is similar as  far as border violations are concerned, since young men from  Kosovo and Metohija and even the Raska region [Sandzak], that  is, Albanians and Muslims, are mostly avoiding serving with the  Yugoslav Army. However, since they have illusions about a  forceful secession, they have been sending these young men for  training to various centers abroad through various channels, and  upon their return -- to test their training and to bring in a  large amount of arms, they enter our country illegally -- and  now, since they are most often prevented by the members of  border units, there are incidents. [sentence as heard] These  incidents most frequently amount to their using arms when they  are stopped by our border patrols whilst crossing the border  illegally and, naturally, when someone tries to physically  liquidate our members defending our borders he is met with an  adequate response, and unfortunately these incidents frequently  end in serious consequences for those trying to cross illegally,  which again the world, which is not inclined toward us, has been  using very effectively in the media propaganda against our  country.    [Petrusic] The foreign media says that there is a  possibility of transferring the hot spot of war to Kosovo. This  is aided by the statements, for example, by Ibrahim Rugova, who  on his recent tour of Europe, in France, to be precise, asked  for a protectorate of the international community in Kosovo,  which implies the presence of a military force, that is, NATO.  To what degree is the Yugoslav Army today a factor of stability  on the south of Serbia?    [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army is a factor of stability of  Yugoslavia as a whole, and thus the stability in the region of  Kosovo-Metohija, thanks also, of course, to other elements and  the people's support. However, I personally believe that an  average Albanian, that is a Shqiptar in Kosovo, would never  choose the war options because he can see clearly enough what is  happening in regions where people are trying to resolve  something by force. Second, they can also clearly see what the  living standards of their compatriots in Albania are in  comparison with Kosovo. It suffices to climb mountains  bordering Albania to realize what a vast difference there is  between the economic might and standard of living of Shqiptars  on this and on that side of the border, for the Shqiptars in  Kosovo-Metohija live at least ten times better than their  compatriots in Albania. I believe that all they have been  creating under the fold of the FRY, in the former SFRY, and  Serbia today, is such material wealth that they would certainly  not want to lose in some showdown not of their own choosing, a  showdown that could be imposed by their leaders. But they were  wise enough not to have accepted this. If they had, they would  have lost so much. They are aware of this, so I do not believe  such a thing could happen. Even if it does, the army and  militia in Kosovo, as well as other social factors, will be  ready and able to defend the territorial integrity of the their  own country.    [Petrusic] The situation on the territory of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is very tense. How do you see the denouement  of the situation from the military-political point of view?  And, do you think that the Serbian Republic can defend itself  from an even greater aggression by the Muslim-Croatian  federation, and to what extent?    [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army and the FRY leadership are  making tremendous efforts through various international factors  and through political and military factors in Bosnia to effect  peace there as soon as possible, because we know that only  peace, not any kind of peace but a just peace, can put an end to  destruction and halt the suffering of all three peoples.  However, there can be no peace if all three sides are not  equally determined to achieve it.    Will there be fresh aggression, an offensive of wider  proportions?    I am certain that a major offensive is a realistic  possibility if the international factors that contributed and  even caused the civil war in Bosnia do not exert pressure on the  Muslims and Croats. I am sure that it will not be more  successful than the ones so far, and you know that all of them  ended in failure. The results of the fighting so far are after  all a clear picture of that. This proves that the army has done  whatever it could under extremely difficult conditions and has  successfully resisted all offensives for three years.    If these Muslim-Croat forces, the Muslim-Croat coalition,  were to be aided by certain international factors, especially  NATO, then the situation would naturally be by far more  difficult. However, I believe that the international community  will not allow such a thing to happen, and if it did, the  consequences would be disastrous, not only the for the people of  the Serbian Republic, but for the entire population of the  Balkans, Europe, and even further afield.    [Petrusic] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has said on  many occasions recently, as has Croatian UN Ambassador Nobilo,  that they would return Krajina into Croatia's borders and the  state system by force. What do you think about these threats?    [Perisic] In view of the fact that there has been a  political rift in the Republic of Croatia and that Tudjman is  losing ground, everything is possible. He could push the  Croatian nation into another war in a desperate attempt to hold  on to power. What the chances are to return the Republic of  Serbian Krajina into Croatia's borders by forces are perfectly  clear from the operations on its borders so far.    Even though they engaged the entire country with the help  from the international community in a war against a far smaller  nation, they did not manage to do anything. The Serbs have  managed to protect their territorial integrity and did not allow  deeper incursions to be made.    [Petrusic] We are all witnesses of a parties' struggle for  power. Even foreign powers are being called to help in this.  Can you tell us to what extent can this inter-party bickering  affect the Yugoslav Army and to what extent has the Yugoslav  Army protected itself from internal political divisions?    [Perisic] It is obvious that the unity of the country is  inevitably reflected on the unity of an army. The army is a  social category that in every country, ours included, to a  greater or lesser degree reflects developments in society. The  stronger the consensus between parties on vital issues of  importance for the survival of a nation, normally the more  positively this is reflected in the overall situation in the  army, particularly its combat morale.    The stronger the disunity, the stronger influence it has  over  the army, but as we have said, the army has been depoliticized,  it has gotten a well-built defense mechanism for the prevention  of such negative influences, I think that the party influence on  the overall combat readiness of the army is marginal.    [Petrusic] People talk about a professional army? Do you  think that a partial professionalization of the army has become  a necessity?    [Perisic] Every army in the world, including ours, is partly  professional, because we have permanent and temporary staff.  The permanent staff are officers, noncommissioned officers, and  civilians in the army. The temporary staff are soldiers doing  their military service. To be more specific, we are currently  involved in the process of turning the army into a professional  army. According to the number of the professional soldiers,  there are considerably more of them now than in the Yugoslav  People's Army. However, disproportion between the needs and  capabilities has also arisen in this sphere. This means that we  need to professionalize the army as much as possible, but  society's potential is small. This is, after all, reflected in  the budget, and we cannot have so many people, so many paid  soldiers, or as we say, we cannot have so many professional  soldiers on contract. Naturally, the level of  professionalization will grow with economic growth and the  increase of our country's general potential.    [Petrusic] Mr. General, can you tell us something about  the FRY Army's current level of combat readiness to defend the  country from possible aggression.    [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army peacetime force is qualitatively  and quantitatively completely equipped to prevent any surprises.  By evaluating and analyzing situations, it is always capable of  taking adequate measures to prevent any surprises, even under  the most adverse conditions. This means that only a very short  period of time is necessary to transform the peacetime force  into a war-time force of over 500,000 men, which is completely  sufficient to protect the nation from foreign threats of any  kind.    [Petrusic] And finally, a personal question. How strenuous  and difficult is it to be the chief of the General Staff of the  Yugoslav Army today?    [Perisic] It is not easy to be the chief of the general  staff of an army that, if I may say so, has inherited many  negative traits from the Yugoslav People's Army, nor is it easy  under the present economic conditions, in the present ongoing  war situation on our borders.    Had the conditions been any better, I probably would not  have  been given this job, but considering that the situation is very  complex, I came and accepted this duty for three important  reasons.    The first is to prevent, together with other elements of  society, a civil war in this region, as the enemy has created  such a scenario. According to that scenario, it has achieved  everything it wanted on the territory of the former SFRY, using  primarily the Yugoslavs in the realization of its aims. Using  the same principle, it wants to accomplish other aims in this  region. However, thanks to the substantial role played by all  factors, including the Yugoslav Army -- perhaps its role in this  is the most important -- we have avoided this civil war.  Naturally, the danger of that has not vanished, but I hope that  we will overcome that.    The second reason for accepting the post of chief of the  General Staff is that I wanted to prevent decent people -- who  are in the majority in the army, there are over 90 percent --  from being unjustifiably attacked by, for example, an  irresponsible military leadership. I think that we have had  much success in this, because I believe the current General  Staff gives no reason for other Yugoslav Army members to be  attacked because of our mistakes or some other omissions.    And the third reason I have accepted the post of chief of  the  General Staff is to help preserve the social character of the  Yugoslav Army and the social being of our nation that is now  more imperiled than ever before in its history. I think that,  together with other elements of our society, in which the role  of the media, and others, is not insignificant, and in which I  would say this role is very important, we can present the  Yugoslav Army for what it is and not present it as better or  worse than it actually is for various interests. One should be  completely objective, critically objective. The assessment of  the Army will help us a lot. Uncritical and tendentious  attitudes, which do exist, are hindering us in many ways.    [Petrusic] Mr. General, I wish you much success in  performing your current duties. Thank you for this interview.    [Perisic] Thank you. I would like to urge all the viewers  throughout the FRY to help their soldiers as much as they can to  overcome the problems that the Yugoslav Army and our society  face at present, and through firm and unbreakable links with the  Yugoslav Army, help it become an army that will certainly be a  guarantor of freedom and peace.</p>

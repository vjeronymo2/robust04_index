			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev flew to  Belgrade this evening. ITAR-TASS has learned from the Russian  Foreign Ministry that while in Yugoslavia he intends to conduct  talks on a Bosnian settlement. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian  president's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, will also take  part in the talks.    In an interview Andrey Kozyrev gave to INTERFAX before his  departure, he noted that it was inadmissible that UN  peacekeeping forces in Bosnia were becoming a target for  attacks. In his view, harshest measures can be taken to defend  them, including air strikes.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / William Hill debt refinance extended A meeting of the Brent Walker banks has given Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank more time to complete the refinancing of William Hill's Pounds 370m of debt. The lead banks have repeatedly missed deadlines to agree a refinancing of the loans which are due for repayment on March 1. They are said to be still a long way short of raising the money. However, one hardened follower of the Brent Walker saga noted that the banks had never met a deadline in the three years since the leisure and property group began talks with banks about a refinancing of the group. Lenders to Brent Walker fear that if William Hill were sold, the parent company's future would be bleak. Brent Walker's refinancing, finalised in March 1992, was based on the retention of two cash-generating businesses, the Pubmaster pub chain and the betting shops. Disposals of other activities have been slow to materialise. The Brent Walker board is believed to be anxious to retain William Hill rather than be forced by a failure to refinance into a float or sale of the betting shop business. Meanwhile, the merchant banks appointed in August to sponsor a possible flotation of William Hill have been unable to begin the pre-marketing process considered essential. It is understood that advisers, who had earlier said a decision on the float was necessary by the end of November, have now said it could be achieved if they got the go-ahead at the beginning of next year. The William Hill syndicate is in a strong position to demand repayment since the business is worth considerably more than the debt. Either a float, estimated to raise over Pounds 500m, or a trade sale for the Pounds 470m offered by a group of venture capitalists, would comfortably repay the loan. While the William Hill lenders could be persuaded to wait a few weeks for repayment, that deadline cannot slip far beyond the beginning of March.</p>

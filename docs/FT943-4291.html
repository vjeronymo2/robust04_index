			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coke survives the Sainsbury challenge Sales of Coca-Cola in J Sainsbury stores fell 15 per cent in the first half after the UK's largest supermarket chain launched its own brand of cola, according to Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, the Coke bottler, writes Roderick Oram. But overall sales to Sainsbury by CCSB, a joint venture between Cadbury Schweppes and Coca-Cola, were up 4 per cent in the first half thanks to higher sales of non-cola soft drinks, Mr Derek Williams, head of CCSB, said yesterday. Sainsbury, which had a weak position in the own-label cola market, unveiled its Classic Cola in late April to try to capture sales from branded colas. 'We've responded successfully to that challenge,' said Mr David Wellings, Cadbury's chief executive. 'Own label is not a new or terrifying phenomenon for us.' With Sainsbury's cola, 'we are talking only one product and one customer'. Only some 4 per cent of Coke's sales are to Sainsbury. Overall, Coke's UK sales volume will rise by about 8.5 per cent this year, Mr Williams said. Sainsbury said bottles of Classic Cola now accounted for about 65 per cent of the chain's bottled cola sales against 25 per cent before the launch. Cans accounted for about 55 per cent of can sales gainst 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] RIGA, May 16, BNS - The Latvian defense and other  security-related officials met with a U.S. delegation Saturday  [14 May] to discuss the further bilateral cooperation in the  security sphere.    The Clinton administration has asked the U.S. Congress to  extend financial resources to support the projected Baltic  Peacekeeping Battalion, Charles Freeman, U.S. deputy defense  secretary, told reporters after the meeting.    If the funding is allotted, it will be used for training and  equipment purchase, Freeman said.    Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis said the meeting  also touched on Latvia's involvement in NATO's Partnership for  Peace program, Latvian defense forces reorganization and  potential U.S. technical assistance to defense forces and Home  Guard.    The foreign assistance to the Latvian defense forces should  be based on clearcut plans and programs, said Pavlovskis.    American specialists mentioned the lack of uniform armament  and provision system as the main problem for the setup of  efficient Baltic defense forces. The Baltic military commands  will try to settle the problem, Pavlovskis said.    The U.S. delegation also toured the Latvian naval base at  Bolderaja and reconnaissance battalion at Suzi.</p>

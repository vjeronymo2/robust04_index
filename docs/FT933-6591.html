			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines meet demand as Dow peaks again Wall Street MOST US stock markets advanced further into record territory yesterday amid futures-related buying and continued strong demand for airline issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, all but one of the major indices were at record highs, although off their best levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13.13 at 3,652.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.36 firmer at 460.13 and the American SE composite up 1.22 at 454.42. The exception was the Nasdaq composite, which slipped 1.48 on profit-taking to 733.66. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 301.6m shares. Low interest rates, the lack of alternative attractive investments, and slowly building confidence in the economic outlook have been cited as the main factors behind the markets' recent record-breaking run. That run showed no sign of faltering yesterday, as heavy buying of stock futures and sustained demand for cyclical and other economically sensitive stocks continued to push share prices to new highs. Investor sentiment is so strong, in fact, that it can brush off seemingly bad economic news, such as yesterday's 3.8 per cent decline in July durable goods orders. That headline number, however, was not as bad as it looked, because the decline was entirely the result of lower aircraft orders: excluding the transportation component, orders actually rose last month. Investors were also cheered by good news from the housing market, where existing home sales rose 5.4 per cent in July. Airline shares were in demand after securities house First Boston raised its rating for Delta Air Lines from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. Delta climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 67 5/8 , USAir Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 and UAL Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 149 1/8 . Cyclicals opened firmer, but ended mixed. Ford was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 51 7/8 , General Motors closed steady at Dollars 46 3/4 and Chrysler eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 41 7/8 . Caterpillar, which led the market higher on Tuesday, added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 82 1/2 , while General Electric firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 99 and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 108 1/8 . Philip Morris was a notably poor performer, dropping Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 48 7/8 in volume of 7.5m shares after broking house Smith Barney Shearson lowered its rating on the stock from 'outperform' to 'neutral' because of the company's failure to increase its dividend. Toys R Us rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 in busy trading on press reports that the company plans to open Books R Us departments in its main toy stores following the success of a pilot scheme. Bell Atlantic advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 on news that a federal court had ruled that the company can enter the video-programming business. Canada THE Toronto market finally topped the 1987 all-time high, ending with a modest gain after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was up 10.7 at 4,122.9, surpassing the previous closing record of 4,112.8 registered on August 13, 1987. Volume came to 62.3m shares valued at CDollars 621m and rises led declines by 402 to 334.</p>

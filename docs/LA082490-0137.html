			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> AIRPORT CONTRACTOR MISSES A DEADLINE  </P> <P> Embattled John Wayne Airport contractor Taylor Woodrow Construction California  Ltd. missed Thursday's promised deadline for completing the new Thomas F. Riley  Terminal, with just three weeks remaining before scheduled airline use.  </P> <P> Pesky software glitches in the computer-controlled fire-suppression system  caused it to fail for the fourth time in as many weeks, making the $62-million  terminal ineligible for a required temporary certificate of occupancy.  </P> <P> Despite objections from Taylor Woodrow, airport officials have refused to  accept the building as substantially complete until the fire-control system  works. The rest of the terminal is complete, except for some minor cleanup  work, "tweaking" of the air conditioning and airline equipment installation,  airport officials said.  </P> <P> "We're concerned, but we think the problem is going to be solved in enough  time," said airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch.  </P> <P> Assistant Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier said the fire-control system is not  the only item Taylor Woodrow must fix before the county will accept the  building, but she said the others are "very minor" and will be done in the next  few days.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, for whom the new terminal is named, said Taylor  Woodrow's failure to meet Thursday's deadline "is a surprise, and I hate  surprises."  </P> <P> "I will take whatever action is necessary," Riley said, " . . . to have all of  the activities stay on schedule."  </P> <P> Riley was referring to a Sept. 4 media luncheon, black-tie reception Sept. 7,  public open house Sept. 8 and the terminal's first use by aircraft Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow Senior Vice President William L. Ostfeld defended the company's  performance.  </P> <P> "Since last December, we've worked toward a substantial completion date of Aug.  23," he said. "We have been testing the complex life safety and operational  systems for the past four weeks in the terminal. This week the fire marshal has  requested some minor modifications and we are making them. The building itself  has been substantially complete since Aug. 10."  </P> <P> The new, 337,900-square-foot domed terminal has been plagued by delays and cost  overruns since construction began in 1988.  </P> <P> After steadfastly denying that the terminal would miss its April 1, 1990,  opening, airport officials last December announced a postponement until Sept.  16. At the same time, Taylor Woodrow's Feb. 28, 1990, completion deadline was  extended to May 16 due to late steel deliveries. That contractual deadline has  never been changed and is the date from which late fines totaling $25,000 a day  will be assessed against Taylor Woodrow, pending further negotiations.  </P> <P> In May, county supervisors fired Taylor Woodrow from a $25-million garage and  elevated roadway contract for lateness, but also to pressure the firm into  finishing the terminal building quickly. Taylor Woodrow sued the county over  that contract loss. Also, the county forced the Irvine-based contractor to  adhere to a rigid set of conditions, and promised final delivery of the  terminal to the county by Thursday.  </P></p>

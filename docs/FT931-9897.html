			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / A meeting of suspicious minds: The tensions surrounding today's EC-US trade talks in Washington An air of apprehension hangs over today's trade talks in Washington between the European Community and the US, the first high-level meeting between the two partners since President Bill Clinton took office last month. On both sides, there is nervousness about how Sir Leon Brittan, the intellectual EC external trade commissioner, will cope with Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative and a shrewd deal-maker whose strongest card is that he has President Clinton's ear. The need to establish personal chemistry is important because EC-US relations face a rough passage, at least in the short term. In the first three weeks of the new US administration the EC has had to digest statements and actions in Washington which, though some were not initiated by the Clinton government, have heightened the already sharp European fears of trade conflict with the US. They include: A US Commerce Department decision to impose stiff anti-dumping duties on carbon steel products from 19 countries, including some EC members. A US threat to freeze out EC companies bidding for millions of dollars worth of US government contracts, because of objections to a EC utilities directive. Potentially more damaging is the hint that the US might withdraw from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's multinational government procurement code. The new administration's resistance to extending the fast-track negotiating authority beyond its expiration date on May 31. An extension of the fast track, under which the president offers completed trade agreements for congressional ratification without the opportunity for amendment by the legislature, probably offers the best prospect of wrapping up the six-year-old Uruguay Round of the Gatt world trade talks. There is some cause for optimism. Earlier this week the Canadian trade minister was advised in Washington that an extension would be sought. Sir Leon denounced the steel and procurement decisions as 'unilateral bullying'. He has also been frustrated by the administration's 'go-slow' tactics on the Gatt. Without an agreement, he believes, a faltering world economy risks missing out on an expansion of trade of between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 200bn. Failure to reach a Gatt deal would further weaken an already-strained framework for resolving trade disputes. EC apprehension stems partly from the change of power in Washington. President Bush was a known quantity, rarely allowing trade to dominate relations with Europe. He was adept at using threats of protection by Congress as a foil, warning allies that he represented the best deal on offer. President Clinton is an unknown quantity. His big theme is change; but his relations with Congress are untested. His obvious focus is domestic, or as Mr Kantor put it in his confirmation hearings: 'Trade policy is to be part of a co-ordinated and integrated economic strategy.' Some EC trade officials worry that this implies the entry of new players in Washington into the field of trade policy previously the preserve of a handful of politically insulated 'experts', such as Mrs Carla Hills, Mr Bush's trade representative. Particular concern centres not only on Congress but also on the writings of Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers and an advocate of 'reciprocity' in trade, and perhaps Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary and architect of tough 1988 trade legislation. Some hope that the discreet Mr Robert Rubin, running Mr Clinton's economic security panel in the White House, could be a counterbalance. This uncertainty explains why Sir Leon made a serious effort to reach an outline agreement on the Uruguay Round with the outgoing Republican administration. On January 2, four days before he formally took over his post, Sir Leon spent all day closeted with Mrs Hills. He offered sharp cuts in tariffs, prompting US officials to believe a large market-access package could be completed before the inauguration. What happened next is in dispute. EC and US officials in Brussels say the outgoing administration failed to respond with a serious counter-offer. In Washington, US officials say Sir Leon subsequently backtracked because of division within EC. Sir Leon now faces a fresh US team. It is an administration which, on the fragmentary evidence of its first three weeks, with so many policies at home and abroad subject to review and with so many senior positions still unfilled, is not about to be rushed. Nor is Mr Kantor, a man patient and clever enough to have faced down the ultimate negotiator, Mr James Baker, when the two determined the framework of last year's presidential debates. The key will be Mr Clinton himself. Those who know him well, like Ms Paula Stern, former head of the International Trade Commission, an independent regulatory body, are convinced that philosophically he is a free trader, which was indeed the balance of the evidence of last year's campaign. She insists Mr Clinton understands better than did Mr Bush that 'America's prospects are tied up with global prosperity'. In spite of the EC's fears about resurgent US protectionism, Mr Clinton's words on trade as president have so far been carefully measured. He certainly did not encourage the US auto industry's pursuit of anti-dumping remedies and this lack of support was probably a factor behind Detroit's decision on Tuesday not to proceed as threatened. Nor can new protectionist impulses necessarily be read into the steel tariffs ruling, imposed in the first week of the new government but long in train. Still, the US 'wait-and-see' approach to the Gatt is not without risk, not least because it could exacerbate several bilateral disputes already in the pipeline. The dispute over state support for Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft builder, may have temporarily been settled. But the EC remains angry over US taxes on European luxury cars, while the US-EC accord on agricultural export subsidies reached late last year, supposedly clearing the way for a Gatt deal, is still fragile. Above all, the steel and procurement rows, both of which Sir Leon and Mr Kantor must address today, underline the dangers of conflict. What irks Brussels is that the US steel duties include a 10-year period in the 1980s when the EC was operating under a global 'voluntary' restraint agreement with the US. The US action looks like a breach of faith, but it also represents an abuse of the wide-ranging US anti-dumping law to protect a cossetted industry, says an EC official. The dispute over the EC utilities directive is murkier. It allows EC governments to reject tenders where the non-EC content is more than 50 per cent. Also, preference is given to tenders where more than half the contents are EC-produced, even if the price is up to 3 per cent higher. Mr Kantor claims the directive blocks US access to government contracts; but EC officials see it as an important market-opening initiative and a centrepiece of the single market programme, allowing outside bidders to enter a business worth about Ecu50bn (Pounds 40.6bn) in telecoms and electrical equipment alone. One potential compromise is to drop temporarily the 3 per cent clause in return for reciprocal concessions under the US Buy America Act, a federal law which encourages domestic procurement. But the bilateral disputes cannot conceal the main task in front of Mr Kantor and Sir Leon. This is to establish a road map for a future Gatt agreement which includes tackling specific areas of dispute and a commitment to an early deal. Without such a commitment, says Mr Gijs de Vries, a Dutch Euro MP and close observer of US-EC relations, trade tensions will come to dominate the transatlantic alliance, putting at risk necessary co-operation in other areas such as bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia and helping reform in the former Soviet Union. The Clinton administration would not dissent from this view. But defusing trade disputes will not be easy in the current climate of suspicion on both sides.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuching (East Malaysia), June 24 (OANA/BERNAMA) --  The anti-palm oil campaign waged by certain quarters, especially  in the United States, is waning in the face of counter measures  taken by Malaysia, Palm Oil Promotions Council of Malaysia  Chairman Dr. Ani Arope said Friday.    He said the U.S. was beginning to see the advantages of palm  oil used for cooking, and the outlawing there of the no palm oil  labelling on canned and food products had helped.    Five years of intensive campaign by Malaysia has begun to  show positive results. The U.S., the biggest opponent of palm  oil at one time, is now using a lot of palm oil, he told  reporters after the launching of the palm oil week in this state  capital of Sarawak.    Ani said there had been no new attempts to oppose the use of  palm oil in developed countries.    Palm oil was poised for a golden era because it was far more  competitive than other types of cooking oils, he said.    Farmers in Europe and the U.S. can only get 0.5 tonnes of  vegetable oil per hectare of crops but we are more efficient  because one hectare of oil palm can yield 4.5 tonnes of oil.    Compared with soya beans, which have to be planted every  year, oil palm has the edge because it can last 25 years, he  said.</p>

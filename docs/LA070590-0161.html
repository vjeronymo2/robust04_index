			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE JOB;  </P> <P> FIREMEN ON CALL;  </P> <P> 'IF IT'S A CAR FIRE, A HOUSE FIRE OR A BURNT POT OF BEANS, THEY'RE READY.'  </P> <P> There was no time to spare. Roger Campbell, who had been awakened in the middle  of the night, scrambled up the stairs of a Fillmore apartment building.  Summoned by a woman in labor, he raced past his fellow firefighters.  </P> <P> His intuition, not to mention his agility, paid off.  </P> <P> "I went into a slide and caught the baby just as it was about to hit the  floor," Campbell, 39, said. "The father was there, but he was freaked. He was  useless."  </P> <P> That was seven years ago and it was the first birth Campbell witnessed during  his 17 years on the Fillmore Volunteer Fire Department. The second came this  last May when another woman failed to make it to the hospital in time. The baby  arrived just before the firefighters and, luckily, without any complications.  </P> <P> So it goes for Campbell, who divides his time between answering emergency  calls, helping decide the city's fate as a councilman and fixing cars. As one  of 20 men on the volunteer force, he is known to drop everything when a voice  on the radio squawks "Patrol 6."  </P> <P> "If I'm on the phone with someone who doesn't know what I do, I just tell them  I've got to go," he said "I don't do a lot of explaining."  </P> <P> And calls seem to come at the most peculiar times.  </P> <P> In 1984, during a heated debate among City Council candidates, fire bells rang  out while Campbell, vying for his first term in public office, was stating his  case. He didn't want to miss out on the forum, but he also couldn't sit still  knowing that a fire was threatening a nearby hill.  </P> <P> Sensing his anguish, the audience fell silent then broke into laughter.  </P> <P> "I didn't end up going, because we soon learned it wasn't that big of a fire,  but it was difficult for a few seconds," Campbell said. "It was a tough  decision."  </P> <P> As a newcomer to the City Council that year, Campbell skipped out on council  meetings to fight fires and respond to traffic accidents.  </P> <P> "I'm probably the only one who has gone to a fire in a suit and tie," he said.  </P> <P> Since 1911, Fillmore has received its fire protection from volunteers,  residents who have agreed to be on call 24 hours a day. For the first few  years, a couple of county firefighters lived at the station, which was then  located across from Fillmore Central Park.  </P> <P> When a fire broke out, the telephone operator would call the station and  announce the location of the fire, and one of the firefighters would run  outside and ring a big bell. In a town with only a few hundred citizens and a  dozen or so fires a year, using a bell to beckon the volunteers worked fine.  </P> <P> But as the town grew, the operation needed to expand. Three sirens were  installed in town to notify volunteers of an emergency, Campbell said.  </P> <P> And when they blared, Campbell said, it seemed that the whole town poured out  into the streets to see what direction the fire engine was headed.  </P> <P> All this public attention backfired on Campbell, who decided once to run from  his garage to the fire station a block away. Speeding past the opened doors and  curious faces, Campbell saw a small dog in front of him and realized that he  was going to have to step on the dog or tumble onto the sidewalk. He chose the  latter.  </P> <P> "I twisted my ankle, but with everybody watching, I was not about to start  limping. I kept running, with tears in my eyes," he said. "I walked with a limp  for a month afterwards."  </P> <P> In the summer of 1987, when the city began contracting for police service with  the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the town sirens were replaced with  radios, which are carried by each volunteer. The city's "911" emergency calls  are dispatched out of Ventura and relayed via radio.  </P> <P> Like his father, George, who served on the volunteer force for 30 years,  firefighting is a basic part of Campbell's life. In the showroom of his garage,  he has set up the Fillmore Fire Museum, complete with the department's 1926  fire engine, antique oxygen tanks, sirens and helmets.  </P> <P> Fire Chief Pat Askren said the department relies heavily on Campbell's  experience.  </P> <P> "He's so busy that he's spread thin," said Askren, who is Campbell's  brother-in-law. "But he's willing to drop everything when I need him. He's the  one we really depend on."  </P> <P> For his firefighting efforts, Campbell is paid $75 a month to cover the cost of  cleaning his uniform, another $75 a month because he is an emergency medical  technician and an additional $200 for his role as assistant fire chief.  </P> <P> "It sounds like a lot of money, but it isn't when you consider the time that  goes into it," Campbell said. "Nobody does this for the money."  </P> <P> In fact, Fillmore couldn't afford to pay for full-time fire protection. It  would run four to six times the amount of the department's $111,250 annual  budget, said Mayor John Murphy.  </P> <P> "I don't even see where the monies would come from. We barely squeaked through  with a balanced budget this year," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Campbell is proud of the Fire Department, which received a 4 rating (on a scale  of 1 to 10, with 1 being the best) from a private company that inspects fire  departments for insurance rate-setting reasons. With an average response time  of 2 1/2 minutes, they improved their 1975 score by two marks.  </P> <P> Dorothy Haase, who has worked since 1974 in the building that houses the  Fillmore Historical Museum, can't believe how quickly the firefighters assemble  at the station on Main Street.  </P> <P> "They used to blow the siren from City Hall and they would all come running. It  amazed me how quickly the fellow would get on the truck and get started," Haase  said. "Now that they do it by radio, I just hear a bunch of cars rushing up and  see people jumping out. If it's a car fire, a house fire or a burnt pot of  beans, they're ready. The department is probably one of the most, if not the  most, important things in town."  </P> <P> Campbell's wife said she's had to adjust to her husband's second career, which  sometimes takes him away in the middle of dinner, a movie or a family  gathering.  </P> <P> "Thank goodness for microwave ovens. Now he doesn't have to have a cold  dinner," Kathy Campbell said.  </P> <P> "I admire him and all the other guys," she said, turning serious. "They  constantly put their lives on the line. Once in a awhile they need to be  reminded that they're appreciated."  </P> <P> UP CLOSE ROGER CAMPBELL  </P> <P> Vocation: Volunteer firefighter, councilman and mechanic  </P> <P> Age: 39  </P> <P> Birthplace: Fillmore  </P> <P> Favorite cold drink: Pepsi  </P> <P> Toughest rescue: Dislodging a 9-year-old boy from an irrigation pipe  </P> <P> Driving distance from home or work to Fire Department: 20 seconds  </P> <P> Dressing time in middle of the night: Five seconds  </P> <P> Funniest moment: "About two years after I got on the department, we were doing  a hot drill. I was on the end of the hose and yelled for water and  instantaneously, there was 450 pounds of pressure. It picked me up like I was a  rag doll and threw me in the air. Then, it turned and attacked me and blew a  shirt right off me. This all happened in about 30 seconds. It was just like a  cartoon."  </P></p>

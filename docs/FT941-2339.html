			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Austrian state oil group to shed jobs OMV, the Austrian state-controlled oil group which is due to be privatised, has announced job reductions which will lower its workforce by a fifth over the next two years, Reuter reports from Vienna. The company said the number of employees at its parent company would be cut to 4,000 by 1996. That would represent a 50 per cent reduction from a decade earlier. A statement said OMV strategy was to strengthen the business 'with the emphasis on reducing personnel costs.' It would also focus on central European markets, in particular the growing demand for natural gas. The statement did not say whether the planned job cuts had been agreed with union leaders, nor did it remark on their significance for the company's privatisation prospects. The Austrian government wants to reduce its 72 per cent stake in OMV to below 50 per cent through a sale to a strategic partner. Abu Dhabi is tipped as a leading candidate, but Austrian partners are also being sought. OMV has said it expects to make a 1993 loss of Sch4.7bn (Pounds 264m), including restructuring costs.</p>

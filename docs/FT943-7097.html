			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / People: Worboyes - levelling up at the PIA Mark Worboyes, 40, an accountant with Fimbra, has been appointed head of investigations at the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog charged with protecting the private investor. The PIA started operating last month after a long debate about reforming a widely-criticised system in which regulation of retail financial services was split between Lautro, which regulates life companies and unit trusts, and Fimbra, which supervises independent financial advisers. However, the problem of merging two regulators has caused considerable jockeying for position behind the scenes and there has been some criticism that Lautro staff were getting the plum jobs in the PIA. Kit Jebens, head of the PIA's member relations, and Stuart Willey, head of legal services, both come from Lautro. David Severn, head of policy development, comes in from the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Worboyes, who comes under Kit Jebens' department, takes over from his old boss Jim Gaskin, Fimbra's former deputy chief executive, who had been given the job of the PIA's investigations chief. He quit last week to become managing director of Countrywide, a chain of independent financial advisers. Worboyes joined Fimbra in 1988 and has held a succession of posts in the areas of compliance and enforcement. The PIA is still looking for a new head of finance and administration to complete its top management team under Colette Bowe, the new chief executive who was brought in from the SIB at the start of the year.</p>

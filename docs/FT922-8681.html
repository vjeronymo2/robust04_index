			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Matsushita orders retail shake-up / Examining the Japanese group's restructuring plan Matsushita Electric Industrial, Japan's leading consumer electronics group which made its advanced washing machine and camcorder into domestic best-sellers through its extensive domestic distribution network, has started to restructure its retail system. The restructuring comes at a time when Japanese electronics companies are facing sluggish demand due to slowing growth in both overseas and domestic markets. In the year ended March, Matsushita expects a 43 per cent pre-tax profits fall to Y340bn (Dollars 2.55bn). The restructuring is part of a shift in Matsushita's strategy of mass-marketing cheap products. Instead, the company intends to sharpen its focus on 'value added' products, which it will market as enhancements to consumers' quality of life. 'The age of focusing on quantity and market share is over,' says Mr Jiro Aoki, head of Matsushita's domestic business planning division. Matsushita's retail network consists of some 27,000 small 'mom and pop' stores called National shops after Matsushita's domestic brand name. This extensive network of shops offering only Matsushita products has been the underlying strength in the company's retailing power. Matsushita has managed to maintain a tight grip on its retailers through a special savings scheme. A National shop owner is allowed to place on deposit 1 per cent of every wholesale purchase with Matsushita, which in turn pays the retailer 20 per cent interest on the deposit. At the end of March 1991, Matsushita held a total of Y63.6bn in deposits from National shops. However, the once cozy relationship has become an increasing burden on Matsushita as the retailing power of the dealership has been undermined by larger discount stores. Some of the retailers are finding it hard to attract customers by offering only Matsushita products. The group also faces overseas pressure as the exclusive retail networks operated by Japanese electronics groups have become a target of criticism by US trade negotiators. Matsushita's restructuring plan includes altering its savings scheme over the next three years and reforming the company's rebate system. The company intends to change the old savings scheme by reducing the interest benefits and setting more stringent requirements on retailers. Only 50 to 60 per cent of the existing National shops are expected to have sufficient turnover to survive after the restructuring and the smaller stores, which are too small to purchase large quantities of stock from Matsushita, are expected to drop out of the network. Meanwhile, Matsushita has set up a new system to assist its National shops through training programmes intended to enhance retailers' product knowledge and marketing skills. For the small retailers who feel they cannot compete alone, Matsushita will encourage mergers among the stores. However, drastic changes are uncommon among Japanese companies, and reform of the Matsushita distribution network is expected to proceed at a gradual pace. Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo, says that Matsushita first began restructuring its retail network in the mid-1980s, but reforms were delayed after domestic demand surged and profits rose. 'If things start looking better, they may forget about current problems again,' he adds.</p>

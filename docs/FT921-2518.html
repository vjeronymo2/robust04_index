			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / BAT to pay uncovered dividend BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, yesterday announced an 8 per cent increase in its annual dividend although the payment will not be covered by earnings per share, which rose 21 per cent. The group reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 945m to Pounds 1.05bn for 1991 which Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, described as a 'year of recovery'. Sir Patrick said the dividend rise showed a 'continuing commitment to dividend increases substantially in excess of the rate of inflation'. He expected the 1992 dividend would be covered by earnings. BAT's aim was to rebuild dividend cover to 2. The shares rose 6p to 660p. The proposed final dividend of 11.2p, up from 10.4p, gives a total for the year of 33.6p, up from 31.1p, while earnings per share were 27.9p, up from 23p. BAT is reverting to paying two dividends a year, rather than three, as it did until 1989. The interim will be declared in July and is expected to be 40 per cent of the total. BAT's tobacco business made record trading profits of Pounds 1.08bn, a 14.2 per cent increase. Cigarette volumes worldwide increased by 3 per cent, taking BAT's world market share to 10.5 per cent. BAT gained market share in the US, and exports to Asia and eastern Europe were strong. Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary, returned to profit in the second half after the government allowed price increases. However, the Argentine business was unprofitable because, BAT said, it was the victim of a Dollars 38m (Pounds 21m) tax fraud. The financial services side was hit by difficult trading conditions in Eagle Star's general insurance business, offsetting good performances from Farmers, the US insurance group, and Allied Dunbar, the life and pensions subsidiary. General business incurred a trading loss of Pounds 22m from a profit of Pounds 145m, while the life business made a profit of Pounds 254m, up from Pounds 234m. Sir Patrick said he thought Eagle Star had 'hit bottom' with the underwriting result better in the second half of 1991 than the first and some signs that claims on the domestic mortgage side were reducing. The group's net interest charge fell from Pounds 210m to Pounds 133m, helped by lower interest rates and sales of investments. The group's net debt stood at 52 per cent of shareholders' funds at the year end. Lex, Page 24</p>

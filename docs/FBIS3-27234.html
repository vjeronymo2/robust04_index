The expansion, 29.8 percent over December 1992, was 10.9  percent higher than the November rise.    Figures from the State Statistics Bureau show that national  industrial output last year hit 3,507.39 billion yuan ($403.15  billion) in 1990 constant prices, up 23.6 percent over 1992.    Capital investment last year was still huge, helping to  propel the industrial growth.    A report from the bureau indicated that spending on capital  construction in State-run industries jumped 54.2 percent over  1992 to 464.69 billion yuan ($53.41 billion ).    Of this expenditure, 186.5 billion yuan ($21.44 billion)  went  to projects under the administration of the central government,  an increase of 39 percent. The remainder, 278.19 billion yuan  ($31.98 billion), went to enterprises under the control of local  authorities, a rise of 66.5 percent.    Manufacturing projects absorbed 319.98 billion yuan ($36.78  billion), an increase of 51.1 percent.    Non-manufacturing investment totalled 144.71 billion yuan  ($16.63 billion), up 61.7 percent of which housing accounted for  50.39 billion yuan ($5.79 billion), up 54 percent.    Money spent on technical renovation in State-run industries  hit 219.25 billion yuan ($25.2 billion) up 50.1 percent.    In industrial production, light industry's output jumped  22.3  percent to 1,659.48 billion yuan ($190.74 billion) while heavy  industry's gained 24.8 percent to 1,847.91 billion yuan ($212.4  billion).    In 1993, State-run industries generated 1,830.71 billion  yuan  ($210.43 billion) worth of products, 8.9 percent more than in  1992, while collectively-owned enterprises chalked up an  increase of 39.8 percent to 1,279.56 billion yuan ($147.08  billion). Of the total output of collectively-owned firms,  791.07 billion yuan ($90.93 billion) was generated by plants in  rural areas, up 57.6 percent.    Foreign-funded enterprises and private firms reported 1993  output of 397.12 billion yuan ($45.65 billion), a hefty increase  of 64.4 percent.    However, the bureau said energy production edged ahead only  4.3 percent to 1.103 billion tons of standard coal equivalent.    Production of undressed coal climbed 4.2 percent to 1.14  billion tons, while production of crude oil grew 2.2 percent to  1.45 billion tons.    Natural gas production inched up 6.8 percent to 16.56  billion  cubic metres, and production of hydro-electric power grew 12.3  percent to 146 billion kilowatt-hours.    A close look at other products shows that with few  exceptions, production increased in 1993 (See table).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Unit              |Output            |Change (Percent)  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Automobiles       |million           |1.3101            |21.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TV sets           |million           |28,848            |2.5               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Colour TV sets    |million           |13.873            |5.5               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Home washing mach-|million           |8.763             |23.0              |  |ines              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Home refrigerators|million           |6.2196            |30.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yarn              |million tons      |4.871             |0.8               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chemical fibre fo-|billion metres    |1.969             |6.6               |  |r garments        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cigarettes        |billion           |1.683.7           |22.4              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beer              |million tons      |12.257            |21.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Steel             |million tons      |88.676            |10.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rolled steel      |million tons      |75.897            |16.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sulphuric acid    |million tons      |13.139            |-5.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Soda ash          |million tons      |5.266             |16.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chemical fertiliz-|million tons      |20.16             |-4.0              |  |ers               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Timber            |cubic metres      |38,150,000        |-0.6              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cardboard         |cubic metres      |4,937,200         |30.8              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cement            |million tons      |356,737           |19.8              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flat glass        |million boxes(1bo-|108.932           |12.9              |  |                  |x=50kg)           |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

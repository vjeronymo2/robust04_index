Washington St. will accept trash from private and  public trash haulers so their trucks will not have to travel 40 miles to a  landfill, said Tony Harris, spokesman for the city Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> With the controversial Lopez Canyon facility near Lake View Terrace the only  city-owned landfill still in operation, city officials have increasingly looked  to recycling as a way to reduce the amount of waste going into dumps.  </P></p>

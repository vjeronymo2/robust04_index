			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sachsenmilch suspended in Frankfurt TRADING in Sachsenmilch, the only eastern German company listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, was suspended yesterday following losses and large cost overruns. The dairy group, based in Dresden, whose majority shareholder is the bank Sudmilch of Stuttgart, was listed on the exchange in 1991 in expectation that investments of DM260m (Dollars 152.9m) would increase the market share in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. The shares were issued at DM80, and suspended at DM60. Deutsche Bank, the dairy's principal creditor, which prepared the company for the listing, said the agricultural ministry of Saxony and Sudmilch, were trying to assess the extent of the losses.</p>

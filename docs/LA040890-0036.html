			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE NEED DEADLINE FOR GETTING TAX INFORMATION  </P> <P> There should be a deadline for firms mailing you those envelopes containing  income tax information, like, let's say, March 1 of each year! It's very  inconvenient for taxpayers to have to delay their returns until all of these  "missiles" have arrived. Maybe the penalty to the firm mailing same is needed.  </P> <P> EARL S.

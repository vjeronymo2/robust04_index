			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  Victor Chernomyrdin said here today that Russia's participation  in the NATO Partnership for Peace program does not necessarily  amount to giving up its position.    At a news conference joined by visiting U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry, Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia  has accepted the NATO's partnership proposal without putting up  any preconditions.    The U.S. defense secretary also pointed out that the  partnership for peace plan would not be practical until the end  of March, when Russia formally applies for the partnership, the  first step toward the full NATO membership.    The two ministers have worked on the issue of nuclear  weapons  and discussed specifically the disarmament of the nuclear  arsenal in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, reportedly the  world's third largest.    Cooperation on the conversion of military industries into  civil business and destruction of chemical weapons were also  among the subjects they discussed, said the Russian prime  minister.    Before leaving Moscow for Alma Ata, Perry and Russia's First  Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin signed an agreement  on military conversion this afternoon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich and </F> Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow December 16 TASS -- ``Russia together with  other countries is welcoming the decision of the Supreme Soviet  of Kazakhstan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]  as a member state not possessing nuclear weapons,'' Russian  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said at a briefing  today.    Thus, Kazakhstan's joining of the system of commitments  based  on the START-1 treaty and the 1992 Lisbon protocol has been  completed from the legal point of view. ``Russia regards this  step taken by Kazakhstan as a major contribution to the  strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to the  ensuring of the nuclear arms reduction,'' he said. This is  especially important now, because the non-proliferation regime  has been jeopardized by the dangerous stand, taken by Ukraine.    According to Karasin, Russia would like to hope that the  resolution, adopted by the Kazakh parliament, will set a good  example for Ukraine. Whether an impetus will be given to the  spreading of nuclear weapons all over the planet, or whether the  mechanism of significant nuclear arms reductions, envisaged by  the START-1 and START-2 treaties, will be set into motion,  depends very much on the policy pursued by Ukraine.</p>

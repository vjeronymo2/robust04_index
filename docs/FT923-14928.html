			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Food: English-made Caesar salad - Cookery I HAVE not yet been to America in the flesh, only in spirit. You may think me medieval for this. Most of my culinary impressions have been gleaned from films, television and novels. In the Hollywood version, GIs, when not chewing gum, are tucking into or craving Hershey bars, fudge brownies, cheesecake, and Mom's apple pie. In the deep south they seem to survive on curiously named confections like Mississippi mud, jambalaya, hominy grits, johnny cake and hush puppies - not forgetting Kentucky fried chicken, of course. Many American meat dishes sound curiously unappetising: meatloaf, corned beef and hamburgers to name but three. Fish offers more glamour and allure: Grand Central Station clam chowder, New England crab cakes, oysters Rockefeller and lobster Newberg. This last, devised by Delmonico's restaurant in Manhattan, was, so the story goes, originally named after a patron called Wenberg. The letters were transcribed at a later date after an exchange of sharp words between patron and restaurateur. It has been said that two things make American meals stand out from those of other countries. A family dinner customarily begins with a salad, and it is not considered complete without a very serious dessert. The American tooth seems even sweeter than the British one, which is saying a lot. Their salads often include as much fruit as vegetables, and sometimes the fruit is set in jelly like a nursery pudding of the nastiest sort. Waldorf salad, on the other hand, is pleasing with its happy marriage of celery, apple and walnuts, while fruitless Caesar salad is particularly appetising. I confess, though, that rather than serve Caesar salad in its traditional role as a first course, I prefer it as a lunch dish. It makes a good choice for a warm summer's day, needing little more than a bowl of, say, fresh ripe cherries and tawny apricots to follow it. CAESAR SALAD (serves 4 for lunch or 6-8 as a first course) In spite of the Roman implications of the name, this is a north American recipe, created in the early 1920s by Caesar Cardini in his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. Many versions of the salad are now in circulation, some quite elaborate, but it began life as a simple affair and that is how I like it, the charm of it lying in its combination of a few very fresh, top quality ingredients: Cos, the best lettuce there is, anointed with an egg-enriched dressing, a savoury grating of genuine Parmegiano-Reggiano and the crunch of good bread fried in good olive oil. Some cooks add snipped anchovy fillets, a splash of Worcester sauce and other extra flavourings. I find them quite unnecessary. Many use one-minute boiled eggs in the dressing. I have never quite understood why. Such brief immersion in boiling liquid does not cook an egg in the accepted sense; it barely sets a thin outer film of egg white, leaving the rest of the white and the yolk raw and barely warmed. Is it really worth effort of getting out an egg boiling pan and setting a pinger timer for this? A raw egg seems to me as suitable as a semi-raw one for the twin purposes of increasing the food value of the salad and mollifying the lemoniness of the dressing. (Those fearful of salmonella may prefer to omit the egg altogether and up the oil content of the dressing accordingly.) 1 1/2 lb or more Cos lettuce leaves (I use the best inner leaves of 2 large Cos and save the outer parts for making soup or cooking with peas); 5-6 oz good quality slightly stale bread (ciabatta for preference); 1 oz or more freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 2 garlic cloves; 8 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 1 egg, at room temperature; 3-4 teaspoons lemon juice. Wash and dry the Cos and cut or break the leaves into bite size pieces. Dice the bread. Grate the cheese. Slice the garlic thinly. Put the garlic into a large frying pan together with 4 tablespoons olive oil and place over very low heat. When the oil is very hot and aromatic, remove the frazzled fragments of garlic. Add the diced bread to the pan and turn up the heat a little. Fry, stirring and turning the bread as necessary, until golden and crisp. Set the pan of croutons to one side while you quickly break the raw egg into a salad bowl. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon juice, a good scrunch of sea salt and a generous grinding of black pepper. Mix well with a fork. Add the leaves to the dressing and toss to coat them. Sprinkle on the cheese and mix again lightly. Adjust seasoning to taste. Add the croutons of garlic fried bread, toss briefly and serve straight away.</p>

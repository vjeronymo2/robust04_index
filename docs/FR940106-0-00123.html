			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department also has decided that the 1988 Amendments relating to sections 231(a)(5), 231(b), and 231(c) of the Trade Act, which, under section 1430(f) of the OTCA, took effect 90 days after the date of enactment (i.e., on November 21, 1988), are not affected by the new interpretation of section 1430(a). Although the effective date language of section 1430(f) is the same as the effective date language of section 1430(a), the Department has determined that the application of the new interpretation to these provisions would cause manifest injustice to affected workers and also would appear to be contrary to the intent of the Congress and the logic of the 90-day delay in the effective date of these amendments. This is more fully explained in GAL 15&hyph;90 and Attachment A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Changes to &sect;617.11(a)(2)(iii)(B) (1) and (2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 amended section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 by adding a new paragraph (D) to the categories which are considered a week of adversely affected employment at wages of $30 or more a week in order to qualify for TRA. The new subparagraph (D) provides that any week a worker is on call-up for active duty in a reserve status in the armed forces, provided such active duty is ``Federal service'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8521(a)(1), shall constitute a week in meeting the TRA qualifying requirements of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974. Section 106(a) also clarifies that not more than 26 weeks described in subparagraphs (B) or (D) of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act may be used for TRA qualifying purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This means that all of the required employment and wages necessary to qualify for TRA may be attained during a reservist's call-up to active duty. This amendment only affects the TRA qualifying requirement in section 231(a)(2); all other TRA qualifying requirements in section 231 are unchanged. Therefore, State agencies must also determine if a reservist meets the remaining TRA qualifying requirements contained in section 231 of the Trade Act before awarding TRA entitlement to the reservist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the worker's qualifying weeks at wages of $30 or more a week for TRA qualifying purposes, the amendment to section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act applies to weeks beginning after August 1, 1990. The effective date of this amendment results in a retroactive application to TRA claims filed (or which would have been filed) by reservists who took part in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. This means that State agencies must redetermine the TRA initial claims of all reservists called-up for active duty whose claims were denied solely because they did not meet the requirements of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment. State agencies must also take TRA initial claims of reservists who did not previously file a TRA initial claim because they did not meet the requirements of section 231(a)(2) as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating instructions issued to State agencies in GAL No. 10&hyph;92,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating Instructions to section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 Contained in H.R. 5260,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> dated July 6, 1992, explained the changes to section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act and instructed State agencies and cooperating agencies to take the appropriate actions to identify and inform reservists of their rights to redetermination or the opportunity to file TRA initial claims. Actions by State agencies include a search of claimant files and publication of information on this new provision in newspapers of general circulation and other appropriate media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, a new clause ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> iv <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is added to &sect;617.11(a)(2)(iii)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and clause ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(iii)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is changed to implement these amendments to section 231 (a)(2) of the Trade Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Change to &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(E) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1425(b) of OTCA provides eligibility for TRA to certain workers who were continuously unemployed since separation from adversely affected employment during the period from August 13, 1981 to April 7, 1986, not taking into account seasonal employment, odd jobs, or part-time, temporary employment. This provision opened up eligibility to workers who could not qualify for additional weeks of TRA because they did not meet the 210-day time limit for filing for training and to workers who did not receive all of their TRA entitlement because their eligibility period was based on their first rather than their most recent separation. In the proposed rule, general guidance was provided to State agencies on ``continuously unemployed'' but State agencies were allowed to apply the provisions using their expertise in determining eligibility relating to employment. However, the Department decided that it was essential to provide State agencies with guiding instructions for implementing section 1425(b)(2)(A) (ii) of the OTCA so that the Department, rather than States, defines the limits of the Federal liability. Accordingly, definitions to be used in applying the terms ``seasonal employment'', ``odd jobs'' and ``part-time, temporary employment'' are added in a new clause ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(E). Because precise definitions were not available for each of these terms, definitions were developed for purposes of this final rule from various sources and other program applications. The seasonal provision of applicable State law is used in applying the ``seasonal employment'' provision. A definition for ``odd jobs'' was developed in which the established period of employment occurs within 5 days or less. The definition for ``part-time'' is taken from the ETA Glossary of Program Terms and Definitions (ETA Handbook No. 373), which provides for less than 30 hours per week of regularly scheduled work. However, that definition has to be applied along with ``temporary employment.'' The definition for ``temporary employment'' is based on ETA reporting requirements for the public employment service in which an established employment period of 150 days or less is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

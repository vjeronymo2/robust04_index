			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special AFP envoy Cristobal Kohn] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 6 Jan (AFP) --  The Mexican Federal Army continued on Thursday its cleanup  operations in Chiapas State (southern Mexico) in pursuit of the  guerrilla forces which have apparently dispersed in the  mountains.    Military sources indicated there were skirmishes in the  hills  which surround San Cristobal de las Casas, during the sixth day  of the insurrection launched by the Zapatista National  Liberation Army (EZLN), but all cities seized by the rebels are  now under the control of regular forces.    The Mexican Army, which has maintained an almost complete  silence on the operations' development, has established  roadblocks. On Thursday morning journalists were forbidden from  travelling along the road to Ocosingo, north of San Cristobal,  where violent clashes have occurred.    The media was able to ascertain that airplanes and  helicopters continue to fly over the zone and have bombarded the  vicinity of San Cristobal at least once on Thursday morning.    New military reinforcements, particularly light tanks,  arrived on Thursday in San Cristobal (80,000 inhabitants), the  second largest city in Chiapas State which was seized by the  EZLN for more than 24 hours.    According to a communique from the municipality, the city  has  returned to normalcy and fuel and food supplies have been  restored.    Local radio stations continue to broadcast messages from  people who seek news about their relatives or who on the other  hand only have this means of notifying their relatives that they  are all right.    Some people, particularly in the Indian communities, are  afraid the Army will conduct exactions [exacciones].    "The Indians are afraid the military will not be able to  tell  the difference between them and the guerrillas," said Father  Jesus Villalobos, who harbored 10 Indians from the Tzeltal  ethnic group in his convent.    Carmela Hernandez, one of the refugees, explained the Army  bombarded her village, San Antonio, on Tuesday, when the  guerrilla forces had already withdrawn.    "A bomb fell 70 meters from my house, and I fled with my six  children," she said.    Her husband remained in the village so no one would steal  their animals.    Jorge Madrazo, chairman of the National Human Rights  Commission (CNDH), arrived at San Cristobal on Wednesday and  said the CNDH would increase its presence and investigate all  reports "regardless of origin."    "Summary executions, disappearances, illegal arrests, and  any  other human rights violation are unacceptable," Madrazo added in  a news conference.</p>

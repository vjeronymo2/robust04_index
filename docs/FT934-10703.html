			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Former building chief convicted of Pounds 2m theft THE FORMER chief executive of Farr Construction, the collapsed building company, was yesterday convicted of stealing almost Pounds 2m from its pension fund in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the company going into liquidation. Dr Gerald Smith was found guilty by a jury at Southwark crown court, south London, on seven counts of theft and one of forgery. He will be sentenced on November 24 and was released on bail until then on sureties of Pounds 100,000. Dr Smith took control of the company, based in Westbury, Wiltshire, in early 1989. He was under pressure from the company's bankers to repay a Pounds 2.2m overdraft, lawyers for the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution, had told the court. The first theft from the pension fund took place in September 1989 when he stole a cheque for Pounds 940,000 and diverted the money into the company's accounts. In January and February 1990 he stole securities worth almost Pounds 1m from the fund and, having deposited them in a Swiss bank account, used them as collateral for a loan to further shore-up the company. He misled fellow directors about the finances of the pension fund by presenting them with a false valuation report which stated the securities were still owned by the fund. The thefts did not prevent the collapse of the company, which went into liquidation in December 1990. By then the pension fund's assets had fallen from some Pounds 3m to a few hundred pounds. In August 1991 Dr Smith wrote to the fund trustees and members, saying the assets had been borrowed as a temporary source of funds to finance the company's expansionist policy. 'I believed the fund could properly be used to save the company,' he said. He also promised to repay the fund to ensure that members did not suffer any loss.</p>

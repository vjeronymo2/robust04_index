			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Fundamentals replace focus on rates cut - London Relieved, at least to some extent, of its fixation with the chances of a cut in UK base rates, the London stock market is expected this week to reassess the investment fundamentals. The dramatic response to Lloyds Bank's acquisition of Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society indicates the market's readiness to back companies regarded as making the right moves. At a less dramatic level, fund managers are now expected to pay even closer attention to the flow of higher dividends appearing across the range of recovery sectors. Analysts' forecasts for growth in UK dividends range to around 10 per cent in each of the next two years. Suggestions from UK Treasury sources that high dividend payouts starve industry of investment funding are addressed by SG Warburg, which says the level of profits retained by companies does not seem closely-linked to levels of investment activity. The base rate debate shifted significantly last week with news of an unexpectedly good rise in March retail sales. The stock market believes a cut is now ruled out, on economic grounds at least, and that the Bank of England would strongly resist such a move. A politically-inspired rate-reduction can never be discounted entirely, but such a move would probably alarm the markets rather than encourage them. The relaxation in near-term base rate tensions should also help the bond market, which will be good for equities as well as for the big securities houses carrying heavy losses in government stocks. The renewed search for genuine investment value in UK equities covers the full range of both domestically and internationally- oriented sectors. With benefits from the UK's economic recovery already taken into share prices - Strauss Turnbull calculates that real equity returns have risen by about 55 per cent since the beginning of the upturn - analysts are measuring London market prospects in terms of economic recovery elsewhere in the world. BZW believes the overseas earners will soon find welcome surprises from their European operations as Germany and France move to the recovery phase. However, 'sensitivity to the Far East in the UK market is quite small - 7 per cent of total market turnover'. In its list of stocks with European exposure of 30 per cent or more, BZW highlights a number of well-known names. British Steel has already attracted attention as a stock with European earnings, but Guinness, Shell, De La Rue and Redland have perhaps not had their due. Reviving confidence in the motor industry, stirred by a record quarter at Chrysler, global development plans by Ford and a recovery trend at Peugeot, has brought a focus on the UK vehicle distributors which, according to SG Warburg, face 'the most profitable period ever experienced'. Car sales are already nearly 17 per cent up this year.</p>

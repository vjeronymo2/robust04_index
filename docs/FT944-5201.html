			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Temptations held out to shareholders: The Russian government aims to make investing in private companies more attractive It is an irony that a confectionery company named in honour of the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 promises to open a new chapter in Russia's capitalist development. But the public share issue that the Red October enterprise launches today may have a significance far beyond whether the Moscow company receives Rbs70bn (Dollars 22m) to upgrade its production lines for its Clumsy Bear chocolates and Lobster Tail sweets. The broader purpose of the issue is to construct a model for raising finance that can readily be copied by other companies. If successful, it could show Russian companies how they might access untapped pools of domestic and international capital to fund their investment needs. The architects of the issue, which include the UK government's Know-How fund and a small army of Russian and foreign advisers, also aim to strengthen the local stock market infrastructure. By linking brokers and financial institutions through this issue, and encouraging the public to invest in productive enterprises rather than speculative ventures such as the MMM pyramid scheme, the project can help to broaden the shareholder culture. The Know-How fund is paying for nine companies in five Russian cities to follow Red October's path. 'This issue is about more than whether one small confectionery company can raise some money. It is about how to point 14,000 cash-starved privatised companies towards available sources of capital,' says one Moscow-based stockbroker. One perverse by-product of Russia's vast and rapid privatisation programme has been to create a back-to-front capital market structure. Russia is perhaps unique in having created secondary markets, which sprang up to trade the shares of the newly privatised companies, before it developed primary markets where companies could issue shares to raise fresh funds. The reformers in the Russian government are aware of this weakness and are intent on rectifying it. In an interview with the Financial Times last month, Mr Anatoly Chubais, recently promoted to first deputy prime minister after spearheading the privatisation programme, defined the government's two chief goals for next year as economic stabilisation and the development of effective securities markets. Mr Chubais believes these processes must go hand in hand. If inflation is 15 per cent a month, nobody will invest - even in sound enterprises; but economic stabilisation cannot be achieved if Russian companies still have to rely on inflationary state credits. 'Our citizens must be stimulated to buy shares in serious industrial enterprises,' he said this week. 'People do have money and are ready to invest it in amounts the federal Treasury could not even dream of.' He suggested domestic savings had increased this year from Rbs5,000bn in January to Rbs20,000bn by November. Teams of Russian and western experts are working feverishly to create the mechanisms and legal framework to enable this savings pool to be sucked into productive investments. Red October is perhaps as good a place to start as anywhere. Founded in 1867 as Einem, after the German entrepreneur who created it, the renamed Red October subsequently grew into one of the best-known companies in Moscow. Its products have been popular with generations of Russians who have a penchant for sticky sweets. Its highly visible site, occupying a famous red-brick complex on an island opposite the Kremlin, is a Moscow landmark. It is not hard to imagine the day when the site alone could be worth more than the company's nominal valuation. Like all Russian companies, Red October has severe problems, but at least it is financially stable - making profits of Rbs16.6bn on sales of Rbs71.2bn in the first six months of the year - and appears to have good growth prospects. Despite being Russia's biggest confectionery company, Red October accounts for just 3 per cent of the national market. The big western groups, such as Mars, Cadbury Schweppes, Hershey's and Nestle, are flooding the country with their products and may pose a serious long-term threat. But these multinationals claim to be expanding the market as a whole, rather than grabbing share from local manufacturers. The share issue itself is divided into three tranches. Of the 3.5m shares on offer, 1.5m have been reserved for Russian institutional investors, such as banks and the nascent investment funds, which are expected to have a keen appetite. Another 1m shares have been allocated for international investors and will be marketed in London through James Capel, the stockbroker, where the extent of the interest remains to be seen. Many western fund managers appear to have taken the conceptual leap that Russia is a country in which they want to invest. The progress on economic reform and the relative political stability of recent months, combined with the seemingly low valuations of Russian assets, have already attracted speculative funds. But mainstream investors remain deterred by the rudimentary nature of the market infrastructure and the lack of information on company performance. One of the most impressive aspects of the Red October issue is how far it has gone to help dispel the latter concern by significantly raising the level of disclosure among Russian companies. A 48-page prospectus has been produced containing a wealth of financial information and summaries of the company's history and strategy. Nevertheless, the document candidly highlights the high risk inherent in Red October as an investment proposition. The rudimentary accounts are heavily qualified by Deloitte and Touche, the auditor. It would be impossible to launch a fund-raising exercise in a developed stock market on the basis of the information provided. Whether the issue is judged a success, however, will depend on the appetite of private retail investors in Russia for the remaining 1m shares. Other stockbrokers, which have tried to sell shares in solid Russian industrial companies, have failed to excite much interest, being drowned out by the noise of speculative funds which promise seemingly stratospheric returns. Red October concedes its sales pitch is emotional as much as financial. Mr Anatoly Daursky, Red October's president, thinks many local investors will relish the opportunity to buy a 'part of Russian heritage'. But there are critics of the Red October fund-raising who say such projects are too complicated and inappropriate for this stage of Russia's economic development. The expensive paraphernalia of a stock market fund raising demands too much management effort. Besides, why should Russian companies give away a big chunk of their equity when they are valued so cheaply? 'Is this a means by which the Russian equivalent of the Fortune 500 can raise capital? I do not think so,' says one Moscow-based western financial expert. 'It would be too much hassle to try to raise Dollars 1bn in packets of Dollars 10 shares.' Significantly perhaps, the giants of Russian industry, such as Gazprom, the vast gas concern, and Lukoil, the country's biggest privatised oil company, do not yet see Russia's equity markets as being sufficiently developed to raise money, and are aiming to raise capital in international markets. Both have already succeeded in raising multi-million dollar debt finance packages from German and Japanese banks secured on hard-currency export earnings. Both companies are also seeking to raise money through international equity offerings. Gazprom will sell 9 per cent, probably through a private placing arranged by UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. Lukoil aims to sell up to 15 per cent of its equity abroad and obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. It will be a tortuous process, but it has already taken on western auditors to prepare the necessary accounts and has hired lawyers and management consultants to reshape its business. Whatever the balance between debt and equity finance, whether from domestic or foreign sources, it is clear Russian companies must find new capital from somewhere. 'If you believe in the economic transformation of Russia, then you have to believe that domestic savings will be channelled through intermediary institutions into fixed capital formation,' says one Moscow-based financier. 'What is clear is that if reform is to work, the government has simply got to get out of that business.'</p>

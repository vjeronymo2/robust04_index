			<p>BFN     [Text] Over 54 percent of the electorate voted in the  runoffs held in Kharkov. Elections were invalid in Vyzovskiy,  Moskovskiy, and Saltovskiy constituencies due to a low turnout.  In Dzerzhinskiy constituency neither of the candidates received  the required number of votes. The elected deputies include  Volodymyr Hrynyov (Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms), Mykola  Koshlyakov, secretary of the oblast Communist Party committee,  Oleh Dyomin, vice president of the UkrSibInkor association,  Oleksandr Karpov, a lecturer of the city's State University, and  Oleksandr Chornousenko, head of the Kharkov Oblast branch of the  Security Service.    Elections were valid in all of the 17 Zaporozhye Oblast  constituencies. In Zhovtnevyy and [name indistinct]  constituencies of Zaporozhye city, the winners are Yuriy  Syzenko, a worker of Zaporozhye electric wagon repair plant, and  Viktor Ponedilok, a scientist of Zaporozhye Technical University.    Our Chernigov Oblast correspondent reports that elections  were valid in all of the oblast's constituencies. The average  turnout in the oblast was 73 percent, while in Chernigov city it  was just over 50 percent.    In Vinnitsa Oblast, people's deputies were elected in 11 out  of 16 constituencies which held runoffs yesterday. They include  Hryhoriy Nedvyha, an engineer of the locomotive depot, Yevhen  Smyrnov, a stage director at Narodnyy Theater, Mykhaylo  Parasunko, deputy minister of agrarian policy and foodstuffs,  and Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of  Independent Trade Unions.    Our Odessa correspondent reports that over 62 percent of the  electorate voted in the oblast. In Odessa, the highest turnout  was in Zhovtnevyy constituency (62 percent) and Malinovskiy (60  percent). Unfortunately, in some constituencies, such as  Leninskiy and Tsentralnyy, the turnout was only 48 percent. In  the countryside, the highest turnout was in Tatarbunarskiy,  Filiyskiy, and Razdelnyanskiy rayons.    Our Poltava correspondent reports that all of the 15 Poltava  Oblast constituencies have reported a valid election. The  highest turnout was in the countryside. Thus, in Orzhitskiy,  Velikobagachskiy, Zenkovskiy, Mirgorodskiy, and other rayons,  the turnout was over 90 percent of registered voters. Somewhat  lower was the turnout in Kremenchug and Poltava itself. We are  unable to name those elected yet, but there is every confidence  that the number of Poltava representatives will be larger this  time.    Finally, results in the Ukrainian capital. Our presenters on  10 April were unable to quote even preliminary results, saying,  however that elections were valid in about eight of the  capital's constituencies. Here are the preliminary results of  elections in Kiev that we know so far. Out of the 23  constituencies, eight reported a valid election. The elected  deputies include Myroslav Horbatyuk, Ivan Zayets, [Minister of  Environment] Yuriy Kostenko. I will remind you that people's  deputies elected in Kiev on 27 March were Volodymyr Lanovyy and  Les Tanyuk. [sentence as heard] All of the Kiev deputies named  here are supported by the Ukraina Democratic Association. We  have no results yet as to the runoff in Artemovskiy constituency  No. 1 where the contenders were lawyer Viktor Medvedchuk and  [ex-Minister of Defense] General Kostyantyn Morozov. In two  constituencies, Pecherskiy and Podolskiy, neither of the  deputies received the required number of votes.</p>

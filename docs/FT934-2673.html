			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Scargill plans case against Labour Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, intends to take legal action against the Labour party to try to prevent the introduction of women-only shortlists for the selection of some of its parliamentary candidates for the next general election, Robert Taylor writes. 'I have not fought all my life against sexual discrimination to see one form of discrimination replaced by another,' he says in a letter to a party member revealed yesterday on BBC's On The Record programme. A National Opinion Poll in the Labour party magazine New Century shows 61 per cent of people oppose all-women shortlists and only 28 per cent back them.</p>

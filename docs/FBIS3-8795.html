			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not  given: "Meciar Did Not Convince Me"]    [Text] [Pankovcinova] How do you assess the prime  minister's speech in the National Council of the Slovak Republic  [NRSR], his offers regarding a solution to the domestic  political situation, and his statement that he would be ready to  step down one minute after the president does?    [Carnogursky] The speech was general and did not address  those parts of the president's speech that described the  actually existing negative features of Slovak politics.  Moreover, he tried to give himself the air of someone who has  been fighting for Slovak statehood since time immemorial. I,  however, remember the meeting in the Vikarka restaurant [at  Prague Castle] in January 1991, when he signed all points on the  future constitutional setup submitted by President Vaclav Havel.  The prime minister said that matters raised only in one-to-one  conversations between himself and the president should not be  made public. Yet this is exactly what he himself did last year  with regard to his talks with Ludovit Cernak, the then chairman  of the Slovak National Party [allusion to Meciar's claim that,  in a private conversation, Cernak had asked for funds from the  state budget for his party]. Vladimir Meciar simply did not  convince me. As for his proposal that he will step down one  minute after the president tenders his resignation, this is  sheer demagoguery because, if the president of the Slovak  Republic resigned, there would be no one to accept the prime  minister's resignation.    [Pankovcinova] Olga Keltosova, minister of labor and social  affairs, called on deputies on Thursday [10 March] to consider  the possibilities arising from Article 106 of the Constitution  of the Slovak Republic. This article deals with conditions  under which the NRSR can recall the president....    [Carnogursky] This was a display of demagoguery and  arrogance because, by proposing a broad-coalition government,  the president did not make himself guilty of anything  [constituting grounds for impeachment] under Article 106 of the  Constitution of the Slovak Republic. The very fact that a  minister dares say anything of that sort about the president is  brazen.    [Pankovcinova] How long will the formation of the coalition  government last?    [Carnogursky] It cannot last long. The government must be  formed within the next few days.    [Pankovcinova] Will you seek a change in the post of NRSR  chairman?    [Carnogursky] I think that this issue will be topical.    [Pankovcinova] Are you personally interested in any  government post?    [Carnogursky] No, it will be a government without party  leaders.    [Pankovcinova] Which government departments does the  Christian Democratic Movement intend to fill?    [Carnogursky] That is a matter for political parties to  agree upon.</p>

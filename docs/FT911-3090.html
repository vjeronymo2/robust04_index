			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bank issues writ against Raglan Prop Trust RAGLAN PROPERTY Trust yesterday announced that Security Pacific, one of its bankers, had placed its Piries Place subsidiary into receivership and issued a writ against the parent company. The subsidiary, which is in the hands of Price Waterhouse, developed a scheme comprising a supermarket, shops and offices in Horsham, West Sussex. Although the supermarket and a number of the shops are let and trading, the development has fallen sharply in value. The writ issued by Security Pacific on April 9 is thought to concern the Pounds 11m limited recourse loan that financed the scheme. There is a dispute about the construction cost overruns that have been guaranteed by the parent company. Raglan said it would vigorously defend the action. Raglan said its principal bankers - Kleinwort Benson, Midland and National Westminster - had been informed about these events and had confirmed their support. Raglan's share price fell  1/2 p to 2 1/2 p.</p>

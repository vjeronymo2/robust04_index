			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has  categorically stated that Pakistan will not roll back its  nuclear program. Addressing a news conference in the Parliament  House in Islamabad this morning, she said this is a firm  commitment of her government with the people of Pakistan. She  said Pakistan will not open its nuclear facilities for  inspection unilaterally as this would be discriminatory and  against the wishes of the Pakistani nation. Ms. Benazir Bhutto  emphasized that there should be an even-handed approach by the  United States on the problem of nuclear nonproliferation, arms  race, and missiles race, but these are to be resolved in South  Asian subcontinent. Pakistan has given several positive  proposals for nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, but these  have been rejected by India.    The prime minister said Pakistan wanted to improve bilateral  relations with the United States not for acquisition of F-16  aircraft or for arms purchases, but because Pakistan and the  United States have a history of old friendship. She said the  United States is now the only superpower and so it has a role to  play in the solution of the Kashmir problem. Referring to the  U.S. deputy secretary of state's forthcoming visit to Pakistan,  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan will inform Mr. Strobe Talbott  that it believes in nonproliferation in South Asia, but there  should a regional approach to it.    She also urged the opposition to give up its negative  attitude of confrontation and join hands with the government on  the sensitive issues of national importance like nuclear and  Kashmir.</p>

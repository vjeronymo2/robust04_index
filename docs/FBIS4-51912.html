			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hwang To-hyong] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Independent lawmaker Chong  Tong-ho, former chief presidential bodyguard under the Choe  Kyu-ha government, will be summoned Tuesday for questioning on  his alleged involvement in the "Dec. 12 coup d'etat-like  incident," the prosecution said Monday.    The incident refers to the controversial apprehension of  then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Chong Sung-hwa by a group of  military officers seeking to interrogate him in connection with  the assassination of former president Pak Chong-hui in 1979.    Chong Sung-hwa and his followers have filed suits with the  prosecution against former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was then  chief of the Defense Security Command (DSC) in charge of  investigating Pak's assassination case, and Chon's men, accusing  them of staging a rebellion to grab power after former president  Pak's assassination.    Lawmaker Chong, one of Chon Tu-hwan's men who was the acting  chief presidential bodyguard, will be questioned on his role in  isolating president Choe by replacing guards at the prime  minister's residence with presidential security guards under his  control, the prosecution said. At the time Choe still resided  at the prime minister's residence, although he had assumed the  presidency just after president Pak's death.    The prosecution has thus far interrogated 15 of the 38  people  accused of rebellion by former Army Chief of Staff Chong and  other victims of the Dec. 12 incident.    Those already questioned include Ho Sam-su, who was then the  DSC's personnel affairs bureau chief, Song Hwan-ok, then Army  colonel at the military police unit of the Army headquarters,  Pak Hui-mo, commander of the 30th division, and Pak Chong-kyu, a  battalion commander of the third airborne brigade who actually  mobilized troops to seize Chong Pyong-chu, then commander of the  special warfare forces, in a bloody battle with Chong's forces  who strongly resisted the apprehension of the Army chief of  staff.    The prosecution's probe of the case has entered a second  phase with former chief presidential bodyguard Chong Tong-ho  being the first high-level official to be questioned in  connection with the incident.    The prosecution said it would call in more than 10  high-level  officials and military officers involved in the case during May.    Among those to be summoned are Ko Myong-sung, who was then a  senior presidential security guard, Ho Hwa-pyong, then chief  secretary to DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan, and Yi Hak-pong, then  senior official of the DSC's investigation department.    Also to be called in by the prosecution will be the  then-commanders of the first and third airborne brigades, Pak  Hui-to and Choe Se-chang, who mobilized their airborne troops to  counter Chang Tae-wan, then commander of the capital garrison  command, who fought against the forces of the DSC's Chon Tu-hwan  to keep Chon from seizing then-Army Chief of Staff Chong  Sung-hwa.    The prosecution also plans to decide by June whether to  interrogate three former presidents involved in the incident  including Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, according to  prosecution sources. The prosecution said it will focus on  whether the apprehension of Chong Sung-hwa constituted a  rebellion under the military criminal code.    Chong and other victims of the Dec. 12 incident claim that  then-DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan and his followers violated the  military criminal code by seizing Chong in an apparent effort to  grab power in the vacuum created by Pak Chong-hui's death.  Chon's side, meanwhile, insists that the apprehension took  place in due course of investigating the incident and that they  had no intention of taking power by seizing Chong.</p>

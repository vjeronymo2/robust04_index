			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL WATER POLO PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> ROYAL ADVANCES TO SHOWDOWN WITH EL TORO  </P> <P> Devin Hurst scored five goals and cousin Todd Hurst added three to lead Royal  High over Glendale, 11-6, in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A  Division water polo playoffs Wednesday at Royal.  </P> <P> The Highlanders, who this season won their ninth consecutive Marmonte League  title, advance to the second round for the eighth time in the past 10 years.  Royal, however, has never won a second-round match and this year's opponent --  El Toro -- figures to be a worthy foe. The Chargers are the division's  top-rated team. A coin flip today will determine the site of Friday's match.  </P> <P> Against Glendale (10-10), which finished third in the Pacific League, Royal  (15-6) got an inspired performance from junior William Spencer, who came off  the bench to score two goals. He also had three steals and two blocks.  </P> <P> "He provided the spark," Royal Coach Steve Snyder said. "He got into the flow  of the game very quickly."  </P> <P> Crespi 7, Costa Mesa 6 -- Crespi goalie Tim Behrens, making his first start  after being sidelined with the chicken pox, recorded 15 saves as the Celts took  a 7-5 lead in the fourth quarter and held on in the 3-A match at Crespi.  </P> <P> Vince Greco had three goals for Crespi (16-7), which never trailed. Jean Michel  and Paul Suppa each scored twice for the Celts, who will play Palos Verdes on  Friday. Palos Verdes defeated Fountain Valley, 11-9, on Wednesday.  </P></p>

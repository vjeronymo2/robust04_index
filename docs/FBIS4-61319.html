			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- The Latvian state border is  practically unguarded but it is being relatively controlled,  Frontier Guard Brigade Cmdr. Janis Adamsons told reporters on  return from a border inspection trip.    The border control is hampered by the acute lack of funding  and equipment, as well as inefficiency of certain officials.    The Frontier Brigade received 42 percent of the required  minimal funding this year, Adamsons said. Border guards have 47  percent of needed vehicles not speaking about specific  technologies, he noted.    Many work organization problems also wait for solution, the  commander said. For example, several units are stationed 70  kilometers from frontier, he said.    The average discipline of guards is "rather poor," said  Adamsons, "separate unit chiefs imagine that they can take  nation-scope decisions."    During the spot check, Adamsons fired 12 officers. He,  however, denied it being "personnel cleansing" because the  sacked people were unprofessional and lacked discipline.    Adamsons called absurd the present situation when serving  border guards face 92 criminal charges or former convicts join  the staff.    The economic protection of Latvia stands the main task of  border guards in the present situation, said Adamsons. The  large quantity of imported food blocks the development of local  agriculture, he said.    According to guards' estimates, 20 percent of imported food  is contraband.    Adamsons said the brigade command will propose the  government  to allow border guards to confiscate not only the illegal cargos  but also the vehicles that carry them.    The Latvian Border Guard Brigade has a personnel of 4,000.  Around 900 border guards work on the border daily checking 8,500  Latvian citizens and 10,000 visitors.</p>

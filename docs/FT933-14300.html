			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Hunt launches 27 work-creation schemes MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, yesterday announced the formation of 27 local projects aimed at creating jobs and helping the long-term jobless. The projects, announced on the eve of publication of the latest unemployment figures, are the result of a call by the government for the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) to generate ideas to tackle local problems. An extra Pounds 25m was made available in the last Budget for the scheme, called Tec Challenge. Tecs administer the government's main training programmes for the unemployed and try to create jobs that are suitable for their areas - such as offering tailor-made training for companies wishing to take on recruits. While funding for the projects is finite, the Department of Employment may select some of them for general use should they be particularly successful. Mr Hunt said yesterday: 'I hope that some of the best schemes generated by Tec Challenge will come to be standard practice for many Tecs in future.' Ideas include: A grant of up to Pounds 75 a week for 20 weeks from Aztec, the Kingston-upon-Thames Tec, to allow people to build up a portfolio of part-time jobs. A Calderdale and Kirklees Tec plan for business start-ups based on developing new products and focused upon unemployed graduates, particularly engineers, and those with management skills. A Kent Tec project to help smaller companies expand and recruit unemployed people - with help including a recruitment subsidy. Merseyside Tec will offer a recruitment package for employers, linked to customised training. For the past four months unemployment has gone down - with various theories put forward to explain the unexpected trend. A report published today by the Employment Policy Institute, an independent think-tank, says there is little evidence to support controversial claims that unemployment has fallen as a result of an 'administrative fiddle' by the Department of Employment. The report says that the timing of the fall is probably best explained by employers 'over sacking' last year - leading to a period of 'employment readjustment' over the past few months - combined with a reduction in the number of people in the labour market. The report concludes that there is some faint ground for optimism, but it remains possible that unemployment will start to rise again in the next few months. Whatever happens, it seems unlikely that predictions of unemployment peaking well in excess of 3m, will be fulfilled. Economic Report, Volume 7.

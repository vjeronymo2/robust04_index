			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / BBC complaints reform The governors of the BBC yesterday outlined a new approach to the handling of serious complaints about corporation broadcasts as part of a reform of the accountability of the organisation. A new Programme Complaints Unit will investigate complaints on behalf of viewers and listeners. There will be a right of appeal to a sub-committee of the governors. The new procedure is part of a wider move towards increasing the accountability of the BBC, including a redefinition of the role and responsibilities of the governors as trustees of the public. This implies a less detailed intervention in the day-to-day running of the corporation than has sometimes been the case in the past. In future the governors will concentrate on: Agreeing a BBC strategy and holding management to account for its perfor-mance. Staying closely in touch with public opinion, partly through a larger number of advisory bodies. Ensuring the BBC complies with its legal and statutory obligations and internal guidelines and policies. Providing more detailed and candid reports to licence payers and parliament on the corporation's performance.</p>

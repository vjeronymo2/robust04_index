			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Earnings growth at 12-year low THE ANNUAL increase in average earnings to July was 6 per cent, the lowest rate since 1980, according to government figures published yesterday. The level provided some comfort for the Department of Employment on the day that it announced that unemployment had risen by a seasonally adjusted 47,000 in August to 2.8m. It also said that the number of stoppages through industrial action in July was 35, the lowest monthly total since 1929, and the number of working days lost in the year to July was 0.5m, the lowest annual total since records began in 1920. Industrialists and economists will focus on the unemployment figures, which on an unadjusted basis rose by 71,541 in August to 2.85m, and on the employment figures. The UK workforce in employment in June was 25.4m, a fall of 182,000 during the second quarter of the year and a reduction of 651,000 over the year to June. Continuing the pattern of the recession, unemployment continued to grow more rapidly in the south of England than in most other regions between July and August. The unemployment rate in the south-east reached 9.5 per cent in August, 0.2 percentage points above the previous month, and 9.4 per cent in the south-west, 0.3 per cent up. Recorded unemployment among men was 13.2 per cent, against 5.5 per cent for women, although that is heavily influenced by who is eligible to claim unemployment benefit. The July figure of 6 per cent for the rise in average earnings compares with 6.25 per cent in June, adjusted from the previous estimate of 6 per cent. It is likely that the figure will fall below 6 per cent within the next few months if overtime remains static and bonus payments continue to fall. The number of people on government training and employment programmes has fallen 12.3 per cent since the spring of last year, refuting the widely held view that the unemployment figures are being substantially depressed by such schemes, David Goodhart writes. The figure comes from the Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey, which was yesterday published on a quarterly basis for the first time, instead of annually. The main reason for the fall in the number of people on government schemes is demographic - with fewer young people in the population going on to Youth Training, the scheme for those aged 16 to 18.</p>

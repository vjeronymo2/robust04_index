			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Water sector alert Water shares outpaced the rest of the utilities as dealers picked up whispers that the indicative 'K factors' passed by Ofwat, the industry regulator, to the water companies three weeks ago may be more generous than originally feared. The 'K factor' is the amount by which Ofwat allows water companies to raise prices every year, over and above inflation. Fears that the regulator might impose negative factors on some water companies lay behind steep falls in water shares earlier this year. Although the K factors passed to the companies are strictly confidential, market rumours have suggested that there will be be no negative K factors and that the overall range will be from zero to 4 per cent. This would be better than the market had been expecting, and would compare favourably with the treatment meted out to British Gas, which was given an inflation minus 5 points formula, and BT, which has to work under an inflation minus 7.5 points formula. After consultations with the individual water companies, Ofwat will announce its final decision on K factors on July 28. The rumours triggered keen demand for many of the water stocks, with South West leading the sector and closing a net 6 higher at 503p. Anglian, 475p, and Southern, 512p, rose 5 apiece, while North West edged up 2 to 497p, as did Severn Trent, to 497p. Yorkshire put on 5 at 495p ahead of today's preliminary figures.</p>

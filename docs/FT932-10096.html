			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition seizes on Tory disarray MR DAVID RENDEL, the Liberal Democrat victor in the Newbury by-election, took his seat in the Commons yesterday - a day earlier than is the convention - to vote against the government last night over the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. The decision is just one sign that the opposition parties are determined to exploit the Tories' disarray and their own successes in last Thursday's elections. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was quick to condemn ministerial insistence that there would be no change in policy as a sign that the government would be not listen to clamour for change. 'The British people don't want a prime minister that just listens, they want a prime minister that hears,' he said yesterday, urging the government to change course. Labour believes there are tangible and straightforward changes that it can press the government to make on testing in schools, on rail privatisation and on the use of Group 4 Security in the prison escort service, apart from the continuing attacks over the state of the economy. The party plans to capitalise on its county election gains, hoping that in the next election campaign the new experience of an administration with a Labour input in some southern shires will give it a counter to Tory claims of what Labour would do in power. Some in the Labour party believe it should be possible to broaden its support so that it is seen not just as an urban party but one with appeal to the surrounding areas as well. Although the Liberal Democrats will continue to attack Tory 'triumphalism' at signs of recovery, their prime emphasis is on maintaining their own momentum and retaining a high profile, rather than putting pressure on the government. The party held back some policy papers - to be published over the next couple of weeks - so that they would attract maximum publicity after what were confidently expected to be good results. Speeches by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, tomorrow and at the party's spring conference, will carry further his talk of 'new politics'.</p>

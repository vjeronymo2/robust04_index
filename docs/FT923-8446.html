			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Four telecom groups may win licences: DTI plans more competition THE GOVERNMENT plans to award national telecommunications licences to four groups in one of the biggest steps to open up the UK telecommunications network to competition. The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to announce today that it plans to award public telecommunications operator licences to Ionica, a private company based in Cambridge; National Network, based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire; and World Communications, a Swiss-owned company based in the UK. It is thought the other licensee will be a US group. National Network expects to take about 4 per cent of the UK market by the end of 1996. It applied also for an international telecommunications licence in February. Ionica is a new enterprise set up by telecommunications executives. It expects to take about 5 per cent of the UK market within 10 years. The DTI is expected to invite comments from the public on its proposal to award the licences to the companies. After a two-month consultation period, the licences will have to win final approval from parliament. The development represents the first significant step in opening up the domestic telecommunications industry since cable television operators were granted the right, in the government's duopoly review, to operate local networks without the consent of either British Telecommunications or Mercury Communications. The licences are expected to lead to a number of telecommunications services for subscribers at substantially lower rates than those currently charged by BT. Ionica plans to provide national telecommunications services based on radio systems. National Network, which already provides a private telephone service over the Post Office's internal network, plans to invest about Pounds 150m in the next few years to build up its own fibre-optic network. The company already provides a telecommunications service to private customers at rates up to 30 per cent below BT's and 15 per cent below Mercury's. The new licence would enable it to extend its service to smaller customers. World Communications, which also has a private telecommunications service in the UK, expects to benefit from the international traffic opportunities that the licence would bring.</p>

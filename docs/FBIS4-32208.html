			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, SDL, by Julius Gembicky; place and date not  given: "It Will Not Be Weiss From Whom Luptak Will Take Away the  Biggest Slice of the Electoral Pie"]    [Text] The day before yesterday, we published an interview  with Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] leader Peter Weiss. An  interesting passage regarding the composition of [Jan] Luptak's  Association of Workers of Slovakia [ZRS] was left in Julius  Gembicky's notebook. It would be a pity not to print it.    [Gembicky] What are the reactions to the growing distance  between two related entities, the SDL and the ZRS, particularly  in central Slovakia, which is the ZRS's stronghold?    [Weiss] Everyone knows that the SDL has not given a final no  to cooperation with the ZRS within the framework of a coalition,  even though it was the SDL Executive Committee that had actually  founded this party. We wanted it to be a professional civic  organization that would analyze workers' problems and  communicate them to parliament. ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak seems  to have different ideas, however. What is the ZRS, actually,  and what does it represent? According to a representative  sociological survey of March 1994, as many as 30 percent of ZRS  supporters had previously been Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] supporters; 12 percent had been SDL supporters;  6 percent had been Social Democratic Party in Slovakia  supporters; 8 percent had previously supported the Slovak  National Party, the Christian Democratic Movement, and the  Hungarian parties; and 4 percent had been supporters of the  Democratic Party. In other words, the ZRS is a manifestation of  workers' discontent with all parties, and it is not just a  problem for the SDL, as has sometimes being argued. After all,  only 25 percent of ZRS members subscribe to left-wing values. We  have never underestimated the importance of the workers  movement, but we have always refused to follow the path of  outdoing one another in unrealistic promises.    Faced with glances full of expectations, whether it was in  Spisska Nova Ves or at a meeting with female textile workers of  the Lykotex Revuca company, we never yielded to the politician's  temptation to proclaim in loud voice: We are going to resolve  everything, we will guarantee your jobs. We want to do it, but  not by means of cheap promises. But our offer of postelection  cooperation with the ZRS is still on the table.</p>

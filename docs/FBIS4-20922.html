			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed EE/BN: `The `New Forum' Replaces COCOM -- A </F> Good Decision According to the Swiss Delegation'; as released by  Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Amsterdam, 31 Mar (ATS) -- The COCOM [Coordinating  Committee on Export Controls] has been dismantled. The  coordinating committee on the unilateral control of exports of  high-technology weapons to the former East bloc countries will  now be called the "New Forum." Its structure has been slightly  modified. The decision was made at the two-day conference in  Wassenaar near The Hague. The Swiss delegation welcomes this  arrangement.    Rolf Jeker, a member of the Federal Office for Foreign  Economic Affairs (OFAEE), said that this was a reasonable  decision as far as security policy is concerned. Some  transparency in the export of weapons is a good thing, the Swiss  delegation head told ATS.  <H5>  Swiss Membership </H5>   So far, Switzerland has cooperated with COCOM only on an  independent basis. Following the example of Sweden, Finland,  Ireland, and New Zealand, it became a fully fledged member of  the "New Forum," however.    Last November, at the first "high-level meeting" [preceding  three words in English], COCOM's 17 member countries (Japan,  Australia as well as all NATO countries excluding Iceland)  acknowledged that the organization had no more reason to exist  given the end of the Cold War. At the second meeting in the  Netherlands, the members decided definitively to disband it.  <H5>  Interim Period </H5>   The disbandment of the organization will leave no  international convention on military property and dual-purpose  items (that also can be used for defense) during the interim  period, until October, when the "New Forum" is set up. During  this period the member states will have to reinforce the  controls on their national exports.    A working group will draw up a new list of products, while  another will set up an information exchange system. The "New  Forum" will have to expand as quickly as possible. Russia could  be present at the next meeting in October. China, Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are seen as important  possible new members.</p>

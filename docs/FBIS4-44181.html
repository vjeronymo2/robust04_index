			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Bernd Schmidbauer, state minister </F> in the Chancellor's Office, by Udo Ulfkotte in Bonn on 22 June:  "`Russia Pursuing Aggressive Spying Activities'"]    [Text] Even after the end of the East-West conflict, the  FRG remains the main target of eastern espionage. While some  countries of the former Eastern Bloc, such as Hungary, have  reduced their intelligence activities in Germany considerably,  Russia is "now, as then, pursuing very aggressive spying  activities, particularly in the military sphere." This was said  by State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who is responsible for  coordinating the intelligence services in the Federal  Chancellor's Office, in an interview with FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE. Schmidbauer called on Russia to also adapt its  intelligence efforts to the changed political situation. The  "methods of the Cold War" must be "reduced step by step." We  have "not noticed anything yet" regarding the "necessary drastic  reduction" in Russia's intelligence activities in Germany, the  state minister said.    The Federal Intelligence Service [BND] office in Moscow --  one of more than 70 BND facilities in other countries -- was  trying to increase cooperation with Russian intelligence  services for the fight against organized crime and the  prevention of nuclear smuggling. In the past few years, the BND  has been able to get an insight into the logistics of those  eastern smugglers that want to sell weapons-grade nuclear  material on the European market. It is in this sphere that  cooperation with the eastern intelligence services is beginning  "to work." The BND has repeatedly "uncovered the smuggling of  nuclear material" without informing the public. In most cases,  the nuclear material appeared only in small quantities, mostly  samples. In the past few years there has "hardly been a sphere  in which the BND's effectiveness could not be proved  convincingly," Schmidbauer said. It is due to the BND's  activities that there was "not a second al-Rabitah," and in the  "Mykonos trial" in Berlin the "BND's contribution has also been  obvious."    As a result of the changed situation after the end of the  East-West conflict, the tasks have become more varied for the  BND. Apart from proliferation, organized crime, money  laundering, refugee smuggling and narcotics trade had become new  areas in which the German intelligence services have become  active. "Those who are aware of the increase in such crimes in  those spheres know that, without the necessary information on  the logistics and the background of these criminal  organizations, we are unable to develop sensible defense  strategies at home," Schmidbauer said. The new tasks of the BND  require new investments as a result of the advance in  technology. The participation in an intelligence satellite  alone will "cost several hundred millions of German marks." The  ultimate decision on Germany's participation in the French or  the U.S. project is still pending. The decisionmaking process  will involve fundamental issues in terms of security, foreign,  economic, and research policy. While the U.S. satellites that  are used for military purposes are said to have a resolution of  30 centimeters, most maps in the BND archives in Pullach have a  resolution of only 10 meters. Cuts in BND personnel have  reached the "absolute limit." The objective is to streamline  the administration by 1996/97 and recruit "new experts in the  spheres of organized crime, money laundering, and the narcotics  trade."    Asked whether, apart from Iran, the BND had relations with  other countries suspected of supporting international terrorism,  too, Schmidbauer said: "Intelligence services must have such  contacts. They must conduct critical dialogue. They must get  information. They are involved in the fates of abducted Germans  or Germans in captivity. We cannot always chose our partners in  the talks. A lot of what we describe as critical dialogue has  yielded positive results -- for German citizens abroad, for the  liberation of hostages, for the search of terrorists even on our  own territory. We have to rely on such contacts."    Of the about 6,500 BND employees, 3,500 are working in the  headquarters at Pullach; others work in the 70 branch offices  abroad (from Prague to Moscow and Damascus) or other facilities  in Germany. The BND collects at least 80 percent of its  information from open sources, mainly newspapers: from 1.5  million reports per year. Compared to that, "human sources"  provide "only" about 80,000 reports, and technological  intelligence provides some 100,000 reports. Moreover, there are  about 12,000 documents provided by ambassadors each year and the  reports from about 200 other intelligence services in the world  with which the BND cooperates. On the basis of the huge amount  of material collected, analysts in Pullach issue publications  that are distributed to ministries, the Bundeswehr, and others  with the note VS [Verschlussache -- classified document]. BND  agents have told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that the procurement of  military material from abroad "has always helped" to lower the  enormous costs of the Defense Ministry, for example when "one  got hold of Russian tanks of the most recent design," which were  then tested for their vulnerability.</p>

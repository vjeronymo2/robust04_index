			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN OF NIGHT GETS GIRLS OFF THE STREET, BACK HOME  </P> <P> Christina was a prostitute at 12, a mother at 15 and a heroin addict at 16.  Now, almost 8 years after she left her house following a fight with her father,  she's finally going home. This time, she says, it's for good.  </P> <P> Christina is one of the success stories of Children of the Night, a Los  Angeles-based project that tries to get young prostitutes off the streets. The  organization, founded in 1979 by sociologist Dr. Lois Lee, has served almost  5,000 youngsters, getting 80% of them off the streets and back home.  </P> <P> Organization volunteers work Harbor and Beach boulevards in Orange County  because they have become regular stops on the West Coast circuit for  prostitutes. The streets, Lee says, are full of young girls like Christina.  </P> <P> Christina (not her real name) knows the streets of Orange County well. It was  in Santa Ana where she was last arrested for prostitution, and it was in the  Orange County Jail where she decided she had had enough. In a telephone  interview just hours before catching a plane back to Seattle, she told her  story:  </P> <P> "I was adopted when I was real young," she begins. "And one day my dad came  home drunk and he was mad at me. He said, 'Since you don't want to follow my  rules I'll tell you you are adopted and you can find your own parents.' I was  really hurt by that. I was 12, you know. I got hurt real easy. (So) I went to  downtown Seattle and met a girl, and from there it was history."  </P> <P> Scared and alone, Christina latched on to the first person who was nice to her.  It turned out to be a pimp named Gerald, the first of what would become a long  line of pimps and protectors.  </P> <P> "So I meet Gerald, and Gerald pretty much says, 'Baby, there is a better way,  and if you come with me I'll show you.' I was looking for stability, and I  figured he would be the person."  </P> <P> Within weeks, Christina was converted from innocent sixth-grader to prostitute.  She immediately went on the circuit with Gerald, driving to Seattle, Tacoma,  Wash., Portland, Ore., and Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> Everything she made went to Gerald. In turn, Gerald bought her food and  clothes, paid for their motel rooms and bought her cigarettes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Take It All  </P> <P> "The pimps don't let you have nothing," she said. "They take it all. Oh, maybe  some cigarette money. I was making $700 on an average night, anywhere from  $1,000 to $1,500 on a good night. But they take it all. You don't give it to  them and you've got trouble."  </P> <P> She also learned, quickly, several unbending rules held by the pimps: no drugs,  and keep yourself clean. A drug habit can be costly, and pimps don't want their  girls spending his money on drugs, she said.  </P> <P> As for fear of AIDS, Christina said the circuit girls always use condoms. The  pimps see to that.  </P> <P> "They don't want you getting sick," she said. "But hell, you can only take so  many precautions. You can get it anywhere. It doesn't have to be a prostitute  or a trick."  </P> <P> In the beginning, she said, she "wasn't really scared because I didn't have any  bad dates. In my later years I became hard. . . . Things have happened so many  times to me. It doesn't faze me anymore. You have bad dates where someone tries  to get their money back or rapes you or hits you. That happens a lot,  especially in California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jungle Out There  </P> <P> "It's a jungle out there. It can take your life. Cynthia -- she was a friend --  she was killed, and another girlfriend was stabbed in Portland. A man chopped  Ceci's head off for taking his briefcase."  </P> <P> In 1986, Gerald went to prison and, Christina said, she spent 9 months in a  youth authority home near Seattle. The partnership broke up, but soon she was  back on the streets.  </P> <P> "I got out and met a man named Nate, who was another pimp. I met him in Oregon.  Nate took me to San Francisco and Anaheim and Santa Ana, Hawaii, Houston, San  Diego and Denver and Colorado Springs and Albuquerque. This is the circuit here  in California. We'd keep moving."  </P> <P> "We'd hit the highway. I didn't decide anything. I went where he wanted to go  and I liked it. Pimps collaborate on where they think it might be going on . .  . places that attract money or tourists. I just went where he told me to go."  </P> <P> Christina said Orange County was on the circuit "because it's full of people  that have plenty of money. At the beginning it was pretty easy, but at the end,  just recently, the Santa Ana police got real hard on us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quit Prostitution  </P> <P> Christina then became pregnant for the first time and had her first child. She  quit prostitution just long enough to drop the baby off with her parents in  Seattle and return. Last July she gave birth to her second child. That one too  was dropped off with her parents.  </P> <P> The fathers of both children were her pimps, she said.  </P> <P> Christina said she left Nate 9 months ago and "I've been through about four  (pimps) since then." She said it is common for girls to change pimps.  </P> <P> "It's a law of the game," she said. "If a woman leaves, she has to go to  another pimp. You give him a choosing fee and you go with him. The fee is  anywhere from $500, tops $1,000. First of all you look for a pimp that doesn't  do drugs with your money and one who will buy you clothes and make you look  good, someone who looks to have something in life."  </P> <P> "The pimps, they don't care if you leave. They just say, 'Man, we don't chase  them, we replace them.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrested in Crackdown  </P> <P> Christina was arrested in a recent Santa Ana crackdown on prostitution. She  spent 13 days in the women's jail and decided she would go home. When she was  released last week, she called a 24-hour hot line operated by Children of the  Night and was picked up and taken to the group's offices in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There was a pimp who was looking for me. I didn't want to see him," she said.  </P> <P> "I'm fed up; I'm through. Eight years is plenty to realize that there is a  better way. I'm going back to Seattle tonight.  </P></p>

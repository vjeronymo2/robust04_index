			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: MURDER TRIAL OF HARE KRISHNA DEVOTEE NEAR END  </P> <P> The prosecution began its closing arguments Wednesday in the trial of a Hare  Krishna devotee charged with murdering a critic of the faith.  </P> <P> Thomas Drescher, 42, is charged with the March 22, 1986, murder of Stephen L.  Bryant, a disillusioned Krishna follower who had called for the death of  Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada, Drescher's spiritual leader.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Drescher shot Bryant twice in the head with a  .45-caliber pistol as the victim sat in his parked van a few blocks from the  Hare Krishna temple in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris is scheduled to finish his arguments Monday  in Van Nuys Superior Court, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district  attorney's office. The trial is expected to go to the jury by the middle of  next week, she said.  </P> <P> Bryant, of Royal Oak, Mich., died about a year after launching a crusade  against Bhaktipada, whom Bryant accused of drug trafficking, prostitution and  child abuse.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Energy: A New Age," Aug. 10) regarding the need for action in  the area of energy conservation calls for some comment.  </P> <P> Your proposals to force builders to incorporate energy conservation gimmicks in  their new construction sounds like yet another well-intentioned attempt to  provide for the common good. To your credit, you do recognize the disruptions  to be expected but your proposed solutions sound awful.  </P> <P> You propose tax incentives to cushion the builder from the economic adversity  brought upon him by your laws, and low-interest loans for the home buyer so  that he may be able to afford to buy. Both of these proposals will exacerbate  the most pressing economic problems that we face today.  </P> <P> The tax benefits will reduce tax revenues collected from the builders and the  low-interest loans will undermine the solvency of the financial sector. The net  effect on the deficit and the need for a government bailout of the savings and  loan industry should make us pause for thought.  </P> <P> We should ask ourselves if the mechanism of the market is truly inadequate to  guide the home builders and home buyers in their economic decisions. Are we  sure that they are doing such a poor job of planning? Our free markets have  done quite well in the past as they diverted us from the perils of running out  of leather, wood, whale oil, and rubber.  </P> <P> Perhaps our Public Utilities Commission planners and your editors will be  surprised at how well industry will provide for our energy needs and how well  the public will respond to change.  </P> <P> EMILE M. MULLICK  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

The proposed improvement will involve the reconstruction of the existing route from the northern terminus of Interstate 684 to Putnam County Route 65, Putnam Lake Road, a distance of 2.9 miles. Also under consideration in this proposal is construction of a grade separated interchange at Putnam County Route 54, Milltown Road. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project proposes to improve traffic operation and safety on the existing route. The proposed action is consistent with the NYSDOT transportation improvement program for the Route 22 corridor, between Interstate Route 684 and Route 55, which has been studied by the FHWA and NYSDOT since 1980. In 1990, the Route 22 Corridor Development Study_Final Project Development Report was completed. the Corridor Development Study identified existing traffic operation and safety problems, projected significant future increases in traffic demand, identified needed highway improvements and recommended in implementation plan. Improvement of Route 22 between Interstate Route 684 and County Route 65, Putnam Lake Road, was recommended, as were other improvements within the corridor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action, (2) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four lanes with a flush median and improved intersections; (3) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four lanes divided by a median barrier and with turning lanes at intersections; and (4) congestion management system strategies. Variations to horizonal and vertical alignment and the possible provision of an interchange at Milltown Road will also be studied with the various build alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on studies done to date, issues that need to be analyzed in depth include the impacts on noise, air and water quality, cultural resources, floodplains, and adjacent right of way. The project's effect on features such as Bog Brook Reservoir and East Branch will also be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in this proposal. If necessary, a scoping meeting will be held with involved Federal, State and local agencies. A public information meeting will be held after additional study. The EIS will be made available for agency and public review and comment, after which a public hearing will be held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or NYSDOT at the addresses provided above.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Research, Planning and Construction.

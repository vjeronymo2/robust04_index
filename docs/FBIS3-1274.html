			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Italcized passages in English] </F>   [Text] An Independent Electoral Commission delegation held  talks in Ulundi today with King Goodwill Zwelithini, Dr.  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on  free political activity in the country. We are in direct  contact with Gary Alfonso in Ulundi.    [Begin recording] [Alfonso] Good evening from the KwaZulu  Legislative Assembly's building in Ulundi where Justice Johann  Kriegler is still being bombarded with questions by the kwaZulu  Legislative Assembly members, posing questions on the  commission's plans for kwaZulu concerning the election and free  political activity in the KwaZulu-Natal region. Chief Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, King Goodwill Zwelithini, and Justice  Kriegler have already addressed the assembly. However, the  reception of Justice Kriegler and his members, including veteran  politician Helen Suzman, can best be described as cool. The  judge was jeered when he referred to statements made by the  king, who said that he could not tell his people to vote, and  the judge was also interrupted several times by members of the  Legislative Assembly when he attempted to explain what he and  his council members, stationed in kwaZulu-Natal, are planning  for the region. This footage recorded earlier this evening can  best describe the reception of the Independent Electoral  Commission here in Ulundi and also the addresses by the king and  Dr. Buthelezi.    [Zwelithini] The kingdom of kwaZulu remains sovereign  and now we seek our freedom and we seek social, economic, and  political justice from within that sovereign kingdom. Even  today, sir, as I address you and your commissioners I cannot  advise my people that the correct thing for them to do is to  vote in the forthcoming election.    [Kriegler] His Majesty expressly did not say it would  be incorrect for his people to vote. He said he could not  advise them to vote. Mark those words. [laughter from crowd]  Can I ask you...can I ask you to afford me the same courtesy  that your king and his prime minister afforded me -- to hear me  out. Can I be afforded that courtesy, please?    [Buthelezi] Your interests are to secure free and fair  elections for all those who want to vote in compliance with the  law and my interests are to persuade the electorate not to vote  in compliance with the decision of our party. How do we deal  with each other, sir, across a situation in which what you do  serves your interest and works against not what I do, but  against what my people do, without me instructing them or  without direction. This could mean that in terms of the act  under which you work, what my people do and what you do may make  me a criminal. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / People: More rooms at the Inns - As the world's biggest hotel company continues its breakneck expansion, president Michael Leven tells Michael Skapinker that he will match quality to quantity When Michael Leven joined Holiday Inn in 1990, he engaged the services of an Atlanta-based British woman who teaches Americans how to deal with UK companies. Holiday Inn had recently been taken over by Bass, the UK brewer, and Leven, who grew up in Boston, was worried about committing some indiscretion. 'Americans are scared to death of doing the wrong thing,' he says. His memories of what the consultant taught him are hazy. But whatever it was, it seems to have worked. Earlier this month, Leven, 56, was promoted from head of the Americas division to president and chief operating officer of Holiday Inn Worldwide, giving him responsibility for the day-to-day running of the world's biggest hotel company. Over the past two years, Holiday Inn, which has more than 1,900 hotels, has been opening new properties at the rate of one every two days. It plans to have 3,000 by the end of 1998. Much of the expansion will be abroad. Hotels outside the Americas currently provide Holiday Inn with 10 per cent of its profits, but Leven wants to see that rise to 33 per cent over the next four years. His anxiety about running an international, UK-owned business has disappeared, although he has made some adjustments to style. One of the things he does remember his consultant telling him was that UK companies were more formal than American ones. 'She said that I had to remember that most British business people think that Americans shoot from the hip. She was right. That was very helpful. When I wanted to do something I made sure I had all the documentation.' Leven says Bass has become less formal in the four years he has been there. In the beginning, however, he was struck by the manner in which Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn's British chairman and chief executive, conducted meetings. Langton began by noting the apologies, a procedure which was new to Leven. He says: 'In the States, if a guy doesn't show up, he doesn't show up.' Other than that, he thinks the problems of working across national boundaries have been exaggerated. 'People have made doing business internationally into a mystique. It's easy when things aren't going right to make the excuse that it's because the people are different. Oftentimes, things don't go right when people aren't different.' Everyone, he says, has been asking how he and Langton, who remains chairman and chief executive, are going to divide duties between them. Bass says Langton, 57, will focus on strategic issues, while Leven takes responsibility for hotel operations and sales. Leven says that companies often want their two top executives to have different skills: for one to be strong in finance, for example, and the other in marketing. In the case of Langton and Leven this is not so. They have similar backgrounds having specialised in the operational side of the business. And their personalities are not dissimilar; both are accomplished raconteurs. Leven says: 'It's not the usual balance between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer. But the real advantage I have working with Bryan is that he understands Bass and how to move through it.' Before joining Holiday Inn, Leven spent five years as president of the US chain Days Inn. He has spent his entire working life in the hotel industry, except for nine months in the late 1960s when he was employed at the Practising Law Institute in New York. His job there was to make hotel bookings for the institute's meetings. He was appalled by what he saw. 'I got to understand what a hotel was like from the customer's point of view. I learned how badly customers were treated.' Leven has also had a taste of life as a Holiday Inn franchise holder. While he was working as head of operations for a company which ran a Holiday Inn under a franchise agreement, there was a disagreement on how much to spend on refurbishing a hotel. Leven suffered the indignity of being thrown out of the system. It is something he has done to many other hotel owners since. The company only owns about 10 per cent of the hotels that carry its name. The rest are run by franchise-holders. Bass found that many were run down, particularly in the US, and that the Holiday Inn name had been badly damaged as a result. Veterans in the company found it difficult to accept that this had happened. Holiday Inn had been launched in 1952 with the specific intention of providing travellers with a guaranteed level of quality and no unpleasant surprises. Kemmons Wilson, its founder, built the first Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, after deciding that there had to be something better than the appalling hotels he had encountered on his travels round the US. Langton moved the company's headquarters from Memphis to Atlanta and cut headquarters staff from 2,450 to 1,000. Leven's first job at Holiday Inn was to raise the franchised hotels' standards. It is a task he says is not yet complete. 'I am not happy with a piece of the chain where the quality and service standards are still behind what they should be,' he says. Leven estimates that about 15 per cent of Holiday Inns in the Americas still have unsatisfactory standards. He would be happier if the figure fell to 5 per cent - which he says should happen by the beginning of 1997. He insists, however, that much has been done to rescue the name since the Bass takeover. Of the 1,600 Holiday Inns in the Americas, almost 1,000 have been fully refurbished. But how will Holiday Inn maintain standards if it expands as rapidly as it says it will? Over the past two years, the company has signed joint venture agreements with local partners to open 30 hotels in Indonesia, 47 in Thailand, 70 in India and 11 in Nepal. It will also manage two luxury cruise ships in China. Over the next five years, franchisees and joint venture partners will build 60 hotels in Europe. Leven says: 'We don't have quality problems with the hotels we open. It's the older ones that have problems.' The question that intrigues analysts in the leisure industry is whether, if the expansion goes smoothly, Leven's reward will be the chairmanship when Langton retires. But the difficulty here is that executive directors on the Bass board have to leave at 60; though US Holiday Inn employees can continue until 65, Leven is only a year younger than Langton and would be near the board age limit when Langton retires. Bass insists that nothing should be read into Leven's promotion except that he has a job to do. Leven concedes that if he fails to meet Holiday Inn's targets, that sort of conjecture would be irrelevant anyway.</p>

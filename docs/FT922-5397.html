			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A three-city conundrum THE WEEK has belonged to Nemesis, a goddess who could have taught scorned wives a thing or two about come-uppance. Britain's trade figures revive the nightmare of growth constrained by balance of payments worries. The once-great Alan Bond is in prison. And with Mountleigh in receivership and Canary Wharf in administration, the banks face new write-offs of up to Pounds 1bn - a sum which will be substantially enlarged by the steady flow of smaller and largely unremarked corporate failures. Yet the London market fell only fractionally on Thursday, after the Canary Wharf news, and more than recovered its losses yesterday; while in New York and Tokyo, where the banks are exposed to almost any major failure in the world, stocks rose. This apparently paradoxical behaviour is at least consistent, and is easy to explain: there is no surprise in the last acts of dramas which have been playing in public view for months and even years. Markets move only in response to the unexpected, and they like to have uncertainties resolved. In any case, failures in the property field are in one sense good news; receivers and administrators will respond more readily than developers to market conditions, and cut prices far enough to bring important new developments into productive use. Moreover, if Canary Wharf moves down-market, it may ease competitive pressures in more favoured parts of London by reducing the gross oversupply at the top end of the office market, and so offer some hope to other troubled developers. Property bubble A longer view, however, suggests a paradox which is not so easy to explain. The property bubble was an international one, inflated by excessive credit from Japan and from all the English-speaking banking systems; yet since it burst, the Tokyo market has fallen by well over 50 per cent, the London market has moved to new nominal highs (though it is still below 1987 levels in real terms) while Wall Street has risen to ever more hopeful multiples, and extended the performance yesterday. Since investors are often told that they must spread their risks through what has become a single world capital market, these extreme divergencies are not only puzzling, but worrying. On the face of it, the capital markets are telling us that the Japanese miracle is finally over, that Britain is still stuck in much the same groove, but that in the US the worst is over, and the world's biggest economy may become its leader again. That message is true only in a comparative sense. Japanese self-confidence has indeed suffered a major blow, with little immediate hope of recovery, while the London market has long been resigned to a long, hard slog out of debt and excessive costs within the ERM. It is only New York's performance, against a background of slow growth, trade squabbles and start-ling political disillusion, which is now arousing fears of a new bubble, which could burst as it did in 1987. To get any further than these generalisations, which probably represent the consensus view, one must look in a little more detail at what drives the three markets. Bearish glosses The savings of the personal sector provide the basic drive, monetary policy the most important constraint; and here the three markets differ widely. In Japan savings flows remain vast, but there has been a monetary squeeze which in terms of national experience has been as fierce as Mr Paul Volcker's deflation of the US economy in 1979-82. Policy is now easing, but not fast enough to satisfy the Ministry of Finance, which issues bearish glosses even on favourable figures (a practice which may damp investors' confidence, but no more than the British official habit of looking relentlessly for a supposed bright side). Above all, Japanese savers, including the insurance companies and others who invest on their behalf, have been frightened by repeated financial scandals, and have been diverting funds abroad. The Japanese collapse has therefore supported rather than undermined other markets. (A revival in Tokyo might be a different story.) In Britain, personal savings are high and rising, and have been fed directly into the market through high unit trust sales. Cynics may read this as a sell signal, on the view that the little man is always too late; but yields remain high by international standards, and the economic news is not nearly as bad as it may look. The trade balance, especially, reflects heavy inward investment, which is a sign of promise, not of trouble. It is in the US, again, that the pattern of support could be worrying: it comes not from savings flows, which remain depressed, but from switching out of savings deposits and money funds, as interest rates have been cut again and again. This switch reduces the money supply, as companies seize the opportunity to fund debt, but the fall provokes calls for still further easing of policy. The US corporate balance sheet looks much healthier as a result, but the policy trend is not sustainable. In a market which has become so obsessed with interest rates that it treats bad news of the economy as a bull signal, a tightening could cause an ugly awakening.</p>

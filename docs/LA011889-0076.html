			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAIN MAN'S KIN OFFERED '7-FIGURE' SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The state has offered a cash settlement of at least $1 million to the family of  an off-duty Rapid Transit District bus driver shot to death by a California  Highway Patrol officer during a traffic stop in 1986, sources said.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the state and the family of Yusuf Bilal, 38, met throughout the  day Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement on the proposed settlement.  </P> <P> Investigators said Bruce M. Moats, a motorcycle officer, stopped Bilal's car on  South Broadway for allegedly running a red light on March 18, 1986. They said  Moats jabbed Bilal with a baton when Bilal was slow to get out of the car as  ordered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat of Attack  </P> <P> Moats, 38, said he fired his gun after Bilal wrested away the baton and  threatened to attack him. The officer said he acted in self-defense, fearing  for his life.  </P> <P> Bilal's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court  seeking damages "in the millions." While the terms of the proposal that would  settle the lawsuit were not disclosed, sources close to the case said the state  offered at least "seven figures." The settlement offer was made Friday. Trial  of the lawsuit had been scheduled to start Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's unjust the way Yusuf was murdered," Robert Johnson, 39, Bilal's brother,  told reporters Tuesday outside the downtown court office where attorneys for  the family and the state were meeting.  </P> <P> "My brother was just trying to defend himself," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson was joined in the Courthouse hallway by Bilal's wife, Naseem, daughter,  Nazihah, 2, and sons Abdullah, 6, and Adur Raham, 3. Citing insufficient  evidence to prove that a crime occurred, the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office declined to prosecute Moats for the shooting.  </P> <P> A 20-page report by Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard B. Healey concluded in August,  1986, that when Moats shot Bilal, he did so in the belief that he was in  serious danger.  </P> <P> However, despite the decision not to file a complaint, Healey said he and other  investigators were "not happy" with the tactics Moats used when he stopped  Bilal's car about 2 p.m. March 18, 1986.  </P> <P> The district attorney's report said that after ordering Bilal several times to  step out of the car, Moats pulled out his baton, opened the front door on the  driver's side and jabbed Bilal to reinforce his orders.  </P> <P> "Exactly what happened next is the subject of much dispute," the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Struggle Ensued  </P> <P> According to the report, nine witnesses heard shouts of anger and saw the  ensuing struggle, but "the stories told . . . are often at odds with each other  on points of critical importance."  </P> <P> After sorting through these contradictions, the investigators finally concluded  that "Moats and Bilal struggled for possession of the baton . . . Moats lost  the baton . . . (and Moats) fired three shots at Bilal, hitting him in the  back."  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officers arriving moments after the shooting said they found  Bilal sprawled on his back outside the car with his right leg extending through  the open driver's door. They said they found the baton on the floor in front of  the driver's seat.  </P> <P> The report said the jabbing with the baton "might have been 'unreasonable' in  the sense that it was demeaning and inflammatory and much likelier to excite  further resistance than it was to extinguish resistance."  </P></p>

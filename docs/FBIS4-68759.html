			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Petru Lucinschi, chairman of the parliament </F> of Moldova, by Arkadiy Romm; place and date not given: "You Need  To Dress for the Weather"]    [Text] Petru Lucinschi, the present chairman of the  parliament of Moldova, was not that long ago Petr Kirillovich  Luchinskiy, first secretary of the Moldavian Central Committee  and then secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.    One of "yesterday's men who has surprisingly discovered  the present and, in addition, has a pretty good views for the  future. The smile of fortune or the art of political survival?  What does Mr. Lucinschi himself think about this?    [Romm] Brazauskas, Aliyev, Shevardnadze, Lucinschi.... One  has the feeling that the former republics of the USSR have begun  to pine for the leaders of the CPSU. Perhaps it is a question of  the increased "buoyancy" of the former party leaders--they  emerge from all scrapes?    [Lucinschi] Forgive me, but who started these "scrapes"? No  one today cares to recall the ideas we presented in those times.  That same Brazauskas and Shevardnadze, how they came in for it  in those days! I was hit also, and there was reason--just read  our public speeches of that time. Yes, we wanted change, how  everything turned out is another matter. Not the best it could  have been, to be blunt.    That which is new gradually grows out of the past. I do not  believe that we are people of the old system because we not only  proposed transformations but took part in them also. This is the  first point. The second: In the old days also I was not so much  appointed as elected, from the elections to the Kishinev  University Hostel Council to election as secretary of the CPSU  Central Committee. If people elect, consequently, they value.    We change together with life. I do not recognize politicians  of whom it is said that their position is unshakable. When a  person goes out, and it is raining, he opens his umbrella. Is  dressing for the weather a retreat from principles? Of course,  there are constant human values: kindness, love of motherland,  integrity, finally. Political reference points are conditioned  by life's demands. In one case one thing is suitable, in  another, something else. It does not seem to me that in the  former republics of the USSR people are being racked by  nostalgia for the former times. It is more a desire for  stability. And we are required to satisfy this desire of the  people. If we cannot, we will be replaced by others.    [Romm] Today's political type and the Soviet political  type--how much do they differ, in your view?    [Lucinschi] The former was more beset by complexes and  oriented toward restrictions, stereotypes. There could be no  dissertation, no speech, say, without quotations from Lenin and  Brezhnev. There was more of a bifurcation at that time: There  was politics "on the job" and "domestic" politics. Although we,  the last generation of politicians of the Soviet Union, adhered  less to the canons and argued more. Now, however, a politician  is more unfettered and more decisive not only in his views but  in his actions also. True, many people are commenting that there  is too much argument and far from always on a point of  substance. The lack of inhibition sometimes exceeds all  permissible bounds.    Previously everyone understood that it was necessary to get  along with those at the top. If you were held in some esteem  there, your career was assured. Now, on the contrary,  politicians orient themselves only toward those below them. Our  members of parliament, say, it is quite difficult to unite them  for collective action. Everyone tries to please his electorate  first and foremost.    [Romm] Does it not seem to you, Petru Kirillovich, that had  you not fallen foul of the first putsch, you would have fallen  foul of the second?    [Lucinschi] Possibly. Too much is usually demanded of a  politician--an instantaneous response to complex events. The  national leadership at that time criticized us for our slow  response to the events of August 1991. During the second  putsch--rebukes once again, aimed at the Russian leadership this  time. But this is life. And had things taken a different turn?  Restraint is needed in such cases. Had I fallen foul of the  second putsch, once again I would have been in no hurry.    [Romm] Can you distinguish in yourself, as a politician,  your  strongest and weakest traits?    [Lucinschi] My strong side is my weak side also--I do not  form "my team," I rely on those with whom I happen to work.  Trusting those around me, I have, of course, been "burned"--not  everyone next to one is sincere. But it is better this way than  trusting no one.    [Romm] Whether it is true or not, it is said that you feel  quite lonely on Moldova's political Olympus.    [Lucinschi] Before becoming speaker of parliament, I held  dozens of election meetings and socialized with thousands of  people. Aside from planned meetings at enterprises, there was  informal street contact also. It seemed to me that many people  link their particular hopes with me. This restrains me each time  it suddenly occurs to me to change the nature of my occupation.  Am I lonely in this office? No, I do not experience loneliness.  I experience another feeling--regret. It jars on me when our  bureaucrat, having built a home and purchased a car, puts up one  further little mansion and purchases yet another Mercedes--with  dishonest money. Ours is a small republic, everything is in  public view. If it is lonely, it comes from helplessness at  being unable to bring order to bear.    [Romm] What will it take for this? You once said that  Moldova  needs 1,500 laws. When will you have prepared and adopted them?    [Lucinschi] A great deal of time will be needed, of course.  But the present parliament, elected according to the  proportional system, did in the first several weeks as much as  the previous one did in six months. I said before the elections  even that if one of the 13 parties that were fighting for seats  in parliament were to obtain a majority, this would be the best  thing. Otherwise we would once again be bogged down in  intrapolitical struggle. I do not know of an instance in world  practice of some member of parliament being answerable for  having voted wrongly. It is usually the party that won the  elections that is responsible. Had we not had a victorious  majority here, we would have the same situation as in Russia,  say. For what and to whom is Zhirinovskiy with his 22 percent of  the vote responsible? Our Agrarian-Democratic Party, however,  with which I am affiliated, has 54 percent of the seats in  parliament. The parliamentary majority has formed a government  accountable to both parliament and the people. An effective  mechanism of power has come about.    [Romm] It was this, evidently, which secured the swift  ratification of the treaty on Moldova's membership of the CIS  also?    [Lucinschi] It was not so much politics as economics that  prompted this decision. The manufacturers were telling us: Give  us an outlet to the market. What kind of a parliament are we  unless we create the necessary conditions for them? I was asked  whether we would not be politically dependent on the CIS  countries here. I replied: Of course we will be. What small  countries are not politically dependent on big ones? This  dependence does not frighten me, I failed to understand right  from the outset why we had to reject the CIS.    [Romm] Will this ratification change relations between  Moldova and Romania, in your view?    [Lucinschi] I would not say so. We have emphasized  repeatedly  right from the start that Moldova wants to develop as an  independent state in friendship with neighbors and other  countries. That some politicians of Romania view our decision as  a sign of a cooling and even of a break with them altogether is  another matter. But what there is in our common history, in the  culture--this is here to stay. The common language itself  presupposes closer human contact. The statements of our previous  parliament and of a number of political parties were presented  such that the people of Moldova want to unite with Romania. But  sociological surveys have said that this is not so. It was no  accident that the party that advocated unification with Romania  mustered only 0.3 percent of the vote at the last elections.    [Romm] We have heard in Moldova repeatedly: We are not  Moldovans, we are Romanians. You do not consider yourself a  Romanian?    [Lucinschi] My parents and my forebears were Moldavians.  Hence, I am a Moldavian also. And the majority of inhabitants of  our state feels this way. After all, Moldova has had its own  history since the 14th century. This was, as we know, the  northernmost province of the Roman Empire, this was why the  ethnonyms "Roman" and "Romanian" became prevalent. Some people  call themselves Romanians now also. I am not allergic to this.  If this is what you call yourself, so be it.    [Romm] The previous parliament relinquished its authority on  account of it being unable to untie the "Tiraspol knot." Will  not the present parliament depart for the same reason?    [Lucinschi] That corps of deputies was unable to handle any  serious problem, specially such a major one as this. Now,  however, we have quite a number of pragmatists who are not  obsessed with extremes. The Tiraspol leaders themselves are  saying that with the accession to power of the  Agrarian-Democratic Party a real opportunity for resolving this  problem has appeared.    [Romm] And what have you personally done to bring the banks  of the Dniester closer together?    [Lucinschi] Inasmuch as the 14th Army is in the Dniester  region, inasmuch as the self-proclaimed republic is supported by  certain forces in Russia, and inasmuch as Russia is linked with  this conflict in general, settling it without it is impossible.  This is why I insisted that Russia appoint its representative,  who would assume the role of mediator and be constantly up to  date. Moscow agreed, and negotiating is now easier.    [Romm] You are being called the future president of Moldova.  Is there any basis for this talk?    [Lucinschi] We will have presidential elections here in 1996  so there need be no hurry. When I began my work in parliament,  the press began to constantly set Snegur and myself against one  another. It would like, evidently, to organize some conflict. I  believe, however, that since we have been elected, we should  work together--otherwise it will be bad for everyone. In a word,  all in good time. Who knows what the alignment will be in 1996?  I have experience of how changeable society's affections are,  and I am not forecasting my presidency--this would get in the  way of work.</p>

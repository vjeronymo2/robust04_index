			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Victims of cancer treatment to sue AT LEAST six cancer patients wrongly diagnosed at Birmingham's Royal Orthopaedic hospital are to sue for compensation, triggering a potential flood of litigation against the local area health authority at the centre of the case. Five solicitors have already received instructions from clients and a further two expect to do so in the next few days, according to the Law Society, which has set up a service to co-ordinate actions. 'People have come to expect high standards,' said Mr Stephen Jones, a partner with Pannone &amp; Partners, who added that the amount of litigation has risen in the past seven to eight years. Pannone is representing Ms Vicki Hunter, a 20-year-old PE student who lost part of her right leg as a result of unnecessary cancer treatment. Diagnostic errors have so far been identified in 42 cases handled by Dr Carol Starkie for the hospital's bone-tumour unit. About 1,600 more cases will be re-examined over the next three to four months, and the total of misdiagnosed patients is expected to reach 100. Solicitors for plaintiffs point out that recent changes in legal-aid rules will make it more difficult for families to obtain help to finance actions. 'Changes may mean that people won't take action,' said Mr Tony Hall, of Birmingham-based Anthony Collins, who is representing Matthew Guest, a nine-year-old who received unnecessary chemotherapy treatment. Even so, the cost to South Birmingham Health Authority could run into millions of pounds, highlighting the burden of medical negligence claims for both hospitals and general practitioners. The Medical Defence Union, one of three mutual insurance schemes which provides cover for GPs, said claims reached Pounds 28.5m last year, with costs increasing by at least 15 per cent annually in recent years. Health authorities are not insured for medical negligence claims and must meet most of the costs of awards from their own budgets. Ms Cheryl Blundell, a medical negligence specialist with Berrymans, the firm of solicitors which acts for defendants, suggested that authorities could be stretched by the cost of awards, which can reach more than Pounds 1m. The Law Society is considering further legal action against the Lord Chancellor over his latest plans to cut legal-aid pay. From November Lord Mackay is proposing to pay solicitors a fixed hourly rate set by him for civil legal-aid work. At present fees are set by district judges. The society claims Lord Mackay's proposed hourly rate of Pounds 65 is about 25 per cent less than the average now allowed by district judges.</p>

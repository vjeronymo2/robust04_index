Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet thanked Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and  accepted his invitation to visit the Russian Federation this  year.    The Vietnamese leaders warmly welcomed the Russian  Government  economic delegation's working visit to Vietnam. They highly  valued the results that both countries have recorded over the  past years in the framework of their bilateral cooperation  program, especially in the domains of energy and oil and gas.  They reiterated Vietnam's constant efforts to consolidate and  promote the traditional friendship and cooperation with the  Russian Federation based on the principle of equality and mutual  benefit.    The Russian Government delegation attended the inauguration  of the eighth, and also the last, group of generators of the Hoa  Binh hydroelectric power plant.

At the meeting, the two sides studied practical issues  relating to the implementation of agreements on economic, trade,  and scientific-technological cooperation for the 1993-94 period.  The two sides maintained that the implementation of the  agreements reached at the second meeting in May 1993 has led to  practical results and contributed to promoting the economic,  trade, and scientific-technological cooperation between the two  countries.    The two sides exchanged views on measures to resolve  existing  problems and on ways to further enhance the efficiency of  cooperation in energy, oil, and gas development; agro-industrial  joint ventures; and exchanges of goods. Both sides agreed on  the need to make continued efforts to renovate the mechanisms to  create favorable conditions for establishing direct contacts  between sectors and localities in the two countries.    The two sides signed the minute of the third meeting and the  agreements on post and telegraph cooperation and on the  preparatory work for the signing of the agreements on investment  promotion and protection and on agro-industrial joint ventures,  and a number of other agreements.    The Russian Government economic delegation toured a number  of  economic and cultural facilities. It also met and exchanged  views with Vietnamese businessmen. Leading officials of a  number of Vietnamese and Russian ministries, sectors, and  localities also met and exchanged views on a number of practical  issues relating to bilateral cooperation.

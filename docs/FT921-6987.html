			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Kerrey and Harkin pin hopes on South Dakota THE focus of the US presidential primaries shifts to South Dakota today where the two midwestern Democrats - Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa - are engaged in a duel which could kill off their campaigns. After finishing third and fourth respectively in the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday, each senator must show significant strength in his regional home base if he is to raise enough money to stay in the race. The most recent polls have Mr Kerrey leading the field. However, these were taken before a contentious debate on Sunday night gave many Dakotans their first in-depth look at the national front-runners, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts. Mr Tsongas stumbled on Sunday in the Maine caucuses. What should have been an easy victory, after his win in New Hampshire, ended in a close race with former Governor Jerry Brown of California. Mr Brown turned Mr Tsongas's support for nuclear power into a campaign issue and exposed vulnerability in the pro-business candidate. These early races have little to do with collecting supporting delegates for the party's convention. They are skirmishes, demonstrating a candidate's electability, and the name of the game is to create sufficient momentum to carry him into the larger races in the south on March 10, then Michigan, Illinois and New York. Mr Harkin, a 'prairie populist' with strong union and farm group support, ought to win in South Dakota if he can win anywhere. But he was badly wounded by his poor showing in New Hampshire. Mr Kerrey, an extraordinarily popular figure in neighbouring Nebraska, a war hero who calls for a restructuring of government and 'fundamental change' in US domestic policies, has sought to demonstrate a grasp of rural issues. With a victory in South Dakota, he could sell himself as an appealing candidate if the front-runners falter. But the voters could move towards Mr Clinton, a 'farm state governor' who turned in a smooth debate performance on Sunday. Mr Tsongas made much of his wife's South Dakota origins and promised to appoint an agriculture secretary who 'will be committed to preserving the family farm'. On the Republican side, the White House has yet to recover its equilibrium after President George Bush's weak win over right-wing commentator Mr Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire. Their biggest return match is slated for Georgia next Tuesday. The president's strategists have been torn over how to handle Mr Buchanan, but are seeking to placate party conservatives. Last week Mr Bush fired the controversial chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, long a demand of the Republican right.</p>

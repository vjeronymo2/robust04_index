			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STATE DEPT. WARNS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. TARGETS  </P> <P> The State Department expressed concern Friday about the possibility that Middle  Eastern terrorists may be planning a variety of attacks, perhaps against U.S.  targets in Western Europe or West Africa.  </P> <P> A brief statement said the concern was based partly on recent reports of  movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of weapons  shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and Africa.  </P> <P> "If credible, specific information or a threat to the public is received, the  Department of State will provide additional information for travelers and other  concerned parties," the statement said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The creation of a customs union within the CIS is a  remote, but feasible prospect, the chairman of the State Customs  Committee, Anatoliy Kruglov, told Interfax Wednesday.    Kruglov said the first steps were being made in this  direction. In particular, a council of the leaders of CIS  customs was set up which will be responsible for shaping up a  coordinated customs policy of the CIS states.    However, the creation of a customs union should be preceded  by the creation of a strong economic union and a single economic  space within the CIS, Kruglov said.    At a news conference in Moscow Wednesday, Kruglov put a  special emphasis on the CIS customs offices' interaction on the  road to integration. In particular, the council had made a  number of crucial decisions over the four months since its  creation.    At the initiative of the Russian customs service, the  council  prepared an agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in  customs affairs and another agreement on the detention and  return of illegally exported and imported cultural values. The  two agreements were signed by the CIS heads of government on  April 15.    In addition, a multilateral interdepartmental agreement on  cooperation in tackling drug trafficking has been prepared and  recommended for signing.    At present, the council is preparing drafts of CIS customs  legislation and an intergovernmental agreement on simplified  clearance on customs borders.</p>

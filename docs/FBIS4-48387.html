			<p>BFN     [Text] Umtata May 17 SAPA -- The chief of the South African  Air Force, Lt-Gen James Kriel, assured members of the former  Transkei Defence Force on Tuesday that their jobs would be safe  in the new South African National Defence Force. Speaking after  meeting with members of the former Transkei Defence Force Gen  Kriel said the integration of the airwings of the former  homeland armies would not pose a problem. "People should not  fear that they will lose their jobs and benefits because of this  new setup. There will be no discrimination on the colour of the  skin", Gen Kriel said.    The Umtata airwing will close at the end of May and its  aircraft will be transferred to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free  State.</p>

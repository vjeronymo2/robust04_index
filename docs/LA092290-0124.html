			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> MAN FORCES WOMAN TO WITHDRAW $5,000  </P> <P> A woman who offered to help a stranger Friday found herself robbed of $5,000,  Santa Paula police said.  </P> <P> Sgt. Gary D. Marshall said a heavyset woman in a black dress approached the  victim about 11:15 a.m. at Main and 8th streets, saying she was new to the  country and needed help finding a lawyer.  </P> <P> The victim, whose name Marshall said was not available, agreed to help the  woman, but said she first had to do some banking at a nearby Santa Paula  Savings branch.  </P> <P> When the two women reached the bank's entrance, a well-dressed man confronted  the victim, Marshall said. He told her that he had a handgun in his pocket and  would kill her if she did not accompany him into the bank and make a  withdrawal.  </P> <P> The man, who never displayed a weapon, stood at the woman's side as the teller  handed her $5,000 in $50 bills. Neither bank customers nor the teller suspected  anything was amiss because the woman remained calm, Marshall said. The man and  woman, described as both Latino and appearing to be in their 40s, left the  victim unharmed. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

Samusenko, Gomel State University; UDC </F> 621.396.677.45]    [Abstract] For simple shape radiators, the characteristics  of antennas made of conductors with infinitely small radii _r_  can be analyzed by applying approximate analytical expressions.  Algorithms were developed, and cylindrical spirals (CS) over an  infinite perfectly conducting screen were numerically examined  applying a random shape ultrafine wire radiator analysis method.  A comparison was also made of this method with the ``Mei  Integral Equations method''. The computation results obtained by  the two methods agree with accuracy of 1 - 2%. In order to  estimate the boundary limits of this method, the functional  dependance of the radiator's characteristic as a function of the  conductor's radii was also made and the numerical results were  compared with the analytical. A cylindrical spiral (CS) was  examined with a number of turns N=6 and the winding angle  _l_=14. It was demonstrated that when _r_ was reduced  from  10[.sup]-2[/] _l_ to 10[.sup]-5[/]_l_, the input impedance  Z[.sub]0[/] changed from (105-j33) Ohm to (511-j19) Ohm, and  the directive gain from 11.5 to 2.5. Frequency relationships of  the Z[.sub]0[/] and the directive gain for CS with  _r_=10[.sup]- 5[/] _l_ are shown in a graph. Figures 3,  references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / US to let China buy computer THE Clinton administration has decided to sell China a supercomputer to help in forecasting natural disasters, AP reports from Seattle. US officials said the sale of power turbines for nuclear generators had also been tentatively approved. However, while the supercomputer, manufactured by Cray Research and worth about Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.3m), is a 'done deal', the sale of the turbines will depend on China showing a willingness to respond to US concerns over human rights and trade practices which inhibit US exports to China in several areas.</p>

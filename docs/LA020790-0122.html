			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: SUPERVISORS TURN ASIDE DOUBTS ABOUT MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Finally, it was her turn. But before Nettie Castle, a retired schoolteacher  from Garden Grove, could tell the powers-that-be what she thinks of malathion  spraying, Supervisor Don R. Roth interrupted her.  </P> <P> "We don't do the spraying," he said. "It's out of our control. It's the state  that does the spraying."  </P> <P> Nettie said that she understood that, as did the others who had addressed the  board before her. Still, she wanted to say her piece. She got caught in the  spraying last month and came down sick.  </P> <P> Despite all the manicured talk about no risk that she had just heard from state  officials, Nettie thought that getting doused in malathion was not a good  thing.  </P> <P> She remembered when they used to X-ray feet at the shoe store to figure out  which shoes would be the best fit. They don't do that anymore. And what about  generic drugs, she wondered. Turns out now that some of them aren't too good  for you either.  </P> <P> "Maybe you could tell the governor that down here we are kind of different,"  she said. "We don't like this. I wonder if it is some manner of getting even?  It seems like they are going to do a lot of dumping on us."  </P> <P> Roth cracked a smile. He said he liked Nettie's style. Then he dismissed her.  </P> <P> Neither she nor any of the other 30 people who told the Board of Supervisors  that they opposed aerial malathion spraying could change his mind. Roth never  wavered.  </P> <P> After nearly five hours of testimony Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors voted 3  to 2 not to revoke the so-called Medfly emergency in Orange County.  </P> <P> This was expected. Nothing was changed. The buck just passed a little further  down the line.  </P> <P> Roth and Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who suggested that those made ill by the  spraying simply move out of the area, said they supported Gov. Deukmejian's  emergency declaration that allows the aerial malathion spraying wherever state  entomologists see fit.  </P> <P> Even if they opposed the spraying, they stressed, the Board of Supervisors was  powerless to stop it. But by also declaring Orange County a disaster area, they  would protect the county from liability in the event that it is named in a  lawsuit.  </P> <P> In other words, declare an emergency and protect yourself from any legal  consequences.  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez softened his own support by proposing an amendment  -- which he, Riley and Roth passed -- that said the declaration of an emergency  does not necessarily mean that the county advocates aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton, whose districts include the 36 square  miles in the current Medfly target range, said in essence that that was a lot  of poppycock. Their constituents were watching. They voted no.  </P> <P> So far, three Medflies have been found in Orange County: two in Westminster and  one in Brea. Isi Siddiqui, the assistant director of the California Department  of Food and Agriculture, said that could mean that 1,500 to 3,000 Medflies are  really on the loose here.  </P> <P> This, in the eyes of the state, is an emergency. And maybe it truly is. But  state officials, and it seems most of the supervisors, don't like to hear any  doubts.  </P> <P> When Stanton hinted that the state reaction might be overblown, Siddiqui said  he should give him a lesson in Entomology 101.  </P> <P> And initially, the state discounted the public concerns entirely. It was only  Monday, after Wieder and a delegation of Orange County city officials flew to  Sacramento to protest, that plans were announced to monitor air and water  quality after the Southern California sprayings. A health advisory panel will  also be formed.  </P> <P> Perhaps, as state officials suggest, those who are caught in the trenches of  the war on the Medfly should not be concerned that opinions are mixed on the  safety of malathion spraying. You'll see, they say. It will all work out just  fine.  </P> <P> But at Tuesday's meeting, it was clearly the minority who appeared to believe,  rightly or wrongly, that everything would indeed work out as the state  promised.  </P> <P> Most in the crowd, however, seemed outraged and scared.  </P> <P> One woman's sister, extremely chemically sensitive, cannot now live in her own  house in Garden Grove. One father pleaded on behalf of his 2-year-old daughter,  who has trouble drawing her breath. Another woman said she was frustrated to  hear that her voice doesn't matter, that a dictator in Sacramento was making  sure that democracy does not prevail.  </P> <P> As I listened to this parade of supplicants -- all of them asking that their  voice be heard -- I couldn't help wondering why so many minds appeared to be  closed to what they had to say.  </P> <P> They may be needlessly alarmed, or they might just have a point. The Orange  County Board of Supervisors should have voted against extending the county  state of emergency.  </P> <P> It may not have stopped the spraying, but it would have shown the voters of  this county that at least their concerns are being heard.  </P> <P> Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Readers may reach  Klein by writing to her at The Times Orange County Edition, 1375 Sunflower  Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626, or calling (714) 966-7406.  </P> <P> </P></p>

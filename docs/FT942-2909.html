			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / S Yemen to seek emergency UN talks South Yemen will ask for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss Yemen's seven-week civil war, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. Southern foreign minister Abdullah al-Asnaj said in Saudi Arabia that he would fly to New York today with Prime Minister Haider Abu Bakr al-Attas to ask the Council to convene. Mr al-Asnaj said at least 47 civilians had been killed in Aden yesterday in repeated northern rocket attacks on the besieged city of 400,000 inhabitants. The fresh barrage followed assurances by northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh to the United Arab Emirates that he accepted an immediate ceasefire. Leaders of the breakaway southern state were due to meet the UN peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the north's latest conditions for a truce. Mr Brahimi, shuttling between the two sides in several locations, met northern leaders in their capital Sanaa on Wednesday after talks with secessionist leader Ali Salem al-Baidh in the ancient southern city of Mukalla.</p>

The  discussions centered on the current education crisis, violence,  and freedom of the press. Siaka Konate has the details:    [Siaka] The education crisis and the violence it engendered  were at the center of this news conference. (Ameyi Dicko) of  the Union for Democracy and Development gave a lot of  information on the causes of the crisis and the opposition's  contacts with the government aimed at ending it.    For his part, Ousmane Edmond Traore of the National  Committee  for Democratic Initiative [CNID] made suggestions aimed at  ending the violence.    [Begin Traore recording] It is necessary and compulsory to  release the students who were arrested, namely the Association  of Malian Students and Pupils [AEEM] activists who were recently  arrested. We condemn their acts of vandalism and violence but  we call for their release since peace in this country is  priceless. Also, we call on the AEEM and even demand the AEEM to  stop its acts of vandalism because vandalism has never solved  any problems.    We appeal to the government for multilateral dialogue as the  AEEM no longer trusts the government. Since the association no  longer trusts in negotiations, it is forced to obtain some  guarantees and such guarantees are the other social forces.  There is a need for multilateral dialogue to put an end to  confrontation and misunderstanding due to mistrust. [end  recording]    The CNID official also condemned what he described as verbal  threats uttered by some top state officials, the excesses of the  security forces, and the behavior of private militias.  Concluding, he denied that the AEEM was manipulated by the  opposition, adding that the AEEM is manipulated by its own  problems.    For his part, the PSP [Progressive Sudanese Party]  representative called for a national debate to be attended by  all the social partners to help end the crisis. According to  Ousmane Dicko, this debate which will aim at restoring social  peace as well as security of goods and people will tackle all  the nation's major problems, namely the education crisis, fraud,  insecurity, structural adjustment, and so on.    Another issue discussed at this news conference was press  freedom. The related paper was read by Ibrahim Diakite of the  National Front. After stressing the media's role in the advent  of democracy in Mali, the official said government is stifling  press freedom. In this regard, he denounced the closing down of  Radio Kaira, the censorship in force at the radio and television  broadcasting corporation, and the lack of statutes for  independent radios. He therefore made some suggestions to  safeguard press freedom.    [Begin Diakite recording] We suggest, first, the presence of  media practitioners elected by their colleagues, representatives  of the Malian Association for the Defense of Human Rights and of  the Malian Bar Association within the national committee on  equal access to state media. Second, we suggest the extension  of the committee's responsibilities beyond the period of  electoral campaigns. The opposition wants the Higher  Communication Council to include media practitioners elected by  their colleagues. It calls for the division of the Malian Press  Agency into three different directorates: First, a directorate  of publications for ESSOR, PODIUM, and so on; a directorate of  the news agency in charge of gathering news; and a directorate  of advertisement. Finally, the opposition calls for the review  of the provisions of the law on the media and related offenses.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marjolein Roggen: "It Will Not Be Really Quiet </F> in the Cabin of the Fokker 100"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- Passengers sitting at the rear of a  Fokker 100 will, for the time being, continue to suffer from  excessive engine roar. Antinoise systems that have been tested  by Fokker and the TNO [Netherlands Central Institute for Applied  Research] Institute of Applied Physics (TPD) seem unable to  muffle the sound from four independent turbines. Worse still,  if conditions are unfavorable, the noise actually increases.    Passengers in the F-100 are not bothered by the jet engines  as they sound on the ground, but by the moving parts of the  engine. In contrast to the engines of the Boeings which  dominate the fleet in the Netherlands, the engines of the F-100  are mounted at the rear of the fuselage. Each engine contains a  high-pressure and a low-pressure spool, in turn consisting of a  compressor and a turbine. These spools rotate independently of  one another and each produces its own sound. This imbalance  means that the passengers seated at the rear of the cabin are  subjected to a roar of 85 decibels -- a good 10 decibels louder  than the noise experienced by their fellow passengers at the  front of the cabin.  <H5>  Low Frequencies </H5>   All Fokker's attempts to eliminate the engine imbalance and  to make the engine suspension more flexible using insulators  have not had the desired effect. Since the problem is caused by  low frequencies, conventional, passive silencers have also  failed to reduce the roar. Antinoise is a highly promising  technology, particularly for suppressing low frequencies. In  brief, antinoise systems consist of a microphone which absorbs  noise, a control unit which records and analyzes this noise, and  then via a loudspeaker emits a sound into the room which is of  the same amplitude but the opposite phase, so that ideally it  should generate silence.    Headphones with antinoise are already commercially  available,  and next year will see the launch of the first propeller  aircraft with an antinoise system. However, its first  commercial application in jet engines will not be for some time,  principally because there are four frequencies to be suppressed,  rather than just one as in a propeller airplane.  <H5>  Eliminate </H5>   Fokker's antinoise efforts started about three years ago,  with the Asanca European technology program. The aim of this  project was to determine how many loudspeakers and microphones  were required, and where they should be located, to eliminate a  single frequency. By continually relocating one loudspeaker, a  mathematical model could be developed. From this model it could  be deduced that a reduction of six decibels could be achieved  using four loudspeakers. Using 30 loudspeakers, this figure  increased to 16 decibels. "That may not be much to people used  to industrial noise, but in an airplane we are happy with just  one decibel," said E. Waterman of Fokker Aircraft, speaking last  week at a symposium about antinoise systems.    The results of another project in collaboration with the TPD  were less encouraging. Four loudspeakers and microphones were  placed on the rear four rows of seats. The measurements showed  that this small system was not enough to muffle the noise in a  restricted area. On the contrary, at the edges of the rows of  seats, the motor roar was actually eight decibels louder. A  larger system would be needed to achieve adequate noise  muffling, even over a small surface area.    The results of the test using two frequencies were even more  dramatic. According to Waterman, it did not work at all. The  closer the frequencies were to each other, the less successful  the system was in muffling the sound. Here, too, the noise  actually increased when the frequencies were virtually  synchronous. The problem is that the speed of the engine is not  known in advance.  <H5>  Purely Comfort </H5>   The antinoise system as envisaged by Fokker and the TPD is  not set to be a success just yet. Waterman dismisses ideas for  making passengers wear (working) headsets or clamping them into  a headrest with little microphones right beside the ear. She  says that noise silencing is purely a question of comfort, and  that passengers will not suffer hearing damage. She is also  against any system which would prevent passengers from talking  normally to one another or force them to wear headphones.    Whatever the case, Fokker is about to begin follow-up  research which will look at whether it might be more effective  to suppress the vibrations.</p>

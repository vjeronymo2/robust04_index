			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Said Naqvi: "Delhi's Brave Start to Putting </F> Srinagar Back on the Path to Governance"]    [Text] The human rights drama being staged in Geneva will  complete its run by the second week of March. The focus of  everyone's attention, however, will be the steps Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao will take regarding the situation in Kashmir. The  developments related to New Delhi and Srinagar will take place  under his personal supervision.    Skeptical people will ask, "How do you know?" After all,  there was never so much unawareness as there is now in the  capital of what the prime minister wants. I can say, referring  to a very reliable source, that one month ago, the prime  minister had taken all of the Kashmir-related issues into his  own hands.    The people who had been associated with Kashmir's  administration until now are amused by the prime minister's  direct interest in it. They argue that General Krishan Rao,  Kashmir's governor, talks directly only with the prime minister.  He does not even have time to talk with Home Minister Chavan or  the Home Minister for State, Rajesh Pilot. The fact is that if  either of them had any clout, he would have already been removed  from the position of governor. After that, they would have been  busy trying to push each other out and, following the Lucknow  etiquette, asked one another to go first. By taking the Kashmir  affair into his own hands, he has cleared up the rumor that he  was removing the governor from his position.    The governor is still there. The people in the North Block  who had bombarded the governor with accusations have pointed  their cannons toward the governor's assistant now that the  situation has changed. The balls of accusation are aimed at  Sheikh Ghulam Rasul, the chief secretary of Jammu-Kashmir  affairs. He is accused of being like a strange courtier who  first won the governor's confidence with his cunning and then  tried to dethrone him. The argument is that the chief secretary  does not allow the governor to do what he wants to do. The list  of accusations continues, and there are about 80 government  employees who do not even go to work but still draw their  salaries every month, thanks to the chief secretary. There are  quite a few employees of the Jammu-Kashmir police who are  working in cahoots with the terrorists. Until they are  controlled, the Central Reserve Police and the Border Security  Force cannot work closely with the local police, because the  fear is that all their plans are forwarded to the terrorists.    After the peaceful resolution of the Hazratbal crisis, there  were indications that the Kashmiri people wanted a normal  situation in the valley. The administration there, however, was  not the kind which respected their wishes and followed up on  them. No attention was paid to accounts for four years. Now the  chief secretary is being blamed for part of this poor  administration, breaking various rules and regulations (which  used to be blamed on the governor before), and hindering the  government's work.    The situation [here described] in Kashmir is not based on my  own observations. I have not visited the valley for some time. I  have based my conclusion on what I have heard from the  politicians and officials who have visited Kashmir.    How will the prime minister proceed with this affair? He  will  talk with the governor and announce that it is very important  that Sheikh Ghulam Rasul remain in his present position. The  intelligence bureau report will be presented in detail. Until  the chief secretary is removed, the terrorism in the valley will  not end.    At one point, it was a common belief that the British and  the  Americans believed that Pakistani assistance to Kashmiri  terrorists had started to come from across the border.  Siddhartha Shankar Ray complained to U. S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher in their sole meeting that Pakistan was  helping Kashmiri terrorists and encouraging them. He was given  the answer, "According to our information, this is not happening  now."    Our diplomats have begun to strongly believe that Western  intelligence can get information only to an extent, and not more  than that. Therefore, as the Indian sources indicate, Kashmiri  terrorists are still getting help from outside, and we should  take this information seriously. The fact is that the permanent  secretary of the British Foreign Commonwealth Office, Sir David  Gillmore, repeated the same comments given by Prime Minister  John Major during his trip to New Delhi last year. He said, "We  believe that the best way is to find a solution according to the  Shimla Agreement. Steps should be taken to implement a sincere  political process by talks, respect human rights in Kashmir, and  stopping outside aid to the terrorists which is creating most of  the problems."    According to one analysis, the mercenary terrorists across  the border are facing a new problem. There is such a heavy  concentration of Indian soldiers on the border that the  mercenary soldiers, if they enter Kashmir, find it difficult to  go back. This analysis indicates that those terrorists are  acting like daredevils.    When the prime minister sits down to review the situation,  he  will find that the basic facts cannot be clouded by analysis.  One fact is that there still exists the feeling of our being the  outsiders among the people who live in Kashmir. Because of the  lack of information among our security forces, they committed  atrocities against the people, which strengthened this feeling.    When the prime minister talked with Muslim ministers,  senators, and others about Kashmir and invited them to find a  solution, this issue was raised again during the talks. The  following people participated in this discussion: Jaffar Sharif,  Ghulam Nabi Azad, Salman Khursheed, Ahmed Patel, Saifuldin Sauz,  and Farooq Abdullah.    The prime minister is making Farooq Abdullah the New Delhi  spokesman for Kashmir. One thing he will understand very soon is  that we kept the DULF [expansion not given] leaders in Sri Lanka  so close to us that they lost the respect of the Tamils there.  This resulted in the rise of the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of  Tamil Eelam]. We know that Farooq Abdullah is not very popular  in the valley. Perhaps by appointing him spokesman for human  rights in the Geneva Human Rights Conference, we have totally  destroyed his credibility in the valley.  *</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Russian minister is promoted Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian government's longest-serving minister, was yesterday promoted from economy minister to deputy prime minister in charge of the economy. He said after a cabinet meeting yesterday that Russia's tight financial policy would cause a fall in production of 20 per cent this year, and that a more 'moderate' course was necessary. Meanwhile, the US television network NBC yesterday reported that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, had 'life-threatening' cirrhosis of the liver. The report, based on a security source and two former Russian diplomats, is the latest in a spate of rumours since the 63-year-old president retired last week to the Black Sea resort of Sochi to recuperate from a three-week illness. However, his aides repeated that he was in good health and would be back to work in a few days after resting well.</p>

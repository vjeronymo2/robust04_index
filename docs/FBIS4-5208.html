			<p>BFN     [Text] The Board of Investments (BoI) reported over the  weekend a 5.6 percent drop in investment last year, from P96.6  billion [Philippine pesos] in l992 to P94.086 billion in 1993.    The figure represented the total cost of investments in  2,000  projects approved by the BoI.    "But it is not too bad," the BoI said, "given the power  generators, and iron and steel investment projects during the  year were to be excluded, the total project cost of investments  in 1993 would amount to P43.2 billion."    This was 62.5 percent higher than the corresponding amount  of  P26.6 billion in 1992.    Specifically, the BoI said investments in energy-related and  power generator projects rose from P19.4 billion in 1992 to  P30.4 billion in 1993, or an increase of 56.7 percent.    Investments in iron and steel projects dropped from P53.8  billion in 1992 to P43.2 billion in 1993, or a hefty growth of  62.5 percent.</p>

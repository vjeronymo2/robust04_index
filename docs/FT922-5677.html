			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Falling car sales put brake on Caffyns Falling sales of new cars and losses at four showrooms reduced Caffyns, the Sussex-based motor group, to little more than break-even last year. Pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 63,000 on sales of Pounds 127.8m (Pounds 133.9m) in the year to March 31. The cost of closing four sites plus their second-half losses led to Pounds 535,000 exceptional costs, set against gains of Pounds 295,000 on property sales in the first half. Operating profit of Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 2.46m) only just covered net interest costs of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 1.75m). No figures were available for net debt or gearing. Although the family-controlled group lost 5.6p per share, against earnings of 13.9p, the final dividend is maintained at 6.5p to give an unchanged total of 11.5p, costing Pounds 473,000.</p>

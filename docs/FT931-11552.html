			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japanese oil refiner surprises with large increase in dividend THE conflicting corporate philosophies of the US and Japan were brought sharply into focus yesterday when Tonen, a Japanese oil refiner in which Exxon and Mobil, the US oil companies, each have a 25 per cent stake, unveiled a hefty dividend increase. Japan's meagre dividend levels have been cited by Washington as a 'structural impediment' to trade and condemned by Japanese life companies. But Tonen is the talk of Tokyo not because the payout is too small, but because it is too large and getting larger. The ratio of Tonen's dividend to net profits has risen from 37.6 per cent in 1987, to 93.7 per cent in 1990 and, for the year just ended, a mighty 174 per cent, much to the discomfort of its Japanese managers, who would prefer to bolster the company's reserves. Mr Takuya Fujimura, managing director, said Tonen had been 'requested' by Exxon and Mobil to increase the dividend, and the rise from Y26 in 1991 to Y50 was made after considering relevant circumstances. One such circumstance is that the two US oil companies, if they joined forces, would hold sway at a shareholders' meeting. Tonen's pre-tax profit for the year to December is expected to fall 5 per cent to Y32.7bn (Dollars 262m), while sales slipped 14 per cent to Y558bn. In attempting to save face in announcing the year-end dividend of Y37.5, following a Y12.5 interim payout, the company found two handy anniversaries on which to hang the increase. One, coming a year early, was the establishment, in 1893, of a Mobil unit in Yokohama; the other was that an Exxon Japanese subsidiary began business in Japan in 1962. Japanese brokers were wondering aloud last night what anniversary would be found to justify the next payout. The average Japanese payout last fiscal year was about 38 per cent, though the Life Insurance Association of Japan found that 46 per cent of companies held the payout ratio below 30 per cent. It said the average yield on Japanese equity was around 1.97 per cent - about one-third that of the US - while the yield on the 225 stocks in Tokyo's Nikkei index was a slim 0.89 per cent in calendar 1992. About 20 per cent of Japanese companies plan to cut or suspend dividends in the year to end-March, and most will leave the amount unchanged.  ----------------------------------------                  TONEN  ----------------------------------------            Ratio of dividend              to net profits  ---------------------------------------- Year                                % 1986                             33.4 1987                             37.6 1988                             72.0 1989                             82.7 1990                             93.7 1991                             95.8 1992                             74.0  ---------------------------------------- Source: Company accounts  ----------------------------------------</p>

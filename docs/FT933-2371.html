			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (14): Be sure your Will is correctly drawn - Inheritance tax planning / The government's budget deficit may be be an ominous sign for people who want to pass some wealth on to the next generation INHERITANCE TAX has been called a 'voluntary tax'. It is possible to give away a large part of your wealth, and if you survive for seven years from the date of the gift, no IHT will be payable. Indeed, the rules have never been more generous, with some businesses and farming land now fully exempt from inheritance tax. However, the cloud on the horizon is the current budget deficit. The government needs to raise money from somewhere, and while it is more likely that the finance will be found from VAT, national insurance and income tax, which are more widely based, it is quite possible that inheritance tax rates could increase or the regime be changed so that it is less flexible. The table shows that it is important to ensure that your will is tax-efficient. A husband and wife each have a nil band of Pounds 150,000. In the first example, that band is not being used by the husband, so that Pounds 340,000 is payable to the Inland Revenue when the wealth passes to the children on the second death. However, in the second example, both husband and wife utilise their nil rate band on their respective deaths, thereby saving Pounds 60,000 of tax. If you examine the value of your estate, your house may be one of your largest assets. It is also a non-income producing asset, so that, if it were to be given away, your income would not fall. Unfortunately the gift-with-reservation provisions do not allow you to merely give your house to beneficiaries, such as your children, if you continue to live there while they do not. If you do so and do not pay a market rent to your children, then the provisions will still enable the Inland Revenue to tax the value of your home as though it were part of your estate. However, these provisions do not apply on death, so that if a husband and wife were to hold their house as tenants in common, they could then give a share of the house to their children, or in trust for their children, on the first death. This is a useful way of using the nil rate band. For example, if the house is worth Pounds 300,000, then a half share of the house could be given to the children on the first death, with the surviving spouse keeping the remaining 50 per cent share. This does not give the surviving spouse security of tenure, as the children could force a sale of the property; but if the family relationship is sound, it may be a good way of using the nil rate band. There are other methods of giving away a house while continuing to live there using certain leasehold arrangements, but a great deal of care is required in these more complex arrangements, which should only be considered if the value of the home is very significant. If you are the founder of your family business, the improvement in business property relief discourages you from passing your shares to your children, because, if those shares are increasing in value, your children would acquire the shares at probate value for capital gains tax purposes on your death. However, it is quite possible that business property relief at 100 per cent may not be available forever, so that you may wish to consider a making a gift of shares now while there may be no charge to stamp duty, capital gains tax or inheritance tax. Many wealthy individuals are too concerned with the Pounds 3,000 IHT annual exemption. Although they are correct in taking advantage of this tax exemption, planning should not end here, as a larger gift only becomes taxable if the donor dies within seven years; and after three years, tapering relief applies so as to reduce the tax charge. Also, if you have surplus income after tax and your normal living expenditure, then this income can be given to your children without inheritance tax being payable if properly structured. The following illustrates the points:                      Pounds 000 Taxable income               80 Tax (say)                   (26) Annual expenditure          (40) Regular annual gifts        (10) Remaining surplus             4 There are other arrangements which are worth considering if you have left planning very late. For elderly people, there are available plans that enable you to continue to enjoy income, provide you with scope to receive back your capital while also making a substantial gift now, which could reduce the inheritance tax charge even if you die the day after making the gift.

According to an internal report on the  experiences of the 3d Corps in Koblenz, there were problems with  supplies and with the transportation of material both for the  advance team and for the main contingent of the German unit. In  addition, the rapporteurs advise against putting together  foreign contingents from so many different units in the future.  Such a varied troop could easily get into difficulties in  critical situations, the report says.    According to the 3d Corps, one of the "basic insights"  gained  from the Somalia mission is that for future missions "the core  of an advance team must be kept ready." The personnel must be  put together and be equipped, ready for action. It must be  possible to load the equipment into the Bundeswehr transport  planes ready-packed. Pallets destined for the Somalia mission  were taken apart and the material was loaded into different  planes; afterward, it was necessary to put it together "with  great difficulties and over the course of days." Army beds and  mosquito nets were missing for days.    In addition, the rapporteurs suggest taking loading  equipment  -- that is, fork lifts or elevating trucks -- along on the first  materiel transport. The advance team in Belet Huen would have  had to unload its equipment with great effort by hand if  equipment belonging to Canadian units had not been available by  chance. Furthermore, the 3d Corps writes: "In order to unload  containers from a ship, one needs container lifters, which are  to be loaded on the first ship in such a way that they are  available immediately upon arrival." In addition, because of  the great number of containers it was impossible to know "where  which container with what contents was at what time."    According to the report, critical situations were "an  exception at best," also because the entire mission was  conducted from one base. The unit, which consisted of soldiers  from more than 200 sections, would have been in much greater  danger in a critical situation than a unified unit would have  been. In addition, this variety did "not make" internal  leadership "easier." Therefore, the 3d Corps suggests using  "unified and cohesive units" in the future. One must also  reconsider the command structure, because, as a result of the  many tasks of the commander, a speedy reaction and command would  have been "at least doubtful" in critical situations.    The 3d Corps stresses that the materiel has proved its  worth,  even though "our gun is too heavy because of the amount of  ammunition that has to be taken along." Independent  reconnaissance for the Bundeswehr would also have been  important. For future operations, one must work out a  reconnaissance concept, which was not possible in Somalia  because of constitutional restrictions.    The report is restrained regarding the political assessment.  However, it says: "In view of the changed quality of UN  operations, a clear separation between Chapters VI and VII of  the UN Charter is no longer possible. The transitions are  flowing." There is great danger that one has to fulfill one's  own assignment with military force, and is thus dragged into a  mission on the basis of Chapter VII, which regulates combat  missions.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Trading in Argentaria gets off to a brisk start ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled Spanish banking corporation which has issued 25 per cent of its shares on the domestic and international markets, traded briskly on its opening day yesterday when its share price rose by more than 11 per cent in Madrid. The shares rose sharply from Pta3,800 to Pta4,305 before easing to Pta4,230 amid heavy trading. Analysts said the trading indicated that Argentaria had struck a correct balance in its share price by offering a sufficient premium to investors. Heavy demand for Argentaria meant domestic retailers were limited to maximum investments of little more than Pta280,000 (Dollars 2,370) against the original Pta8m limit outlined in the share offer.</p>

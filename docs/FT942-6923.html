			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cranswick ahead at year end with Pounds 2.33m Despite a fall at the interim stage, Cranswick, the integrated supplier of grain, feed, livestock and meat products, reported record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.33m for the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 2.2m. Mr Jim Bloom, chairman, said the current year had also started well with sales of pig feed and bird food ahead of last year. The improved performance from pig rearing activities had continued and pig marketing volumes were ahead of last year. Although turnover declined to Pounds 106.5m (Pounds 109.6m) operating profits rose to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.32m) including Pounds 499,000 from acquisitions. Net interest charges were sharply down at Pounds 17,000 (Pounds 118,000). A proposed final dividend of 5.85p (5.6p) lifts the total to 8.25p (8p), payable from earnings of 12p (13.2p) per share.</p>

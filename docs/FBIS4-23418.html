			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] has come out in limited support of the government's  Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP]. The committee  emphasized at a meeting in Ulundi that the provinces should be  empowered to decide on the implementation of the program. A  resolution was accepted on budgetary provisions to enable  provinces to implement reconstruction policies. The committee  expressed concern over what it said were reports about the  intention of the central government to assume control of  existing laws, which under the 1993 constitution fell within the  competence of the provinces.</p>

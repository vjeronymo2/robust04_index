			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Mayhew toughens stance on Ulster THE GOVERNMENT yester-day poured more cold water on the Hume-Adams peace initiative as speculation mounted on the Conservative back benches that ministers would agree to establish a select committee on Northern Ireland. In response to questions in the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, appeared to harden the government's position that it would only look afresh at policy if there was a genuine end to violence. Sir Patrick yesterday said peace could only be secured if terrorists turned their backs on violence for ever and not just for a ceasefire. 'To secure the peace that everyone in Northern Ireland deserves . . . (needs) a declaration by the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups that the perpetration of violence is over and over for good. It is not a question of a ceasefire and that of temporary relief.' Details of the peace initiative have not been published, but it is understood to envisage a cessation of violence as the start of talks on Ulster's constitutional status. Sir Patrick's comments were interpreted by some MPs as a signal that the government was further distancing itself from the peace initiative created by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The Ulster unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux, have rejected the Hume-Adams proposals as 'sheer lunacy'. The government's small majority and the continued threat of revolt has increased its dependence on the Ulster unionists. This has fuelled speculation that ministers may soon agree to unionist demands for a select committee on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick has said it is a matter for the Commons, but it would need government support. Sir Patrick also said that an immediate resumption of formal inter-party talks on the future of Ulster would be 'counter-productive'.</p>

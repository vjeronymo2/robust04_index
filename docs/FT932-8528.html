			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Proposals for electoral change threaten to split Labour party LABOUR MPs opposed to electoral reform launched a campaign yesterday against a working party's proposals for sweeping changes to the way parliament is elected. The proposals, which are to be discussed today by Labour's ruling national executive committee, are made in a report by the opposition's working party on electoral systems, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield. The report recommends abolishing the first-past-the-post system used for elections to the House of Commons in favour of an untried system known as the supplementary vote. It also recommends switching to proportional representation for elections to the European parliament and for the second chamber Labour proposes to introduce to replace the House of Lords. The NEC discussion was intended to launch a consultation period on the Plant report before a decision at the autumn party conference. Now it looks likely to open up a new split in the party, already deeply divided over internal reforms such as the loosening of links with the trade unions. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will be hoping to avoid an open split by backing the idea of a national referendum on electoral reform at today's meeting. Mr Smith is cautious about electoral reform, although he is said to have accepted the case for change. But a group of MPs opposed to reform launched a campaign to retain the first-past-the-post system. Mr Derek Fatchett, chairman of the group, warned that for a newly elected Labour government to spend its first year or two on electoral reform would be 'Labour's equivalent of a new Maastricht bill', in terms of its divisiveness and irrelevance. The Plant report says the present system fails to reflect the changing nature of British society. It examines three options for changing the UK's electoral system so that the number of MPs from each party more closely reflects party support, without losing the direct link between MPs and constituencies. All three options would have left the Conservatives short of an overall majority at the last election and would almost certainly have resulted in a minority Labour government. By a narrow majority, the Plant committee recommends that Labour should adopt the supplementary-vote system devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, MP for Workington. That would allow voters to express a second preference, which would be taken into account if no candidate won more than 50 per cent of the first-preference votes. Other recommendations in the report include: Introducing four-year fixed-term parliaments; State funding for political parties; Limits on national spending by parties in general elections.

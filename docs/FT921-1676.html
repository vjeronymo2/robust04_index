			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Poll cheer for Kinnock THE FINE print of this weekend's polls will have gone down just as well at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters as the headline figures showing a Labour lead in four cases out of five. The party will have been heartened by its generally improved showing for economic competence, by evidence that Mr Neil Kinnock is making up ground on the other leaders, and by indications that voters see the National Health Service as the most important issue. The Conservatives will be concerned by the finding in the Mori poll for The Sunday Times that tax is well down the list of decisive issues. But they will take heart from suggestions in yesterday's NOP survey for The Independent on Sunday that an increasing number of voters think Labour is making promises the country cannot afford. For all that, Mr John Smith's shadow Budget appears to have bolstered his status. In the Observer/Harris poll 40 per cent thought Mr Smith the best choice for chancellor, compared with 27 per cent for Mr Norman Lamont. A Mail on Sunday/NOP survey gave Mr Smith a 32 percentage point lead over his opposite number. On economic competence, Labour scored its first positive rating in the Independent survey since the newspaper's pollsters started monitoring the subject last May. Overall, 47 per cent of those sampled regarded Labour as very or fairly competent on the economy, and 46 per cent said they were not very or not at all competent - compared with 43 per cent and 50 per cent respectively in the previous week. The Conservatives scored plus 5 percentage points on the same measure. The Sunday Times gave the Tories a 9 percentage point lead over Labour on managing the economy. A Sunday Express/ICM poll gave Labour a 1 percentage point lead over the Tories on the question: 'Which party will make your family better off?' Labour will be less pleased with the Independent's finding that 56 per cent of respondents thought it would 'put up income tax sharply for people on average earnings'. Mr Kinnock still lies third in the popularity stakes among the party leaders but has picked up 4 percentage points according to the Mail on Sunday, to trail Mr John Major, the prime minister, by 16. In Scotland a Mori poll showed a 3 percentage point drop in support for the Conservatives compared with a week ago and a 3 percentage point rise in backing for the Scottish National party. It put Labour on 43 per cent (up 1), SNP on 27 per cent (up 3), Conservatives on 20 (down 3) and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent (down 2). A single constituency poll on Mid Staffordshire for the Birmingham Post indicates Labour could hold the seat - which it won with a 21.3 per cent swing in a 1990 by-election - with an increased majority. A poll in the Wallasey, Merseyside, constituency where Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, is defending a majority of just 279, showed the Conservatives trailing, but by only 1.2 percentage points.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO LEADS IN FT POLL OF POLLS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Last night's        Latest opinion     Betting      Futures        FT forecast                  poll         odds      trading  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative    299 seats            39%        Evens          303  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour          308 seats            41%         8/11          305  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Liberal/Dem      19 seats            15%        300/1           25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             (NOP/Mail on    Ladbrokes     Dealing on the                             Sunday)                       number of                                                           seats  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Field date      (for most     (IG index                             20-21 March      seats)       mid prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (3): Wired for growth - Asia switches on to private power THE private power sector is now playing an important role in electricity generation in Asia's developing countries. Relentless economic growth, and an even faster growth in electricity demand, have opened this door to the private sector. The countries most affected are Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. One reason is the high cost of adding new, efficient capacity out of national financial resources, and the perception that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are no longer bottomless wells of concessional aid support, particularly given the demands on them from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The two Banks have made clear that developing Asia must do more on its own, and they have pressed their borrowers to boost power utility efficiency and revenues through higher electricity tariffs and reduced subsidies to customers. In Asia, their power sector lending accounts for about 20-25 per cent of all aid, but their own resources are being stretched. This was underlined recently by Mr William Thompson, ADB vice-president, operations, who said that electricity demand in the 1990s would require the addition of 300,000MW of capacity, more than double that now in place in the region's two-dozen developing countries. He noted that in spite of a 100 per cent increase in electricity use in the 1980s, Asia's per capita energy consumption was still low by global standards, and would rise sharply. Asia, with 40 per cent of the world's population, accounted for only 20 per cent of total energy use. With GDP expected to grow annually by 5.5-6 per cent over the 1990s and current account deficits worsening, increased reliance on the private sector to raise finance was required. He stressed such schemes as build-own-operate and build-operate-transfer (BOO and BOT respectively), in which the plant supplier finances the scheme through the sale of power to the state utility, essentially owning and operating the plant until all financing and profits have been recovered. The use by the World Bank of BOT in Pakistan to structure the Dollars l5bn Hab River power project, a 4 x 323MW oil-fired power station 50 km west of Karachi, is credited with convincing Islamabad to restructure its two unwieldy utilities, the Water and Power Development Authority and the Karachi Electricity Supply Company, whose total capacity is 8,000MW. Work on Hab is expected to start this summer, under a consortium of US, British, French, Italian, Saudi and Japanese companies, with delivery of the first unit in three years. Electricity would be sold by HubCo, the managing company, into the national grid. This would pay for the project costs and generate profits over 23 years before the station is turned over to Pakistani control. Pakistan is encouraging more BOT schemes and plans to hive off some of WAPDA's thermal power stations into similar BOT operations. India last year introduced laws to broaden the private power base and, in some cases, to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power companies. At 65,000MW, just 5 per cent of India's power comes from four private sector companies, led by the Tata Group. All of these are profitable compared with the 18 state-sector utilities, most of which are in deficit. The issue has proven so successful that the private sector now claims to be capable of adding 24,000MW of new capacity to the grid by 2000 if its proposals are approved. The I990-95 five-year plan called for 38,000MW of new capacity, but this looks like falling about 35 per cent short under state plans. If the private bids are approved, the gap between private and state electricity generation will narrow sharply. Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is now seeing through the flotation of 23 per cent of its shares, the largest such flotation of a state-utility's shareholdings in Southeast Asia. At 5,000MW, TNB plans to increase capacity to nearly 8,000MW by 1995, hence the need for private capital. By comparison, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is taking a different approach. Its target is to boost capacity to 13,075MW by 1996 from 8,193MW last year. In February it amended the EGAT Act to allow the creation of wholly-owned power generating subsidiaries, whose shares can be sold. Under this scheme, it has designated three projects for mini-privatisation: the 4 x 300 MW Rayong combined-cycle power plant, the 600MW Khanom combined cycle plant; and the recently-proposed 2 x 700MW Aoi Pai coal-fired power station. The government has also endorsed the purchase by EGAT and the Metropolitan and Provincial electricity authorities (the two electricity distributors) of up to 50MW of capacity from individual private power generators operating combined-cycle plants. Uncertainty surrounds the privatisation plans of Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia is steering clear of BOT projects. Current installed capacity of the PLN, the state utility, is 9,000MW, all of it on Java. Indonesian energy officials say plans are to boost this to 20,000MW by 2000. Such an expansion will cost Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn. Indonesia hopes to offset much of this cost by encouraging more 'captive' power stations, those built to fuel company towns and self-contained industrial complexes. Government officials say 40 per cent of the additional 11,000MW of planned capacity could be developed this way. The Philippines recently refloated shares in the Manila Electric Company, which had been sequestered following the corporate shakeup of para-state companies following the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986. It has said it plans to restructure and privatise the National Power Corporation, the main utility, once the political dust has settled following this month's national elections.

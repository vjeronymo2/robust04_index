			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fall in UK sales behind 46% decline at Eurotherm A HEFTY fall in UK sales was behind lower-than-expected results at Eurotherm International, the control equipment and systems group, which reported a 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 7.15m in the year to October 31. The decline also reflected net exceptional costs of Pounds 1.86m arising from redundancy payments. Eurotherm is, however, raising its final dividend to 4.7p (4.55p) for an increased total of 7.2p (7.05p). This is covered about 1.5 times by earnings per share of 10.6p (19.6p). The results reflected a satisfactory performance, considering the double digit decline in industrial investment in both the UK and the US, said Mr Claes Hultman, the new chief executive who joined the group in September. The decision to increase the dividend was based on confidence in the future of the group, following the restructuring carried out last year and measures to cut costs and raise profitability, he said. In the period concerned, however, the group had found it very difficult to find cus-tomers willing to spend any money in what had been 'a pretty lousy year economically,' said Mr Jack Leonard, chairman. The UK had been particularly affected by the slowdown in industrial activity. While overseas sales fell marginally to Pounds 117.2m (Pounds 117.2m) turnover in the UK declined by 14 per cent to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 47.2m), taking overall turnover down to Pounds 157.7m (Pounds 164.4m). Cost cutting measures have led to savings of Pounds 3m a year, but redundancies would be an ongoing process while businesses that did not fit into the new structure would be disposed of. In addition, tight financial controls were being augmented by steps to raise profitability, particularly in the UK, by increasing margins and moving out of low profitability areas. COMMENT Investors must be wondering when Eurotherm will be able to put the shine back on its rather dull performance of late. Strong trading in the first two months of this financial year was followed by a disappointing December which has made Eurotherm understandably cautious about prospects for this year. Having taken a good chunk of costs out of operations and with the new business structure in place, the focus will be on whether the strategy is going to work. While management is making encouraging noises about new markets for its products and the group's ability to raise profitability, it will probably take at least a noticeable upturn in the UK to prove that the new structure is going to impact on sales. The chances are that Eurotherm has a lot to look forward to when industrial activity does pick up. But with the UK proving slow to come out of recession the pay-off looks unlikely to come for some time yet. Until there is stronger evidence of these benefits coming through, the shares have little to recommend them, making a prospective multiple of 16 on forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m high enough.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (H) The results of the analyses of complex model samples for oxygenate type and oxygen weight percent, benzene, aromatic hydrocarbon, and olefin content, E&hyph;200, E&hyph;300, and RVP, and the calculated VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and toxics emissions reduction percentages;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The name and address of each laboratory where gasoline samples were analyzed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (J) A description of the methodology utilized to select the locations for sample collection and the numbers of samples collected;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (K) For any samples which were excluded from the survey, a justification for such exclusion; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (L) The average toxics emissions reduction percentage for simple model samples and the percentage for complex model samples, the average benzene and oxygen percentages, for each survey conducted during the period June 1 through September 15, the average VOC emissions reduction percentage for simple model samples and the percentage for complex model samples, and beginning on January 1, 2000, the average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reduction percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Each survey shall be conducted at a time and in a covered area selected by EPA no earlier than two weeks before the date of the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15) The procedure for seeking EPA approval for a survey program plan shall be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The survey program plan shall be submitted to the Administrator of EPA for EPA's approval no later than September 1 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Such submittal shall be signed by a responsible corporate officer of the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender, or in the case of a comprehensive survey program plan, by an officer of the organization coordinating the survey program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) (i) No later than December 1 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted, the contract with the surveyor to carry out the entire survey plan shall be in effect, and an amount of money necessary to carry out the entire survey plan shall be paid to the surveyor or placed into an escrow account with instructions to the escrow agent to pay the money over to the surveyor during the course of the conduct of the survey plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) No later than December 15 of the year preceding the year in which the surveys will be conducted, the Administrator of EPA shall be given a copy of the contract with the surveyor, proof that the money necessary to carry out the plan has either been paid to the surveyor or placed into an escrow account, and if placed into an escrow account, a copy of the escrow agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;80.69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for downstream oxygenate blending.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of this section apply to all reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending, or RBOB, to which oxygenate is added at any oxygenate blending facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for refiners and importers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For any RBOB produced or imported, the refiner or importer of the RBOB shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Produce or import the RBOB such that, when blended with a specified type and percentage of oxygenate, it meets the applicable standards for reformulated gasoline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In order to determine the properties of RBOB for purposes of calculating compliance with per-gallon or averaged standards, conduct tests on each batch of the RBOB by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Adding the specified type and amount of oxygenate to a representative sample of the RBOB; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Determining the properties and characteristics of the resulting gasoline using the methodology specified in &sect;80.65(e);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Carry out the independent analysis requirements specified in &sect;80.65(f);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Determine properties of the RBOB which are sufficient to allow parties downstream from the refinery or import facility to establish, through sampling and testing, if the RBOB has been altered or contaminated such that it will not meet the applicable reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to the addition of the specified type and amount of oxygenate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Transfer ownership of the RBOB only to an oxygenate blender who is registered with EPA as such, or to an intermediate owner with the restriction that it only be transferred to a registered oxygenate blender;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Have a contract with each oxygenate blender who receives any RBOB produced or imported by the refiner or importer that requires the oxygenate blender, or, in the case of a contract with an intermediate owner, that requires the intermediate owner to require the oxygenate blender to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Comply with blender procedures that are specified by the contract and are calculated to assure blending with the proper type and amount of oxygenate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Allow the refiner or importer to conduct quality assurance sampling and testing of the reformulated gasoline produced by the oxygenate blender;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Stop selling any gasoline found to not comply with the standards under which the RBOB was produced or imported; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Carry out the quality assurance sampling and testing that this section requires the oxygenate blender to conduct;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

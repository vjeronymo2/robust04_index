			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO CHIEF ASKS LOCAL TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Mexico and the United States, instead of dealing with immigration policy almost  entirely at the federal level, must consult more with local governments and  labor unions as part of a renewed effort to bring order to the massive flow of  people across the borders of the two countries, Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said Monday.  </P> <P> Proposals to have the Mexican and U.S. governments work directly with local  governments and labor unions on the border-crossing problem have been debated  by academics in both countries in the past and have been suggested as an  alternative to the present immigration system by Jorge Bustamante, director of  the Mexican Center for the Study of the Northern Border in Tijuana, a  government agency.  </P> <P> But this was the first time that a senior Mexican political leader has embraced  the approach. Under such a system, farmers in the United States presumably  would be permitted to go into Mexican communities and work with local officials  and labor unions in arranging for migrant workers to enter this country and  work on American farms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complex Rules  </P> <P> Salinas, in Washington for a series of meetings on bilateral issues with  President Bush and other Administration officials, noted that the thousands of  Mexican migrant workers who cross the border -- part of 22 million border  crossings a year -- now are subject to a series of immigration rules in both  countries that compound an already complex situation.  </P> <P> He brought up the idea during an hourlong session with a small group of U.S.  reporters at Blair House, the official guest house across the street from the  White House, where he is staying during his Washington visit.  </P> <P> During the interview, Salinas also declared that the recent seizure of 20 tons  of cocaine in Los Angeles shows that drug traffickers have been having great  success smuggling the illegal drug through Mexico to the United States and that  it demonstrates the need for closer cooperation between the two countries in  the war on drugs.  </P> <P> "It worries me very much . . . because it shows that very much cocaine is  passing through Mexico and too much is entering the U.S.," he said. "That's why  I have decided we must strengthen cooperation. . . ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Information on Drugs  </P> <P> Salinas said that the problem will be "one of the main topics that I will talk  to the President and his Administration about -- the strengthening of  relations, cooperation on drug trafficking, especially with relation to  information, because I have said that the responsibility of finding drug  traffickers in Mexico is not solely within the Mexican means."  </P> <P> But in answer to a question, he said that he cannot see Mexico ever agreeing to  permit U.S. law enforcement agents to cross Mexico's borders in "hot pursuit"  of drug suspects. "No, that will never happen," said Salinas, who is known to  feel strongly that such a practice would threaten Mexico's sovereignty.  </P> <P> Although stressing the need for changing the two countries' systems for  handling border crossings, Salinas said that the Mexican economy's need to  provide more jobs for Mexicans is another factor that figures heavily in  discussions about ways to deal with the huge outflow of migrant workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Million Jobs Needed  </P> <P> Mexico needs to create a million new jobs a year and that is the goal he has  set for next year, said Salinas, who is nearing the end of his first year of a  six-year term.  </P> <P> He called for the United States to lower trade barriers on textiles, steel,  automobiles and other products and said that free trade would increase  employment substantially and provide "jobs for Mexicans in Mexico and not in  the U.S." He said that Mexico has unilaterally opened its markets and the  United States should now lift its own trade barriers.  </P> <P> Salinas and Bush are expected to sign several agreements covering such subjects  as border issues, expanded trade and investment, tourism and pollution control  when they meet at the White House today.  </P> <P> Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, told  reporters that both countries hope the agreements will be instrumental in  "opening the Mexican market for investment." But he declined to discuss details  of the agreements.  </P></p>

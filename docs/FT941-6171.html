			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Clinton urged to back jobs International trade union leaders will tomorrow urge President Bill Clinton to back a 'global new deal' to create jobs for the estimated 35m unemployed in western industrialised countries. Led by Mr Lane Kirkland, head of the American AFL-CIO, OECD union officials will demand 'a profound change in the direction of international economic policy' at the G7 jobs summit in Detroit later this month. Union leaders will urge Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, to back their call for a co-ordinated employment growth strategy and reject current western economic policies. They want cuts in short-term interest rates in Europe; a growth strategy based on infrastructure investments; regional development; targeted research spending; the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

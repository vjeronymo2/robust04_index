			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Playing heart-strings Labour's ex-ploitation on TV of images of a young schoolgirl in pain has become the focus of the most virulent exchange of insults and accusations of the campaign. That is hardly surprising. If the Conservative counter-attack strikes a chord with voters, the government might yet avoid defeat. If Labour's TV heartbreaker prevails, the Tories are finished. The broadcast was described as 'shameless' by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, yesterday. Considering the source, that is praise indeed. Mr Howard's habitual use of hyperbole casts 'shameless' in a new light. Uttered by him it must mean 'brilliant', as when the young deploy 'wicked' to much the same purpose. Mr Michael Heseltine chose a different adjective - 'despicable'. It brought to mind the use by President George Bush of Willie Horton, a murderer, in his campaign against Mr Michael Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts. Horton had been given a weekend pass under state legal procedures. He escaped, raped a woman and stabbed her companion. The Bush commercial was a ruthless appeal to racial fears. It was despicable. Labour's broadcast showed one little girl getting instant treatment on the strength of her mother's cheque book while another suffered as she waited for surgery on the National Health Service. Let's regard the film as an allegory. As such, it appealed to class antipathies, the muddled British sense of fair play, and our subconscious terror of being bereft of medical care when we need it. It also spoke to the personal experiences of many voters, their friends, or their near relatives. It rested on a mountain of anecdotal evidence. It was shameless. It was also humbug. Labour has no claim to moral superiority. The architect of the NHS, Aneurin Bevan, consciously laid the foundations of a two-tier system of health care, one for the rich and one for the rest of the population. Private patients could be treated in state-owned hospitals from the start. He may not have liked it, but he acknowledged that it was unavoidable. It still is. Bevan also knew that some patients would be made to wait. 'We never will have all we need,' he said on the eve of the establishment of the service. 'Expectation will always exceed capacity.' Since then, the tier of money has been overlaid by a tier of connections between favoured doctors and chummy consultants. The extra Pounds 1bn Labour proposes to spend on the NHS if it is elected will not change that. The service cannot hope to satisfy every demand, since it is free at the point of use and supply is rationed by the Treasury. They began to sow the seeds of their own destruction might enable doctors to ensure that more patients make the best of what will always be an unfair system. That is what the government's reforms are intended to achieve. Labour is obscuring what should be a rational debate by the use on TV of soap-opera techniques. Yet whatever you think of such methods, it is the Tories who have allowed the NHS to become the foremost non-economic issue in this election campaign. They brought it on themselves. The story starts shortly after the 1987 election, which the Conservatives won with a majority of 102. That third smashing triumph in a row went to their heads. They began to sow the seeds of their own destruction. Mr John Moore, then secretary for social services, failed to secure an adequate cash allocation for health during the public spending round. The Treasury minister with whom Mr Moore had to deal was Mr John Major. Mr Moore was at that time tipped as a successor to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He was broken by Mr Major's tough bargaining. As winter drew on, he had to come back for an emergency Pounds 100m injection into the NHS. Mrs Thatcher blew up. Ad-libbing in a TV interview, she announced a thorough review of the service. That was at a time, remember, when the Conservatives seemed to be invincible. The far-out rightwing think tanks put up plans to privatise it or to change to a wholly insurance-based system. Mrs Thatcher never quite fell for those, but she flirted with them. In consequence, the review was foredoomed by its use of the language of markets, prices, purchasers and even customers. When Mr Kenneth Clarke succeeded Mr Moore - and Mr Major became dauphin - he found an inchoate plan to divide purchasers of care from providers. With the exception of tax relief for private health insurance for the elderly, the wilder ideas had already been discarded. Mr Clarke built a new structure around the internal market theory of management. Thus did 'GP fundholders' and 'trust hospitals' come on to the scene. 'Opt-out' was invented by a newspaper. Still infused with the post-1987 Conservative hubris, Mr Clarke declined to contemplate a pilot scheme before the launch of the new system. Shortly before she was deposed in November 1990, Mrs Thatcher had the collywobbles. Should the reforms be put off until after the election? Her successor, Mr Major, lacked the depth of experience that might have led him to shelve the project. Instead, he persuaded Mr William Waldegrave, the new health secretary, to tackle Labour's wily Mr Robin Cook head-on. That was madness. Every time health hit the headlines, Labour rose in the polls. Only a wave of revulsion against shamelessness would make it different this time. Mr Major's attack on the opposition last night - 'such men are not fit to govern' - was therefore well worth a try, but if it is true to past form Labour will get the better of the political argument.</p>

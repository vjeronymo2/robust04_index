			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Board and in particular, section 15B(b)(2)(C), which authorizes the Board to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes also that the proposed rule change addresses the concerns raised by the Division of Market Regulation in its 1993 report to Congress on the Municipal Securities Market. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  In that report, the Division cited sales practices as one area that could benefit from increased MSRB attention and specifically encouraged the MSRB to update its suitability and customer protection rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Sept. 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change will help prevent fraudulent and deceptive practices and promote just and equitable principles of trade because it is designed to ensure that dealers, before making a recommendation to a customer, take appropriate steps to determine that the municipal securities transaction is suitable. In particular, by clarifying and strengthening the rules governing the inquiries dealers must make of customers and the circumstances under which recommendations are permissible, the rule change will further important goals such as assuring the integrity of the market for municipal securities and safeguarding the interests of the investing public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional customers also will be better protected under the proposed rule change because brokers an dealers will be required to have reasonable grounds, based upon information available from the issuer and facts disclosed by or known about a customer, for believing that a recommendation is suitable, whether or not the client is an institution. Institutional and non-institutional customers will be treated differently only with respect to the precise information that must be obtained prior to a recommendation. For both types of customers, information still must be obtained that is adequate to support a reasonable suitability determination. There will be no difference in the standard a broker or dealer is held to in determining the suitability of that recommendation. Thus, in many cases, even though not required to obtain certain types of customer information for recordkeeping purposes, dealers will, as a practical matter, need to obtain the same types of information for certain institutional accounts as would be required for non-institutional accounts. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the NASD and the MSRB should reconsider specifying information collection requirements for dealers when recommending securities to ``institutional accounts.'' In particular, the Commission believes that the NASD and the MSRB should evaluate (i) the appropriateness of dealers making such recommendations to high net worth individuals, absent the kind of information required to be obtained for non-institutional accounts; and (ii) the need to provide dealers with more definite guidance regarding the kind of customer information that they should obtain before making recommendations to different types of institutional accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, by revising the definition of ``institution'' to conform with the definition used by the NASD, <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  the proposed rule change promotes consistency in classification, thereby facilitating the determination of the proper duty of inquiry owed to the particular client, and reduces confusion in the administration, compliance and surveillance of municipal securities dealers by NASD examiners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NASD Rules of Fair Practice, Art.

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV  </P> <P> With local basketball and hockey long done, baseball highlights the sports  choices on TV this weekend.  </P> <P> Crucial is usually not an appropriate label to a series scheduled for the first  week of June.  </P> <P> But that designation does apply to the Dodgers-Cincinnati Reds matchup as the  locals desperately seek to remain a credible pennant contender. SportsChannel  will televise tonight's game at 7.  </P> <P> The Angels, no longer underachievers but overachievers, meet the Texas Rangers  at 5:30 p.m. today on KTLA Channel 5.  </P> <P> Finally beginning to meet their lofty preseason expectations, the San Diego  Padres play host to the Atlanta Braves tonight at 7 (TBS and San Diego Cable  Sports) and 1 p.m. Sunday on TBS.  </P> <P> Two area college baseball teams will also make television appearances today.  Cal State Fullerton faces Oklahoma State at 5 p.m. on ESPN. Cal State  Northridge goes for the Division II championship against Jacksonville (Ala.)  State. Prime Ticket will have delayed coverage beginning at 5:30 p.m. STEVEN  HERBERT  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> OTHERS MAY MERIT HOLIDAY HONOR  </P> <P> Allegations about King's extramarital exploits and recent charges of plagiarism  of his college papers take nothing away from his accomplishments as the  lightning rod for black Americans seeking government recognition of their  endowed, unalienable rights. What it does is support those who felt more time  was needed to study King's life and background before he was honored with  national and state holidays.  </P> <P> Black giants like Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and Frederick  Douglass may be even more suitable subjects to honor with a holiday or other  recognition because their lives have withstood the test of historical scrutiny.  </P></p>

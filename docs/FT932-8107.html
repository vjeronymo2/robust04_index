			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Candybar Issues If Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's biggest advertising agencies, can get away with a Pounds 73m rights issue, it surely must be on the mend. But it still can't afford to lose big name clients such as Mars, the highly private confectionery and pet food giant which is fighting to stem the slide in its share of many of its main markets. Indeed, Observer hears that chairman Maurice Saatchi has been spending so much of his expensive time buttering up multi-billioniare Forrest Mars that a number of Maurice's colleagues have rechristened him Snickers Saatchi, after one of Mars' more famous chocolate bars. Better than Whiskas Saatchi, perhaps.</p>

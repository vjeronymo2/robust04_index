			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ARCO SAYS NEW NORTH SLOPE WELL COULD BE BIGGEST FIND IN 10 YEARS  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield Co. said today that a new well it is testing on the Alaskan  North Slope could prove to be one of the largest discoveries in the United  States in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> Arco's stock jumped $2.25 to $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange on the  news.  </P> <P> Tests on the Point McIntyre well near Prudhoe Bay showed oil flowing at the  generous rate of 5,400 barrels a day.  </P> <P> The total daily output of Alaskan oil is about 2 million barrels, with many  single wells producing around 2,500 barrels a day.  </P> <P> The average well in the United States yields fewer than 10 barrels a day. Many  of the fields in Texas and other states are mature.  </P> <P> An Arco spokesman said preliminary tests indicated a high recovery rate that  could ultimately reach about 300 million barrels during the life of the well.  </P> <P> Arco said in June that tests on its first well in the area indicated flow rates  as high as 5,300 barrels a day. The figures released today are for a second  well in the area.  </P></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Flights to the land of Nod - Rival airlines' sleeper services It almost seems a shame to go to sleep if your company has forked out for you to fly first class. There are fine wines, good food and all the latest movies to be sampled. But many people find the best preparation for a business trip is a good sleep on the aircraft - so British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have launched rival sleeper services. British Airways began what it calls its 'dream service' for first-class passengers on some overnight flights last year. It has since expanded the service to the Middle East and some destinations in Africa, as well as transatlantic routes from the US east coast and Toronto, Canada. Virgin Atlantic launched its 'Snoozzone' on flights from the US and to Hong Kong and Tokyo from London. The two services are similar in concept. On some flights passengers have a choice of a meal at the airport - the best are in New York - or a light meal on the flight. Once on board, passengers are given a cotton tracksuit and the seats are made up into the closest thing to a bed the airlines can manage, with a duvet and pillow. BA's final touch is a mug of hot chocolate and cookies before all the cabin lights are turned out. The main difference is in price. The British Airways one-way fare of Pounds 1,974 from New York's John F Kennedy airport to London compares with Virgin's one-way weekday fare of Pounds 1,082 from New York. Virgin's price is lower mainly because it has done away with the first-class/business-class distinction in favour of what it calls Upper Class. BA's first-class cabin is smaller and quieter than Virgin's. BA sleeps 16 in first class on a 747 and 10 in a 767, while Virgin has 28 Upper Class seats on A340 aircraft and 30 on its 747 fleet. On Virgin, dinner carts serving non-snoozing passengers may clatter around for a while after take-off. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong carrier, also offers a sleeper service in business class three times a week. After a meal before take-off, passengers are given a kimono-style dressing gown, blankets and pillows. Cathay tries to split those who opt for full service from those who want to sleep. Even people who find it difficult to sleep in aircraft should manage a bit more than 40 winks on such sleeper flights. The only thing missing, as one passenger said on a flight from Washington DC to London, is a teddy bear.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Defense and  Public Security Experts subgroup of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group ended its 16th meeting in Hong Kong yesterday.  The parties did not reach a consensus in all aspects on the  transfer of military-use land in Hong Kong, but made progress on  some issues. Both parties agreed to hold an informal meeting in  the next few days to continue their consultations.    In his interview with reporters after the meeting, Chen  Zuoer, head of the Chinese delegation, said: During these four  days, both parties have further narrowed their discrepancies and  made some progress. But there are some issues which need  further discussions. The Chinese side will try its best to  continue to seek a resolution to some pending problems in an  informal and flexible manner so as to reach an agreement at the  earliest possible date.</p>

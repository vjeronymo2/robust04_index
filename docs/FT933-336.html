			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sir Robert Jones sells Tasman Properties stake SIR Robert Jones, one of New Zealand's most flamboyant businessmen, has sold his shares in Tasman Properties, the company he founded in 1982. Falling property values and rising debt have forced the company gradually to sell all its property outside Australia and New Zealand. The shares stood at NZDollars 3.80 in 1987: they are currently around 8 cents. Sir Robert was deposed as chief executive last year by a group representing the company's new main institutional shareholder, New York-based Eyk Van Otterloo. The company subsequently changed its name from Robert Jones Investments to Tasman Properties. Earlier this month the High Court lifted a freeze on 40m Tasman shares owned by Sir Robert. The freeze was imposed last month after the Securities Commission alleged that Sir Robert had given inadequate information on share deals. Whitcoulls has agreed to buy Croxley Collins, the stationery group, for about NZDollars 50m (USDollars 28m), from the unlisted Spicers Papers. Croxley has annual sales revenue of around NZDollars 55m and prints Croxley writing papers, Collins diaries and Olympic school stationery. The Whitcoulls retail outlets already sell around 75 per cent of Croxley's products.</p>

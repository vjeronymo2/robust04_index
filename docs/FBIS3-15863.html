Yushenkov told Interfax the meeting, which took place in the  Pentagon on Tuesday and lasted an hour, had focused on the  possibility of Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for  Peace program, seen as a preparatory stage for membership of the  North Atlantic alliance.    Perry "did not deny that the program provides for the future  standardization of weapons according to NATO technology,"  Yushenkov said. He believes that, in view of this and since  "the framework agreements were drawn up without our  participation and do not conform to the status of Russia," the  State Duma must protest against Russia's joining the program,  despite the fact that most East European countries have either  joined it or stated their intent to do so.    But there was complete mutual understanding on the other two  issues, the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the future  ratification of the START-II treaty, Yushenkov said. It was  also agreed that Perry would meet State Duma members during his  end-of-March visit to Moscow.</p>

Faction  Chairman Moshe Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that  Rabin's willingness to include Tzomet in his cabinet is  tantamount to admitting the failure of his policy. According to  Qatzav, he has learned that Rabin is using Tzomet to freeze the  continuation of the implementation of the Oslo agreement after  the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.</p>

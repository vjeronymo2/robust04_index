			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Yorks Water plans cutbacks Yorkshire Water is set to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in a bid to beat the efficiency targets established in what is expected to be an increasingly restrictive price regime. The company said it would cut its 4,000 strong utility workforce by 400 this year. About half of the reduction arises from transferring employees to contractors now providing services which Yorkshire previously carried out itself. It has been estimated the reduction could result in cost savings of up to 15 per cent on an on-going basis. Yorkshire also announced that a substantial reduction in capital expenditure  -from Pounds 303m to Pounds 221m - meant it would meet the spending targets set at privatisation. Previously analysts had feared Yorkshire would spend much more than forecast, leaving it with a lower return than expected on funds invested. Yorkshire's comments came as it announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 139m to Pounds 144m for the year ended March 31. Turnover was ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 531m. The increase was achieved after lower than expected charges of Pounds 10m for rationalising the core utility division and against a Pounds 4.4m exceptional gain in 1993. The regulated businesses continued to suffer from a decline in demand from industrial customers. The fall was offset by a main charge increase of 7 per cent, leaving operating profits up 5 per cent at Pounds 153m. The non-regulated businesses, principally environmental and property, more than doubled profits at the operating level from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 7.2m, on sales 89 per cent higher at Pounds 51.9m. The property division contributed Pounds 3.8m. A final dividend of 15.2p makes 22.8p (21.25p) for the year. Earnings were up 4.6 per cent at 68p (65p), although the increase rises to 8.3 per cent when a Pounds 4.4m exceptional gain in 1993 is excluded. COMMENT Yorkshire is proving its determination to get to grips with costs and surprised many by its tough line on capital expenditure. With the benefits yet to feed through on technology improvements it seems one of the better bets to beat whatever efficiency targets are set by the regulator in the current price review. Nevertheless, the sector is likely to be dogged by uncertainty until the end of July when the pricing regime becomes public. Forecasts are for about Pounds 155m, with the usual cautious approach to the dividend leaving expectations of a 7.8 per cent rise to 24.6p.</p>

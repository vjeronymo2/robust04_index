			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips optimistic on consumer electronics PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that it was optimistic about the long-term prospects of consumer electronics, its single biggest activity, in spite of the set-backs suffered in the sector in 1991 and early 1992. Mr Jan Timmer, president, said the company intended to continue pursuing its strategy of gradually increasing its role in the 'software' side of consumer electronics - music, films, video rentals and other forms of entertainment - to complement its presence in the world market for televisions, compact disc players and video-cassette recorders. He also said that Philips currently had no plans for a share issue to finance future investments. Instead, it would continue to seek ways to run its businesses at a lower cost level. Speaking at the Philips shareholders' meeting, Mr Timmer acknowledged that serious problems in consumer electronics had masked the overall progress which the company had made in returning to lasting profitability. He said that the difficulties in consumer electronics would eventually come to an end, enabling Philips to reap the full benefits of the restructuring and cost-cutting programmes launched in 1990. However he was unable to say when the market would begin to recover. 'The only big set-back (in 1991) was in consumer electronics, and the first quarter (of 1992) did not show an improvement,' he said. Mr Timmer conceded rescue operations at Super Club, Philips' loss-making, 51 per cent-owned, Belgian-based video-rental chain, had brought unforeseen problems for the group. He said Philips would press ahead with attempts to restructure Super Club's finances and to buy out minority shareholders. Talks with minority shareholders, bankers and bondholders had entered a 'decisive' stage, he added. Earlier this week, Philips reported a 29 per cent increase in first-quarter net profit in spite of the fact that its consumer electronics business slipped into the red, due to fierce competition on the global consumer market. In 1991, Philips returned to a full-year net profit of Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 650m) from a record loss of Fl 4.24bn the year before, when the company took restructuring provisions of Fl 4.6bn.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Chile resolves presidency row The heads of Chile's political parties have settled a long-running dispute, by agreeing to cut the presidential mandate from eight to six years, less than 48 hours before today's presidential and parliamentary elections, writes David Pilling from Santiago. Mr Eduardo Frei, who is the candidate of the governing Concertacion coalition, is clear favourite to win the presidency. The agreement to cut the term must be confirmed by Congress.</p>

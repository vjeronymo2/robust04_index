			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [AzerTadzh report: "The Production Recession Continues"] </F>   [Text] The stabilization of the economy being forecast this  year has not begun yet, judging by the results of the first  month. According to data provided by the republic's Goskomstat  [State Committee for Statistics], the decline in industrial  production in January, compared with the same period last year,  was recorded at 11.3 percent.    The situation was worse in practically all sectors.    The situation in agriculture is even less comforting.    The production of automotive gasoline was increased  somewhat.  But against the background of nearly universal economic decline,  the situation in the wine and vodka sector was especially  heartening. Production of alcoholic beverages was nearly doubled  compared with January 1993.    As far as prices are concerned, they rose by nearly 10 times  as much during the year, but the average wage rose by just 4.3  times as much. It was 4,600 manats in January 1994.    The principal reasons for the production decline and the  worsening economic situation, according to the analysis cited by  the republic's Goskomstat, are the critical shortage at  enterprises of raw material and materials because of their  higher prices and enterprises' failure to make payments.</p>

In my opinion, they are particularly significant at a  time when the UN Human Rights Commission holds its annual  meeting in Geneva.    Havana -- One of the main goals sought by the U.S. blockade  against Cuba has been to obstruct medical aid to the population  in an effort to undermine support for the island's leaders.    The White House believed this action would be effective  because more than 40,000 pharmaceutical and medical products  (medicine, reagents, disposable material, surgical equipment,  and others) were registered in Cuba up to 1959. More than 80  percent of the products were sent by foreign firms, basically  U.S. firms, while Cuban laboratories purchased most of the raw  materials for their production -- low at the time -- in the  United States.    Aware of this dependence, U.S. officials worked hard to  obstruct that bilateral supply until it was suspended early in  the 1960's. They have later tried everything within their means  to force the rest of the world to do likewise.    The situation substantially worsened for the Cubans  following  the disappearance of socialist markets in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe, which served to considerably lessen the general  effects of the blockade for more than 30 years.    Under these circumstances, aside from receiving less income  in convertible currency, Cuba was compelled to pay higher costs  in freight and product prices -- given the distances and given  the special deals with businessmen who render their services or  supply medical products despite the risk of paying the sanctions  imposed by the U.S. blockade.    As a result of this, on a given year within the first half  of  the 1990's, Cuba had to disburse an extra $45 million to cover  its public health needs. Had it not been for the blockade, the  amount would have allowed, to use an example, the purchase of  enough powdered milk to produce 180 million liters of this  product.    One of the most negative effects of the U.S. policy of  isolation is the high cost of freight paid to import merchandise  from ports and airports in Europe and other distant areas.    Cuba: Were it not for the astronomical freight prices....    It is appropriate to remember that, since the implementation  of this line of conduct, the White House has forbidden U.S.  ships to load merchandise shipped from any country to Cuba or to  dock at any Cuban port; and in 1962 it established the so-called  "black list" of ships from other countries that traded with the  island. The provision to be removed from that list was to  suspend all trade with the island.    It is well known that this case history was somehow recast  in  1992 for the so-called Torricelli amendment, to officially  threaten with strong sanctions the ships that carried any  merchandise to Cuba.    As of 1993, official statistics show Havana had an annual  expense of $6 million in air and maritime freight for the public  health sector. The amount would have been $1 million or $2  million if the cargo had been purchased in markets located  nearby and under the normal circumstances which surround these  deals.    The effects of the blockade are simultaneously reflected in  a  foreign debt increase and a greater disbursement of hard  currency given the excessive cost of freight, air freight in  many cases, to guarantee the prompt arrival of critical products  which guarantee the health -- sometimes the life -- of human  beings.    The frequent use of air freight, despite the fact it is  much more expensive than sea freight, is because under current  circumstances Cuba's medical reserves do not always allow the  long waiting time by sea, in addition to the fact the blockade  also restrictions affect the availability of vessels.    The following is one example that illustrates this.    As already known, Cuba has been affected by a neuropathy  epidemic. Airfreight costs from Europe amounted to $237,448  just to cover a partial shipment of a contract for vitamins and  excipients (a substance that dissolves) to manufacture tablets  for the sick and as a preventive measure for the rest of the  population.    Had the blockade not forbidden access to the U.S. market and  access to nearby U.S. affiliates, to acquire these products  freight costs would have been $55,900. In other words, Cuba had  to pay $101,548 extra for just one of the many transactions  carried out to face this epidemic.    Another case.    When examining payments made between 1991 to 1992 for 32  products used in medical assistance from Europe, one can see in  airfreight alone $26,037 was spent. From the United States this  would have only amounted to $2,413.    With the $23,624, which Cuba was forced to pay due to the  blockade, Cuba could have purchased 10,453 packages of  methotrexate, which is used to treat children suffering from  acute leukemia, in other words, 87 percent of this product's  yearly requirement.    The Obsession To Leave Cuba Without Medicine [subhead]    For three decades the White House explicitly forbad Cuba to  acquire medicines in the U.S. market, the world's most  important. At the time, THE NEW YORK TIMES harshly criticized  this.    Something similar occurs with chemical reagents, which are  essential for the clinical analysis that guarantees health  services to the people and vital products for the development of  the medical- pharmaceutical industry.    The U.S. siege surrounding these essential materials has  forced Cuba to pay between 30 to 40 percent more to  intermediaries and spend more time to obtain the products it  needs, sometimes urgently.    If one considers the fact Cuba has very few financial  resources, one can better understand all the efforts the Cuban  authorities have to make to maintain the level of medical  assistance Cuba has, despite everything.    The neuropathy epidemic serves as an example for a better  idea regarding this.    Let's take, among the numerous documents, a contract Cuban  sanitary officials made available to me, covering only three  products (reagents) earmarked to fight the neuropathy epidemic,  which were purchased from a European supplier. The complete  operation, including freight, cost $1,938 per shipment.    To have some idea of how this affects the Cuban economy,  let's say that according to the price catalogue of the U.S. firm  Sigma, had there not been a blockade, the f.o.b. [free on board]  price for these products would have been $827; that is, 134  percent less for each purchase.    If this saving could have been made, with the money  difference, approximately 2,485 milliliters of cattle fetal  serum could have been obtained. This is an essential reagent  component used to test pregnant women for abnormal fetuses.    Another comparison serves to demonstrate more crudely the  realities of this uncommon process.    A contract for 1992 to 1993 which includes prices of 24  medical products turns out to be particularly significant when  it is compared with the supply of similar merchandise offered by  Miami- based Talgrex International Export Company.    In one single purchase, $986,386 in excess of the prices  announced by Talgrex were invested. This does not include the  burden that was imposed additionally by the freight.    For instance, one of the medications included in that  contract, the niphedipine [nifedipine], which is used for  treating cardiovascular disease, cost Havana $111.67, while in  the Talgrex catalog it was sold for $61.56, namely 81 percent  less.    There is another angle to the problem -- the multiple  obstacles that the blockade creates for Cuba when it wants to  obtain specific medication. The situation worsens even more when  it is necessary to resort to a costly and prolonged medication.    Third generation antibiotics are part of this intricate  general context. They are an essential part of the work carried  out at intensive care units and the cytostatic treatment of  cancer patients.    An important U.S. company, Lilly, and its branches in Latin  America manufacture insulin, which -- as it is well known -- is  essential for diabetic patients. However, these companies  refuse, using the blockade as an excuse, to sell this product to  Cuba, which has tried to resort to the distant European market  to guarantee medical attention for these persons.    There are 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 inhabitants on the  island, and a considerable part of them are insulin dependent.  This means their lives are closely linked to the existence or  lack of this much sought after pharmaceutical product.    Please ... give handicapped Cubans a chance in Geneva.    Another significant example is shown in Havana's relations  with the Dutch firm Enraf Nonius, which supplied equipment and  spare parts for the rehabilitation of handicapped patients until  1991, to the extreme that 80 percent of the facilities came from  that source.    On 16 July 1991 the Dutch company sent a message to the  Cuban  capital notifying that it was suspending its shipments because  George Bush's Republican government did not grant it the  authorizations demanded by the blockade for products which have  a certain degree of U.S. components.    Since this step jeopardized the treatment of numerous  handicapped patients, the Caribbean nation's authorities were  compelled, as in other cases, to seek more costly solutions in  the world despite the country's precarious financial situation.    In the technology sector, the Cuban health system is  compelled, essentially by the blockade, to resort to  extraordinary measures to purchase textbooks and magazines,  while facing multiple limitations when its specialists want to  participate in courses and scientific meetings held in the  United States.    Books also fall prey to this attitude. The Spanish firm  Inter- American Publishers House, Inc. sold Cuba the medical  books it needed, but transactions were suspended in 1991 when  the enterprise was bought by the U.S. firm McGraw-Hill.    Despite all this Cuba has achieved extraordinary development  in the public health sector, a fact that is recognized even by  relevant members of U.S. scientific institutions which have  participated in neuropathy research since 1993 in what  represents the pioneer group involved in a noble activity that  should be carried out some day in the third world.    What the United Nations now demands as a foremost goal for  underdeveloped nations on the brink of a new millennium, Cuba  already achieved and surpassed years ago -- sometimes at levels  that are similar to the ones which currently prevail in  developed countries. In fact, it protects its basic  achievements in this area despite Washington's systematic  efforts to jeopardize its health care system. Those efforts are  part of an overall plan to create internal problems and  undermine the lifestyle which currently prevails on the island  and, eventually, cause it to revert.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Observer: O'Malley was here One of the great trade secrets of the world's industrial paints business can now be told. How did Austin O'Malley, just retired as head of PPG's European automotive paints business, always appear to be in several places at once? The 65-year-old Irishman developed the technique in the 1960s when working for Pinchin Johnson, which supplied paint to the Ford and Vauxhall factories on opposite banks of the Mersey. O'Malley was the technical support man for both plants and soon found that he could not flit quickly enough between Ford at Speke and Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port to keep both sets of bosses happy. So when he was in Speke for the day, he persuaded the Ellesmere Port receptionists to put out regular messages over the factory Tannoy calling him to the foyer, or the paint shop office, and so on. The Speke receptionists did the same when he was at Ellesmere Port. Former colleagues, who tried in vain to find O'Malley in factories where his name was being broadcast, swear the technique made him a household name and helped advance his career up the European paints ladder.</p>

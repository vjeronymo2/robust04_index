			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / People: Telegraphed Dan Colson, the London-based Canadian lawyer and long-term associate of Conrad Black, publisher of the Daily Telegraph, is to join The Telegraph group as an executive director from the beginning of December. He will be director with responsibility for acquisitions and external relations, but will also be vice-chairman of the group - which publishes the Daily and Sunday Telegraph and has stakes in a number of other newspaper groups around the world. Colson, 45, a senior partner of lawyers Stikeman Elliott, has been a non-executive director of The Telegraph since 1986 and is also a director of Hollinger, its Canadian parent. He is chairman of the executive committee of The Telegraph's associated company in Australia, John Fairfax, publishers of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age. Sir Frank Rogers remains deputy chairman of The Telegraph. But one member of the star-studded non-executive board, financier Sir James Goldsmith, has decided to retire. Sir James says he is so seldom in the UK that he cannot be present at the periodic board meetings and so cannot meaningfully contribute to the affairs of the company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputies to the Ninth National Assembly while  attending the fifth session in Hanoi have agreed that industrial  and agricultural production are expected to achieve and surpass  the yearly plan. Discussing the implementation of socioeconomic  tasks in the first six months of 1994, they said that external  economic activities are attracting many foreign investors with  large projects, national defense and security are insured, and  progress has been made in diplomatic relations and other fields.    Many deputies maintained that the party lines and government  policies have helped develop agricultural production, the  winter- spring crop this year has yielded a good harvest, and  farmers' lives are improving. They held that in face of the  challenges of the market economy, industrial and handicraft  production still maintains its importance.    Deputies from Ho Chi Minh City stressed the development of  the power industry. They said the inauguration of the last  generator unit of the Hoa Binh hydroelectric power plant in  northern Vietnam, the Ba Ria gas turbine power plant in southern  Vietnam, and the completion of the 500-KV north-south  transmission line will help boost the Vietnamese economy and  people's lives.    Some others laid stress on the deployment of the program on  equitization of state enterprises. The National Assembly  deputies also held that results obtained in national defense and  security also contribute to national socioeconomic development.  They acknowledged the progress made in education, personnel  training, and cultural and information activities.    However, they also outlined the difficulties in highland  education. The deputies said the fight against public property  waste, corruption, and smuggling was a very important but  difficult and complicated task. They demanded that tougher  measures should be taken to cope with these social evils.</p>

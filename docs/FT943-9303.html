			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Nigerians dig holes for jet fuel Nigeria has gold in the north, marble in the middle belt and oil in the south-east but in Lagos people are digging for jet fuel. For the past month crowds have arrived in a patch of bush next to the international airport, carrying jerry cans and scooping the fuel out of pits they have dug in the ground or out of pools forming on the surface. The jet fuel has leaked out of an underground pipeline running from the outskirts of the city to the hydrant installation at Lagos international airport. Jet fuel is a substitute for kerosene, which millions of Nigerians depend on for cooking but supplies are running out. The place is called Mafoluku, but has been nicknamed 'Bakassi', after the peninsula where troops from Nigeria and Cameroon clashed earlier this year, because it is full of oil and soldiers. A platoon of soldiers guarding an office of the state-owned Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) next to the pipeline shows no sign of interest while the people mill around shallow pits underneath two government signs which say 'Safety on the job begins here' and 'No smoking'. Mafoluku shows the extent of the break-down in the public sector and what many Nigerians will do just to get by in life. 'There has been a leak there for about two years and despite repeated attempts PPMC have still not fixed it,' says an executive for one of the oil companies which run the jet fuelling operation at the airport. 'It is not dangerous to use this for cooking, it's basically the same fuel. These people are getting it for free. There is no kerosene around because it is all being used as jet fuel to keep flights going.' Domestic fuels are supplied by PPMC and officially sold at a subsidised price of some 4 pence sterling a litre, but for most of this year it has been scarce. Long queues of women and children with their kerosene cans have become a normal sight outside petrol stations. The six-week political strike by the oil workers' unions Nupeng and Pengassan has made fuel almost unobtainable except at a 1,000 per cent mark-up on the black market. Kerosene and LPG cooking gas can be bought only at black market prices 12 times the official price (around 50 pence a litre of kerosene). Many manual workers are paid the equivalent of about Pounds 10 a week and cannot afford these prices. Those who wish to play it safe are reduced to searching for firewood. The unions are demanding the end of Gen Sani Abacha's regime and release of Mr Moshood Abiola, banned winner of last year's presidential election, who has been jailed for treason. Last week's general strike is suspended until next Tuesday's hearing of the court trying Mr Abiola in Abuja. But the Lagos branch of the Nigeria labour congress has stayed out, bringing the commercial capital in Mr Abiola's Yoruba heartland near to standstill. A bank strike, just ended, delayed payments of July salaries; public transport is scarce; and power cuts are worse than usual. But some people have cooking fuel, unorthodox though it is.</p>

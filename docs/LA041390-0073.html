			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> EX-SEN. CHILES ENTERS RACE FOR GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, a fixture in Florida politics for three decades,  shook up the state's gubernatorial race by entering the Democratic primary.  </P> <P> Chiles, 60, formed a ticket with former Rep. Buddy MacKay as his lieutenant  governor candidate -- a pairing some Democrats immediately called the "dream  team." Chiles retired from the Senate after the 1988 election. He served in the  Florida Legislature from 1958 to 1970, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.  MacKay was defeated in 1988 by Republican Connie Mack in a race for the seat  Chiles vacated.  </P></p>

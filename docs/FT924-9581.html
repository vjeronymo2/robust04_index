			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nippon Mining slides 36.5% for half-year NIPPON Mining, the Japanese metal processing and oil refining group, yesterday reported a 36.5 per cent slide to Y3.06bn (Dollars 25m) in parent company pre-tax profits in the half-year to September from Y4.81bn a year earlier, as a result of weak demand and prices throughout its core businesses. Sales fell by 11.7 per cent to Y384.84bn from Y435.72bn. In the metals side of the business, sales fell by Y13.9bn to Y141.1bn, with sales of copper, gold, and silver all reduced in value. The volume of zinc sales fell, although a rise in prices helped improve the value of sales. The volume of petroleum products sales fell from 8.69m kilolitres to 8.16 kilolitres, while the value of sales was off by Y39.45bn to Y241.26bn. At the net level, Nippon Mining's profits fell by 64.5 per cent to Y905m from Y2.55bn.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / People: Medeva picks internal candidate Medeva, the drugs company which saw its share price battered after a profits warning in July, has picked its one internal candidate, European regional director Bill Bogie, for the new post of chief executive with effect from the beginning of next year. Executive chairman Bernard Taylor, who announced his intention to split the top management spot at the interims in August, says that as the headhunters got to work, it became clear that Bogie, who arrived only in April, was 'head and shoulders' above the other candidates. Bogie, 49, has impressed his new chairman by 'grasping the nettle' over Europe, 'neatly executing a potentially painful rationalisation'. His background also matches the company's requirements for a chief executive 'steeped in pharmaceutical lore'. A medical doctor by training, Bogie spent four years in the Health Service before joining Hoechst Pharmaceuticals, initially on the research side, in 1972. He worked in Germany and the US in the early 1980s, and later ran Hoechst Pharmaceuticals in the UK before joining Medeva. When Bogie takes over, the company's founder Ian Gowrie-Smith will relinquish his title of managing director. 'That will not change his task qualitatively; he was always the corporate development man,' says Taylor, conceding that, given the company's enfeebled share price, 'we have difficulty in generating enough acquisition work to keep him interested'. While no directors would be getting bonuses this year, Gowrie-Smith's basic salary of Pounds 287,000 would be reviewed when the company had 'a better assessment as to what the future holds for near term acquisitions', Taylor added. The shares closed up 1 1/2 p at 139p yesterday.</p>

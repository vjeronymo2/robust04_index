			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A senior official of  the Communist Party of China (CPC), Hu Jintao, said here today  that China intends to increase and expand the friendly contacts  between the CPC and the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan  on the basis of four principles covering inter-party relations.    "China also wishes to enhance its long-term friendly ties  and  cooperation with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles  of peaceful co-existence," said Hu, a Standing Committee member  of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at a  meeting with a delegation from the People's Democratic Party of  Uzbekistan.    The delegation, led by A.M. Jalolov [spelling of name as  received], second secretary of Uzbekistan's party central  committee, arrived here on June 15 as the CPC's guests.    Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee, noted that traditional friendship between the two  countries has grown since they established diplomatic ties.    He noted that Uzbekistan President Islam Azim Karimov's  visit  to China in 1992 and Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to  Uzbekistan in April this year gave a powerful impetus to the  growth of bilateral relations in depth and opened a new chapter  for such relations.    Jalolov said the bilateral relations between the two  countries and the two parties are developing satisfactorily.    The Uzbekistan people and party are greatly interested in  the  tremendous achievements that China has made in reform and  construction, he said.    Jalolov expressed the hope that his current visit will  enable  him to learn more about China's experience.    Besides Beijing, the delegation is expected to visit  Shanghai  and east China's Jiangsu Province.</p>

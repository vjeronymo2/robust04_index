			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Beeston: "Hurd Condemns Squalid State of </F> Gaza"]    [Text] Gaza -- Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, set  aside his normally cool manner yesterday when he visited the  Gaza Strip and spoke with emotion about the squalor and  deprivation he witnessed.    "Whether you know it well or are here for the first time,  you  can be sure of one thing, this is no way to run a community of  this number of people," said Mr Hurd, whose Israeli police  escort attracted a hail of stones from Palestinian youngsters.  "There is built-in disease, pollution on a monstrous scale and  violence which has not improved since the Israel-PLO agreement.  These are getting worse. There is evidence of greater cynicism  and frustration."    To improve conditions, Britain is spending 70 million pounds  in the occupied territories during the next three years;  yesterday Mr Hurd also unveiled plans to help to set up a  Palestinian government, including offering to help organise  elections scheduled for the occupied territories in July and to  train Palestinian civil servants.    There was still no clear sign yesterday of when the Israelis  and Palestinians would return to the negotiating table.  Disagreements over future sovereignty, security and land have  delayed the transfer from Israeli military control to  Palestinian self-rule, which had been due to take place in Gaza  and in the West Bank town of Jericho on December 13. The sense  of crisis was compounded by attempts yesterday to resolve new  splits between the PLO and Jordan and between the Palestinians.    Mr Hurd said that the 26-year Israeli military occupation,  which he described as a "denial of human rights", must come to  an end and he asked opponents of the agreement what alternative  they had to the deal signed in Washington last year.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Travel side helps Hogg Robinson jump to Pounds 15m HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services company, yesterday announced a sharp increase in profits compared to 1990-'91, when its travel business was hit by the Gulf war. Pre-tax profits rose 86 per cent to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 8.16m) in the year to March 31, on sales up 11 per cent at Pounds 102.5m (Pounds 92.5m). At the interim stage, which covers the busy summer holiday period, profits improved by almost a quarter to Pounds 10.85m on sales of Pounds 52m (Pounds 48.6m). The results were slightly ahead of expectations and the shares gained 7p to 220p. Mr Brian Perry, chairman and managing director, said all divisions had performed well, especially financial counselling and European transport. Bookings for this summer through the company's 214 high street travel agencies were running at about 8 per cent ahead of last year. 'But it's been declining in the last six weeks and a hoped for surge after the election didn't materialise,' he said. The travel division turned from operating losses of Pounds 2.63m - caused by the Gulf war and Pounds 3m of cost cutting - to profits of Pounds 4.44m. Following last year's rationalisation involving 200 job losses, productivity increased 16 per cent. Business travel also improved. Transport, which covers commercial freight operations in Europe and the Falkland Islands, lifted operating profits to Pounds 4.66m (Pounds 3.92m). Turnover was helped by a five-month contribution from Belgian trailer company Dens group, acquired last year for Pounds 6.83m. Financial services, which saw good growth advising on employee pensions, lifted operating profits to Pounds 4.65m (Pounds 3.66m). Interest payments fell to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 4.44m) due to lower interest rates and a Pounds 4m fall in net cash to Pounds 29m at the year end. Earnings almost doubled to 14.01p (7.4p). The total dividend payment for the year is 6.3p (5.55p), via a recommended final of 3.8p (3.3p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The time is approaching for the complete withdrawal  of Russian forces from Latvia. A decision was made at a  government session which has just taken place, on permission for  Russian military personnel and members of their families to stay  until 31 August. We asked Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the  government commission for monitoring the withdrawal of the  Russian Army, to comment.    [Begin Upmalis recording] So far, permits of stay have been  valid until 30 June. As the stipulated period is expiring and  the deadline for the withdrawal set in interstate agreements is  31 August, amendments were made today to the previous decision,  and it was stipulated that permits to stay have been extended  until 31 August 1994. The procedure is that, Army units have to  submit lists of military personnel, as well as lists of members  of families, who have these permits to stay. [end recording]</p>

Koo said that he personally would not oppose Mainland  China's  participation in the civilian organization, which comprises  chambers of commerce in 18 Asian countries. Mainland China's  bid to participate in the regional body will be voted on by all  other CAPCCI members.    Additionally, regardless of whether Beijing fails in its bid  to join the group or not, the CAPCCI should not ignore the ROC's  contribution to the organization, whose permanent secretariat is  still based in Taipei, Koo added.    The 49th CAPCCI board meeting is scheduled to be held in  Papua New Guinea on April 28. The CAPCCI is the only  international organization in which the ROC takes part with its  official name intact.</p>

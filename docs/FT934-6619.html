			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Child health fund may have to close Trustees of the National Council for Child Health will decide today whether to wind up the charity following loss of government funding. The charity, the only one promoting immunisation and preventative health among children, risks closure when the government is seeking to raise overall health standards through its Health of the Nation strategy. Ms Fiona Fountain, director, said the charity had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain alternative finance to cover its core costs since a three-year programme of government funding had come to an end. Ms Fountain said: 'The government says that it is not its policy to provide core funding indefinitely. We are able to raise finance to run specific programmes, but grant-making trusts and similar organisations are unwilling to provide money to cover basic administrative costs.' The National Council for Child Health, whose patron is the Princess of Wales, needs to raise its income by about Pounds 75,000 to remain in operation.</p>

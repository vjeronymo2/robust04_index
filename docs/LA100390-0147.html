			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE CO., LAGUNA STRIKE TENTATIVE DEAL FOR CANYON;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY WOULD GET 2,150 ACRES FOR $78 MILLION THAT WOULD BE PAID  OVER FIVE YEARS.  </P> <P> After days of intense negotiations, the Irvine Co. informally agreed Tuesday to  sell 2,150 acres of Laguna Canyon land to the city for $78 million over a  five-year period.  </P> <P> However, the "agreement in principle" reached between the developer,  environmentalists and city negotiators needs to be studied by City Council  members before they give their final approval, officials said. The boards of  other organizations involved in the negotiations must also approve the  agreement before it is finalized.  </P> <P> But the tentative agreement signals an end to a long period of discord between  the company and Laguna Beach residents who were opposed to the 3,200-unit  Laguna Laurel development project. Environmentalists had vowed to stand in  front of bulldozers before abandoning their hopes of keeping the pristine land  as open space.  </P> <P> "I think the company has been very generous in basically gifting $80 million to  realize a $78-million purchase price," Irvine Co. Senior Vice President Gary  Hunt said after the tentative agreement was reached.  </P> <P> Although the land was independently appraised at $105 million, the Irvine Co.  added to the valuation $30.5 million that it said would be needed to meet the  terms of a development agreement with the county.  </P> <P> According to the terms of the agreement, the company will drop the price from  $105 million to $78 million, assume the $30.5 million in required  infrastructure improvements and agree to forgo $22.8 million in interest  payments that would normally be assessed over the five-year period.  </P> <P> Following the council's closed-door session to consider the latest offer,  Councilman Robert F. Gentry stopped short of saying they had an agreement but  said they were very close. He thanked the Irvine Co. for making concessions on  the proposed purchase price.  </P> <P> "We are encouraged by the movement of the Irvine Co. The council is seriously  considering this plan, and we hope to have a final approved plan put together  this week," Gentry said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's negotiating session was hurriedly called after informal proposals  were exchanged in recent days between the Irvine Co. and Paul Freeman, the  go-between who was hired by both sides to help negotiate the land purchase  agreement.  </P> <P> The proposed purchase price was also a compromise for the city, which last  offered $75 million.  </P> <P> Although Gentry hedged on whether an agreement had been reached, Freeman said  he was optimistic the council would give its approval because it has scheduled  a special session to discuss the latest offer for later this week.  </P> <P> "It certainly represents a fair and balanced plan," he said.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for the city to pay $33 million by June 30 of next year.  That payment would buy 90% of the land, including most of the environmentally  sensitive property on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The next three years include payments of $3 million, $4 million, and $5  million, respectively, with $33 million due the final year.  </P> <P> Also in the agreement is an option for the city to purchase other parcels not  included in the Laguna Laurel development plan. The city would be required to  exercise that option within five years.  </P> <P> "We got a lot for a little in the first year, and we have five years to pursue  other funding sources," Freeman said.  </P> <P> Part of the city's first-year payment would come from a $20-million bond issue  that Laguna Beach voters will be asked to approve on the Nov. 6 ballot. The  county has also promised $10 million over five years, and the city is looking  to state grants and private fund raising to help meet the payments.  </P> <P> Officials are under pressure to wrap up the land negotiations this week in  order to give city residents enough time to study the proposed agreement before  voting on the bond issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAGUNA LAUREL: A TENTATIVE DEAL  </P> <P> The Irvine Co.'s proposal calls for the Laguna Beach to pay $33 million by June  30, 1991. That payment would buy 90% of the land, including most of the  environmentally sensitive property on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The next three years include payments of $3 million, $4 million, and $5  million, respectively, with $33 million due the final year.  </P> <P> Also in the agreement is an option for the city to buy other parcels not  included in the Laguna Laurel development plan.  </P> <P> Part of the city's first-year payment would come from a $20-million bond issue  that Laguna Beach voters will be asked to approve Nov. 6. The county has also  promised $10 million over five years, and the city is looking to state grants  and private fund raising to help meet the payments.  </P></p>

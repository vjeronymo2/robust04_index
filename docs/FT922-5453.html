			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Baby unit at Holloway - Radio JENNI Murray presented part of Woman's Hour on Tuesday from the prison chapel of Holloway Prison. It marked the opening of the mother-and-baby unit, one of Judge Tumim's proposals, that will provide a kind of normal life for the young mothers. Inmates can give birth in prison (in former days women so far into pregnancy were usually acquitted]) and breast-feed their babies. The rule is, however, that babies must be given up after nine months. Esther Rantzen, in the visiting party, proposed that, if this limit is enforced, there should be a nearby toddlers' unit. There were some 200 prisoners and prison officers at the opening, and they had their chance to put questions and make suggestions. There was a feeling of friendly cooperation both between prisoners and officers. Much emphasis was given to letter-writing, evidently an important concern to the prisoners. The Bill Naughton celebration moved to Radio 4, where on Sunday and Monday they gave his last play, Derby Day, a two-part job set in working-class Bolton in 1921. It had exchanges like 'She's having a stand-up bath.' - 'What, on a Wednesday?'. A seven-shilling win on a shilling bet was a fortune. World War One songs and recollections abounded, a harvest of nostalgia for those who cared. But the tales were only of magazine-story quality, even if we did have a live close-up of Polly giving birth to a son in her front kitchen. Very nicely done under Jane Morgan's direction. The Monday evening play, for such as had survived all that Naughton, was Heretics by Alison Leonard. Its principals all wanted to become priests. They were gay Gavin, in love with rough Bernard; Keith, married to Maggie, but in love with Julie (who wants to be a nun); and Maggie herself, of whom I mainly learned that she could not pray to a feminine God. Radio 3's prime offer was a 15-minute German piece, Der Findling, a Prix Futura winner in 1991, which I heard last year and was entranced to hear again. It is a setting of part of Heiner Muller's poem about a young East Berliner, adopted by his hard-Left father from a Nazi camp, later shopped by him for his radical opinions. When the Berlin wall comes down, the new Germany proves not what he was after, not all that Coca-Cola: we struggled so hard, now all will be forgotten. The repeated vergessen und vergessen und vergessen is dreadful. My German is poor, but I heard my tape two or three times when it was done last and have heard it three times so far this week - not only for the fine rhythmic speaking of the verse, but for the wonderfully imaginative background assembled by the director, Heiner Goebbels. The play was given as part of a double bill, the other half an adaptation of Susan Sontag's The Way We Live Now, a symphony of voices discussing the illness (presumably Aids, though not specified) of a friend. This was re-translated from Valerie Stiegeler's adaptation in German, and is played by a star British company under Michael Fox. On Tuesday, Radio 4 gave us the first of two pieces on the Mission Aviation Fellowship, which provides free air transport in 36 countries with 300 light aircraft. This week we heard about about a flight from Kampala to Karamoja in northern Uganda: first, a hospital in Kotido where they run 'eye safaris' to heal trachoma and so on, then on to Morota, near the Kenya border, where a British blacksmith teaches the villagers to use old car-springs in simple engineering. Next week we go from Mwanza in Tanzania to Magwanza on the border with Burundi, where a 100-bed hospital serves an area as big as Wales. I liked the MAF even better than those talkative flying doctors in the Antipodes. ment of yesterday's Kaleido</p>

At a Chongwadae [presidential residence] dinner he hosted  for  overseas mission chiefs and their spouses, Kim said the  organization and function of overseas missions should change for  the sake of new diplomacy.    "You should do actively anything that can be of help to  strengthening the country's competitiveness," the president said.    Stating he is planning to have summit meetings with the  leaders of major countries and would attend an APEC  (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit meeting taking place  in November in Indonesia, President Kim asked the senior  diplomats to try to ensure national interests solidly in the  course of preparing these and other events.    Korean mission chiefs posted in the American and Asian areas  are now visiting the home country to attend an annual mission  chiefs meeting.</p>

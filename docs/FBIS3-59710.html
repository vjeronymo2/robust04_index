			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Asahi Ciba, a joint-venture company of Asahi  Chemical Industry and Swiss Ciba-Geigy, announced on 20  September 1993, that it would transfer the complete control of  sales from its parent companies and would be involved in the  total operation of the company, from development and production  through sales. Through this reorganization move, the company  hopes to gain the competitive strength necessary in order to  succeed in the epoxy business where competition among too many  companies (over ten companies) are rapidly becoming overheated  on the domestic market....    Thus far Asahi Ciba has been producing epoxy resin at a  35,000-ton plant located within the Asahi Chemical Industry  Mizushima Plant. The amount of its annual sales is &yen;6  billion. Until now, sales have been handled by Asahi Chemical,  which sold epoxy resins under the product name of ``AER,'' and  by Japan Ciba-Geigy, which sold the same product under the name,  ``Araldite,'' while Asahi Ciba has been involved only in  production. Approximately 167,000 tons of epoxy resins are  expected to be used in 1993, in coating and laminated plates,  semiconductor sealing agents, and in adhesive agents.    The fact that an excessive number of both domestic and  overseas epoxy resin makers, with [Toto Kasei] as a leading  manufacturer, are competing for their share of the market  intensifies competition. It is contributing to poor  profitability, making things worse for every one involved.    As its restructuring move, Asahi Ciba has decided to  establish an integrated business system. Under the new setup,  Asahi Ciba has integrated within Japan Ciba-Geigy its R&amp;D  Division and bolstered product development functions. Moreover,  it has newly established a sales office in Osaka where the  product will be sold under the name, ``Araldite-AER.'' The  company's plan is to achieve the sales goal of &yen;10 billion  by the year 2000.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS BEATS OXNARD, 7-3, TO RETAIN SHARE OF SECOND PLACE;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: COUGARS OVERCOME FIVE ERRORS AND 2-0 FIRST-INNING DEFICIT.  </P> <P> The first five batters reached base against College of the Canyons starter Mike  Teich, but Cougar Coach Len Mohney wasn't worried about falling behind by two  runs in Thursday's Western State Conference baseball game against host Oxnard.  </P> <P> "We've been doing this all year," Mohney said. "We've got something like 23  freshmen on the roster and at times it shows. But I thought we were in pretty  good shape after making all kinds of mistakes in the first and only trailing by  two.  </P> <P> "I figured the rest of the game would be easy after that."  </P> <P> Mohney figured correctly.  </P> <P> Canyons defeated Oxnard, 7-3, to stay a half-game behind first-place Moorpark  (6-1) in the WSC standings, and set up a second-place showdown Saturday  afternoon with Cuesta, which remained tied with the Cougars at 5-1 after  defeating Bakersfield, 12-5.  </P> <P> Canyons committed five errors -- two in the first, two in the fourth, and one  in the eighth -- but Teich and Jason Farrell combined on a five-hitter as  Cougars improved their overall record to 13-6.  </P> <P> Teich, who forced a runner at home and struck out two to end the first, allowed  four hits, and three runs (one earned) in eight innings. He also struck out  four, walked three and hit one batter.  </P> <P> And the Cougar offense, which stranded at least one runner in each of the first  eight innings, scored three insurance runs on Steve Kovacic's home run in the  ninth.  </P> <P> After giving up two runs on one hit in the first, Teich retired the side in the  second and third and would have done the same in the fourth if not for errors  by shortstop Charlie Fowlks and second baseman Kovacic.  </P> <P> Trailing, 2-1, after three innings, the Cougars scored twice in the fourth to  take a lead they would never relinquish.  </P> <P> Kovacic (two for four, three runs batted in and three runs scored) walked with  one out, went to third on Jon Beauchemin's bloop single to right field and  scored on Mike Stephenson's sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Billy Horvat drove in Stephenson with a double off the left-field fence.  </P> <P> "Once we got out of the first, I figured Mike would be OK," Mohney said.  </P> <P> With Teich limiting the Condors (9-11, 2-4) to a double and single in the  fifth, sixth and seventh, Canyons extended its lead to 4-2 with a run in the  eighth, then reverted to its defensive problems in the bottom half of the  inning.  </P> <P> Oxnard's Pat Avila reached first on third baseman Beauchemin's error to start  the inning, went to second on a passed ball, took third on a sacrifice fly by  Tim Johnson, and scored one out later on Al Anaya's single.  </P> <P> Teich walked Juan Benavidez, but Manny Mejia flied out to end the rally.  </P> <P> Canyons scored three runs in the ninth to take some pressure off its pitching  staff.  </P> <P> Fowlks and Gary Morgan led off with consecutive singles, and, after Chris  Vasquez flew out and Junior Trujillo forced Morgan at second, Kovacic hit his  three-run shot that bounced off the top of the left-field fence.  </P> <P> "We finally executed in the ninth," Mohney said. "You win baseball games by  playing defense and hitting in the late innings. . . . I know that's an  overused cliche, but it's true."  </P> <P> Morgan and Beauchemin each had two hits for Canyons.  </P> <P> John Brookman (6-2) took the loss.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / CBI survey reveals 'fragile' recovery A GLOOMY survey from the Confederation of British Industry confirmed yesterday that the pace of economic recovery has slowed since the summer, strengthening calls for an early cut in interest rates. Over the last four months, manufacturing orders and output were flat, export orders fell, more jobs in industry were lost and business confidence weakened, the CBI reported. Sir David Lees, chairman of the confederation's economic affairs committee, said: 'The recovery, while still moving slowly forward, is fragile, with considerable uncertainty about the prospects for exports.' He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to take advantage of subdued inflationary pressures to cut interest rates from the present 6 per cent and help sustain recovery and investment. The CBI's message contributed to a sharp drop in share prices as the FT-SE 100 share index closed 19.5 points down at 3,165.3. The pound lost early gains against the D-Mark to close unchanged, and fell more than half a cent against the dollar. It closed in London at DM2.4875 and Dollars 1.4795, with little change in New York. Although manufacturers still hope for a modest improvement in demand and production over the next four months, the results of the survey - covering 1,316 companies responsible for 2m employees - will add to a growing realisation that sluggish demand in continental Europe is holding back recovery in the UK. The CBI reported that for the first time since the survey started in 1958, more companies expect unit costs to fall than to rise. Over the past four months, more companies cut their output prices than raised them. Investment in plant and machinery is not expected to rise, while investment in buildings is expected to fall. Companies report, however, that they intend to spend money on innovation and training over the next year. The survey indicated that manufacturers have made further cuts in export prices. The CBI warned that if expectations of a pick-up in export demand over the next four months were not met, then 'it is likely that the recovery could be very sluggish into the new year'. It also said another 33,000 manufacturing jobs would be lost over the next three months with large companies planning the biggest cuts.

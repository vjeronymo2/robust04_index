			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Italians to shed 11,600 steel jobs ILVA, the loss-making, state-run steel group, has unveiled plans to axe over a quarter of its 40,000-strong workforce in response to EC pressure to cut Italy's over-capacity and end state subsidies. The job cuts are part of Ilva's plan to split the group into two companies - flat products and special steels - in order to privatise. The project is due to be decided at the end of the month by the Ilva board, headed by Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese executive brought in earlier this year to reorganise the group. According to the plan, 11,600 jobs will be lost between 1994-96, the bulk of which will come from the workforce producing flat products at Taranto, Europe's largest steel plant, and Novi Ligure, near Genoa. Some 5,000 workers already laid off will not be rehired. This is a far more radical solution than originally envisaged. It has been drawn up in the past three months after the government recognised the EC would only be satisfied with a clear commitment to rationalise Ilva. The trades unions have been warned well in advance and their protests are likely to be directed less at the job cuts than at the redundancy terms, retraining and investments in fresh employment - especially in the Taranto area of southern Italy. The German government was likely to oppose a restructuring plan for the Spanish steel industry, backed by the European Commission, unless it was radically changed, officials in Bonn confirmed yesterday, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Senior officials said the plan, which EC industry ministers will be asked to approve in November, was 'completely unacceptable in its present form'. The plan foresees state aid amounting to Ecu2.77bn (Pounds 2.14bn). German officials say these state subsidies remain 'much too high'.</p>

Belousov, identified by caption]    [Text] [Prokofyeva over shot of garbage dump] It is a  golden fall in the Baltic region -- the smell of the sea and  autumn leaves. Except for here, that is. This is the infamous  garbage dump near Kaliningrad. My colleague Stanislav Chekalin  reported on it back in the days of perestroyka. And that old  footage in no way differs from today's. In recent times an  increase in intestinal illnesses has been noted in Kaliningrad.  Local experts and experts brought in from Moscow believe that  the garbage dump is largely responsible for this.    [Unnamed interviewee] The water from the Pregel river is the  reason for the outbreak of illnesses. Untreated effluent not  only from this garbage dump but also from the entire municipal  sewage network, and most importantly of all particles from pulp  and paper plants, are discarded into the river.    [T. Grunicheva, Kaliningrad's chief hygienist, identified by  caption] Documentation was sent to the prosecutor's office. A  lot of documentation, whole volumes of it. But all we got was a  terse reply -- just a few lines -- telling us that given the  absence of a corpus delicti the matter was being returned to us.    [V. Cheburayev, representative from Russia's State Committee  for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, identified by  caption] There is no material evidence of a crime. What they  mean is that our laws do not work. Our most fundamental  principle is the principle that the polluter should be made to  pay -- but it doesn't work anywhere.    [Chekalin] It's true. The laws do not work, and nor do the  purification facilities, whose construction began back in the  socialist era a quarter of a century ago under the requirements  of the International Convention of the Baltic Countries.  Hundreds of millions of rubles went to waste in every sense of  the word -- the construction projects were never finished. The  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision and the  municipal administration have worked out and approved a program  to protect Kaliningrad's population against epidemics.

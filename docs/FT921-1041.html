			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Oriel moves ahead 33% to Pounds 2.81m ORIEL GROUP, the insurance broker, lifted pre-tax profits by 33 per cent, from Pounds 2.11m to Pounds 2.81m, over the 1991 year. Commission income, net of discounts, and investments income improved from Pounds 8.76m to Pounds 12m. Mr Nigel Cayzer, chairman, said the group's strategy of concentrating on niche broking businesses 'proved more than resilient in the current weak economic climate'. Borrowings at the year-end amounted to Pounds 1.26m, reflecting a series of acquisitions and working capital requirements. Mr Cayzer stressed, however, that day-to-day operations were cash-generative and the group does not intend to maintain long-term borrowings. Earnings per share were 13.11p (11.15p); a proposed final dividend of 3.2p brings the total to 5p (4.5p).</p>

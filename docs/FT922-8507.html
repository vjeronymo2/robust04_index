			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Union Intl gets closer to agreement on debt standstill UNION International, the heavily indebted trading arm of the private Vestey Group, is putting the finishing touches to a standstill agreement on Pounds 350m debt owed to some 70 banks. Mr Paul Taylor, the former Lonrho executive who joined as Union's finance director in March, said yesterday that the group was 'a long way down the road' to completing the agreement. The standstill, expected to be announced in July along with 1991 results and a rationalisation programme, would run to December 1994. The Vestey family - which controls the Vestey Group, one of the UK's largest private companies - will provide an injection of more than Pounds 35m as part of the agreement, Mr Taylor said, but no more. Union has had to give the banks certain covenants, such as the disposal of assets. Several asset sales were under way, Mr Taylor said. The announcement last week that 600 of its 1,006 Dewhurst butchers shops were to be sold formed part of the disposal programme. However, the announcement had also in part been prompted by the fact that the 600 shops were incurring losses. He said Union had also discovered possible fraud - amounting to between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m - at one of its businesses. Some of the money had been recovered and Union was considering legal action.</p>

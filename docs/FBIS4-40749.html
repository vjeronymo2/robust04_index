			<p>BFN     [Text] The media can play a negative role in Russia's  political life, said Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  addressing on Monday the International Conference on the Role  and Responsibility of the Media in the Development of Democracy  and Tolerance.    "The recent parliamentary elections showed that a pathetic  political dwarf and scandalous figure can turn into a leader of  a parliamentary party due to a few snappy appearances on TV," he  said without disclosing the name of the politician he meant.    He believes that the danger of nationalism is still  threatening the country and that chauvinism and nationalism are  evident in many democratic publications.    He urged reporters to quote official statements more  exactly,  providing critical comments on them. "This will help highlight  the authors' idiocy," he said.</p>

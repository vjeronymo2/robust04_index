Where the Deputy Administrator determines a higher level of cost-share assistance is necessary to provide adequate incentive for a participant to perform a conservation practice, the Deputy Administrator may specifically authorize a higher level. See &sect;701.116 for special provision for low-income farmers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Levels of cost-share assistance under long-term agreements shall not be in excess of seventy-five (75) percent nor less than 50 percent of the average cost for each practice as determined by the COC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-share assistance, the average cost of performing a practice may be the average cost for either a county or a part of a county as determined by the COC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.111  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Starting practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Costs will not be shared for practices or components of practices that are started before COC approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.112  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Method of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved practice, taking into consideration the county allocation, the conservation and environmental problems in the county, the land involved, and the practices for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as most needed. The method approved shall provide for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice the number of units of the practice for which the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost-share assistance for the performance of that number of units of the practice. To the extent practicable, notices of approved practices shall be issued before performance of the practice is started. No practice may be approved for cost-share assistance except as authorized by the county program, or according to procedures incorporated therein. Available funds for cost-share assistance shall not be allocated on a proportionate share basis; however, cost-share funds shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most enduring benefits attainable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Annual agreements may be approved in all counties. Long-term agreements are limited to farms or ranches which are within Soil Conservation Districts (or comparable districts) through which the SCS provides planning and technical services, except:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Farms and ranches located within a county designated for the Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) are only eligible if not covered by GPCP contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Farms and ranches not located within a Soil Conservation District or comparable district may be eligible for a long-term agreement provided CPO's are developed by the farmer or rancher in cooperation with the SCS and approved by an appropriate State official or, in cases where an appropriate State official is not available, approved by the SCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.113  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Long-term agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) program years nor more than ten (10) program years. The COC and the signors to the long-term agreement in consultation with the SCS representative shall mutually determine the period of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The long-term agreement will be based on a CPO for the farm or ranch or portion thereof which has been approved by the Soil Conservation District or comparable district or for farms or ranches not located in a Soil Conservation District or comparable district, by an appropriate State Official or the SCS, as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The long-term agreement will provide that the farmer or rancher will perform those measures in the CPO's which are determined to be essential to meeting the basic conservation needs of the farm or ranch, or portion thereof, regardless of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The owner of the farm or ranch will be required to sign a long-term agreement regardless of whether that person contributes to the cost of approved practices thereon except in cases where the long-term agreement consists wholly of integrated crop management practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Any party to a long-term agreement who is not an owner of the farm or ranch shall provide assurance of control of the land for the duration of the period of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera] </F>   [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] yesterday said  it was willing to resume exploratory talks for peace with the  government, but continued to press demands the government has  described as "unreasonable."    "The (NDF) is willing to resume exploratory talks on the  basis of firm adherence to The Hague Declaration," said a faxed  statement signed by Connie Ledesma, executive director of the  leftist group's international office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.    Ledesma said that NDF negotiator Luis Jalandoni wrote  Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the government panel, stressing  the need for preliminary talks before the conduct of exploratory  talks "to adequately resolve" some issues.    The NDF office in Utrecht is demanding that the government  rescind Executive Order [EO] 125 which the rebels said limits  the scope of the talks to the confines of the Constitution.    The NDF also demanded that the government stop "coddling"  breakaway communist leaders.    The NDF statement also said the "deadline" set by the  government was "totally unacceptable" to the NDF. Dee earlier  said that if nothing happens to the negotiations by the end of  the first quarter, the government may start talking with the  other factions in the communist movement.    Ledesma said that the NDF panel's position was based on a  memorandum on the conduct of exploratory talks issued by NDF  Chairman Manuel Romero, believed to be the alias used by rebel  leader Antonio Zumel who, together with Satur Ocampo,  represented the NDF in the failed 1986 talks.    In the memorandum, Romero reportedly warned the current NDF  negotiators not to be tricked by the "objectionable" EO 125  which he said "delimits the... talks to the existing Philippine  Constitution."    "(EO 125) must be withdrawn if the NDF is to proceed with  the  talks," Romero was quoted as saying.    Romero recalled that the same strategy was adopted by the  Aquino administration in 1986, but the NDF panel "correctly  rejected the proposition."    The NDF leadership, too, reminded Jalandoni that it should  insist having equal say in all aspects of talks, including the  choice of venue.</p>

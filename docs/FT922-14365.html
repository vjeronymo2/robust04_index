			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Curfew in Sarajevo as prime minister resigns THE prime minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Jure Pelivan, resigned yesterday amid continued ethnic battles in the republic. The state presidency issued a new appeal for a ceasefire and imposed a night curfew in the capital, Sarajevo. Mr Pelivan, a Croat who led a coalition with Moslems and Serbs, stepped down after the worst flare-up of violence in the republic since the Second World War. In one incident, snipers, said to be Serb militants, opened fire on peace protesters in Sarajevo, the capital, for the second day in a row. Five demonstrators were killed, according to one western newsagency report, although another could confirm only 15 wounded. Skirmishes were reported around Kupres, a town taken over by Croat forces. Unconfirmed radio reports say hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in Kupres in recent days. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, who is a Moslem, claimed the bloodshed was the result of Serb efforts to seize territory, destabilise the republic and thwart its recognition as an independent state. Serious ethnic clashes in Bosnia have increased since voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum on independence from the Yugoslav federation last month. Serbs boycotted the vote and oppose being cut off from Serbia by an international frontier. Their leaders have warned for more than a year that such a step would lead to civil war and now advocate breaking the republic into ethnic cantons. The Serbs, who account for 32 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m people, claim 60 per cent of the republic's territory. The republic's Moslems and many Croats support independence as they are reluctant to be linked with what is certain to be a Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav state. Exploding mortar shells fell yesterday on Sarajevo's historic, mainly Moslem-populated bazaar area and outlying areas east of the capital. People around the city of 700,000 braved sniper fire to watch artillery shells exploding in the mountains above. Several thousand demonstrators stormed the Holiday Inn hotel, breaking windows and searching for gunmen believed to have fired on peace protesters outside the parliament opposite. Hand grenades exploded inside the building, which Serb militiamen have been using as a base. Thousands of peace protesters including tin-helmeted miners occupied parliament and announced formation of a national salvation committee. They demanded a referendum, fresh elections and disarming of rival paramilitary groups. They appealed for help from the Yugoslav army and from United Nations peace-keepers who will soon start separating warring Serbs and Croats in neighbouring Croatia. The republic's interior minister, Mr Alija Delimustafic, yesterday repeatedly called on the Yugoslav army to intervene on the side of the 'citizenry' to stop the bloodshed. The army's loyalties remain unclear despite the fighting around the city. Yugoslav army infantry units backed by tanks yesterday guarded Sarajevo's airport. European Community military observers said masked men in camouflage uniforms who attacked the passenger terminal on Sunday night were driven out of the airport by Yugoslav army troops.</p>

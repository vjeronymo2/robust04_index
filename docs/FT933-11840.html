			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Israel steps up attacks on south Lebanon ISRAEL defied international criticism and stepped up its aerial and artillery bombardment of southern Lebanon yesterday, striking for the first time at villages suspected of supporting Arab guerrillas. The intensification of the Israeli blitz on the third consecutive day of relentless shelling and air attacks forced Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, to cut short his Asian visit and return to Washington for 'urgent consultations'. After a day in which Israel fired more than 5,000 shells into Lebanese villages, the EC called for an immediate stop to Israeli attacks 'directed against the sovereignty of Lebanon, its territorial integrity and its independence and which threaten the peace process'. President Bill Clinton praised the 'commendable restraint' shown by Syria in the wake of the Israeli offensive. The White House blamed Iran and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas for trying to torpedo the Middle East peace talks. Mr Christopher still plans to visit the Middle East early next week to try to persuade the negotiating teams to return to Washington in August. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, told a parliamentary committee the offensive, dubbed 'Operation Accountability', was designed to create a wave of refugees from southern Lebanon. fleeing towards Beirut. He said he expected the exodus would increase pressure on the Lebanese and Syrian governments to curb the activities of Hizbollah, which is responsible for recent rocket attacks on Israeli forces. He said he expected the raids to continue for days, not weeks. In south Lebanon, however, Hizbollah's secretary general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said the guerrillas would not back down. Tens of thousands of Lebanese villagers streamed north yesterday, clogging the roads to the capital. Thousands more vehicles headed south to rescue families. Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, travelled to Damascus for urgent consultations with Syrian leaders as the toll from the three-day operation rose to at least 55 people dead and 272 wounded, most of them Lebanese civilians. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he hoped a ground offensive would not be necessary. He claimed Israel had no alternative to continuing its offensive. Israeli aircraft also hit a United Nations position south of Tyre yesterday, wounding four Nepalese peace keepers and damaging 20 buildings. Israeli officers said they were increasing their target list to 72 villages. Hizbollah fighters launched seven to 15 122m Katyusha rockets into northern Israel and a dozen into the Israeli-controlled area of Lebanon. Mr Peres said he was very concerned about the impact Israel's action was having on the stability of the Lebanese government but stressed Israel was at war with the Hizbollah and not with the Beirut government.

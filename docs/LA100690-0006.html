			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HIT BACK WITH COMPLIMENTS  </P> <P> I just wanted to commend both Chris Dufresne and Chris Baker (not necessarily  in that order) and The Times sports department for the excellent and often  witty writing in covering the Raiders. No one expects you to blindly write  obligatory stories; fans just want to read a balanced truth. And I get that  from Chris . . . and Chris.  </P> <P> KEVIN CASH, El Segundo  </P></p>

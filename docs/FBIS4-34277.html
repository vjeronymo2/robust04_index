			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with National Registrar Luis Camilo </F> Osorio in Santa Fe de Bogota by station announcer Dario  Arizmendi and an unidentified reporter in Emisoras Caracol's  Santa Fe de Bogota studios -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] We have National Registrar Dr. Luis  Camilo Osorio with us this morning. There are 60 hours before  the runoff election. Good morning, Mr. Registrar.    [Osorio] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] What will happen with the voters who have been  affected by the earthquake and the mudslide in Cauca and Huila  Departments?    [Osorio] At this time, Dario, we are in the process of  collecting information on people who lost their personal  identity papers during the tragedy. The information I have is  not up-to-date. As of yesterday, however, we had received  approximately 400 identity card replacement requests in Huila  and Cauca. We plan to send registrars to places where people  have been relocated so these people can vote. Registrars will  use census forms. We will replace the relocated people's  identity cards and tell them where they can vote.    [Arizmendi] Approximately 18,000 people have been relocated,  many of whom have their identity cards. Can these people vote?    [Osorio] Yes, but the figures we have are much smaller. We  estimate that 2,000 voters have been relocated. We are providing  local registrars with additional census lists so the people can  vote where they are.    [Arizmendi] People have begun to wonder: The Registrar's  Office was so efficient during the first round that results were  released before 2300 local, at least in 90 percent of the voting  sites. What will happen next Sunday? Can we expect to have the  name of the president-elect by 2000?    [Osorio] Yes, we will do it again, with the possible  exception of two or three points. I have headed the Registrar's  Office on three previous occasions, in 1991, 1992, and the first  Congress elections in 1994.    [Arizmendi] So this election will set a record for the  Office.    [Osorio] We will duplicate what we did during the first  round  of elections.    [Arizmendi] Do you think we will know who is ahead in the  election by approximately 2100 local time?    [Osorio] It will depend on the relative position of the  candidates, Dario. As you know, there is a virtual tie between  the leading candidates, according to opinion polls.    [Arizmendi] At what time do you expect to release the first  bulletin?    [Osorio] Well, it is not the first one that counts but the  last one. Anyway, we think there must be a very significant  margin of difference between the two. We estimate we will be  able to release the first bulletin by the same time we released  the first one during the first round, 1640 local time.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, what can you tell us about the  people in the eastern flatlands, in southeastern Meta and  Guaviare Departments, who are isolated because of flooded rivers?    [Osorio] Well, Dario, so far it has been unnecessary to  relocate any voting sites. Some damaged installations will be  repaired, but we will have no relocations of people here as  happened in some Huila and Cauca municipalities.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Registrar, we continue to  receive  calls from many people who did not vote in the 1986 and 1990  elections but who would like to vote in this runoff election.  They ask us why they cannot vote, why their identity cards, if  they failed to be registered, are not in the lists of the  so-called line-up voting sites?    [Osorio] As we have explained before, the citizens who have  not voted on previous occasions can do so now provided they are  included on the list of persons who applied for their identity  cards as of March 1988 when, by legal provision -- this is not a  provision of the Registrar's Office or an administrative act  apart from the state's sovereign willingness expressed through  the Congress -- those persons were automatically included in the  electoral counts. In each municipality, voting sites are  prepared for these citizens to vote. Only these citizens can  vote at these sites. The rest of the citizens must have been  properly registered at the sites where they have chosen to vote.  Unfortunately, whoever has not been registered and has not  applied for his or her identity card after March 1988 is not  included in the census and consequently will not be permitted to  vote.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be more or less than  5.8 million votes, the number of people who voted in the first  round?    [Osorio] Dario, we hope there will be more than 6 million  votes.    [Arizmendi] [Words indistinct]    [Osorio] I beg your pardon? Oh yes, although there will be a  soccer championship, there will be several matches. If people  take advantage of the few working hours to find out where their  voting sites are located, they can do their duty as citizens by  casting their votes and still watch the soccer matches. For this  reason, I think there will be more than 6 million votes.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SALIDA;  </P> <P> SLAYINGS LINKED TO WHITE GROUP  </P> <P> Four suspects arrested in the murders of four people found in a dilapidated  duplex containing drug paraphernalia are members of a white supremacist group,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "The common thread we're finding is they all belonged to what appears to be a  self-proclaimed white supremacist-type group," Stanislaus County Sheriff's Lt.  Richard Breshears said. "There doesn't appear to be any racial overtones in  this (the four victims were white). The motive is really up in the air a  little." Some of the victims reportedly knew the suspects and apparently were  specific targets in the slayings, Breshears said. The others might have been  "at the wrong place at the wrong time," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WINFIELD GOOD JUDGE, JUDGE SAYS  </P> <P> Actor Paul Winfield did his homework for his role in "Presumed Innocent,"  according to the judge who was his role model.  </P> <P> "He picked up that feeling of the courtroom, with lawyers going back and forth,  trying to get in evidence they know they shouldn't get in, the exasperation you  feel," District Judge Willie G. Lipscomb said at a screening of the new film.  </P> <P> "Presumed Innocent," about a deputy prosecutor accused of murdering a  colleague, made its national debut Tuesday night at the Detroit Institute of  Arts. The movie, starring Harrison Ford, was filmed partially in Detroit,  although the book by Scott Turow was set in a mythical Illinois city.  </P> <P> Winfield observed Lipscomb's court before playing the judge in the film.  </P> <P> "Presumed Innocent," which opens nationwide Friday, also stars Raul Julia and  Greta Scacchi.  </P></p>

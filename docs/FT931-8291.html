			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alples (1): Resilient stronghold - Rhone-Alpes has the largest economy and population outside Ile de France. The region now runs its own local affairs - and looks likely to influence the shape of national government after the March elections IF FRANCE'S opposition right wing wins next month's parliamentary election, which is likely, Rhone-Alpes will be one of the main victors. The economically biggest and most populous French region outside Paris is a traditional conservative power base. So it will probably be the most important provincial influence on French national politics during the next government. Over the past few years it has provided firm ground on which half a dozen ambitious young opposition politicians have built political bases, some hotly tipped to take ministerial jobs in the new government. This can only increase Rhone-Alpes' already weighty influence in the Paris bureaucracy, a valuable asset in a country where much economic power remains concentrated in the capital, despite the decentralisation of the past decade. Local political heavyweights tipped for a national cabinet seat in the spring include Mr Charles Millon, chairman of the regional council and national parliamentary whip for the centre right UDF party; Mr Bernard Bosson, centrist CDS mayor of Annecy; Mr Michel Barnier, the RPR Gaullist president of the Savoie general council and organiser of last year's winter Olympics, and Mr Alain Carignon, the RPR mayor of Grenoble. Mr Bosson and Mr Carignon had ministerial jobs in the 1986-1988 conservative government. Rising above the fray is the distinguished head of Mr Raymond Barre, former prime minister of France and a centrist member of parliament for the Rhone, who is spoken of as a possible (though outside) runner for the Matignon again. The young reformers have become candidates for ministerial jobs because they have used decentralisation (which has mainly increased the power of town mayors by granting them authority to give or withhold planning permission) to shape the region and demonstrate their skills in the art of government. 'At national level, the political class is being devalued in public opinion. But good mayors are still respected, except those who have made mistakes,' explains Mr Jean Regis, one of Mr Bosson's colleagues on Annecy town council. Of course, local politics in Rhone-Alpes is not an automatic track to stardom. Take Mr Michel Noir, the dynamic mayor of Lyon, the regional capital which is the economic and political lynchpin of Rhone-Alpes. Only a few years ago he looked ready for great things - perhaps as a rival to Mr Jacques Chirac for leadership of the RPR. Mr Noir remains respected for the amount of investment he has marshalled to update Lyon's crowded roads and to beautify further this ancient city. Yet, his ambitions have taken a knock with his misjudged decision, in 1990, to give up his RPR parliamentary seat in disgust at internal bickering among the leadership, hoping to form a right wing union of young reformist-minded people like himself. In the event, only two other MPs followed his example and the idea has quietly sunk. Mr Noir's national image took another battering when his son-in-law and former election campaign manager, Mr Pierre Botton, was jailed last November for alleged misuse of public funds. The latest twist to Lyon's city politics came last month when the RPR placed Mr Alain Merieux, one of its rising stars in the region, as parliamentary candidate in the same constituency as Mr Noir - re-elected since as an independent. The RPR's choice of Mr Merieux was significant. He is a vice president of the regional council, an important businessman (he is head of the Institut Merieux pharmaceuticals group) and a member of the old bourgeoisie which runs Lyon behind the scenes. 'The Parisians have decided against the will of the Lyonnais to organise the division of the national opposition,' complained an angry Mr Noir. Rhone-Alpes' political importance is also a reflection of the size and vitality of its economy - dimmed by the economic downturn. 'For a while we were sheltered from economic difficulties because of the strength of our economy. But when the crisis did finally hit, it hit us harder than other regions,' says Mr Yves Minssieux, regional director of Lyonnaise de Banque. Of course, damage from the recession has been as unevenly spread as might be expected from a region as big as Rhone-Alpes. Its 5.3m inhabitants represent just under a tenth of the French population; it covers 8 per cent of the nation's land mass and produces a tenth of France's gross domestic product. It is geographically diverse, from the high snowfields of the French Alps to the fertile wine-producing hills around the Rhone and the arid scrub of the Drome. Economically Rhone-Alpes presents no less striking contrasts: traditional chemicals, engineering and automotive industries around Lyon, which have been hardest hit in the slowdown; light industries around the old coal steel and textile town of St Etienne, which appear more confident than businesses around the regional capital; and a thriving community of high technology companies around the town of Grenoble. Some economic commentators liken Rhone-Alpes to a small country such as Switzerland or Belgium. A more exact comparison could be made with other important European regions such as Piedmont in northern Italy, Hesse in Germany or Catalonia in northern Spain. Rhone-Alpes has intimate political and business links with all three - and this highlights another of its important qualities: the pro-European Community consensus among the regional leadership. It is no accident that, when the rest of France hesitated over the prospect of European political and monetary union, Rhone-Alpes produced nearly 55 per cent in yes-votes in last September's referendum. The region is a pro-European island on the map of French referendum results, surrounded by no-votes from Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur in the south, Auvergne to the west and Burgundy to the north. To complete the picture, Switzerland is on its north-eastern frontier. Some local planners expect last year's Swiss vote against closer European integration to trigger a migration of Swiss-based companies into the Haute Savoie. Lyon has played on its European credentials, as well as on its high quality of life, to support its campaign (led by the tireless and persuasive Mr Barre) to become the headquarters of the European central bank. The uncertainties facing European monetary union have not diminished the city's determination. 'If we didn't believe in the Euro-bank, we would not make the effort.' That resilience translates into an ability to continue attracting prestige foreign investments to the region at a time when the international recession has caused overall foreign investment in France to decline. Last year Rhone-Alpes overtook Ile de France for the first time in terms of the number of jobs created by foreign investors - although it still lagged behind heavily subsidised Lorraine, in north-eastern France. It has a slightly higher economic growth than the French average and, according to a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, it will grow 20 per cent faster than France as a whole over the five years to 1995. Rhone-Alpes' high profile newcomers include Rank Xerox's new European research laboratory in Grenoble, and Euronews, the new satellite news channel. A satisfied Mr Maury claims: 'If they come here, it's not because of aid, because we don't offer very much. It's because we are attractive.'</p>

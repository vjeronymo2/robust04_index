			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: A monster tamed by Europe's red tape - Simon Tait explains how the arts alone could have lost millions if an MEP's proposal had been accepted NOTORIOUS Eurocratic red tape may have worked for the good of arts' sponsorship by placing a noose around a monster which could have been hugely destructive. A frisson of panic went through the corps of sponsorship brokers with the draft report of a French Green Party MEP, Yves Fremion, which suggested sponsorship was just an inexpensive publicity outlet for rapacious big business. He cited Voltaire's remark that anybody who gives does so out of bad conscience, and suggested that those getting sponsorship money were corrupted by it. 'The all-invasive presence of the brand name does not shock sportsmen much, but it does shock artists, even those who are resigned to it . . . Choices of sportsmen and artists are increasingly subject to the will of the sponsor,' the report said. Fremion suggested to the European parliament that sponsorship should be banned unless sponsors agreed not to have their names associated with it. The damage which would have been done if this report had been accepted at next month's European parliament plenary session - binding members to it - is immeasurable, but millions could have been lost to the arts alone. Guinness, an Irish company with huge interests in Europe (biggest brewer in Spain, owner of the biggest distillery in Germany) which sponsored the Royal Ballet's Paris season this summer, would have cancelled all its sponsorship, worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. And few companies could have persuaded shareholders that there was any advantage to sticking with sponsorship under Fremion's conditions. As it was, British MEP Patricia Rawlings led an assault on the report in committee and 125 amendments have been demanded before it is considered again next month. Rawlings describes Fremion as a 'a nice man but quite wrong and terribly ill-informed on this.' Yet, he has his sympathisers. There is concern that sponsorship can be used to spear products into sections of the community insidiously through arts' sponsorship where advertising cannot - alcohol towards youth, for instance, through support for avant-garde music, theatre and dance. Whatever its future, though, the report - by getting the subject discussed - could well have given impetus to a bandwagon that is rolling in Europe already. Earlier this year Cerec, the three-year-old European version of Britain's Association of Business Sponsorship for the Arts, commissioned a report into pan-European arts' sponsorship. This report, funded by financial consultant Arthur Andersen, canvassed 200 companies in 10 European countries and revealed that while arts' sponsorship has been growing at 5 per cent a year for the past three, over the next three it is expected to grow at 12 per cent annually. European sponsors also spend more than national ones, averaging Pounds 500,000 in 1992 compared with Pounds 340,000. British companies use the arts to get them into European markets, and Rank Xerox's Pounds 200,000 sponsorship of the National Theatre's coming tour of Sweeney Todd in Hungary will give it valuable political as well as business contacts. Perhaps more altruistic, though, is The Economist magazine's decision to celebrate its 150th birthday by funding a Pounds 240,000 English language exhibition to travel in eastern and central Europe. Anne Vanhaeverbeke, Cerec's director, says: 'Arts' sponsorship clearly is a developing culture in Europe. It is encouraging that the French electricity industry, which is to be privatised, is looking at sponsorship to raise its community profile, and this comes at a time when the French government is not generating anything like the subsidy it did.' She added that the French also were looking at adapting the British business sponsorship incentive scheme - the government's programme of encouraging business support for the arts by matching first-time sponsorships (which is itself being spread overseas with Pounds 250,000 having been allocated to the British Council this year). The French also are believed to be looking closely at the Spanish scheme where certain banks must turn over a proportion of their profits to arts foundations. North American companies are using sponsorships to get into Europe and Northern Telecom, AT&amp;T and American Express have been to the fore. In 1994, tobacco giant Philip Morris is sponsoring a competition European design and art students. The British Council, the UK's official cultural gunboat, has set about sponsorship with spectacular success. It began in 1988 by raising Pounds 670,000 but the target last year was Pounds 5.8m for all sponsorship; in the event, Pounds 7.23m was realised, Pounds 5.29m for the arts. Europe took about Pounds 2m of that but the council is concerned to attract sponsorship money beyond Europe and into the third world. Brazil and the Pacific rim have been the most successful. Almost no impact has been made in Africa so far, but India is coming up fast. In one notable example, the Standard Chartered bank, which has been in India since 1858, is to spend Pounds 150,000 - the most it has ever committed in the sponsorship field - to funding Northern Broadside's production of The Merry Wives of Windsor in seven Indian cities. John Pank, the bank's communications chief, says: 'It's a calculated sponsorship - Shakespeare is hugely popular in India, and this production is bound to be a success. We have done local sponsorship on an ad hoc basis in the past, but we will be doing more, and we'll be more driven in the things that we do. It's a matter of image.'</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> CROWD'S FIRED UP BUT PLANT'S LUKEWARM  </P> <P> Robert Plant's show practically burned down the house Friday night at Irvine  Meadows Amphitheatre, but it also stunk up the joint.  </P> <P> Actually, it was Plant's fans who did the burning and stinking. Taking a  familiar arena-rock act of homage to extremes, thousands of them set beer and  soda cups aflame and held them aloft. Forget flick-your-Bic. This was  light-your-torch.  </P> <P> In the 22 years since his start with Led Zeppelin, Plant presumably has seen  just about everything that a rock audience's huddled masses can come up with.  But this left him agape.  </P> <P> "Wow, look at that," the 41-year-old Englishman said, pausing after "Ship of  Fools," the ballad that touched off the pyromania. Later, stopping again to  scan the impressive field of burning cups, he pronounced the sight "beautiful."  </P> <P> The melting material from the cups smelled like incinerator spew, no doubt  highly carcinogenic. For a while, mass asphyxiation seemed a possibility.  Luckily, the ammo was spent by the start of Plant's second encore. Fun's fun,  folks, but let's not make this a habit, OK?  </P> <P> Plant's show was full of other memorably strange and wacky occurrences that  made the evening more than your usual hard rocker's night out. (At one point,  somebody presented Plant with a lemon, an unsuccessful effort to get him to  sing a Led Zep oldie, "The Lemon Song," giving the singer occasion to display  some likable wit.)  </P> <P> Musically, the nearly two-hour show ranged from dull and diffuse during the  first half to appealingly folkish during a mid-set acoustic segment, to flaming  -- figuratively speaking -- during a splendid show-closing pair of  rockabilly-tinged rockers: Zep's "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)" and  Plant's solo hit "Tall Cool One."  </P> <P> For one of rock's supposed titans, Plant's presence as a performer was  surprisingly unremarkable. He was energetic enough, with his characteristic  spins, struts, cross-legged steps and dramatic, hands-aloft pose-striking  framed by all manner of stage fog and backlighting.  </P> <P> But visuals alone don't make a singer commanding. The performers who fix our  attention are the ones with something truly vivid to say. Plant has devoted his  career to heroic gestures and inflated myth-weaving, but his songs during and  after Led Zeppelin have seldom packed involving meanings.  </P> <P> Early in his show, Plant's myths and mysteries became shrouded in a musical fog  of gauzelike keyboard textures and elongated, meandering arrangements. Plant  found a focus by simplifying things. "Liar's Dance" featured nothing but his  dramatic vocal and Doug Boyle's spare, tense acoustic guitar. He followed it  with "Going to California," keeping the accompaniment acoustic while  introducing a wistful, dreamy tone.  </P> <P> The show gathered force from there, although it was only during the  hard-charging encores that Plant and his band of capable, versatile, though not  really distinctive players achieved what the title of his most recent album  promises: manic nirvana.  </P> <P> Opening singer Alannah Myles displayed a mighty blues-soaked vocal style and a  frolicsome stage manner brimming with sly, mischievous sexuality. Myles did a  fine job occupying the middle ground between Bonnie Raitt's rootsy authenticity  and Pat Benatar's mainstream arena-rock style.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGER LINGERS ON BEIJING CAMPUSES; INTELLECTUALS' ROLE NOW IN QUESTION  </P> <P> The song is just a simple television advertising jingle about insect spray,  probably inspired by American commercials: "We're bugs, we're bugs. Aaagghh!  Enemy killers are coming. Run quick!"  </P> <P> But when students at Beijing University banged pots and pans late one night a  few weeks ago and sang the bug-spray jingle, "The Internationale" and China's  national anthem, no one could mistake the message.  </P> <P> "The Internationale" and the national anthem, which both call for uprising  against oppression, had been adopted as theme songs of this spring's  student-led pro-democracy protests. And for students to sing the bug song draws  a not-subtle comparison to the night of June 3-4, when the Chinese army put an  end to the demonstrations by shooting its way into Beijing, killing hundreds,  perhaps thousands, of people who sought to block its path.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anger Continues to Smolder  </P> <P> As the fall semester gets under way, anger continues to smolder on Beijing's  campuses. In central government offices, the youngest members of China's future  elite live in fear of being sent away from the capital. A new wave of  anti-intellectualism threatens to undermine the nation's attempt at rapid  economic modernization.  </P> <P> "The damage already exists," commented a European diplomat. "The atmosphere is  that people just don't want to work any more: 'Have you finished that report?'  'Oh, I'm not feeling well -- the weather is so hot.' The role of intellectuals  in society has been set back 10 years. Alienation has set in again."  </P> <P> On the surface, there is mostly silence.  </P> <P> The late July outburst of pan-banging and singing at Beijing University, which  involved a few hundred students, is the only campus protest to have broken out  since June's martial-law crackdown. The alleged ringleader, a graduating senior  who had not yet left campus, was quickly denied his diploma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indoctrination Classes  </P> <P> The most important student leaders of the spring demonstrations are under  arrest, in hiding or in exile. Returning students must attend political  indoctrination classes focusing on the thoughts of paramount leader Deng  Xiaoping.  </P> <P> With the apparent exception of older students who have had work experience  before entering college, the entire freshman class of Beijing University, the  most prestigious school in the nation, is scheduled to spend a year at a  military camp before doing any course work.  </P> <P> Authorities also have announced that this spring's graduates, especially those  in the social sciences, in most cases will not be allowed to pursue advanced  degrees without first getting at least a year of work experience. For many,  this could mean a move to a provincial town, with no guarantee of being able to  return to Beijing or another big city.  </P> <P> "The students are all really angry, but they don't dare speak about it,"  declared one undergraduate.  </P> <P> "I'm not afraid of the new government policies," said another student. "I just  hate the government. My friends at Beijing University and Qinghua University  feel the same way.  </P> <P> "That's why they were out there beating on plates and bowls and singing 'The  Internationale' and the national anthem. They want to sing other songs,  anti-government songs, but they know they will be kicked out or put in jail if  they do. So they just go to their political study classes and pretend to agree  with Deng's speeches. Then they leave with the same feelings of hatred and  ridicule."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cut Off From World  </P> <P> An attempt is also being made to cut students off from a watching world. At  some schools, students have been warned that they will be punished if they  speak with foreign diplomats or reporters.  </P> <P> The loss to China seems even more stark when a comparison is made with what  might have been. When this spring's student-led wave of street protests first  erupted, a key demand was for improved living and working conditions for  China's educated elite, who generally draw salaries no higher than factory  workers' wages.  </P> <P> Even before the demonstrations, the government was drawing up plans for  educational reforms aimed at raising the status of schoolteachers, especially  those in the countryside, at increasing the independence of universities and at  switching to a system by which college graduates find their own jobs rather  than receiving assignments from the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Part of Working Class  </P> <P> Now, in the wake of the June crackdown that ended the demonstrations, Communist  Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin is telling intellectuals -- meaning people  with more than a high school education -- that they are part of the working  class and that policy toward them will not change.  </P> <P> The irony is that in today's political environment, Jiang's comments are meant  to be reassuring. What he means is there must be no return to the virulent  anti-intellectualism of Mao Tse-tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when  educated people were condemned as the "stinking ninth category." This was a new  classification of evildoers added to eight previously labeled categories that  included criminals and so-called counterrevolutionaries.  </P> <P> Jiang's reassurances are needed because echoes of Cultural Revolution policies,  which called for intellectuals to go to the countryside to be "re-educated" by  the peasants, are reverberating through Beijing once again.  </P> <P> The dreams of the Beijing Spring, including hopes that college graduates would  routinely earn more than high school dropouts, that China would direct far more  funding to education, that freewheeling discussion of how to solve China's  immense problems would be allowed on campuses and in the press -- these dreams  have been shattered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Chilling Order  </P> <P> But beyond that, a chilling order has been transmitted through the central  bureaucracy, demanding that all people working in government or Communist Party  jobs at the national level who graduated from college in or after 1985 are to  be transferred to low-level provincial jobs for at least one to two years.  </P> <P> The full implications of this order are not yet clear, and it may never be  rigorously carried out. In China, rules are bent by those who enforce them. The  theoretical purpose of the order is to raise awareness of China's economic and  social realities among the future elite. But there is widespread suspicion that  the rule is meant to be selectively enforced, primarily against those who  participated in the pro-democracy protests.  </P> <P> "Theoretically, it applies to everyone in the central government and central  party organizations (who graduated in or after 1985)," commented a Western  diplomat. "(But) it would be inconceivable to think this thing would be  enforced universally and fairly."  </P> <P> Another diplomat first predicted flatly that the order would prove to be  meaningless.  </P> <P> "They need these people," he said. "They have nobody to replace them. They are  not going to waste them."  </P> <P> But after a moment's thought, he added: "That could change. It's a very  contradictory picture."  </P> <P> If the order were to be carried out, he said, "It would be devastating -- and  Deng Xiaoping knows it would be devastating."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retaining 'Chinese Way'  </P> <P> As long ago as the late 19th Century, and again during the past decade, some  Chinese leaders have hoped to modernize the nation by bringing in Western  science and technology but retaining a vaguely defined "Chinese way" of doing  things -- basically meaning the essence of the system in place at the time.  </P> <P> In the political spectrum of today's China, Premier Li Peng is often placed in  this category, as someone who favors technical and scientific training but  opposes the liberalizing influences of Western society.  </P> <P> Others, including some of the key advisers who until recently were gathered  around former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a reformist, have  advocated far more fundamental changes in the structure of society and greater  individual freedom as prerequisites for sustained economic growth.  </P> <P> "You can't just import technology and expect it to do wonderful things for  you," commented one of the diplomats. "You have to adopt a way of thinking that  uses that technology efficiently. For example, if you don't have a free flow of  information linking scientists to each other, that slows down the bouncing of  ideas off other people and it slows down results."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Severity Unknown  </P> <P> It is still too early to know how harsh the treatment of educated young people  and of intellectuals in general may be in the months and years ahead.  </P> <P> China's top political leadership remains delicately balanced between those who  wish to slow the pace of reform and those who wish to accelerate it. Deng, at  85, is unlikely to last for very many more years as China's paramount leader,  and the succession struggle is already unfolding.  </P> <P> "The best of China's elite is now alienated," said the European diplomat.  "These people were not anti-Communist. They had a chance to be part of the  game, and now they are excluded from the game. But they can be put back in  again if things change quickly."  </P> <P> Nick Driver, research assistant in The Times' Beijing bureau, contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IDEQ initially held a public hearing on the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 air quality improvement plan on October 11, 1990, and received no public comments regarding the plan. However, following one 24-hour PM&hyph;10 exceedance on January 7, 1991 and two near exceedances on January 4 and 6, 1991, EPA requested on March 22, 1991 that IDEQ modify the PM&hyph;10 plan to better ensure healthful air in the future. IDEQ revised the PM&hyph;10 plan and the State of Idaho subsequently held a public hearing on the modified Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 plan on November 4, 1991. Again, IDEQ received no public comments. The modified PM&hyph;10 plan was then adopted by the State of Idaho on November 14, 1991, and the plan was submitted to EPA on November 15, 1991 as a proposed revision to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. A letter dated April 27, 1992 was forwarded to the Administrator of the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Accurate Emissions Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area (see e.g. section 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act). Because the submission of such inventories is necessary to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The base year emission inventory (1987) developed for Ada County/Boise identified the major sources of PM&hyph;10 concentrations during 24-hour worst case winter periods as residential wood combustion (71%), fugitive road dust (15%), industrial (7%) and other sources, including but not limited to, transportation, construction and open burning (7%). Annual emissions for 1987 were fugitive road dust (51%), residential wood combustion (23%), building construction (12%), transportation (6%), industrial (6%) and other sources (2%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Full approval of this element is appropriate because it is separable and independent of the deficiency which prevents full approval of the SIP, namely, the adoption and submission of all control measures on which the State relies in the SIP. The emissions inventory is a separable component of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because it represents an assessment of PM&hyph;10 emissions in the area prior to the adoption of control measures and will not change as the result of any additional control measures adopted. For further details, see the Technical Support Document (TSD) corresponding with this action, which is available at the EPA address indicated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the amended Act (see section 193 of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Control Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition, RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

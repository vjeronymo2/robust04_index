			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva today visited the  National Defense Institute and delivered an interesting lecture  to the graduates on the state of the economy, the European  Union, and foreign policy. More details from Paulo Barbosa:    [Barbosa] [passage omitted] The prime minister spoke about  foreign policy and Angola:    [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We continue to follow closely  the Lusaka peace talks and to support the UN envoy's efforts.  These efforts are aimed at reaching an agreement that may allow  the existence of a fair and long-lasting peace process in that  tormented country.    The situation in Angola is truly tragic: A lot more people  are dying in Angola than in the Bosnian conflict. Therefore, it  is imperative that the international community does not abandon  Angola, that it keeps showing an interest in the ongoing  negotiations, and that it shows its readiness -- in case an  agreement is reached -- to give the necessary assurances for its  compliance, namely the availabilty on the ground of a UN peace  force.    We have not yet signed a military cooperation agreement with  Angola because of the situation of armed conflict that still  coexists with the endless Lusaka peace negotiations.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an arrival statement at Larnaca Airport this  afternoon, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said Cyprus has  achieved very advanced positions at the European Union  [EU]-Cyprus Association Council, which conferred in Luxembourg  last night. Mikhailidhis described the Council's meeting as a  great political achievement for Cyprus, because one of the two  goals--to include Cyprus in the countries that will participate  in the EU expansion--was achieved. The second goal, he said,  was establishing a date to begin accession negotiations.    Referring to the joint statement of the Twelve, Mikhailidhis  said the positions adopted are much more advanced than the ones  we have had so far. He added that there is clear reference that  human rights for all citizens must be safeguarded without any  limitations or distinctions, and that any settlement or solution  must be in line with the EU foundation principles. Mikhailidhis  said: This means that the Cypriot Government's initial  position--that a Cyprus solution must conform to EU principles  and will allow us to enter and operate within the  community--today has become an EU decision.    Discussing the confidence-building measures, the foreign  minister said the joint statement clearly holds the Turkish side  exclusively responsible and hails the Cypriot Government's  constructive stance.    On the prospects of the EU accession of Cyprus, Mikhailidhis  said January 1995 has already been set as the date to reevaluate  Cyprus' application and the entire course for accession.</p>

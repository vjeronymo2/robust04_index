			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> ECONOMIC DATA CALMS TRADERS; DOW ADDS 8.34  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks advanced for the fourth straight session Thursday as traders  gained confidence that the U.S. economy might do better than expected this  year.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.34 to close at 2,635.59.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was a moderate 157.9 million shares on the New York Stock  Exchange, compared to 184.4 million Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered  decliners in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 843 up, 633 down and  493 unchanged.  </P> <P> Traders said buying in cyclical sectors such as machinery and automobiles was  propelled by increasing faith in the economy.  </P> <P> "There is a growing belief that the economy is not in as bad shape as was  thought a couple of months ago," said Dennis Jarrett, analyst at Kidder,  Peabody &amp; Co. If interest rates begin to fall, he said, "we could have a  dynamite market."  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said the industrial economy  continued to contract in February but at a slower rate than in previous months.  But the slight improvement in the manufacturing sector was mainly because of  one-time factors linked to unusually cold December weather, the private group  said.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 0.9% annual  rate in the fourth quarter, an upward revision from the initial estimate of  0.5%. Although growth was still weak, it was stronger than had been expected.  </P> <P> The government said construction spending rose 1.8% in January, the biggest  increase in more than a year. Some major chain stores reported good February  sales growth.  </P> <P> Interest rates rose Thursday, driving Treasury bond prices down, as traders  interpreted the reports as fresh signs that the Federal Reserve will not ease  credit soon.  </P> <P> The market appeared to be little affected by another sharp drop in the volatile  Japanese stock market. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei index fell  762.41, or 2.2%, to 33,829.58, reversing a 694-point gain Wednesday.  </P> <P> Analysts were uncertain as to how long any rally might last. Kidder Peabody's  Jarrett predicted that the upward trend could last a month or two.  </P> <P> "That doesn't mean it goes straight up, but it's been a good week so far," he  said. The Dow index has advanced more than 70 points so far this week,  recovering last week's 71-point loss.  </P> <P> Harry Laubscher, technical analyst at Tucker Anthony, R. L. Day, said the  market has given a short-term buy signal, but he expects a selloff soon that  could continue through most of April. But "in May we expect a very good trading  rally," he said.  </P> <P> Charles Jensen of MKI Securities noted that seasonal factors have buoyed  stocks. He said pension funds generally pour new money into stocks on the last  day of a month and in the first four days of the new month. He saw some  rotation in the market as stocks that have been lagging the averages started to  catch up.  </P> <P> Union Carbide was the most actively traded issue on the Big Board, falling 2 to  22 1/4 after the company said it was not seeking to sell any of its core  businesses, as had been rumored.  </P> <P> Digital Equipment fell 3 1/2 to 74 1/2 as rumors about a takeover bid by a  Japanese company were dispelled.  </P> <P> Philadelphia Electric eased 2 1/8 to 18 after two Pennsylvania administrative  law judges recommended a rate hike that was below expectations.  </P> <P> Paramount Communications rose 2 1/4 to 45. A Smith Barney analyst reiterated a  buy rating on the stock, based partly on expectations that the company's summer  movies will be well received.  </P> <P> Shares of some retailers responded to strong February results. Wal-Mart rose  5/8 to 44 5/8, J. C. Penney rose 3/8 to 66 1/4 and Woolworth climbed 1/2 to 60  1/8.  </P> <P> In London, share prices finished lower after a dreary session on London's Stock  Exchange, pushed down by a poor performance earlier in Tokyo and an uninspiring  start on Wall Street. At the London close, the Financial Times 100-share index  was down 17 at 2,238.4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Decline for Second Session  </P> <P> Bond prices retreated broadly for the second consecutive session on signs of  strength in the economy.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which fell 7/8 point on Wednesday,  dropped 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 face amount.  </P> <P> Its yield climbed to 8.60% from 8.53% late Wednesday. The bond yielded 8.44%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said the decline reflected a reaction to strong economic reports. A  pickup in the economy could lead to stronger demand for credit, which would  push interest rates higher and bond prices lower.  </P> <P> "All of the economic numbers were relatively strong," said Robert Brusca, chief  economist for Nikko Securities International in New York.  </P> <P> He said the figures indicated that "there will be no easing soon, and the  market is trying to come to grips with all of this."  </P> <P> "The (purchasing managers) report raised expectations of a pickup in the  economy," said Elliott Platt, who follows the bond markets for Donaldson Lufkin  &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.  </P> <P> He said many analysts had expected little change in the index.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.313%, unchanged from late Wednesday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> News on Economy Helps Boost Dollar  </P> <P> The dollar continued its climb against most major foreign currencies, boosted  by the reports showing strength in the U.S. economy and by economic uncertainty  in Japan.  </P> <P> Craig Sloane, a currency futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;  Co., said the reports "seemed to paint the picture that the economy is doing  all right."  </P> <P> Traders said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in an attempt to halt the  currency's rise against the yen, but the intervention appeared to have limited  impact.  </P> <P> The West German mark continued to be hurt by concern that a plan for exchanging  East German marks for their West German counterpart would cause inflation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Gasoline Glut Spurs Sales in Petroleum  </P> <P> A virtual glut of gasoline prompted heavy selling of petroleum futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, coffee futures surged to new 7 1/2-month highs,  precious metals advanced, grain and soybean futures were mixed and livestock  and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> On the New York Merc, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 28 to  37 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in April at $21.17 a barrel;  wholesale home heating oil was 1.13 to 1.93 cents lower, with April at 54.63  cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 2.43 cents lower, with April  at 55.81 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> The April gasoline contract led the way down, trading as low as 54.70 cents a  gallon amid reports of burdensome gasoline supplies.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D8.  </P></p>

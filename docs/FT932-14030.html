			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Homes policy seen to create high-crime estates GOVERNMENT rules on financing affordable homes for rent may turn housing association estates into neighbourhoods with a high crime rate, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says. In a report published today, the social research organisation warns that government policies are forcing housing associations to create a new generation of large estates with heavy concentrations of formerly homeless people and disadvantaged families. The report says cuts in government grant mean that housing associations are increasingly building large new estates to maximise value for money. Social problems are concentrated on these estates by government regulations which require associations to allocate 70 per cent of new homes to homeless families. Associations sometimes give 100 per cent of allocations on new estates to local authorities in return for cheap land. Larger estates therefore end up with a high proportion of unemployed and single-parent families. The Rowntree report says three out of four new tenants on recently-built estates are unemployed, and half depend on social security. The average income of tenants has declined from 73 per cent of the national average in 1981 to 33 per cent on large new housing association estates. Half the families on such estates are headed by a lone parent, and the number of children per adult is up to three times higher than the national average. That makes adequate supervision and control by parents harder, and increases vandalism, litter, graffiti and more serious crime, the report says. 'The combination of unfavourable dwelling mix and very disadvantaged new tenants has produced a seriously unbalanced population mix on new estates,' it says. Most housing associations have little experience in managing such large estates, according to the report. Families with serious social problems on such estates need additional resources such as estate offices and community facilities. The report concludes that smaller schemes, traditionally used by associations to house disadvantaged and vulnerable families, would integrate better with existing communities.

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINA RUSHES TO VICTORY IN BATTLE OF GROUND GAMES  </P> <P> Marina and Foothill high schools decided to shun the forward pass Friday night,  choosing to battle it out on the ground at Northrup Stadium.  </P> <P> Both teams combined to throw just 18 passes, while rushing the ball 74 times.  </P> <P> When the dust cleared, Marina had a 7-3 victory.  </P> <P> "We're very lucky to win tonight," Marina Coach John Seeley said. "They shut us  down completely on offense."  </P> <P> Foothill held Marina to just 98 yards on 37 running plays, stifling the  Vikings' previously productive ground game.  </P> <P> Foothill's defense set up the Knights' only score, forcing fullback Shawn  Fullford (18 carries, 85 yards) to fumble at the Marina 24 midway through the  second quarter.  </P> <P> The Knights settled for a 39-yard Keo Powell field goal and a 3-0 lead, but  then Marina's offense responded with it's only drive of the night.  </P> <P> With 4:18 remaining in the half, Viking quarterback Christin McLemore took  Marina 77 yards in 12 plays for the only touchdown of the game.  </P> <P> Facing a second and 20 with 55 seconds remaining in the half, Marina  jump-started its passing game when McLemore hit split end David Anderson for  three consecutive completions, the third time finding him in in the right  corner of the end zone with 26 seconds remaining in the half.

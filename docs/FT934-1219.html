			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Antall successor brings firm hand to Hungary Mr Peter Boross, Hungary's acting premier since the illness and death of Mr Jozsef Antall, goes before parliament in Budapest today to be confirmed as the country's new prime minister. The smoothness of the succession has defied the doom-mongering speculation typical of Hungary. Commentators pondered every potential catastrophe from wrenching leadership struggle to constitutional crisis, from swing to the right to state of emergency, early elections to delayed elections. Instead, the governing conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum took just a day after Mr Antall's death to designate Mr Boross, the interior minister, as successor. Although the conservative coalition's majority is formally just in single figures, parliamentary approval for Mr Boross today appears assured. Eastern Europe's longest-serving government is still well placed to complete a full term in office. Hungary has passed the initial test. But Mr Antall personified Hungary's political stability and so the question arises of how much will survive him. Mr Boross, aged 65 and a former catering company executive, has never been elected and only joined the Forum in 1991. He may therefore feel the need to secure his political base by appealing to the Forum's right-wing activists. He is an altogether rawer politician than his predecessor and his confrontational rhetoric has made him a bogeyman for opposition liberals and socialists. Even one of his former colleagues admits: 'Boross scares people.' Critics point to Mr Boross's call for a strong centralised state to ensure governability and strong armed forces to maintain the security of Hungary and the 3.5m ethnic Hungarians across the borders. The conservatism of Mr Boross is of the uncompromising variety. When Amnesty International issued a critical report on human rights in Hungary, the then interior minister labelled the authors 'over-sensitive liberal philanthropists that you find in every country'. So much for words. As for actions, opposition politicians note a coincidence, although they cannot prove it was any more than that. While Mr Boross was acting prime minister when Mr Antall was in Germany receiving treatment in October and November, the Evening Balance TV news, a sharp cabaret radio show and other allegedly 'disloyal' programmes were suspended. Mr Boross is no extremist, however. He rose in politics through Mr Antall's sponsorship and so is unlikely to diverge too far from his predecessor's path. The Forum chose him precisely because he offered competent leadership and continuity. The bigger question is whether Mr Boross will be able to revive the Forum's electoral chances in the run-up to elections expected next May. The party is running fourth in the opinion polls with around 10 per cent support while the Smallholders party, a key partner in the conservative coalition, has self-destructed. Mr Boross's owlish face brings little to the Forum's televisual, and electoral, appeal. But he, unlike his predecessor, has at least the physical robustness to conduct a campaign, and his forceful and plain speaking could prove an asset. Personality, however, will prove less decisive than the economy, which has contracted by 20 per cent since 1990 and brought approval for the government down with it. The problem is that Mr Boross has little room to stimulate the economy and so raise voters' sense of well-being. At the central bank council meeting last week the National Bank of Hungary, the newly independent central bank, held to the monetary tightening which has seen money-market interest rates rise 5 per cent since July, compounding government fears that tight monetary policy will snuff out economic recovery next year. Politically, prolonged economic stagnation plays into the hands of the Hungarian Socialist party, the former communists. After the recent shock over the Russian election results the Forum may be able to win back moderate voters with a red scare and the party's record of steady government. But even if the conservatives and the Forum fail, Mr Antall will at least have the posthumous honour of being not only post-communist Europe's longest serving head of government, but also one of the few to have departed undefeated.</p>

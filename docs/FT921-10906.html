			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: US futures exchanges to fight transaction tax plan THE three largest US futures exchanges are firmly opposed to a proposal in President George Bush's 1993 budget for a 15-cent transaction tax to be introduced on trading at US commodity and options exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange denounced Mr Bush's proposal as an ill-advised, anti-competitive step that would discourage liquidity in US markets and drive business overseas. Other countries have moved to eliminate or reduce such taxes. Mr William O'Conner, chairman of the CBOT, the world's largest futures exchange, said his market's share of global futures trading had diminished to 24.5 per cent in 1991 from 38.7 per cent in 1985 and he warned that the tax would 'be the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of our competitive position against foreign futures exchanges.' The CBOT calculated that if the tax would reduce liquidity in the Treasury bond futures market by as little as  1/32 of one per cent - the size of one 'tick', the minimum price movement of the contract - 'it would increase the US taxpayers' burden of financing the US government debt by Dollars 1bn'.</p>

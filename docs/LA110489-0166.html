			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMOTIONALLY CHARGED EVENTS FIRE 'FLASHBULB MEMORIES,' STUDIES FIND  </P> <P> Soon after the tremors settled down, survivors of the Oct. 17 San Francisco  earthquake began filling the ears of friends, neighbors and reporters with  vivid accounts of where they were, what they were doing and how they reacted  when the quake struck.  </P> <P> One 73-year-old survivor recalled, "I was just sitting in my dinette, having a  glass of wine and reading Good Housekeeping, getting really relaxed, when  everything started coming down off the walls."  </P> <P> They were the same kinds of stories that Americans old enough to remember still  tell of where they were and what they were doing when they first learned of the  attack on Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy's assassination or the explosion of  the space shuttle Challenger.  </P> <P> Such unexpected, emotionally charged events can trigger what some psychologists  call "flashbulb memories" in the people who experience them.  </P> <P> The phenomenon was first described more than a decade ago by Harvard  researchers Roger Brown and James Culik, based on studies of people's memories  of the Kennedy assassination a dozen years after the event. Their study  suggested that events with powerful emotional content triggered a special kind  of photographic memory process.  </P> <P> But more recently, researchers like Michael McCloskey, professor of cognitive  science at Johns Hopkins University, have argued that so-called flashbulb  memories are no different from ordinary memory, only stronger, as might be  expected for a major event.  </P> <P> Fergus I.M. Craik, a memory researcher from the University of Toronto, said at  the annual conference of the Association of Science-Technology Centers in  Baltimore last week that some research has suggested that flashbulb memories  tend to be most vivid in their context -- in the detail of the time and place  of the individual's immediate surroundings and his emotions -- rather than in  the details of the event itself.  </P> <P> And that, he said, may suggest the phenomenon's evolutionary purpose -- its  payoff in terms of human survival that has allowed it to become a part of our  psyche.  </P> <P> The animal equivalent of flashbulb memories may mean the difference between  life and death.  </P> <P> An animal in the wild is more likely to survive, Craik said, if it is able to  recognize the smell of the forest where an earlier attack by a predator took  place, the ominous silence, the time of day, the season, the weather -- any  details that might warn of danger if they are ever encountered again.  </P> <P> Similarly affected, many earthquake survivors would be expected to find it  difficult or impossible to go back into the house -- or the state -- that  shook, just as air crash survivors may refuse to fly again.  </P> <P> "Reinstating the context (of an emotionally traumatic event) may be very  disturbing," Craik said. "I had a student who had been recently sexually  assaulted. She told me that one of the very disturbing things for her was when  she saw her car -- she had been assaulted in her car -- the next time, she  didn't want to get back in the car."  </P> <P> Despite the photographic quality their name implies, Craik said, flashbulb  memories can be inaccurate. He recalled the case of a psychologist who appeared  on an Australian television talk show with a local police chief to discuss the  poor reliability of traumatized witnesses to violent crimes.  </P> <P> Shortly after the show, Craik said, the psychologist was arrested on suspicion  of rape. The victim had been watching the TV talk show when she was attacked in  her apartment and raped.  </P> <P> In her distress, Craik said, "she had merged his face with that of her  attacker" and provided police with a vivid description of the psychologist. The  psychologist, of course, had an iron-clad alibi, and he was later released.  </P></p>

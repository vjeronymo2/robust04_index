			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GORMAN MAN, 34, HELD ON SUSPICION OF ARSON  </P> <P> A Gorman-area man was being held on suspicion of arson Tuesday for setting a  small grass fire on a neighbor's property after a dispute, authorities said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's arson investigators arrested Robert Jordan, 34, at  his home Monday near 250th Street West and Avenue A in the sparsely populated  northwest Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> Jordan allegedly used a cigarette lighter Saturday afternoon to set a fire that  burned a quarter of an acre of grass on property containing a house and a feed  store near 250th Street West and Avenue C-15, deputies said.  </P> <P> The fire, which residents extinguished before firefighters arrived, bore little  resemblance to a spate of suspicious brush fires this month in the Antelope and  Santa Clarita valleys. Jordan is not a suspect in any other fires, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The owner of the house and feed store told firefighters that the fire was set  by his neighbor after an argument, county Fire Capt. Michael Glosson said.  Deputies acting on a tip later arrested Jordan, who was being held in lieu of  $20,000 bail at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station.  </P></p>

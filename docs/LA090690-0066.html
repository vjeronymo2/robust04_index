			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOUNDRY IN TORRANCE REOPENS  </P> <P> A Torrance foundry, which closed temporarily last week because of excessive  emissions of airborne lead, has reopened after a judge's decision to relax an  earlier court restriction on its release of pollutants.  </P> <P> The Martin Brass Foundry, at 2341 Jefferson St., started up Tuesday after Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski ordered it to keep its lead  emissions below 3 micrograms per liter of air.  </P> <P> The federal standard for lead particles in ambient air is 1.5 micrograms per  liter. But foundry attorney Charles Ivie successfully argued in a court hearing  Tuesday that the threshold is meant to gauge airborne lead levels in large  geographical areas, not at individual plants.  </P> <P> On Aug. 16, Zebrowski ordered Martin Brass to keep its lead emissions within  the 1.5-microgram range, after the South Coast Air Quality Management District  detected airborne lead concentrations near the plant of up to 20 times the  federal standard.  </P> <P> The foundry has shut down twice in the last month to repair the vacuum system  it uses to control lead dust. The most recent AQMD samples, taken Aug. 21,  showed that the plant was emitting airborne lead in concentrations of 3  micrograms per liter, officials with the air quality agency say.  </P></p>

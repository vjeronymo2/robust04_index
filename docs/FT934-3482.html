			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson active Conglomerate Hanson was actively traded following exceptionally heavy turnover in the US and some technical position taking in UK traded options. In New York on Monday night the equivalent of 150m shares were traded, followed by a further 75m during the first half of yesterday's trading session. Dealers said US investors were 'dividend rolling' - stripping out the dividend following the group's disappointing results at the end of last week. Since the figures, the shares have come back around 25p from their all-time high. Many investors considered that at their reduced level they offered value, and in London yesterday one house carried out a bullish trade in the options market where the equivalent of 6m shares changed hands. As a result of all this frenetic activity the stock rallied from a low of 257p to close 1 1/2 off at 260 1/2 p with 15m shares dealt. Bearish speculation in Signet Group, formerly Ratners, saw the shares retreat, although they managed a slight recovery to close 2 off at 20p. The shares have now declined 33 per cent in the past month as talk of poor sales at the group's three core jewellery chains - Ratners, Ernest Jones and H. Samuel - has been heard in the market. Some stores specialists estimate pre-Christmas sales could be down by as much as a fifth, and yesterday there was talk the company could bring forward a widely expected rationalisation programme. This is believed to focus particularly heavily on the Ratners chain, with some 40 stores facing possible closure. There have also been persistent rumours in recent sessions of the imminent sale of Ernest Jones. Bank shares continued to race ahead with another burst of institutional buying interest, triggered by ever-increasing hopes of above average dividend rises in the sector. And there were suggestions that the recent blaze of buying activity in the banks, which has caught many of the leading marketmakers short of stock, may well prompt a widening of dealing spreads in the sector. Abbey National climbed 15 to a record 460p, with worries about shrinking margins, after the bank lowered its mortgage rate, said to have been dissipated. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have led a surge of buying in the stock after a lunch with senior Abbey officials. Royal Bank of Scotland advanced to another all-time high of 448p before closing a net 7 ahead at 446p, as did Lloyds, up 8 at 646p. The interim profits upsurge and doubled dividend from trading house Smith New Court came as no surprise to the stock market, where Smith shares, trading at a lowly 77 1/2 p as recently as September 1992, fell back from a record 423p to close a net 11 off at 411p. Food retailers again faced another difficult session in the wake of further broker caution. After several weeks of downgrades following analysts concern over the supermarket price war, renewed fears over profitability were sparked last week by Argyll's decision to make property provisions in its results. Yesterday, Cazenove, which has a policy of refusing to comment to the press, was said to have lopped some Pounds 110m - or 18 per cent - from its Tesco profits forecast for the current year to Pounds 500m. Around Pounds 70m of the downgrade was said to be property provisions, although other brokers were sceptical over the Cazenove figure. One said: 'The Pounds 70m has just been plucked from the air', pointing out that if Tesco adopts the same criteria as Argyll, profits due to property provisions will fall around Pounds 32m. However, shares continued to be undermined by the issue. Tesco lost 3 at 195p, J. Sainsbury 9 at 408p and Argyll a penny at 257 1/2 p. Pharmaceuticals group Medeva fell 7 to 132p as weakness in the sector was compounded by a downgrade from UBS. The house moved from 'speculative buy' to 'hold' and reduced its 1993 forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 40m. The sector leaders suffered from profit-taking said to have been prompted by a technical trade in the derivatives market. Glaxo lost 12 to 683p and Wellcome slid 22 to 666p. Falls from Zeneca and SmithKline Beecham were limited by support from Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort Benson respectively. Zeneca slipped 7 to 790p and SmithKline 3 to 393p. British Aerospace declined 6 to 409p after talks to sell its Ballast Nedam unit broke down. A price tag of Pounds 170m had been mooted. Profit-taking took the shine off good results from Siebe, the shares weakening 20 to 566p. Strauss Turnbull has pencilled in full-year profits of Pounds 220m. NFC trailed off 6 1/2 to 234p ahead of results and an expected Pounds 200m rights issue today. Chemicals group Allied Colloids dropped 10 to 228p after reporting lower interim profits. Hoare Govett cut its forecast to Pounds 42m from Pounds 48m and said the shares were now overvalued. Reports that Thorn EMI had been in takeover talks with Paramount, of the US, in November last year lifted the shares 9 to 989p.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STARTING OVER;  </P> <P> BRONCOS' LORI THOMPSON EMERGES AS TEAM'S LEADING PITCHER  </P> <P> Throughout most of her collegiate career, pitcher Lori Thompson of the Cal Poly  Pomona women's softball team has hardly been a center of attention.  </P> <P> Before this season, the 23-year-old senior's playing time had been mostly  limited to mop-up duty as a reliever and an occasional starter.  </P> <P> But with many of the starters lost to graduation, Thompson became a full-time  starter this season and did not squander the opportunity.  </P> <P> She has been the team's leading pitcher with a 19-7 record and an 0.64  earned-run average. Thompson has been even more impressive late in the season,  not allowing an earned run in her last 54 innings.  </P> <P> While her emergence as a standout for the Broncos may be surprising to some  people, Thompson says it is a result of growing more accustomed to her new  role.  </P> <P> "I think toward the end of the season I've felt more relaxed and confident,"  she said. "I think it's because I've gotten the opportunity to pitch a lot this  year. You can develop a consistency, whereas in the past I didn't get to pitch  that much."  </P> <P> Thompson said being more relaxed and confident has meant everything to her  performance.  </P> <P> "That's been the main factor, because in the past I was a little more tentative  in knowing that I wouldn't get a chance to pitch a lot."  </P> <P> She said it is a much different feeling than when she arrived in Pomona.  </P> <P> Thompson was a pitching star at Canyon High School in Anaheim and at San Diego  State.  </P> <P> In high school, she was an All-CIF Southern Section and All-Orange County  selection as a senior and made the All-Century League first team for two  straight years.  </P> <P> As a senior she was recruited by a handful of Division I programs and selected  San Diego State because it was the only school in California that offered her a  scholarship.  </P> <P> In her freshman year with the Aztecs, Thompson posted a 15-9 record and 0.64  ERA and was selected the team's outstanding freshman for 1985.  </P> <P> But she wasn't thrilled with the idea of finishing her career at San Diego  State, which has never been regarded as a Division I power. So she decided to  transfer.  </P> <P> "I wanted to play in a top-quality softball program," she said. "Our high  school team was always one of the top. So being used to winning, I wasn't  satisfied with being under .500 and not making the playoffs. I wanted to go  somewhere where I could make the playoffs and have good coaching."  </P> <P> Pomona, which was closer to home and has reached the Division I playoffs eight  straight years, fit the description.  </P> <P> "I knew a couple of players on the Pomona team from summer ball. So seeing how  they played made me pretty excited about coming here."  </P> <P> After sitting out the next season as a redshirt under NCAA transfer rules,  Thompson saw limited duty in her first two seasons with the Broncos.  </P> <P> "When I came here Rhonda Wheatley was in her senior year and I didn't expect to  pitch that much, and last year we had two other pitchers who expected to pitch  a lot," she said.  </P> <P> As a sophomore, Thompson posted a 4-2 record and 1.13 ERA with nine saves in 80  2/3 innings while the All-American Wheatley handled the bulk of the pitching.  </P> <P> "I pitched mostly in relief at the beginning of the year," she said. "I started  a few games, but once we got into the season Rhonda pitched most of the games."  </P> <P> Last season, pitching 86 innings, she had a 9-3 record and 0.81 ERA with seven  saves.  </P> <P> She said the infrequent playing time was not easy to accept at first. "It was  difficult to adjust to not pitching all the time," she said. "It took a lot to  get used to, but I think in the long run it was worth it."  </P> <P> With the departure of the team's top starter from last season, Kris Rokosz,  Thompson knew she would pitch more in her final year with the Broncos.  </P> <P> "I knew I would get to pitch a lot. We lost a lot of people from last year so I  came into the season ready to pitch a lot."  </P> <P> At 5-foot-2, Thompson is one of the shortest players on the team. She said her  size may have been a reason why the top Division I programs didn't recruit her  from high school.  </P> <P> "That was the only time I've ever been told, 'Oh, you're too small,' " she  said. "But it's never bothered me."  </P> <P> Thompson says her size doesn't create a disadvantage as a pitcher.  </P> <P> "I don't think that makes much difference as long as you're strong in the  mechanical aspects," she said. "I have always wondered what it would be like if  I was 5-8, though."  </P> <P> She said her best pitches are the rise ball and curve ball, although she also  throws a knuckle ball. She said that "since they moved the mound back to 43  feet, it's affected my speed. So it's made me made me more concerned about my  location and my pitches."  </P> <P> Thompson is happy with the skills she has developed as a pitcher. With her  college career winding down, her only regret is that she will not have much  longer to pitch for the Broncos.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me since this is the first year that I've gotten a chance to  pitch a lot," she said. "I have mixed emotions about this being my senior year.  One side is ready to go on to other things, but the other side wants to pitch a  little more."  </P> <P> Thompson said she will probably concentrate on her studies as an exercise  science major. She is hoping for a career in physical therapy and sports  rehabilitation -- a subject she became acutely aware of when she was in her  redshirt year.  </P> <P> "I injured my back near the end of my freshman year and that's when I got  interested in physical therapy and rehabilitation of injuries."  </P> <P> Thompson doesn't want to think about that at the moment, though. Her thoughts  are focused on the NCAA regionals where the eighth-ranked Broncos (40-21) will  square off against fourth-ranked Cal State Fullerton (47-13) in a best-of-three  series Friday and Saturday in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The winner advances to the Division I World Series the following week at  Sunnyvale.  </P> <P> Thompson pitched in only one game in the World Series last season when the  Broncos finished third in the nation. She said this year's team is different.  </P> <P> "Last year we were a power team and this team has to play well together to  win," she said. "But we feel we have the potential to beat Cal State Fullerton.  We can go to the World Series again if we play well together."  </P></p>

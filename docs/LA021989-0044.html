			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Simross wrote about shopping for emergency air fares where there is a death in  the family. Recently I researched this problem for myself and found that Delta  Airlines has an exceptional program. They offer a 35% discount for all family  members traveling to a funeral from within the continental United States. This  would include whether or not you are traveling with the remains as required by  some of the airlines.  </P> <P> It is also a specific policy as opposed to whatever relief may be gained from a  supervisor. The phone number is (800) DL CARES.  </P> <P> ROBERT L. KAILES  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P> <P>  The Delta Airlines DL CARES program is unusual in the airline business because  the carrier has an 800 number for consumers to dial in case of a death in the  family. The requirement for the 35% discount on a regular coach fare is only  that Delta must be shipping the remains of the deceased. Family members do not  have to fly on the same flight with the body. Family members may get the  discounted funeral fare from Delta up to one day prior to the shipping of the  body and up to 21 days after.  </P> <P> </P></p>

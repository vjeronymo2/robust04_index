			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Cambodia outlaws Khmer Rouge The Cambodian government will immediately ask other countries to seize Khmer Rouge assets and extradite to Cambodia Khmer Rouge guerrillas on their territory, it said yesterday. The move came after the national assembly formally outlawed the Khmer Rouge organisation. The plea for asset seizures by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, senior premier in Cambodia's coalition government, is directed mainly at Thailand, but is likely to be coolly received by Thai army generals. This week, Gen Wimol Wongwanich, Thai army commander, denounced Mr Morton Abramowitz, former US ambassador to Thailand, as a 'devil' for mentioning Thailand's links to the Khmer Rouge in a US newspaper. Thailand has long supported the Khmer Rouge and continues to do so by allowing the rebels to sell rubies and timber worth tens of millions of dollars each year from guerrilla strongholds in western Cambodia to Thai traders. The Khmer Rouge is also believed to keep some of its financial reserves in Thai banks. Prince Ranariddh spoke after the national assembly in Phnom Penh passed a law banning the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge's extremist leaders, blamed for the deaths of 1m Cambodians when they ruled the country between 1975 and 1978, flouted an international peace accord for Cambodia by refusing to join UN-organised elections last year. They have continued to fight against the elected government, but kept up an office in Phnom Penh until last month. Under the new law, Khmer Rouge members face prison terms of up to 30 years for secession and fighting against the authorities, although the law provides a six-month amnesty period for rank-and-file guerrillas to surrender and allows King Sihanouk to grant amnesty at any time. Cambodian officials not only blame Thailand for backing the Khmer Rouge. They suspect Thai involvement in a failed coup d'etat last week, though the attempt appears to have been organised by Cambodian officials who opposed the Khmer Rouge and criticised their own government's weakness in dealing with the rebels. Fourteen Thais are under arrest. The Cambodian government says it has information that nine of them are members of a 'hit squad' with expertise in weapons, explosives and radio communications. The Thai Foreign Ministry said yesterday the 14 were merely tourists or people looking for work. Mr You Hockry, interior minister, said yesterday: 'They are Thai people who got involved. That is all I can say.' Mystery surrounds a 15th Thai suspect who escaped. He was named as Lt-Col Adul Boonsert of the Thai police, a former member of parliament. 'He is still on active service,' said Mr You Hockry, demanding an explanation from the Thai government.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL PLAYERS DENY REPORT OF RAMPANT STEROID ABUSE  </P> <P> Notre Dame football players closed ranks behind their boss Wednesday, defending  Coach Lou Holtz -- and themselves -- from published charges that Holtz  tolerated widespread steroid abuse.  </P> <P> "I know the guys on this team don't use steroids, and that's all there is to  it," co-captain Todd Lyght said.  </P> <P> Chris Zorich, a senior nose tackle who bench-presses 500 pounds, said former  Notre Dame player Steve Huffman has a "chip on his shoulder."  </P> <P> Huffman wrote a first-person account for Sports Illustrated in which he claims  steroid use was rampant among Notre Dame players. He claimed Holtz must have  known and implied the coach tolerated the situation.  </P> <P> Holtz and other university officials denied the allegations.  </P> <P> But Notre Dame revealed Wednesday that five players have tested positive for  steroids since 1987 among 466 tests conducted by the university.  </P> <P> The players were disciplined, although athletic director Richard Rosenthal  refused to say whether they were thrown off the team or expelled from school.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, several players say they have never witnessed scenes described by  Huffman of dozens of steroid bottles and hypodermic needles littering dormitory  rooms.  </P> <P> The players also rejected Huffman's claim that Holtz forced athletes to  practice and play through painful injuries. "Yesterday I was injured and I took  myself out of practice, and Coach Holtz didn't seem to have any problem with  that," Lyght said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AGENCY SEEKS PROPOSALS TO REDEVELOP BLOCK  </P> <P> The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday initiated plans to develop another  major office, retail and plaza complex in the high-rise business district on  North Brand Boulevard.  </P> <P> Within a few days, the agency will send notices to owners of all property on  the east side of the 400 block of North Brand Boulevard, inviting suggestions  and proposals for redevelopment.  </P> <P> All property owners within the block are eligible to participate, provided  their proposals meet requirements adopted by the agency Tuesday, said Jeanne  Armstrong, redevelopment director.  </P> <P> A single project should be proposed for the entire block, bounded by Brand,  Milford Street, Maryland Avenue and Lexington Drive. Use of the existing  structures or construction of an entirely new complex will be considered.  </P> <P> The block includes the main office of Valley National Bank, one of the first  medium-rise structures built several decades ago to replace the original  Midwest-style brick storefronts that then lined the boulevard.  </P> <P> The agency's design consultants have recommended that the development  incorporate high-rise office towers at the corners of the block with retail  stores, a public plaza and at least one major restaurant. A multilevel parking  garage also would be included.  </P> <P> Property owners have until the end of March to submit proposals.  </P></p>

Kochug, deputy minister of </F> defense of the Republic of Moldova and chief of the Department  of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations, by A. Verin; place  and date not given: "A New Emergency Situation Service Created"]    [Text] A new Emergency Situation Service was created in the  republic in September of this year. What is this successor to  Civil Defense like? That was the topic covered in a conversation  with Colonel Anatoliy Kochug, deputy minister of defense and  chief of the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency  Situations.    [Verin] Systems for the defense of the population and the  economy have a rich history. Nevertheless in the most highly  developed countries of the world they came into being and  developed mainly after the Second World War. Actually that took  place in the USSR as well as a system of nationwide measures  conducted in peacetime and wartime to ensure protection of the  population against the use of modern means of destruction. What  is the Civil Defense like today?    [Kochug] Civil Defense is constantly developing its field of  activity and expanding, and presently its task consists not so  much of the defense of the population under conditions created  by the change in modern means of destruction, as conceived by  most of our countrymen, associating it only with the shelter and  gas mask. Under conditions of modern production with its  concentration of vast amounts of energy and creation and  utilization of a great number of materials, including some that  are dangerous to man and his environment, there was a sharp  increase in the probability of accidents and catastrophes.    Natural disasters, which bring destruction of human life  along with great economic losses, are constantly making  themselves felt. The 1968 earthquakes in Moldova the Chernobyl  catastrophe at the atomic electric power station that same year,  the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, and the catastrophic flood in  central regions of the Republic of Moldova serve as sad examples.    There were 28 emergency situations caused by fires, leakage  of poisonous substances, explosions in residences, food  poisoning, railway accidents, and other events occurring in just  10 months of this year in the republic. As a result 11 people  were killed, seven wounded, and seven more poisoned.    [Verin] Consequently life itself is setting forth the tasks  of ensuring the protection of the population together with  physical assets of the republic against industrial accidents and  catastrophes as well as ecological and natural disasters?    [Kochug] Absolutely correct. We do need realistic help in  the  form of a legislative base and legal back-up of measures for  prevention (and a decrease in the consequences) of emergency  situations. Such activity itself, however, is conducted through  the creation of new organizations within existing structures of  state administration. We believe that the establishment of the  Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations within the  Ministry of Defense was a timely measure. This determined the  role and place of Civil Defense in the overall scheme of state  organs of power. Other questions of considerable importance are  also being resolved at the same time. For instance, the  presently existing non-military Civil Defense units are  ineffective in handling consequences of accidents, catastrophes,  and natural disasters.    [Verin] Can we expect a time when the process involving  adoption of the laws will be completed?    [Kochug] Yes, the extraordinary events that are taking place  both within the republic and beyond its borders, compel us to be  vigilant. The interaction of society with the environment and  preservation of the biosphere for the benefit of the people has  now become one of the most pressing problems. Under conditions  created by political instability, a sharp decline in the rates  of production, the economic chaos, lack of necessary laws (the  disregard of those that were adopted), as well as the  irresponsibility of power structures and managers of a number of  ministries, government departments, enterprises, organizations,  establishments, and national economic facilities it is all the  more important to assign primary importance to the problem of  Civil Defense in our republic on the territory of which almost  all types of emergency situations of industrial and natural  kinds are possible.    Moldova is in a seismically hazardous zone where the force  of  an earthquake could reach eight or nine points. In the republic  there are eight atomic electric power stations at distances of  150--400 kilometers with different kinds of reactors, similar to  those at Chernobyl which are destroyed easily in case of an  accident while fuel is scattered over large areas. There are  around 70 chemically dangerous facilities in operation in the  republic which employ about 20,000 (with over half-a-million  people living in their proximity). Thousands of tonnes of highly  toxic and other explosive and flammable substances are  transported by truck and rail in the republic. Hydraulic  developments along Dniester and Prut rivers threaten around 170  populated points with flooding of more than 1,000 square  kilometers with a population of more than 160,000. The indicated  factors have repeatedly created situations that were close to  being emergencies.    [Verin] Last week your department conducted a check of the  state of Civil Defense and training together with the Ministry  of Transport of the republic. What was its purpose?    [Kochug] Emergency situations should be regarded as  phenomena  conditioned by various factors because of which it is necessary  to prepare ahead of time for their manifestation while working  out and implementing measures aimed at their neutralization and  lessening of harmful consequences. Therefore with consideration  of the circumstances which might develop on the territory of the  republic as a result of an emergency situation we tested the  capability of the ministry to resolve these tasks on the  engineering, radiation-chemical, and medical-biological level,  along with other elements. At the same time we conducted a  series of practical measures in the process of which management  at various levels of the ministry and the personnel of the units  obtained and consolidated required experience. I will note that  railway workers demonstrated a good training level and the  proper understanding of established tasks, even though the  concept of the exercises required them to function in a  practical manner. Naturally, the deficiencies revealed in the  course of our joint work must be eliminated rapidly but on the  whole this ministry has good workers devoted to their work and  to duty.    [Verin] Colonel, what practical steps are presently being  taken by the Department to prepare for the consequences of  emergency situations?    [Kochug] In accordance with a government decision we are  creating five emergency rescue units. At present we are faced  with complex and important tasks involved in housing these  units, establishing military order, the field regulations,  supply of equipment and specialized gear for them, as well as  creation of the necessary training-material and a methodological  base making it possible to undertake fruitful training in order  to be constantly prepared to resolve tasks confronting the  fighters-rescuers.    Adoption of the law on Civil Defense in the Republic of  Moldova is on the agenda. The draft of that law has now been  prepared and was submitted to a parliamentary committee together  with a series of statutes and decrees, and other documents are  also being prepared.    [Verin] Thank you. Now we know who we must rely on in the  most complex situations.</p>

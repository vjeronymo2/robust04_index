			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ROCKETS STILL HAVEN'T LEFT THE LAUNCH PAD  </P> <P> To Don Chaney's horror, the Houston Rockets have gone from envisioning a  championship to plugging holes in a sinking ship.  </P> <P> Mayday: The Rockets are two percentage points ahead of Seattle and one-half  game behind Golden State in the race for the final spot in the Western  Conference playoffs.  </P> <P> Mayday: The same team Chaney predicted before the season would win 50 games is  on a pace for 39.  </P> <P> Mayday: Houston is 4-19 on the road after a 98-91 loss at Dallas Wednesday.  </P> <P> One of the few victories Chaney got in December, when the Rockets went 3-12,  was a moral one.  </P> <P> "We didn't get any finger-pointing," Chaney said. "And one reason, maybe, is a  because we all played poorly. You couldn't point without pointing at yourself."  </P> <P> Akeem Olajuwon, who averages 23.3points and leads the league with 13.4rebounds  and 4.1blocked shots per game, has been one of the few bright spots. But he too  has been frustrated.  </P> <P> "We know this team cannot win a championship," Olajuwon told a Houston TV  station last month. "There's no reason deceiving ourselves now because in the  league you have to play seven-game (playoff) series. There's no luck.  </P> <P> "You have to have the team to win, and it's going to take a lot more to win a  championship. So we are not close."  </P> <P> An 8-5 record in January has helped calm Olajuwon. But the Rockets played eight  of those games at home.  </P> <P> "Our championship focus is not on this year," Chaney said. "We're building for  the future. You can't build and talk about a championship at the same time and  be very realistic.  </P> <P> "To focus on a championship, you've got to be in the playoffs. Our main focus  is to get to .500. Then climb above .500. Then get a playoff spot. Then when  you get in the playoffs, maybe."  </P> <P> During the preseason, however, Chaney said that the Rockets "on paper" had the  makings of a 50-victory team. The Rockets were coming off a 45-victory season.  </P> <P> They had signed rebounding fiend Larry Smith and playmaker John Lucas as free  agents. Off-guards Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd both were back from 2  1/2-year drug suspensions. Forwards Otis Thorpe, Buck Johnson and Derrick  Chievous (average age: 25) would do nothing but improve.  </P> <P> On paper.  </P> <P> "I think we put pressure on ourselves to start out so well," Lucas said. "The  expectations were so high. It kind of hurt us. We lost a lot of confidence when  we lost the first game of the season."  </P> <P> The Rockets opened the season Nov. 2 with a 102-88 road defeat to the Los  Angeles Clippers. Because of a blood clot in his left calf, Olajuwon sat out  all the exhibition games and was not at full speed at the beginning of the  season.  </P> <P> The Rockets were 9-6 entering December. But they lost at home to Dallas and New  Jersey and on the road to Charlotte. During that stretch, Wiggins sprained his  left knee and missed 16 games. Smith missed six games with a back injury.  </P> <P> "When you're having those things happen, you have a tendency to feel sorry for  yourselves," Chaney said. "You let a team like New Jersey beat you, Charlotte  beat you, and you're at an all-time low. The Clippers had injuries and were  short of talent, but they had plenty of confidence. They were taking open shots  and just not making them. This team went out there with their heads down, and  that scared me."  </P> <P> The Rockets have been unable to provide consistent support for Olajuwon. In the  last two months, the Rockets lost games in which Olajuwon had point and rebound  totals of 41 and 14, 32 and 20, 33 and 17, and 34 and 12.  </P> <P> With inconsistent outside shooting, defenses have sagged on Olajuwon and Otis  Thorpe (16.5 points per game) in the Rockets' half-court offense.  </P> <P> Chaney wants the Rockets to push the ball up the court, but they still rank  only 19th in the NBA in scoring (103.6 ppg).  </P> <P> "When we're running, we're in games," Chaney said. "When we're standing, we're  in trouble."  </P> <P> Wiggins, 30, has been a pleasant surprise. He averages 19.8points on  50.7-percent shooting. Before his suspension, he averaged 9.6 points on  46-percent shooting.  </P> <P> "If I had come back and averaged four or five points a game, people would have  said, 'Seeing how he he has been out 2 1/2 years, that's about right,' "  Wiggins said. "Nobody has ever come back like that. It's a lot better than I  expected."  </P> <P> Wiggins may serve as a reminder that there's always hope.  </P> <P> Besides, the Rockets still have Olajuwon, whom Lucas refers to as "our Joe  Montana. Without 'The Dream,' we would already be sitting up in New York  (awaiting the draft lottery) saying, 'Number, please.' "  </P></p>

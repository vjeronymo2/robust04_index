			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO SENSE OF PLACE  </P> <P> We read today, with a mixture of nostalgia, disgust and outrage, Amy Louise  Kazmin's article regarding the proposed demolition of the Munch Box in  Chatsworth in order to build yet another sterile, ugly and unnecessary  mini-mall.  </P> <P> Nostalgia for the many years that we have spent perched on a stool in front of  the Munch Box, enjoying a meal and watching the world roll by; disgust and  outrage at the shortsighted individuals in Los Angeles city government and  private enterprise, working together to rob Chatsworth of one of its few  remaining local landmarks.  </P> <P> Industrializing the West Valley may increase the tax base for Los Angeles, but  it has brought nothing but congestion, crime and blight to this once pretty and  peaceful corner of L.A.  </P> <P> Have the people in City Hall no sense of place? Have they no regard for their  working class constituents? This is yet another example of the continued  erosion of the quality of life in Los Angeles, and in Chatsworth in particular,  for the benefit of a greedy few.  </P> <P> CHARLES R. PAVLIK  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P> <P> BRUCE PAVLIK and LYNN SUER  </P> <P> Oakland, Calif.  </P> <P> ROBERT PAVLIK  </P> <P> Paso Robles, Calif.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA)--The AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper  says the United States has become virtually isolated in its  calls for the continued enforcement of sanctions against Iraq,  particularly since it has seen with its own eyes the  disintegration of its international coalition.    In an article published today, the paper adds: Despite the  fact that the U.S. position on the embargo has remained  unchanged, as attested to by the recent report Clinton submitted  to the U.S. Congress, there has been a change in the French and  British positions on the embargo.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The French position is showing signs of  change, as manifested in the Iraqi-French political and oil  talks and the statements made by the French foreign minister, in  which he said that there is a strong likelihood of Iraq resuming  its oil exports shortly.    The paper goes on to say: Despite the fact that the British  position on the embargo is still close to the U.S. position,  there has been a noticeable watering down of the intransigent  anti-Iraq rhetoric used by British officials. As for Russia and  the PRC, they are sympathetic to the efforts to lift the embargo  imposed on Iraq.    AL-JUMHURIYAH says: These indications, coupled with Iraq's  cooperation and its implementation of the provisions enshrined  in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, underscore the  need to lift the embargo, because there are no justifications  for maintaining it.    The paper concludes by saying: The continuation of the  embargo means that Washington is implementing the most dangerous  chapter of its grand anti-Iraq conspiracy, and that it is  working to stifle Iraq; and this is something the Iraqi people  oppose and will never accept.</p>

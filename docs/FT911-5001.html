			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / More ships tackle oil disaster MORE specialised vessels arrived yesterday off the Italian coast to help with the fight against the oil pollution caused by the tanker disaster near Genoa. The ships, which include the 'Ragno II', an oil exploration vessel owned by Italy's Saipem oil company, will enable experts to form a better impression of how much crude is left aboard the sunken Cypriot-registered supertanker 'Haven' and how best to remove it. Using remote-controlled cameras, experts will try to ascertain the wreck's condition. Decisions will then be taken on steps to remove the remaining oil. Surface efforts have so far recovered 6,000-7,000 tonnes of oil that had leaked from the vessel, which sank on Sunday. However, scientists estimated there could still be 100,000 tonnes of crude oil left in the ship and said this was a clear threat. Light winds were slowly blowing the oil south-west, towards France.</p>

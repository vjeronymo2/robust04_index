Gen. Abacha said this at the opening of bilateral  talks between Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The delegationfrom  Sierra Leone is led by the country's head of state, Captain  Valentine Strasser. Statehouse correspondent, Chris Mbu,  reports on the meeting:    [Begin recording] [Mbu] General Abacha said that ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] is now passing through a critical stage of its operations  but, (?as he says), peace and stability is being restored in  Liberia on the basis of the Cotonou Peace Accord. Gen. Abacha  pleaded with West African countries to come together and put  pressure on the warring groups in the Liberian crisis to make  them understand the need for peace in Liberia. He said that  time had come for the sacrifices being made by countries  involved in the ECOMOG operations to be justified by way of  lasting peace in Liberia. The head of state then called for  support for efforts coming from outside Africa in aid of ECOMOG  operations in Liberia, citing the United Nations efforts as  example.    [Abacha] The interest that is being shown by the United  Nations is something which is very, very positive and it has got  to be encouraged. Countries that [word indistinct] not only in  the subregion, but also in particular in Liberia wish to  cooperate to ensure the success of the accord.    [Mbu] Gen. Abacha then assured Capt. Strasser of Nigeria's  willingness to continue assisting the Sierra Leone which, he  said, has been experiencing some destabilizing fallout from the  Liberian crisis. The Sierra Leone shares borders with Liberia.  On the issue of ties between the two countries, he said that  Nigeria and the Sierra Leone will explore ways of widening the  scope and strengthening existing relations.    The Sierra Leonean head of state, Capt. Strasser, reacting  to  some of the issues raised by Gen. Abacha, expressed concern that  seven months after the Cotonou Peace Accord, as he put it, no  major advancement has been made towards lasting peace in  Liberia. He said that in Sierra Leone, questions are now being  raised about the sense in deploying national resources for  ECOMOG operations when Sierra Leone is faced with what he  referred to as serious security problems. All that  notwithstanding, he assured Gen. Abacha that the Sierra Leone  will continue to maintain its presence in the ECOMOG but with  Nigeria assisting in tackling the country's security problems.    Delegations of the two countries later went into a  closed-door session. The Sierra Leonean head of state who flew  into Abuja morning has since left for home. [end recording]</p>

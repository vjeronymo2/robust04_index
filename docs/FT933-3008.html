			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / State Bank of Pakistan goes independent MR MOHAMMAD YAQUB, governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, has been handed a formidable task. The central bank is to become independent following a decision by the cabinet of Mr Moeen Qureshi, caretaker prime minister. A presidential ordinance due within days is expected to give powers to the bank to set its own monetary and administrative agenda in an effort to end manipulation by government officials, politicians and businesses. Mr Yaqub, who has had a career with the International Monetary Fund, took up his position in August after Mr Qureshi, also a former IMF and World Bank official, was appointed following the resignation of Premier Nawaz Sharif. Mr Yaqub, an economic adviser to the finance ministry under Mr Sharif, became alarmed about the growing budget deficit. 'The ordinance is not going to make us a Bundesbank. We are trying to get closer to what central banks are in most developing countries,' Mr Yaqub said in an interview. Independence is intended to help prevent the bankrolling of profligate public spending. 'You have a situation where the government has been living beyond its means. The central bank should be in a position as an adviser to the government to go and tell them: here is the package of monetary variables consistent with your overall objectives. If you want those objectives, your budget discipline must be enforced in line with that,' he said. Mr Yaqub hopes to strengthen the bank by advising the government on the limits on deficit financing, by halting external influences on commercial banks to give loans, and by having independence in appointing employees. He has already raised interest rates by two percentage points in an effort to attract savings and counter rising inflation, and recommended a target of Rs20bn (Pounds 438m) for government borrowings during the fiscal year which began in July, roughly a third of recent levels. The State Bank's powers have been gradually eroded since the early 1970s when Pakistan's four largest commercial banks were nationalised. State-owned banks have since built up bad debts of Rs80bn. Rampant growth in government spending has caused large budget deficits and uncontrolled government borrowing from banks. Public-sector deficit financing squeezed new credit to the private sector. Mr Yaqub has refused to withdraw fines imposed on two of Pakistan's largest public sector commercial banks, despite concerns among some officials that this could damage their commercial credibility. He says he will not permit banks to violate requirements such as those related to maintaining a certain level of reserves or credit-deposit ratios, nor artificially show higher profitability despite bad loans. Commercial bankers welcome the steps, seeing an opportunity to recover loans. 'Its not as if the borrowers have defaulted because they had no money to pay back. 'It's just that they were too powerful and the finance ministry in Islamabad was behind them, so there were no fears of any clampdown,' says one leading banker in Karachi. Mr Yunus Khan, head of the Pakistani network of Deutsche Bank, says: 'Hopefully, the State Bank will not play to the tune of the bureaucrats or the politicians'. However, he cautions that the loan recovery process may not be an easy one because of likely 'legal entanglements'. Mr Yaqub hopes that a bold and independent central bank will help improve the country's monetary health and enforce prudential regulations. He will inevitably come under heavy political pressure when a new government is elected on October 6, but is confident Pakistan will adhere to Mr Qureshi's reforms, because it has no other option.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Jaunt through the jams - Smart Guide / Bangkok - Victor Mallet gives a few tips What is the best area in which to stay? Pick a hotel as close as possible to where you will be working. The notoriety of Bangkok's traffic jams is richly deserved. If your business takes you all over the city, try hotels on and around Ratchadamri Road. That way you should be able to reach government offices, the main business districts and the airport without great difficulty. On holiday, stay next to the river at The Oriental. It is more fun to look at exotic rice-barges and river-taxis than the concrete shop-houses and tower blocks that dominate the rest of Bangkok. Hotels? The Regent on Ratchadamri Road is efficient and quiet and has an Asian flavour that distinguishes it from the rest of the world's wearisomely familiar five-star hotels. The Hyatt next door looks like an ugly glass and concrete wedding cake from outside, but is pleasant enough within. Next to it is a Hindu-cum-Buddhist shrine where Thais pray to win the lottery. On the other side of Lumpini Park is the Dusit Thani. Once Bangkok's tallest building, this 1970-vintage hotel looks its age, but is arguably as central as you will find. Not far away on Sathorn Road is the Sukhothai, a new and well-designed hotel with ponds and statues that will calm frenzied executives. Officially, all of these cost between 5,000 and 6,000 baht a night, but discounts are available if you ask. How about restaurants? Try not to eat in hotel restaurants. Thai food - fresh, simple, spicy, cheap  -is usually better at a street stall than in a gloomy coffee shop. It is hard to go wrong with Thai food outside the hotels. Among the better Thai restaurants are Ban Chiang (Srivieng Road) and Ban Khun Por (in Siam Square) - both are in wooden Thai houses. For particularly spicy fare and north-eastern Thai mu-sic, try the outdoor Ban Lao (Sukhumvit 36). If your bowels cannot take any more chilli, Bangkok has plenty of Italian, Indian, Arab, French and Japanese restaurants, and more besides. For superb Kobe steaks and Japanese beer, the smoky Misu's Kitchen on Patpong 1 is a must. Entertainment? Bangkok is as notorious for its night life as for its traffic - again, justly. Patpong is the best-known drinking, whoring, ogling and night-time shopping area in Bangkok, possibly in the world - but is not the only one. Nor is licentious behaviour restricted to portly western men. The Japanese have a street of bars in Patpong; unless you look Japanese, you will probably not get past the door. Other entertainments are scarce, but you could watch a Thai kick-boxing match at Lumpini stadium. Cinemas are irritating: many films are in English with Thai subtitles, but the sound quality is of-ten poor and the words in-audible. What local quirks should I be aware of? Do not point your feet at people, touch them on the head, be impatient or loud, or joke about the Thai royal family. If you bribe, bribe the right person at the right time. Obey these rules and you are unlikely to get into trouble. Thais say their culture is non-confrontational, but you may dispute this if you watch people driving. And in a recent A-Z business guide to Thailand, A was for Assassination. Transport? This is the bane of Bankgok. Be flexible. Leap out of your taxi and walk if it helps you reach a meeting on time, but remember that the city is hot, humid, short of pavements and sometimes flooded with sewage. On some routes, you may find it quicker to use a river-taxi or canal-boat, but it pays to know exactly where you want to get off. Many businessmen think nothing of using a motorcycle-taxi, but weaving through the traffic on these machines is as dangerous as it is quick, and the air you breathe is thick with fumes. Suppose I have a spare day? Take a boat up the Chao Phraya river (or a bus) to Ayuthaya, the temple-rich former capital of Thailand sacked by Burmese invaders. If you prefer nature to culture, drive to the Khao Yai national park at dawn and walk in the forest. In the middle of the park are some food stalls serving a dish listed on the menu as 'Untold Miseries Pork'. Thai Airways is increasing flight frequency and capacity to Europe, as well as adding Istanbul as a destination during the current winter season (to March 25), the airline said. It will raise flight frequency to Europe from 34 to 43 flights a week, including a twice-weekly service to Istanbul and Athens and seven a week to Paris and Frankfurt. It will also fly four times a week to Copenhagen and three times to Stockholm. An increase in regional services will include seven flights a week to Kunming in Yunnan province, southern China.</p>

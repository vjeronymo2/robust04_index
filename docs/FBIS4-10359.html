			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Sanchez Belisle] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for  the United People political alliance, yesterday called for  compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties during a meeting  with U.S. congressmen who advocate U.S. military presence in  Panama beyond the year 2000.    "Compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties is the most  advisable thing for the United States and Panama," Perez  Balladares told U.S. Congressmen Phil Crane and Howard Phillips  [title as published], who are holding talks in Panama to promote  a law before the U.S. Congress to extend the U.S. military  presence in Panama after 31 December 1999.    Perez Balladares said his government would be "willing to  hold talks" if the United States should request discussions on  defense issues and on a U.S. military presence beyond the year  2000.    The United People candidate said: "We held very frank  talks."  He added that times have changed and currently "our interests  and the interests of the United States are focused on the war  against drugs and drug trafficking."    Perez Balladares said drugs are causing havoc in Panama,  adding that, if he wins the 8 May elections, he will ask  neighboring countries, specifically Costa Rica and Colombia, "to  establish a united Latin American front to fight drugs." The  struggle against drugs, the presidential candidate added, must  be based on mutual respect that must prevail among free,  independent, and sovereign countries.    Perez Balladares' meeting with Congressmen Crane and  Phillips, who were accompanied by about 20 people, took place in  the afternoon in the Blue Room of the Continental Hotel.</p>

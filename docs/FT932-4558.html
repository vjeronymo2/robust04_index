			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Poland's stags muscle in on issues A RUSH for shares in the Polish government's privatisation issues has seen the return of one of the features of the old economy of chronic shortages - long queues - and the use of violence to obtain shares. Despite a continued fall in the Warsaw stock exchange after its meteoric 175 per cent rise since Easter, small investors remain convinced they will make a killing on new issues and crowded into banks and stockbrokers' offices to buy shares in the Vistula garment manufacturer and the Sokolow Podlaski meat works. Many had turned up day after day for two or more weeks to check their names off a list held by a queue committee specifically set up to make sure the order would be respected when the sale opened on a first come, first served basis. Others had hired 'standers' to keep their place as well as bodyguards to protect the 'standers'. The less subtle simply sent in a hired group of strong-arm men to make the purchase on the day. Thus in Krakow on Monday Mr Krzysztof Arabski, a local broker became the small investor's hero after he refused to serve a dozen or more well-muscled investors who tried to jump the queue. The group was more successful, however, in pushing aside a queue outside the Export Development Bank, where a couple of women accompanying them bought shares. Scores of similar incidents have been reported of strong-arm men pushing into queues and buying all the shares available at a given branch. 'In Bochnia near Krakow one man produced a pistol,' says Mr Arabski. Yesterday Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, head of the Warsaw stock exchange called on the privatisation ministry to drop the first come first served system and offer new issues through the exchange on a subscription basis modelled on British practice. The securities commission which regulates the market has asked aggrieved investors to lodge complaints.</p>

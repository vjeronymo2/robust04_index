			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Bristol &amp; West chief quits suddenly BRISTOL &amp; West, the UK's 10th largest building society, yesterday announced the abrupt departure of Mr Tony FitzSimons as chief executive. The society suffered a sharp rise in lending provisions last year, following what industry analysts regard as over-ambitious lending in the south of the UK between 1989 and 1991. . Bristol &amp; West said Mr Fitz-Simons was resigning 'with immediate effect'. His departure follows the appointment four months ago of Lord Armstrong of Ilminster as chairman. Since Mr FitzSimons's appointment in spring 1989, Bristol &amp; West has suffered particularly high levels of bad debt during the housing recession, while pursuing expansionist policies. The society's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 39.1m last year, from Pounds 67.4m, as lending provisions nearly tripled to Pounds 74.1m from Pounds 24.5m. However, a recovery had begun in the first half of this year, with interim pre-tax profits more than doubling to Pounds 20.4m, total mortgage arrears falling 19 per cent and the ratio of cost to income substantially reduced. Mr FitzSimons could not be contacted yesterday. In a prepared statement, he said: 'I have a number of interesting avenues I have wished to pursue and hope that they will see fruition in the not too distant future.' Bristol &amp; West said there were no immediate plans for a change of strategy and stressed that it was financially strong. Lord Armstrong said: 'Our first priority is to manage out the arrears, make sure we maintain high quality and bring our costs down.' He added that the society was 'looking for the possibility of mergers'. Two long-standing Bristol &amp; West executives change positions as a result of the resignation. Mr John Burke, business development director, becomes chief executive and Mr Jeff Warren, finance director, becomes his deputy. The society's most recent figures showed that 5.1 per cent of its mortgages were more than 12 months in arrears, considerably above the industry norm. While its competitors were reducing their number of branch offices, Bristol &amp; West was investing heavily. Its total number rose from 171 in 1988 to 186 in 1991, before falling to 178 last year. The 1992 report and accounts show that Mr FitzSimons, who was the highest-paid director, received a salary of more than Pounds 195,000. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, said: 'He was considered deal hungry and many investors have been worried that he could 'bet the bank' with some future deal.'</p>

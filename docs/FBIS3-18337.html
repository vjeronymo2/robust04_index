In the Chinese capital on Monday [28 February], Sir Leon  Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi co-chaired the  13th meeting of the joint EU-China committee which is due to  last two days and during which the main subject of discussion  will be China's reentry to the GATT. Their first joint press  conference held yesterday was marked by a quite sharp exchange  on the Hong Kong question. Wu Yi, who judged Great Britain's  attitude as "unfriendly and uncooperative," warned that it could  not but affect the economic and trade relationship between the  two countries. Brittan then stressed that relations between the  EU and China were based on nondiscrimination with regard to EU  member states. "Any discriminatory action against a member  state for political reasons would be a very serious matter, not  just for that member state but for the EU as a whole," he  warned, without specifying what action could be taken. It does,  however, seem clear that Europe's support for Chinese membership  in GATT carries considerable weight.    China accuses the British governor of Hong Kong of seeking  to  introduce without its consent democratic reforms for the colony  which is due to return to Chinese rule in 1997.    Apart from the matter of the British colony, the two parties  displayed optimism, describing yesterday's working session as  "frank and constructive." Brittan stated that Brussels was  "full of admiration" for the efforts made by Beijing to move  toward a market economy, even if differences remain on certain  points. "There are problems to be solved as China's development  is remarkable but incomplete," he said, adding that the  conditions for reentry to GATT "must be negotiated in order to  speed up the process of reform and liberalization."    Sir Leon also spoke of Europe's concern on the human rights  issue, and submitted a draft protocol on European proposals with  a view to settling outstanding questions, expressing the hope  that "progress can be made in this field without delay."    For her part, Mrs Wu accepted that differences of opinion  remained, stressing however that the two parties were determined  to make the necessary efforts to resolve them.    According to one Western diplomat, the EU is worried by the  fact that China may reach an agreement with the United States  concerning its reentry to the GATT in return for trade  concessions which would be detrimental to Europe.</p>

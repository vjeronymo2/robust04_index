			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Gore reaches out to eastern European states The Clinton administration is promising to remain engaged in Europe and to fight for the success of democracy in former communist countries. As President Bill Clinton prepares to fly tomorrow to Brussels, Prague and then Moscow for meetings with leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and eastern Europe, vice-president Al Gore staunchly defended the US's 'Partnership for Peace' proposal for bringing the countries of eastern Europe into closer association with Nato. Although many of these countries have complained that the proposal falls short of the promise of eventual Nato membership which they seek, Mr Gore said it represented an 'evolutionary process of Nato enlargement'. 'It is a step toward adding new members of Nato,' he said in a speech delivered in Milwaukee in the place of Mr Clinton, who flew to Arkansas following the death early yesterday morning of his mother, Mrs Virginia Kelley. Nato countries have been torn between the desire of countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic for early entry into the alliance and Russia's misgivings about being isolated by an expanded Nato. Mr Gore said Mr Clinton's objectives on his 10-day trip to Europe would be to revive Nato, support democracy, reduce the dangers of nuclear and chemical weapons and help the transition to market economies in the former communist countries. Mr Gore argued strongly that supporting the countries of eastern Europe was an investment in US security.</p>

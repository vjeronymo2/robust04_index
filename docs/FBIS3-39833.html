"I want a UDF candidate," he said, "and I do not see  how it could be otherwise.... A two-round majority election  necessarily requires that there are two candidates in each camp  in the first round." Mr. de Charette, who is close to UDF  President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that he "had never been  very much in favor" of the system of "primaries" for the  presidential election which Charles Pasqua wants. "It would be  very difficult to legislate on that," he said.    Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-Social Democratic Center)  also said it is "probable if not certain that there will be a  UDF candidate" in the presidential election. Mr. Monory, the  guest on the France-2 "Hour of Truth" program, added that  wanting "a single candidate" for the majority "at any cost," as  Mr. Pasqua does, strikes him as "not a good idea." "There are  two big groups which must help each other to win the  presidential election," he stressed.    Moreover, Mr. Monory thinks that the future candidate for  the  presidential election will have to promise to carry out "a  far-reaching reform of society." "I am certainly not  criticizing the government's record, but there are problems to  be solved," he said. "What has to be done is not pleasant," the  Senate speaker stressed. "A number of achievements must be  questioned, but the closer we come to the election date the more  this will have to be said to ensure that people are not taken by  surprise.... What is tragic is that many promises were made in  1993, far more than can probably be kept."    UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin (UDF-Republican Party)  also thinks it is "natural for the UDF to have a candidate in  the first round" of the presidential election. The UDF "is  exercising power on an equal footing, holding the speaker's post  in the Senate, and with a majority in the regions and  departments," he said.    "The candidate will therefore run in the first round" of the  presidential election "in a spirit of alliance," Mr. Raffarin  said on Radio-J. Among the UDF's "men of stature," Raffarin  cited Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the president of the confederation;  Mr. Monory; Raymond Barre; and Defense Minister Francois Leotard.    In conclusion, Mr. Raffarin criticized the government's  policy, calling for a "psychological impact" to combat "the  serious risks of a social explosion." "I cannot be satisfied  with a television program, whatever the talents and merits of  the public protagonists," the UDF spokesman said with reference  to Mr. Balladur's appearance on the "Hour of Truth" on 14  February.</p>

Alan Boursse, 39, of  the Berkeley area, and Georgio Melloni, 20, of Pinole, died in the accident  about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. Southern Pacific police officer  Barry Ballence said two counselors and three clients from a Pinole residential  facility were walking along the tracks when the eastbound train rounded a curve  behind them. The train engineer saw a man about 100 yards away, walking in the  middle of the tracks, with his back to the train, a Southern Pacific spokesman  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (3): Telecoms flotation is delayed - The privatisation programme has suffered a setback The sight of Yannos Papantoniou, Greece's economy minister, rounding up deputies in the corridors of parliament before a crucial vote on the flotation of the state telecoms company, illustrates the importance the governing socialists now place on partial privatisation. The law opening the way for 25 per cent of OTE, the telecoms monopoly, to be sold on the Athens stock exchange was finally approved last Monday. But two days later, the government decided to postpone the flotation, set for early December. Advisers to the issue warned early last week that under present conditions the government's target of raising more than Dr320bn from the flotation would not be met. The offering is now expected in February. Mr Papantoniou hopes for a better price then, with OTE's full-year results available, a new board of directors in place and a less charged political atmosphere. The economy ministry forecasts revenues of Dr400bn from privatisation in the next three years. Studies are under way to identify state enterprises that could be listed on the bourse, offered to private investors, or restructured with a view to selling off subsidiaries. Although it took only a few months in power for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement to reverse its opposition to unbundling the state, the OTE delay indicates that the party's radical faction still has reservations. However, a shift in public opinion in favour of privatisation reflects frustration with poor services offered by the state-owned corporations that control an estimated 60 per cent of the economy. The telecommunications, airline, electricity, petroleum and shipbuilding industries are dominated by the state, while more than 60 per cent of the banking market is held by the two biggest state banks. Management is deeply politicised, with senior executives' jobs being handed out by the governing party. The patronage system extends well beyond the board-room, with the result that state corporations are all heavily overstaffed. The disastrous condition of public finances makes flotations of state enterprises an appealing method of raising funds for new investment. The government hoped to reassure Pasok's doubters by offering only minority stakes in public sector corporations and allowing the state to retain management control. The OTE public offering remains pivotal to the economy ministry's privatisation plans. Despite last week's problems, Mr Papantoniou has benefited from the conservatives' failed attempt to sell a 49 per cent stake in the company last year. He had little difficulty in recalling CS First Boston and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the international investment banks chosen by the conservatives to handle the OTE deal, since their fees had not been paid. OTE is one of only a few profitable Greek state enterprises, with pre-tax profits last year of Dr129bn on turnover of Dr389bn. First-half results this year, published for the first time, showed pre-tax profits of Dr77.8bn on turnover of Dr210.8bn. Prof Christos Kazantzis, a financial adviser on the OTE sale, dismisses investor concerns over the quality of state management. He says: 'More important is the tremendous potential for growth, considering that income per line in Greece is less than half the European Union average.' Most Greek commercial banks were invited to share in underwriting the domestic tranche of 7 per cent, to ensure wide distribution of the issue. The new law also aims to reassure investors by providing for share price support by the underwriting banks for several months after the flotation. Regardless of when the OTE sale goes through, DEP, the state-controlled oil refining and petroleum products group wants to come to market next year. Both DEP, a holding company, and the two state refineries it owns are to be floated, along with an oil trading subsidiary. DEP is handing over Dr50bn to the government this year ahead of its flotation. With consolidated profits for 1994 projected at Dr36bn on sales of Dr642bn, the group intends to expand ahead of the flotation. DEP's two oil refineries control 60 per cent of the local market, while its chain of petrol stations has a 20 per cent market share. Manolis Daskalakis, DEP's managing director, says: 'There will be a series of listings starting late in 1995 but we won't be disposing of more than 25 per cent of any of our companies.' DEP plans to use funds from the flotation to finance a Dollars 500m five-year investment plan, which includes expanding into other markets in the southern Balkans. However, the next stage of privatisation will be more difficult. Other companies on the list such as the Public Power Corporation, the power utility, have moved into loss because of restrictions on tariff increases and are heavily burdened with accumulated debt.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: IBM considers investment in Time Warner division IBM may make a substantial investment in Time Warner Entertainment, the film, television and cable division of the entertainment empire, in connection with plans the companies are believed to be discussing to create a large-scale joint venture. IBM says it is seeking partners in the entertainment, consumer electronics and telecommunications fields to create an independent venture that would offer 'interactive multimedia services' to homes and businesses throughout the US. 'Movies on demand' will be one of the first applications of the planned service. Subscribers will be able to watch a film of their choice at any time. Other potential uses include 'interactive television', in which viewers could, for example, answer questions on a quiz show. IBM also envisages educational and information service applications. Time Warner is believed to have become the primary focus of IBM's discussions. An alliance between the two would combine IBM's information processing expertise with Time Warner's entertainment, media and distribution capabilities. Other partners, including an electronics manufacturer, would be needed to provide equipment such as the 'decoder' boxes for use with television sets. A likely choice is Toshiba, which with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading company, has agreed to take a 12.5 per cent equity stake in Time Warner Entertainment for Dollars 500m each. An investment of similar proportions by IBM would provide Time Warner with much needed cash. The entertainment company has been seeking investments to reduce the enormous debt it incurred in its creation by the merger of the former Time and Warner Communications groups in early 1990. IBM's primary goal is, however, to find a partner that would enable it to capitalise on its investments in 'multi-media' technology, which apply computer technology to providing a rich mix of video, graphics and text information.</p>

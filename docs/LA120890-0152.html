			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FLYERS' BASS PLAYER TAKES A SOLO FLIGHT;  </P> <P> BLUES: THE FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY R&amp;B BAND HAS JOINED OTHER  LOCAL ARTISTS TO MAKE A WHOLE LOTTA BIG NOISE.  </P> <P> There's a joke about an anthropologist who thinks he knows all the ways of the  remote tribe he's been living with for two years, but one night a frantic,  desperate drumming commences, and the chief will say only that if the drumming  ever stops, a terrible, terrible thing will occur.  </P> <P> Finally, as the night wears on to morning and the drumming pounds on, the  anthropologist pleads with the chief, "Please, we're blood brothers, tell me,  what is the terrible, terrible thing that happens if the drumming stops?"  </P> <P> "Bass solo starts."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Mighty Flyers' bassist Bill Stuve knew better than to fill his  recently released solo album with lengthy pronouncements from his unwieldy  stand-up bass. Instead, his low notes mostly just provide the solid support  that has marked Stuve's 13 years as a founding Flyer, while his singing and the  solid ensemble swinging of his assembled blues stars make his "Big Noise" album  live up to its title.  </P> <P> This Sunday, Stuve is going live with his Big Noise, performing at Crawford's  Nightclub in Lakewood with most of the album's artists, who compose a large  chunk of the local blues scene.  </P> <P> There'll be harpists James Harman and Johnny Dyer (Dyer doesn't appear on the  album), sax giant Lee Allen (a former Blaster and featured soloist with Little  Richard and Fats Domino), pianist Steve F'Dor, and fellow Flyers Alex Schultz  on guitar and Jimi Bott on drums. Rounding out the group are Jeff Turmes  (bassist with the Harman Band), Brett Wheeler on saxes and Eddie Reed on  guitar. (The album's Jr. Watson, a former Mighty Flyer and Canned Heat member,  has a conflicting gig on Sunday.)  </P> <P> The Mighty Flyers have been a staple on the Orange County blues scene for more  than a decade (they perform one of the final shows at the fading Sunset Pub  tonight; see story on F1). More recently, they've become a major festival  attraction in Europe. Two people not appearing on Stuve's album are Flyers lead  singer/harmonica player Rod Piazza and his keyboardist wife, Honey Alexander,  but that's not because of a falling out.  </P> <P> Rather, Stuve said, "I just thought if I got them on it, it would be too much  like a Flyers record, and I wanted to do some different things, like using  horns. There are only two or three songs with harmonica on the album."  </P> <P> The album boasts three Stuve compositions as well as a Stuve/Bott arrangement  of the title track, adapted from the Bob Crosby standard "Big Noise From  Winnetka." The other selections -- including tunes from Clarence (Gatemouth)  Brown, Muddy Waters, Otis Spann and rockabilly obscurity Lew Williams -- are  mostly songs Stuve has performed onstage with the Flyers but never recorded  with them.  </P> <P> Rather than creating a conflict with the Flyers, Stuve feels his solo outing  helps his relations with the group.  </P> <P> "What happens in bands, I've found, with a lot of cats is they're writing and  doing songs on the bandstand, but it's a different priority when the recording  comes along," Stuve said. "In this situation, it's Rod's band, and he's such a  monster on the harp that it's kind of tough to get my stuff out there (on the  Flyers' records). So instead of getting all negative and bummed out and  quitting the band or anything, I've got this optimistic outlet, which I think  has been a healthy thing for me and the band."  </P> <P> Stuve said the solo project is something he'd always wanted to do. "Then when  we were touring in Europe these companies said, 'Bill, if you ever record  anything we'd like to hear it.' So I said what the heck and booked some studio  time."  </P> <P> The "Big Noise" CD has been released only in Europe. Stuve hopes to make a  distribution deal with Rounder Records in the United States. In the meantime,  he is distributing the imports himself. "I'm doing like Colonel Parker in the  old days," he said, "taking them to the record stores and to the gigs." (The CD  can be found locally at the Music Market in Costa Mesa and Lamar's Records in  Long Beach.)  </P> <P> Stuve, 39, started in music as a youngster, providing drum accompaniment for  his piano-playing grandfather. "Then came the Stones and the Beatles, and I  said, 'Forget that!' and got a guitar. Then I found I was always showing bass  players their parts -- maybe it came easier because of my drum education. There  were always a lot of guitar players around, so I got a gig playing electric  bass, and from there went on to the stand-up."  </P> <P> He cites such influences as Willie Dixon, early Muddy Waters bassist Big  Crawford and Slam Stewart, and he says bass (which he calls "the big doghouse")  never gets boring for him.  </P> <P> "I think there's a lot you can do with it," he said. "People say, 'Oh, it's  just three chords,' but there's all these colorings, interactions between the  band members, and of course working with the audience. So I don't have a  problem with it."  </P> <P> The Flyers have a new album, called "Blues in the Dark," due in January on the  Rounder-distributed Blacktop label. They also have a new publicist and booking  agency.  </P> <P> "Hopefully we'll go to another plateau," Stuve said, "but I really can't  complain about our success. Everything I've wanted to do since I was a child  has come true.  </P> <P> "It's something just being able to play music and make a living doing it. And  we've been able to travel in Europe extensively where, boy, are they  appreciative of American music. Finland was our first stop ever outside the  U.S. It was the middle of winter, freezing cold, but the audience was amazing,  like something you'd imagine the early Stones and Beatles things were like.  They wouldn't stop clamoring.  </P> <P> "It's always a little frustrating because at home, the style of music we're  playing really doesn't get the acceptance you'd hope for. But I think now blues  seems to be making a little turnaround. And sometimes when you're touring  there's going to be the night-after-night drudgery, but overall, I think if you  can be happy 75% of the time up there on the bandstand, then that's better than  most other guys got."  </P> <P>  Bill Stuve's "Big Noise" performs Sunday at 8 p.m. at Crawford's Nightclub,  11529 Carson St. (west of the San Gabriel River Freeway), Lakewood. The Deep  Blue Sea band opens at 6 p.m. Admission: $2. Information: (213) 924-0446.  </P> <P> </P></p>

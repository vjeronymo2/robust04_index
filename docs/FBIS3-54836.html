After expressing his best wishes, he said the people  are coping well with the trials of the early years of transition  to market conditions. Although farmers have gathered in a fine  harvest, a difficult situation has taken shape in that sphere,  as well as in some others, owing to failure to pay. The  president is confident that all these hardships are temporary  and will be overcome through joint efforts. A policy which  regards social programs as a priority is being pursued in the  republic.    Talking about the relations with Russia, Tatarstan's  president said: "We are continuing consistent work aimed at  reaching various agreements, taking into account the  achievements made by Tatarstan on the civilized route toward  establishing its statehood." Such is the will of the people,  President Shaymiyev concluded.    Wishing his countrymen a happy new year, he told them to  strengthen links of blood and spirit between one another.</p>

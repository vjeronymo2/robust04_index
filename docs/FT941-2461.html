			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / People: Siew lands his plum job Richard Siew will be coming home - well, almost - in May when he takes up his new role as managing director of overseas operations at Hall Engineering (Holdings), the UK metal stockholding, steel products and automotive engineering group, writes Andrew Baxter. Siew, born in Kuala Lumpur and a Malaysian citizen, will be based down the road in Singapore for what will be a pivotal role developing Hall's Pacific Rim interests - destined to feature strongly in the future of the Shrewsbury-based group. A self-assured man who has risen quickly through the company's overseas businesses, Siew came to the UK in 1979 but has always had his sights set on a plum job in the Far East. He trained as an accountant, but did not want to become an auditor, so - attracted by the spread of the company's international operations - joined Hall in 1983 to get some industrial and management experience. After working in Saudi Arabia for four years, Siew moved to Malawi for Hall in what he calls a 'trouble- shooting assignment'. Three years of restructuring Press Steel &amp; Wire proved to be a prelude to a much tougher job in South Africa, where he arrived in 1990. Over the past four years as chief executive of Hall's interests in South Africa, Siew has 'downsized' a business which was close to financial collapse because of borrowing restrictions, got rid of loss-making operations, reduced the workforce from 1,000 to about 250 and repositioned it for the future. If things go well, Siew will have little trouble-shooting to do in his new role. Since he will be operating in his own backyard, he sees a unique opportunity to develop Hall's businesses in Asia, many of which are joint ventures with BHP of Australia. Siew will have a twin role of exploiting emerging markets, such as Vietnam, for Hall's more basic products, while pushing higher technology business opportunities, such as automotive engineering, elsewhere. China, where Hall has hardly scraped the surface so far, is a top priority. The Hall associate companies, which overall make the biggest contribution to Hall's profits, have been investing heavily in new equipment and manufacturing sites in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>

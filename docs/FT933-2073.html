			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Handle with care - A H Hermann on some pitfalls of foreign trade under the Vienna Convention The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods concluded in Vienna in 1980 - better known as the Vienna Convention - is the biggest success so far achieved by inter-governmental attempts at unification of commercial laws. The convention has been ratified or accepted by 34 countries and signed by an additional four (see box, right). The secretariat of the UN Commission for International Trade Law (Uncitral) hopes the number of countries incorporating the convention into their law on foreign trade will ultimately reach 50. Already its acceptance is wide, embracing most trading countries of importance, with the exception of Japan and the UK. The reach of the convention goes far beyond the ratifying countries. Almost all of them will apply the convention to all contracts governed by their law, even if the parties to the contract, or one of them, are based in a country which has not adopted the convention. China, Slovakia and the US will apply the convention only if both parties are in countries which adhere to it. The Nordic countries will not apply the convention to contracts where both parties are within their area, preferring to treat these as domestic contracts. In contrast with previous such international pacts, the convention applies automatically, without requiring the contracting parties to mention it in the contract. It is, no doubt, of great advantage to traders in countries which have no proper commercial laws of their own and it has been drafted with particular regard to the interests and requirements of developing countries. As an effective instrument of harmonisation and simplification of law the convention may also prove useful to traders in industrialised countries, but only if handled with care and awareness of its pitfalls. If the other party agrees, these can be avoided at a stroke of the pen, by putting in the contract a clause opting out of the convention. Where it is impossible or undesirable to opt out of the convention altogether, it is possible to overrule most of its undesirable provisions by means of explicit clauses of the contract - but to do that it is necessary to know the convention. There is, however, one article of the convention which cannot be overruled by agreement of parties to the contract. This is Art 12, which safeguards the position of those countries that made a declaration that they only recognise contracts, their modifications or termination, when these are made in writing. Such declarations were made by Argentina, Belarus, Chile, Hungary, Ukraine and the USSR (now the Russian Federation). These are some of the convention provisions which deserve particular attention - and possibly modification by the contract: Anticipation of breach: Art 71 of the Vienna Convention provides that a party may unilaterally suspend the performance of its obligations until provided with 'adequate assurance' if it 'becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations . . .' This leaves the supplier at the mercy of the buyer both in respect of what is 'apparent' and what is 'adequate'. Cure: Art 48 gives the seller the possibility of curing 'any failure to perform his obligations', even after the expiry of the time fixed for their performance, as long as he will not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience, expense and delay. The seller can also ask the buyer for extra time and go ahead with the late performance if no answer is received. Damages: The convention opens the door to unnecessary disputes, limiting, in Art 74, damages to levels which do 'not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen . . .' Force majeure: Art 79 protects the party impeded by force majeure against damages without providing for avoidance of the contract and, in the case of a temporary impediment, leaves the entire burden on the impeded party. Fundamental breach: Art 25 makes the contract voidable only if the substantial consequences of the breach were or could be foreseen by the person in breach. Interest: Art 78 makes interest on overdue debts obligatory but is silent on how to calculate it. Interpretation: Art 8(2) takes the intention of a party into account only so far as its expression would be understood by a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party. Ownership: The convention has no provisions on the passage of the title to the goods from the seller to the buyer. Passage of risk: Art 68 makes the buyer of goods in transit bear the risk only from the conclusion of the contract, rather than from the time the goods were handed to the first carrier. Price reduction: Art 50 allows the dissatisfied buyer to reduce the price unilaterally, without sufficient safeguards for the seller. Specific performance: The convention gives priority to a court ordering specific performance rather than awarding damages, even in a case where the aggrieved party could have been expected to make a substitute contract. Common law courts are not bound by this rule by virtue of Art 28. Stopping goods in transit: Art 71(2) allows the seller who suspects that the buyer became insolvent, to prevent the handing over of the goods dispatched earlier even if the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain them. This may cause problems if the goods were transferred by means of the document to a third party absolutely or as a surety. Substitute transaction: Art 76 provides that the current market price should be taken as at the time of the contract avoidance, rather than as at the time when the performance was due (as according to the UK's Sale of Goods Act).                             *      *      * VIENNA CONVENTION Convention ratified by and automatically applicable in: European Community: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain Efta and Scandinavia: Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland Ex-communist Europe: Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia North America: US, Canada (most provinces) Latin America: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico Middle East: Egypt, Iraq, Syria Far East: Australia, China Africa: Lesotho, Uganda, Zambia, Guinea Convention signed but not ratified by Poland, Singapore, Venezuela</p>

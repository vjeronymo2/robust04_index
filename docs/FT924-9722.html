			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Mixed styles from the BBCSO One tune that is not often heard in the nation's concert-halls is the theme of market forces. Earlier in the year the BBC apparently decided that audiences for its concerts at the Royal Festival Hall had dropped so low that something had to be done. The answer was to tempt people in with a new pricing policy, which sells all the seats unreserved at Pounds 9 or Pounds 4. The hall was still only about half full on Saturday, but at least the audience looked happy about getting the best seats. Given the strange clash of styles on the programme, the numbers attracted were, in fact, not bad. Last year the BBC Symphony Orchestra offered a nebulous piece by the Russian composer Korndorf and it has now followed that with a mirage of a symphony by a counterpart of his from Georgia, Giya Kancheli. A haze of nothing in particular hangs in the air. Kancheli (born 1935) puts much emphasis on achieving a vaguely religious atmosphere and little on musical argument. The main aim of his Symphony No 4, 'In Memoria di Michelangelo', here receiving its first UK performance, is to enter a cathedral-like structure of grand and spacious emptiness. There are a few noisy outbursts, which come from nowhere. Towards the middle harp and celesta tinkle out what sounds like a nursery rhyme, while a pair of solo violas later burble a rustic refrain. And that was all. Writing about the symphony is like trying to describe one of those works of art, which is no more than an empty canvas with a couple of doodles in the middle and random splashes of colour around the edge. The Viola Concerto by William Walton may not have the strongest personality of the composer's major works, but it seemed a more vivid portrait than ever before in this company. The mixture of brooding melancholy and unashamed romantic open-heartedness is very much Walton's own and the viola soloist, Tabea Zimmerman, summoned all the dark and sultry colours for which the music calls. Then Beethoven's Seventh Symphony banished any lingering vagueness. Alexander Lazarev holds a no-nonsense view of the symphony in which each movement becomes a distinct entity, leading from a lyrical opening movement to a excitingly ferocious finale. The BBC Symphony Orchestra had been carefully rehearsed to the extent that the slower music lacked spontaneity. But at the end audience cheered: it had had its money's worth.</p>

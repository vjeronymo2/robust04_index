			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INS CHIEF SEEKS BETTER VERIFICATION METHODS;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: A MUCH-DEBATED PHONE SYSTEM IN WHICH EMPLOYERS WOULD CHECK  DOCUMENTS LIKE THEY DO CREDIT CARDS IS ONE IDEA BEING CONSIDERED.  </P> <P> U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary said  Wednesday that he favors reforms -- perhaps even a telephone verification  system -- to close documentation loopholes that have allowed illegal immigrants  to continue to find jobs in the United States by using phony paper work.  </P> <P> Such new procedures, McNary said, could provide prospective employers with an  efficient means of verifying documents demonstrating a person's eligibility to  work in the United States, thus achieving two goals: reducing the job market  for illegal immigrants and cutting down on discrimination against  foreign-looking job-seekers.  </P> <P> "What we'd like to do is improve the verification system," he said during his  first official visit to the U. S.-Mexico border zone in San Diego.  </P> <P> However, McNary, speaking from atop the southern levee of the Tijuana River, a  major crossing area for the undocumented, said he is categorically opposed to  any effort to create a national identification card -- a document that is  anathema to civil libertarians and others who see it as an Orwellian intrusion  into individual privacy.  </P> <P> "I don't and never have" supported a national ID card, said McNary, apparently  reflecting the official position of the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Asked about alternate proposals, McNary said, "It might just take a phone  call."  </P> <P> He was referring to a projected telephone verification system -- similar to  that used for credit cards -- that would allow employers to dial a number and  quickly assess whether the paper work presented by a job applicant is forged or  authentic. It is among the most popular of the ideas for improving the methods  to root out the phony documents that are now in wide circulation.  </P> <P> McNary did not fully back the telephone verification procedure, but he  indicated that it is one alternative being seriously studied by authorities  seeking to reduce the job market for the undocumented. It was the only  alternative he mentioned during a news conference at the border, aside from a  $1-million advertising campaign aimed at encouraging employers not to hire  illegal aliens.  </P> <P> McNary's comments were the strongest to date on the telephone verification  concept, said Verne Jervis, the commissioner's chief spokesman.  </P> <P> However, a phone verification system is far from becoming reality, and many  questions remain about how it would be put in place and how effective it would  be. A central issue is whether such verifications would be mandatory for all  employers -- something that many consider unlikely because of the burden to the  employers and the expense of setting up such a system -- or whether employers  could simply use the system as an option.  </P> <P> Many observers have already said that such a system is doomed to failure,  particularly if it is a voluntary process dependent on the good faith of  employers who benefit from undocumented labor.  </P> <P> "It doesn't sound like a cure-all to me," said Kitty Calavita, assistant  professor of social ecology at University of California, Irvine, who has  conducted extensive studies on the relationship between employers and  immigrants. "For a vast number of employers in this area, it's just not in  their interest to check."  </P> <P> The document verification issue has been among the thorniest facing lawmakers  since Congress began debating the reform of immigration laws early in the  1980s. The debate intensified in 1986 with the passage of the Immigration  Reform and Control Act, which, for the first time, made it a federal crime for  employers to hire undocumented workers. However, the law established what many  consider an inadequate, cumbersome and loophole-ridden verification system that  officials concede has supercharged what was already a booming market for false  documents.  </P> <P> Several studies have shown that undocumented immigrants have managed to easily  bypass the requirements by showing forged identification documents to  prospective employers.  </P> <P> Most employers must now review a range of up to 17 documents -- from driver's  licenses to passports to visas -- to verify eligibility for jobs in the United  States. But there is a major loophole: Employers are not required to check the  authenticity of the submitted paper work, beyond a cursory inspection for  obvious forgery or other irregularities.  </P> <P> Last month, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, charged  that the process has led to "widespread discrimination" against legal  residents, particularly those who look foreign. Many employers are afraid to  hire such applicants, the study found.  </P> <P> A phone verification system, proponents say, would resolve matters quickly by  allowing employers to dial a toll-free number, punch in identification codes  and receive a timely answer about whether the documents submitted by the  applicant were real and current.  </P> <P> McNary, who has been the nation's top immigration officer since October, said  the technology should not be a problem, but others have questioned the  effectiveness of such a system. For one thing, a prospective employee may  present a document that is indeed a valid one, but that could belong to someone  else. Many undocumented job-seekers borrow legitimate documents or purchase  them on the black market, studies have shown.  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Management: Lies, damn lies and directors' salaries British company directors are a greedy and selfish lot. In the depths of recession they are just as thoughtless as when times are good: they increase their own pay far faster than that of their managers and other employees, writes Christopher Lorenz. Such has been the impression created by this week's media coverage of the British Institute of Management's 1992 salary survey. This showed that the directors of large companies received average earnings rises of 9.3 per cent in the year to January 1, with salary rises of only 6.4 per cent for managers in all size of company, and 8 per cent for UK employees as a whole. The BIM's bombastic new director general, Roger Young, added to the mood of general outrage by warning directors of large companies that they should be seen to be tightening their belts. He declared that 'if they continue to reward themselves far more than their employees, they will have to answer for it' in the form of higher taxes. Young was quite right. He should have been even tougher, pointing out that such directors are worsening the 'them and us' gulf in their companies. They are also acting in flagrant contravention of the ambitious employee motivation and 'empowerment' programmes which almost all have launched. As so often with statistical surveys, things are not as simple as they seem. Precisely the same data could have prompted the BIM to congratulate the vast majority of UK directors on setting an ideal example: taking either outright cuts in earnings, or much smaller rises than their managers and other employees. It's not quite a matter of lies, damn lies, and statistics. It's more a question of which category of data you choose to focus upon. For one thing, virtually no newspaper chose to report the BIM's findings that directors of companies with sales of under Pounds 600m - who constitute the vast majority of the UK director population - took rises of between 2.1 and 4.6 per cent. The overall rise for all directors, including the big boys, was only 3.3 per cent. For another, the Institute's regional analysis (of all company sizes) showed that in only East Anglia and the north did directors take markedly higher rises in earnings than their managers. In London, the south-west and Wales, and even Scotland, directors took far less than their subordinates - ranging from a fall of 3.2 per cent in the south west and Wales, through no increase whatever in inner London, to only 5 per cent in Scotland. For managers, the respective regional rises were 4.5 per cent, 3.8 per cent, and 9.7 per cent. None of this lessens Young's point that the big boys are both grasping and foolish. If they cannot take themselves in hand, others will have to do it for them - shareholders, non-executive directors, and, in the last resort, the government.</p>

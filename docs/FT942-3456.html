			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / 'Scandalous' state of Gulf war tanks attacked by defence MPs It was 'scandalous' that three-quarters of the British army's main battle tanks in Germany were under repair when the Gulf war broke out, the House of Commons Defence Committee said yesterday. Britain should also think twice before buying foreign weapons because it cannot trust other countries to provide support in times of crisis, the committee said in a report on the lessons of the Gulf war. The Ministry of Defence, which is preparing several big procurement decisions and a plan to make deep cuts in spending on support services promised to study the report carefully. The committee commended UK industry for its emergency operation to upgrade the battle-readiness of forces rushed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the crisis found the UK ill-prepared to face chemical and germ warfare attacks, while more than 75 per cent of the army's Challenger tanks in Germany were out of service. 'We are disturbed that the UK was not as ready to protect its forces against chemical and biological attack as it might have been,' the report said. Some deficiencies had been rectified when hostilities began in January 1991, but in future the forces might not have so long to prepare. The committee deplored the condition of the Challenger-1 tanks which were rushed to Kuwait from Germany. It described the tank's turret as 'barely adequate' and said: 'We consider it scandalous that the Challenger-1 tank fleet was in such a poor state.' A spokesman for Vickers, the tank's manufacturer, said the Challenger-1 did perform well when properly maintained, and it would soon be superseded by the superior Challenger-2. The report warns against running down the UK defence sector and said strategic factors should be taken into account in procurement. The government will make announcements soon on plans to buy frigates, minesweepers and transport aircraft. The committee said: 'We believe it would be unwise to rely entirely on even our closest allies to provide surge capacity as they have their own priorities and may wish to supply their own national forces first.' It said some support roles, including the overhaul of vehicles, could be farmed out to private companies but the army must maintain some in-house capacity. A British Aerospace spokesman said UK companies could do vital work at the war front which would be harder if foreign systems were procured.</p>

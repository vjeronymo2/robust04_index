Detailing the American policy, Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant  secretary of state for South Asian affairs, said that of the  $330 million in assistance sought by the U.S. Government from  the Congress for the assistance program in South Asia, $112  million is earmarked for Bangladesh, $155 million for India, $28  million for Nepal, and $35 million for Sri Lanka. No fund has  been allocated to Pakistan and Afghanistan.    That the dreadful civil war in Afghanistan is posing a  problem to providing assistance to that country is  understandable to a certain extent. But Pakistan is being  subjected to this biased treatment by the United States for the  sole reason that it is not prepared to roll back its nuclear  program. Now the United States is exerting pressure to roll  back the program rather than halting or freezing it. This  American tendency has been construed by India as an appreciation  for the production of its nuclear weapons. After noting that the  United States exempts India from all such activities and after  discerning the American designs toward Pakistan, now there  exists no scope for optimism. The United States also does not  want a developing Muslim country to attain capability in  sophisticated nuclear technology, and if this occurs the U.S.  wants to deprive it by tormenting it through various sanctions.  The announcement to grant maximum assistance to India despite  its gross human rights violations and the manufacture of nuclear  weapons as well as the plan to keep Pakistan out of the  assistance program until 1995 warrants us to revise our domestic  and foreign policies and set fresh priorities. The government  also should clearly understand that the United States will not  be content with this and will take steps to cripple Pakistan  economically and to further torment it by joining hands with its  Western allies. Therefore, in view of this situation, the  government should think about taking steps to make the entire  nation demonstrate total harmony and perfect coordination to  safeguard its interests and protect its independence,  sovereignty, and resources. This is possible only through total  solidarity among the people, and in a broader sense, through  full coordination of thought between the government and the  opposition to deal with the situation because it is not a matter  concerning any particular political party or the government, but  it concerns the entire country and the people.</p>

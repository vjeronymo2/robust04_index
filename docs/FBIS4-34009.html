			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Emilio Crespo] </F>   [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia,) 14 Jun (EFE) --  At the inauguration of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit today,  the leaders of 21 countries agreed that development must be  humanized and integration and free trade promoted. [passage  omitted]    In accordance to the general theme of the conference,  dedicated to development and integration, the heads of state  asserted the need to achieve economic growth without leaving the  people's social needs to one side.    In one of the few speeches that conformed to the time limit  assigned to each leader, Spanish King Juan Carlos also advocated  the need to strengthen social development and respect for human  rights. [passage omitted]    Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez called on his  colleagues to admit with "courage" that the adjustment policies  had not solved the unequal distribution of wealth or the  unemployment problem. However, like several of his colleagues,  such as Argentine Carlos Menem or Panamanian Guillermo Endara,  the Spanish socialist mentioned with optimism the democratic and  economic achievements made by the Ibero-American countries since  the Salvador de Bahia (Brazil) conference a year ago.    As had been done by Endara and Menem, Guatemalan President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Ecuadoran Sixto Duran-Ballen  highlighted the advances made by their respective  administrations in the economic and political spheres. In  addition, De Leon Carpio promised, despite the difficulties that  have arisen, he would do everything possible to continue the  peace negotiations with the guerrillas as scheduled and reach an  agreement before the end of the year. The Guatemalan guerrillas  comprise the last such organization still active in Central  America.    Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori, the latter with much more vehemence  and thoroughness, defended the countries' right to their  institutional peculiarities. The Andean head of state, who was  strongly criticized by his colleague two years ago when he took  on extraordinary powers and suspended the parliament and the  Supreme Court, said political systems cannot be called good or  bad and must be graded based upon their results and without any  foreign interference.    Chilean Eduardo Frei and Paraguayan Juan Carlos Wasmosy,  who,  as with five other presidents elected recent months, attended an  Ibero-American summit for the first time, called for the  promotion of free commerce and integration, which the Andean  leader leaned toward "open regionalism."    The newest president was Salvadoran Armando Calderon Sol,  who  assumed the post less than two weeks ago. He, together with  several of his Central American colleagues, defended the  position that development should not be limited to the  liberalization of commerce.    Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Jose Maria Figueres of  Costa Rica underscored the advances made by Central America in  regard to integration, peace, and the consolidation of  democracy. They also presented a regional model for a "feasible  development" [desarrollo sostenible] based on social needs and  respect for ecology.    Several presidents, such as Caldera, mentioned Spain and  Portugal and asked that they become spokesmen for Latin America  in Europe.    Uruguayan Luis Alberto Lacalle, however, noted the  difference  of interests between the Ibero-American countries and the  summit's host, Cesar Gaviria, asked for a policy to attract  investment to the region and expressed his hope that America  will become a single commercial bloc.</p>

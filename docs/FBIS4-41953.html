			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian International Center of Scientific and  Technical Information believes that the restructuring and  conversion of the Russian defense industry will require between  $150 billion and $300 billion.    This estimate was made by a leading figure at the center  Vladimir Zhukov at a current Moscow seminar on Western  investments in the Russian defense industry. He said it is  based on consultations with Western exerts.    Representatives of companies and analytical centers said  that  the existing plans of attracting investments from Russian  commercial banks and for formation of a special export-import  bank cannot guarantee the volume of investments needed to  restructure the defense industry.    According to Zhukov, in conditions of galloping inflation,  mutual debts, and low turnover as many as half of all defense  plants are on the verge of ruin and the number of jobless in the  industry might grow to several million by the end of the year.    The conversion program affects almost 80 percent of the  industry: in the Soviet Union military spending amounted to 30  percent of the GNP.</p>

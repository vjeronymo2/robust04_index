			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4.93m write-off checks St Ives - Losses on disposal of non-core businesses keep outcome flat at Pounds 22m Exceptional losses on the disposal of discontinued businesses held back full-year pre-tax profits at St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer. Although there was a marked improvement at the operating level. the pre-tax line for the 52 weeks to July 29 was flat at Pounds 22.3m, compared with Pounds 22.1m last time, on turnover ahead 7.1 per cent at Pounds 237m (Pounds 221m). Earnings per share slipped from 15.15p to 13.48p. To reflect the improved underlying performance, however, an increased final dividend of 4.5p is proposed, making a total of 6.4p (5.5p). The shares closed 10p higher at 325p. The pre-tax outcome was struck after first-half exceptional costs of Pounds 4.93m - representing goodwill previously written off to reserves - on the disposal of two non-core businesses, Talbot Publishing Systems in December and Nelson Packaging in March. Excluding the exceptional items, pre-tax profits increased 23 per cent to Pounds 27.2m and earnings per share grew 22 per cent to 18.46p. Operating profits increased 25 per cent to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 21m), while net interest receipts fell to Pounds 908,000 from Pounds 1.04m. Mr Miles Emley, chairman, described the results as 'somewhere between not bad and quite good'. He said they reflected an improvement in some of the group's markets, particularly UK magazines, which benefited from increased paginations, and a turnround in the US magazine business. However, conditions in the UK books market remained unsettled, particularly as a result of destocking by the large retail chains towards the end of the period. Even so, St Ives maintained or improved its market share in UK general and hardback books and increased international sales of bibles. The financial printing business was buoyant until the last two months of the year, reflecting the high level of domestic and overseas new issues. The direct mail printing business and compact disc packaging both made gains. The group ended the period with net cash of more than Pounds 36m. It plans to invest Pounds 47m in plant and equipment in the next 18 months, adding about 15 per cent to capacity. COMMENT St Ives' underlying results were somewhat ahead of expectations. Capacity utilisation in the UK print plants is back above 80 per cent, and overall pre-tax margins have increased from 10.3 to 11.7 per cent - well below the peak of 15 per cent, implying further progress is possible. Meanwhile, the hefty capital expenditure programme should help keep profits moving ahead. The pre-tax figure should reach about Pounds 31m this year, producing earnings of about 21p. The shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 15.5, which looks reasonable for a quality printer.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Failure of Taurus blamed on lack of City leadership THE TAURUS fiasco has revealed a lack of leadership for the sort of large infrastructure projects which affect the future of the City, according to Mr Peter Rawlins, the former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. Speaking publicly for the first time since his resignation from the exchange last week, Mr Rawlins warned: 'There is a real City management problem here. It could happen again, and it will happen again unless we change our approach.' He refused to comment on the history of the paperless settlement project, which was scrapped last week after a series of technical problems, but said: 'I took responsibility as chief executive for the stock exchange's failure. But to characterise it simply as a stock exchange failure, or as a failure just of the technology, is to miss the point.' His words were echoed by other senior executives in the City who had been involved in the project. Mr Patrick Mitford-Slade, chairman of the Siscot committee, which designed Taurus, said: 'With hindsight, we were trying to satisfy too many interests. It needed leadership from the Bank (of England).' A member of the City monitoring group set up to oversee the Taurus project said: 'I don't think anyone understood the whole project. There was no single sponsor.' Bank of England officials have also acknowledged the difficulty of promoting significant changes to the way financial markets operate which may be for the good of the City as a whole but which damage some interests in it. The Bank has stepped forward to take over the search for a successor to Taurus, after exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith approached Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Bank of England governor.

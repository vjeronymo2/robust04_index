			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slaughterhouse strike continues TRADE UNION and employer representatives resumed talks here yesterday to find a solution to a 19-day strike by 16,000 abattoir workers, which has paralysed the pigmeat export industry. The strikers were expected to return to work this week, but they rejected a mediation agreement by a large majority in a membership ballot. The conflict is primarily over working hours and the organisation of the working week, not pay.</p>

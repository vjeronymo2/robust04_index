			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER PROPOSITION 128  </P> <P> The time has come to control all harmful toxins, stop pollution and prevent any  further destruction of the environment. If severe and rigid legal methods are  required through the passage of Prop. 128, then so be it.  </P> <P> Big business profits will go down, although the salaries of company presidents  and their executives will assuredly not. Instead of restructuring to be  environmentally safe and, in the long run saving jobs and lives, big  corporations are pumping money into advertising against Big Green.  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian, (gubernatorial candidate) Sen. Pete Wilson and large  corporations have had their chance to protect the environment and the health of  all of us. They have done next to nothing.  </P> <P> Are lives more important, or business?  </P> <P> DEAN H. du VERNET  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

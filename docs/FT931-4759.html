			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Technician who put his company centre stage: Haig Simonian profiles the man with a love for risks MR Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of Italy's Eni state energy and chemicals concern, has the look of a man more at home on an oil rig than in the office. However, it would be wrong to portray him merely as a burly technician. Under his chairmanship Eni has pursued a high-profile sponsorship of Milan's famous La Scala opera house. He regularly attends the opera's glitzy 'prima' each December. Mr Cagliari, 62, is also a keen supporter of the Aspen Institute's Italian branch, which organises regular conferences on environmental issues, particularly related to energy and the Mediterranean. An industrial engineering graduate of Milan's prestigious polytechnic, he joined Eni in 1955, starting at the Houston, Texas, office of its Anic subsidiary. He stayed with the group, then beginning its long challenge to the international oil industry's dominant 'seven sisters', for the next 11 years. The period took him from the US back to Italy, where he moved to Eni's Snamprogetti plant engineering subsidiary. After a spell at Eurotecnica, an energy-related engineering group, Mr Cagliari returned to Eni in 1981. Two years later he joined the group's managing board, where he concentrated on the tormented restructuring of Italy's chemicals sector. In 1989 he succeeded as chairman Mr Franco Reviglio, the socialist university professor who is now minister of finance. The choice of Mr Cagliari was in many ways obvious. Apart from his technical background, he was one of relatively few senior Italian executives to have had wide-ranging job experience abroad. He speaks good, if not perfect, English. Perhaps as important, he bore the right political stamp, having been closely associated with the Socialist party, which has dominated Eni since its creation. Recently, his political credentials have brought Mr Cagliari under media scrutiny. Links have been traced between private family businesses and those of Mr Silvano Larini, the playboy Socialist architect closely associated with Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist party leader, who gave himself up to Milan magistrates. His arrest, and that of Mr Franco Ciatti, the chairman of Eni's Nuovo Pignone subsidiary, is based entirely on his public business role rather than any private activities. Both men have been held on allegations of corruption and illegal political funding in relation to Nuovo Pignone's contracts to supply gas turbines to the Enel state electricity authority. Nuovo Pignone, one of the prime candidates on the government's privatisation list, is Italy's leading producer of gas turbines, compressors and other high-technology engineering equipment. It is a leading supplier to Enel, which has been concentrating on natural gas as an alternative energy source since Italy decided to close down its nuclear power programme in the late 1980s. Gas had been taking an increasing role in national energy policy even before the first oil price shock of 1973. Although traditionally specialised in lower-capacity machines - a spin-off from its expertise in compressors - Nuovo Pignone also produces the high-powered turbines used in big power stations under licence from General Electric of the US. It is this activity for Enel which has now put Mr Cagliari and Mr Ciatti behind bars.</p>

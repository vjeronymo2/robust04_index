			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Aid plan for Harris Tweed launched A Pounds 10M PLAN to revitalise the ailing Harris Tweed industry in the Western Isles was launched yesterday. If successful it will safeguard 400 jobs for weavers in Lewis and Harris. As part of the plan, weavers will be asked to switch to new looms which produce a cloth 150cm wide. Mr Derick Murray, a Lewis producer, said: 'All our research shows the requirement of the international market is 150cm. Our present 75cm width is just not favoured by clothing manufacturers.' The new looms could cost each weaver about Pounds 4,000 - 30 per cent of the total cost. The rest will be funded through the package on offer from Western Isles Enterprise and the European Community. Other elements of the Harris Tweed strategy are a Pounds 2m investment in Stornoway's tweed finishing mills and a further Pounds 2m to be used on promotion and marketing. Highlands and Islands Enterprise expects to invest Pounds 3.8m, with the mills and weavers putting up Pounds 4.25m. The rest of the Pounds 10m is expected to come from further grants. Earlier this week the Harris Tweed Authority was established to promote and protect the industry.</p>

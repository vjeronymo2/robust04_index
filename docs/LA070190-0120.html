			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN OUR OWN IMAGE THE COMING REVOLUTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY BY  FRED RITCHLIN (APERTURE: $15.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> A timely collection of essays on how computer technology is being used to alter  the "real" images in still photographs, motion pictures and videotape. A former  director of photography for the New York Times Magazine, Fred Ritchlin argues  that despite its apparent simplicity, photography consitutes "a rich and  variegated language, capable . . . of subtlety, ambiguity, revelation, and  distortion."  </P> <P> Increasingly sophisticated computer graphics systems are giving editors the  ability to tamper with photographs in ways that suggest alternate realities: In  1982, National Geographic repositioned the pyramids at Giza to fit their cover.  This rapidly spreading technology may soon allow people to present "records" of  events that never occurred. "In Our Own Image" should be read by anyone  concerned with how governments and the news media can manipulate information  that people accept as truth.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TRADITION' AND THE WORKING WOMAN  </P> <P> Equal to the subtle-yet-unmistakable slam against women in the Good  Housekeeping ad is the slam against the international community. Not only is  the center of the world one's own home, but those English-speaking and  (probably) all-white Girl Scouts are more important than the UNICEF cards (and,  I presume, the attendant issues of health care, hunger and shelter for those in  need). If this is neo-traditional, then I'm for the Revolution.  </P> <P> KELLY RUSSELL-BURTON  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

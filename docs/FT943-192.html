			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: IFC record shows that it still has a role Sir, Your leader, 'Frontier finance' (September 21), questions whether the International Finance Corporation (IFC) still has a useful role to play in promoting private sector development. Based on our record performance during the 1994 financial year - almost Dollars 2.5bn approved for 231 projects in 65 countries - this question is, to say the least, rather surprising. In fact, IFC's rapid growth over the past few years demonstrates that our role, far from being undermined, is broader than ever. IFC welcomes the increase in private investment into developing countries, where we have been building local capital markets for 25 years. To cite just one example, IFC introduced the country fund as an investment vehicle. We like to think we helped develop today's emerging market industry. Even in countries that have access to the international capital markets, IFC can play a very important role. For example, we invest directly in the second-tier companies that typically have difficulty raising long-term finance, and provide credit lines to local financial institutions for lending on to small- and medium-sized companies. Moreover, despite the current interest in emerging markets, more than 75 per cent of foreign direct investment in developing countries remains concentrated in only 10 nations. In the many developing countries that are still unable to attract substantial foreign capital, IFC plays a vital role as a 'gateway' for the private investment crucial to fledgling private sectors. More than half our projects involve international commercial lenders for which IFC's presence is a critical factor in their decision to lend. IFC has been investing in developing countries since 1956. While we cannot claim all of the credit for the good things that have happened in the developing world in recent years, we do feel that we have made some significant contributions. We are in it for the long haul, and look forward to working with governments and investors in continuing to promote investment in the developing world. By the way, we were flattered by your reference to IFC as the Starship Enterprise of the developing world. We think Captain Kirk would agree that it is not yet time to mothball the Enterprise.

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Greece in new Gazprom deal Greece has signed a revised agreement with Gazprom, the Russian state gas supplier, to import natural gas from 1996 through a pipeline from Bulgaria. The new accord also provides for Prometheus, a joint venture between Gazprom of Russia and Greece's Kopelouzos group, to build a 400MW coal-fired power station in northern Greece as a turnkey project for DEH, Greece's state power company, and supply equipment for two hydro-electric plants under construction in central Greece. Under the previous agreement, Prometheus was to build a 250MW gas-fired power station in north-eastern Greece on a build-own-operate basis. However, the socialist government has abandoned plans for private power generation in Greece. Gazprom is to supply at least 500m cubic metres of gas yearly through a 550km pipeline from the Bulgarian border to Athens. The pipeline, financed mainly by the European Union will be completed early next year at a cost of Dollars 1.4bn. But construction of gas distribution networks to serve Athens and four other Greek cities has been delayed by administrative and financial problems.</p>

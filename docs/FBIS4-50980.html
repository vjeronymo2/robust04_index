			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Foreign Firms Benefit From New Tax Regime"] </F>   [Text] The new taxation system is creating an equitable  payment environment for both domestic and foreign firms, said a  senior tax official.    This year, the sweeping changes of tax policy in China will  not end tax exemptions for foreign-funded productive enterprises  in their initial two years of profitable operation, said Dong  Shukui, deputy director of the overseas-related tax bureau under  the State Administration of Taxation.    He added that the newly introduced value-added, consumption  and operational taxes have equalized the government's tax levies  on both Chinese and foreign enterprises.    Dong reiterated that the valued added tax (VAT) has more  advantages compared with the old turnover tax, known as the  consolidated industrial and commercial tax (CICT), which was  applied to most foreign businesses before this year.    The new VAT regime provides a channel for businessmen to  claim refunds of VAT assessed on certain goods, mainly raw  materials.    This could help reduce the production costs of foreign  businesses in China.    Exporters might also benefit from the new regime for the  same  reason.    They are now entitled to claim a monthly VAT refund from  Chinese authorities, representing the VAT incurred on the  acquisition of VAT-recoverable goods and services.    Foreign businesses engaged in industries, where the  proportion of VAT-recoverable purchases as a percentage of  turnover is high and where the new VAT rate is lower than the  old CICT rate, may also benefit from the new regime.    However, China's tax collecting officials admitted that the  new tax reforms have caused confusion and other problems.    The current high retail price level, which stood at more  than  20 per cent during the first quarter, was partly due to the  misunderstanding by many taxpayers on the new tax system.    They also failed to know the regulations on issuing special  receipts for VAT and "blindly" raised their products' prices.    To cope with this situation, the government's tax collectors  pledged to take prompt measures to ensure their smooth  implementation, including sending working teams to grass-roots  areas to enforce the new laws and the collection of State  revenue.    Dong said a patient introduction of the country's new tax  system to foreign businesses is especially crucial to the  country's opening drive as well as the economic reform.    The reformed taxation system now specifies 11 items of tax  collection on foreign-invested firms and overseas businessmen in  China.    They involve industrial production, consumption, business  operation, institutional and individual income, natural  resources and land utilization, real estate, stamps, automobile  and ships, and animal slaughter.    This year, some provinces and municipalities have also cut  down their money collection on 21 categories of products  manufactured by foreign-invested factories, Dong noted.    These products are mostly computers, TV sets, refrigerators,  tape recorders, drinks, cigarettes, air-conditioners and a  cluster of chemical goods.</p>

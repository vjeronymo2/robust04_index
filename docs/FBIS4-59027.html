			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Hoseyn Sheykholeslam, deputy foreign </F> minister in charge of African-Arab Affairs, by unidentified  correspondent -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr.  Sheykholeslam, we know the administrative agreement for the  Gaza-Jericho plan was signed in Cairo yesterday. What was the  PLO's and Tel Aviv's aim in signing this agreement?    [Sheykholeslam] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful, greetings to dear viewers. As you might know, the  issue of Gaza and its transfer to Egypt has been under review  for some time in Israeli circles. As reported in the press, the  management of this part of Palestine had become a serious  problem for the Israelis due to an intense and extensive  revolutionary movement, or what we know today as intifadah.  Intifadah consists of methods that we had in our own  revolution; that is, people coming into the streets with bare  hands and there taking whatever they can. Everyone--small  children and old men--wanted the Israelis to leave them alone  and to get out of their country. One faction in Israel believed  that they should let go of the area and get out no matter what.    Mr. Rabin, Mr. Peres, and other statesmen believed that they  should save something from the spoiled oil, and Mr. 'Arafat was  after getting whatever they would give him at any cost. So they  reached this agreement. In reality, Israelis aim to control  intifadah through the Palestinians themselves. Unfortunately,  Mr. 'Arafat has a poor record in the war between Palestinians.  On various occasions, he has suppressed Palestinians for  political and personal interests--including in Lebanon, where we  were a witness.    The main danger facing the situation is that, God forbid,  Palestinian police trained by Britain and other western  countries should stand face to face against the Palestinian  nation and take the place of the Israeli police, which is  presently the main instrument of suppression, and that the war  becomes one among Palestinians. This has to be avoided whatever  way possible.    [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, you spoke about the  intifadah before. What is the reason for the intifadah to  oppose the accord?    [Sheykholeslam] As you know, Jericho and Gaza is a very  small  part of the land of Palestine. The greater part of the land of  Palestine has remained in the possession of the Israelis. It is  the right of the Palestinian nation to oppose the accord and to  fight for the liberation of its land. More importantly, 'Arafat  has given the Israelis a guarantee of security and has  considered the control of the Palestinians as one of his duties.  However, despite that, the Israelis have, nevertheless,  guaranteed the unjust right to enter that same confined area  that was put at the disposal of Mr. 'Arafat for self-rule any  time they wish. In fact, he becomes a mayor of that area.  Whenever--this is categorically stated in the accord--whenever  they consider it necessary to enter the area for their security,  they will do so. In fact, the Palestinian nation has not  achieved anything. Moreover, they seek to divest it of its main  right, which is fighting for the liberation of its lands.    That is why the intifadah does not accept the accord. The  number of those who do not accept the accord is far larger than  the number of those who accept it. I venture to say that if  there were to be a referendum or a similar plebiscite, the  accord will undoubtedly fail to gain any votes. Undoubtedly,  those supporting the accord will be in the minority. The  movement is still continuing, either by the Palestinians inside  or those outside.    [Correspondent] We see that the United States and Egypt  especially, among the Arab states, are mostly seeking to  internationalize the issue. They invite various states to gather  in Cairo, as well as movies and satellite films, etc. Is all  that for the same reason? Is it all for raising the issue and  establishing the issue, or are there other reasons for it?    [Sheykholeslam] In fact, since the weakness of the accord at  its heart is obvious to the Arab states, they are trying to get  it accepted by the Arab nation through much propaganda and hue  and cry. Despite all the invitations extended by the Egyptian  Government to the foreign ministers of various states, there was  not good participation. Foreign ministers of principal states,  such as Lebanon and Syria, were not present.    There is no doubt that the weakness of the accord was  evident  both in the minds of the Americans and the Israelis. That was  even evident yesterday at the scene of the signing of the  accord, as it was being shown in the news bulletin. I was  watching the Egyptian television's live broadcast. 'Arafat  hesitated in signing some sections and demonstrated that even he  did not wish to accept the accord. Then, as a result of the  dominating pressure of the leaders of states there,  unfortunately, he eventually signed. It is regrettable that the  fate of the Palestinian nation was exchanged for the sake of  several presidents and foreign ministers.    In any case, the Americans and some other big countries want  no one to oppose the accord. That, in itself, is evidence to  the weakness of the accord. It is clear that opposition can  damage it.    [Correspondent] Considering the role of Arab countries,  perhaps we can divide them into two groups--the countries that  do not share borders with occupied Palestine, and those who are  next to it such as Syria and Jordan. How do you see the role of  each of those countries?    [Sheykholeslam] Some of those countries, like Syria, adopted  a better stance from the beginning. Syria is calling for  Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan, which has been  occupied by Israel. I should mention that Syria has resisted  well despite various pressure exerted by some Arab and large  countries like America, and sometimes Russia, and has not given  up its fundamental stances. Christopher brought various plans  during his recent visit, and the Syrian reaction so far does not  indicate that the Syrians have accepted Christopher's plans.  Those plans are about Israel's withdrawal from three villages.    Lebanon has adopted a very good stance so far. Their stances  have been in coordination with those of the Syrians. [passage  omitted]    Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, tried to see  that the accord developed in a way that did not harm it.  [passage omitted]    Egypt is left, which is obvious. Unfortunately, a wrong step  was taken by Anwar Sadat, and Egypt has left the camp of  struggle against Israel since then.    On the whole, the stances of the countries who live next to  Palestine are, unfortunately, not very solid, and they accept  the presence of Israel due to their need or dependency on the  United States. That is a great danger that threatens the Arab  world in the future.    [Correspondent] If you allow me, I would like to raise my  final question. Please tell us about the Islamic Republic of  Iran's position with respect to the recent accord?    [Sheykholeslam] The position of the Islamic Republic of Iran  has been clear from the beginning. Since before the revolution  in Iran, his eminence the imam believed that Israel should be  destroyed. It is an illegitimate creation that has been imposed  on the region. [passage omitted]    Naturally, the Islamic Republic of Iran supports all  oppressed nations and their struggles--such as the Bosnians. It  also supports the struggle of the Palestinian nation,  particularly since the Muslims' first Qiblah, the Holy Quds, is  there. The accord has no grounds whatsoever, and one of the  main slogans that says Quds must be the capital of Palestine has  been ignored. Only a request has been made by Mr. 'Arafat in  his speech that the holy place should remain open to Muslim  pilgrims.    It is said that the Israelis have not even mentioned the  holy  places by their real Islamic names in the maps that they have  prepared, which is regrettable. The accord offers nothing but  abjectness. Fortunately, the Palestinian nation is on the  scene, resists, and continues to roar for its rights.    We condemn the accord and support the Muslim nation of  Palestine and their struggle.    [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, thank you for coming to  our studio.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Japanese veterans of World War II reportedly will be among the remnants of  the Communist Party of Malaya who will surrender to Thai forces in the next two  months, military officials said in Bangkok. An army officer involved in the  surrender procedure confirmed a report that 15 Japanese war veterans had joined  the party in 1948 and that two -- both now in their 70s -- had survived 40  years in the jungle. The party waged a guerrilla war against Japanese troops in  Malaysia, then fought against the British after the war ended. Their forces  were eventually defeated, but a few thousand fled to the Thai-Malaysian border  area, where they have continued to harass both governments for almost four  decades.  </P></p>

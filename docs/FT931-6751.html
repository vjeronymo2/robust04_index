			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on GDP figures THE DOLLAR checked its recent fall against the D-Mark yesterday following the strong upward revision for US fourth quarter GDP that the market had been expecting, writes James Blitz. The annualised 4.8 per cent rise in GDP in the last 3 months of 1992, against an original estimate of 3.1 per cent, helped the dollar to peak at DM1.6470 in the early afternoon in Europe. However, dealers appeared to be following the old adage 'buy on the rumour and sell on the facts', and the US currency later slipped to a close of DM1.6415, a net 0.7 pfennigs up on the day. The dollar's rise was also helped by a growing feeling that the Bundesbank may ease monetary policy again at its council meeting next Thursday. Dealers appeared to think that there would no cut in Germany's officially posted rates. However, a softening of the rate at which the Bundesbank provides wholesale funds to commercial banks was deemed more likely. The German banking union's decision to settle on a 3.3 per cent wage rise for its 430,000 workers was one reason for the optimism on German rate cuts. Following the public sector unions' decision to keep wage rises to 3.0 per cent, the chances of inflation being contained within ranges that the Bundesbank would find acceptable is now seen to be more likely. Another factor signalling a near-term cut in rates was the recent call from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, for urgent action to conclude the drawn-out solidarity pact negotiations in Bonn between the government, the federal states and the opposition. One dealer interpreted this call as a sign that the Bundesbank wants to ease monetary policy as quickly as possible. The dollar was underpinned against the yen by a growing belief that there will be no accord by the G7 finance ministers meeting in London today to maintain a strong yen against the dollar. An announcement that there will be no formal communique following the meeting reinforced this view. The Japanese authorities are concerned that a strong yen will restrict their exports during a period of acute economic weakness in their country. The dollar closed at Y118.00 from a previous Y117.50. Prospects of an easing in German rates again helped to reduce tensions in the exchange rate mechanism yesterday. The Spanish central bank again intervened in the markets. The peseta closed at Pta71.69 against the D-Mark from a previous close of Pta71.93.</p>

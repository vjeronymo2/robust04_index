			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Voteless recovery Scare stories of a 'jobless recovery' in the US were just that, merely a scare. US secretary of labour, Robert Reich, visiting the UK this week, even boasted that 'in the 16 months the Clinton administration has been in Washington, the American economy has added more than 3m new jobs in private industry'. Such have been the benefits of winning an election at an ideal point in the economic cycle. But this does not necessarily bring political rewards, as the British prime minister must now know. He gained re-election precisely when the British recession hit bottom. But for the Conservatives, this has been a voteless recovery. Just how voteless was demonstrated by the by-elections on Thursday. In Eastleigh, for example, a Conservative majority of 17,702 over the Liberal Democrats at the 1992 general election was turned into a Liberal Democrat majority of 9,239 over Labour, with the Conservatives in third place. The European parliamentary election results, due late tomorrow night, may reveal a massacre. Mr Major must count himself fortunate that the Labour party is just starting a leadership campaign of its own. A question that must plague the government is whether the recovery will ever give it the political benefits it longs for. It has not done so yet, even though it is well-established. The turn-around in the level of gross domestic product occurred between the first and second quarters of 1992, with GDP growth amounting to 1.4 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1993, followed by another 2.6 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1994. The most important economic data out this week, those for industrial output in April, confirm this picture of an increasingly strong recovery, notwithstanding the tax increases that came into effect subsequent to last November's budget and in April. Total seasonally adjusted output in the three months to April was up 1 per cent on the previous three months, with manufactured output up 1.2 per cent. Hedged endorsement This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development added its mite, by providing a carefully hedged endorsement of central planks of Conservative policy towards the labour market, and by raising its forecasts for economic growth. The secretariat now expects the economies of OECD member countries to grow by 2.6 per cent this year (up half a percentage point on last December's forecast), followed by 2.9 per cent next year. Buoyancy in its principal trading partners is important for the next leg of the UK recovery, particularly since yesterday's trade figures confirmed the disappointingly modest growth in UK exports, notwithstanding sterling's devaluation after its ejection from the ERM. With Germany forecast by the OECD to achieve 1.8 per cent growth this year and 2.6 per cent next, the British export cause should certainly receive a boost. The OECD's forecast for UK economic growth itself remains around 2.9 per cent this year and next, which looks plausible. But the problem even with 2.9 per cent economic growth is that it means modest increases in real disposable incomes after tax, because of the substantial phased tax increases announced by Mr Norman Lamont and Mr Kenneth Clarke. It also means the economy would merely be bumping along the bottom of its longer-term growth trend. Especially dissatisfied A simple way to derive that trend is to take annual rates of growth between successive cyclical peaks and troughs, defined by whether quarterly growth is turning decisively below trend (in the case of peaks) or above it (in the case of troughs). The trend growth rate over the last cycle turns out to be 2 1/4 per cent a year - and 2.9 per cent is only modestly better than that. If voters believe economic growth at the trend rate is their right, as seems plausible, they are unlikely to find anything special about this performance. They will be especially dissatisfied after a fierce recession. If output had continued to rise on trend from its peak at the end of 1988, it would be 10 per cent higher than it is now. Continuation of economic growth at 2.9 per cent would not bring the economy back to even half-way between its peak-to-peak and trough-to-trough trend lines before the end of the millennium. Yet bringing the economy back to the mid-point still faster would be risky, since inflationary pressure is not just related to the amount of slack in an economy, but also to the speed with which it is eliminated. The government hopes that economic recovery will somehow offset the many other reasons for its unpopularity. Yet on present trends, growth may not be fast enough to make that much of a political difference. At the same time, forcing the economy to grow still faster than 3 per cent a year, however tempting, would be irresponsible. The good news for the government is that the recovery is indeed continuing. The bad news is that it could remain voteless.</p>

			<p>Lebanon   by Drug `Gangsters'   <F P=102> JN3003120594 Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 26 Mar 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> JN3003120594 </F> <F P=104>  Baghdad BABIL </F> <F P=105>  Arabic </F> BFN     [Text] Watchers of the Syrian scene and arrivals from  Syria report that Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son,  met his death at the hands of drug gangsters operating in  Lebanon.    According to some reliable sources, Basil was killed in  Lebanon, having received threats in connection with the hush  money he had been receiving from hashish growers and smugglers.  He had been suspected of planning to swindle the traffickers  and control the market.    The sources indicate that the news of Basil's death,  officially caused by an auto crash, was broken two days after  its actual date. Nor was there any picture of the accident that  could be shown on Syrian television.    Observers note that Lebanese factions, the Maronites in  particular, were keen to send delegations to pay their last  respects, lest any be suspected of involvement in his  assassination and then bear the vengeance of Syrian intelligence  services.    The observers are confident that the next few days will bear  out their assessment. A tradition of the al-Nasiriyah sect  calls for the deceased's face to be uncovered for a final  glimpse, which was not observed in the case of Basil al-Asad.</p>

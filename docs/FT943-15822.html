			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Customs to thwart reclaiming of VAT on leased cars The government clamped down firmly yesterday on a tortuous tax avoidance device which could cost it hundreds of millions of pounds a year in value added tax refunds on company cars. HM Customs &amp; Excise took the highly unusual step of circulating a warning to businesses and their advisers that it would work with foreign tax authorities to prevent the repayment of VAT on cars leased from other European Union member states. In a business briefing note, it said that a 'so-called tax planning scheme . . . being promoted by some well-known firms of tax advisers . . . does not succeed'. The statement is an aggressive attempt to head off an effort to exploit different tax laws across Europe, which the UK authority argues distort competition. In the UK, only a few industries such as cab companies and motor traders can claim back VAT on the purchase of cars. The rest pay VAT - estimated at Pounds 1.6bn in 1994. In other countries such as Germany the VAT is refundable. Price Waterhouse and several other large accountancy firms have spoken at conferences and held discussions with clients recommending they take long-term leases on cars with companies in countries where VAT on car sales can be reclaimed. To gain refunds, the cars would have to be leased by a non-UK company to a UK client, imported to the UK and ultimately re-exported when the lease expires. 'We are concerned that one or two firms are trying to drum up business,' Customs said yesterday. 'The imagination of accountants is exceedingly fertile. Our legal advice is that this won't work. This is a friendly note to companies to reconsider their advice to save time, energy and money.' Mr Nigel Cockburn, a tax partner with Price Waterhouse, said: 'I don't see this as tax avoidance. All it is doing is taking advantage of the laws in different countries, which is perfectly legal. Presumably, that's what the single European market is about.' Several UK clearing banks have already lodged appeals with the VAT tribunal claiming that Customs' ability to forbid refunds of VAT on company cars is incompatible with European law. They have complained to the European Commission that the UK has failed properly to implement the European sixth VAT directive, which would have permitted refunds unless a specific exemption had been granted. The commission is still waiting for an official response from the UK.</p>

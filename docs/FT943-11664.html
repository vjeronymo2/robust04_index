			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Pergau dam loan to be renegotiated The controversial subsidised loan provided by the UK government for the Pergau dam project in Malaysia is being renegotiated, report Robert Peston and James Blitz. Bankers said yesterday the Pounds 234m cash cost to the UK government of providing the interest rate subsidy over 14 years may be reduced. However, a banker stressed the initiative had come from Malaysia. British officials regard it as a commercial request which does not significantly alter the basis of the subsidy agreement struck in 1991. Last year, a UK National Audit Office report criticised the method of providing the subsidy chosen by the Overseas Development Administration, saying the cost to the UK taxpayer would be Pounds 56m more than if a more economical option had been chosen. The original Pergau loan of more than Pounds 300m was provided by commercial banks headed by Schroders, the UK merchant bank. It was made to Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity authority, for the construction of a hydro-electric dam at Pergau, though the loan was guaranteed by the Malaysian government. Tenaga pays a minimal interest rate, but the commercial banks receive a market rate, thanks to the UK government subsidy.</p>

[Dvalia] A constituent meeting of the Abkhazian regional  branch of the Union of Georgian Citizens took place in Tbilisi  today. The union is headed by Eduard Shevardnadze. The  speakers noted the need to unite all forces in order to attain  stability and order in the republic. Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze himself spoke at the meeting. He gave a brief  analysis of the sociopolitical situation that had taken shape.  Naturally, he paid special attention to the Abkhazian problem.  For the first time over the few months since Georgian troops  had left Abkhazia, Shevardnadze openly said that, apart from  everything else, a large-scale betrayal near the Katorskiy  bridge in Abkhazia was one of the main reasons for the defeat in  Abkhazia. Also, this betrayal took place in Ochamchira Rayon,  as well as in Sukhumi, where whole battalions were often  withdrawn from advanced positions without command agreement.    Shevardnadze openly accused Tengiz Kitovani, former  republican defense minister, and General Paata Datunashvili,  current first deputy defense minister, of handing over great  amounts of weapons, ammunition, and hardware to the armed  formations of the ex- president's supporters.    The head of state noted that today's Georgia did not have,  in  fact, a unified disciplined army since the available armed  forces cannot be regarded as such. Also, he said that in the  next few days he intended to issue several decrees aimed at  forming new unified armed forces but he did not elaborate on the  subject.    At the same time, it has become known from unofficial  sources  that serious changes are being prepared in the top echelons of  the Georgian Defense Ministry.</p>

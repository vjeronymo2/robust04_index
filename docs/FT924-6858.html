			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (6): Brain drain goes into reverse / Review of higher education provision in the county A REMARKABLE new industry has erupted in Lancashire in less than a generation. It turns over more than Pounds 100m a year and has grown continually; about half its turnover is spent locally, generating three jobs outside for every two within the industry itself. By the end of the decade, more than 30,000 people will be involved. The 'industry' is higher education. Size - and the monies involved - are more than mere indicators of economic importance: the speed of take-off says much about previous pent-up, unsatisfied needs and markets; a big hole in Lancashire's social and economic infrastructure was waiting to be filled. Mr Brian Booth, an economist who is now rector of the new University of Central Lancashire, sums up the raison d'etre of the sector: 'Lancashire and Cumbria have long been net exporters of students. They had about one-thirtieth of Britain's population but well under one-thirtieth of the nation's student places. Two universities are now trying to redress the balance.' The other university is Lancaster, one of the 'new' ones of the early 1960s, built on a greenfield site to the south of Lancaster itself. Central Lancashire is 'new' in the 1990s' sense, springing from Lancashire Polytechnic in the middle of Preston. Previously, there were no universities in the region west of the Pennines north of Manchester and Liverpool. Central Lancashire's origins lie in the Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge, founded in Preston in 1828. Although this eventually became the Harris College in 1956, it never attained the size and status of the regional technical colleges on which other polytechnics were founded. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then education secretary, designated Preston Polytechnic in 1973, it started with 500 students. Mr Booth says this weakness proved the new institution's strength; it could build from scratch, based on market need. It has done so: there are 14,000 students now. About 8,500 are full-time undergraduates and another 1,000 are part-timers studying for their degrees in the evenings. Others are doing diplomas and postgraduate work. Being in a large town like Preston has helped rapid growth, although there have inevitably been strains. There is usually a student lodgings crisis at the start of each academic year, for example, forcing the university to rent Pontins holiday camp at Southport to tide people over while the situation is sorted out. Meanwhile, Lancaster University's growth has been no less impressive, although it has been constrained by its island status in green fields. Mr Colin Adams, its planning officer, says it could only grow as fast as it could build, and many students have long used the seaside resort of Morecambe for accommodation. Nevertheless, Lancaster now has 6,200 students, of whom a fifth are mature, but few part-time. The university is working closely with the local authority to expand without overstretching local housing provision. It expects to have 8,500 students by 1994 and 10,500 by 2001. From a strategic economic point of view, what is going on is a form of import substitution, with consequent benefits to Lancashire's balance of trade in human resources. Previously, the cream of local talent went away for higher education and much of it never came back. At the same time, large numbers of capable people had no means of furthering their potential if they could not get away. It is hard to judge the exact size of this latter market, but one indicator is the success of an institution called the Open College of the North West. This is jointly sponsored by the two universities and consists of all community-level colleges in the Lancashire and Cumbria sub-region. It enables people to do a 'year zero' at their local college, where they can qualify for a three-year degree course at Central Lancashire or Lancaster without having to leap the conventional GCSE 'A' level entry hurdle. It is proving ideal for mature students, enabling them to prove they are capable of benefiting from a university education without having to pretend they are 17-year-olds all over again. Several thousand students are now involved. Starting from scratch has also enabled both universities to tailor faculty structures to market demand. Central Lancashire now has five faculties: science; design and technology; a business school; health; and cultural, legal and social science. Design and technology includes fashion, graphic and three-dimensional design. It aims to use the institution's good engineering reputation to marry design and manufacturing, producing better products that are easier for industry to make. Courses available at Central Lancashire range from astronomy and journalism, to fashion design and midwifery. Its law school also has a good name. Mr Booth believes market relevance was borne out by 30,000 applications for 3,000 first-year full-time places this year. Lancaster's five faculties are a management school; humanities; social science; science and engineering; and teacher education. The management school has proved particularly successful as a bridge to industry and commerce, with relevant undergraduate, postgraduate and management training functions. The school's seven departments - accounting and finance; behaviour in organisations; economics; management learning; marketing; operational research; and systems and information management - are in themselves indicators of the main thrust of teaching and research. Lancaster has strong links to British Airways, British Nuclear Fuels and VSEL, the Barrow-in-Furness nuclear submarine builder. About 300 British Airways managers have been involved in company-sponsored masters of business administration (MBA) degrees or management diplomas. There is also an MBA programme for a consortium of 10 companies, although recession has reduced the intake to one per year of 30 students, instead of two per year of 25 each. MBA degrees can be taken full-time or part-time, but Lancaster also stresses the value to industry of other masters courses, such as in accounting and finance, or operational research. Both universities attract students nationwide; many leave the region after graduating. Mr Booth says one of Lancashire's tasks as a community will be to develop its economy, ensuring more job and career opportunities to keep as many qualified people as possible. Lancaster University is therefore working hard with small and medium-sized companies to help them grow, thus helping the long-term potential jobs market. Central Lancashire intends to play a significant part in Preston Technology Centre, which is being developed near the campus in British Aerospace's Strand Road factory as it runs down. Mr Booth also hopes that a Fashion Design Centre, which the university is setting up with Preston Council, will help develop a widely-based cottage industry for graduates using personal computer-aided design and manufacture software to sell to large clothing companies. Meanwhile, Lancaster University is planning joint property development in Lancaster to clear up derelict sites and bring old buildings back into use. It hopes to build an urban equivalent of the greenfield science park favoured by universities in 1980s, broadening the economic base of the local community at its very heart.</p>

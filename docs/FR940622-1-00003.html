These amendments are intended to clarify that financial assurance must be in place during operations and updated when the licensee decides to cease operations and begin decommissioning. These amendments would explicitly describe the financial assurance certification requirements for licensees during operation, the implementation and timing requirements for licensees whose licenses have been in timely renewal since the promulgation of the 1988 decommissioning funding rules, and for licensees who cease operations without adequate funding arrangements in place.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment period expires September 20, 1994.

Similar provisions were added to 10 CFR Part 72 in 1988 (10 CFR 72.54 (53 FR 24018)). These requirements set out the procedures to be followed by a licensee who decides to decommission a facility and seek termination of the applicable license. Under certain circumstances (which apply when a Part 30, 40, 70, or 72 licensee has more than a modest amount of radioactive contamination to remediate), the licensee is required to submit a decommissioning plan that lays out the methods and measures for decontamination of the property and equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988, the Commission promulgated rules addressing ``Financial Assurance and Recordkeeping for Decommissioning'' (10 CFR 30.35, 40.36, 70.25 and 72.30 (53 FR 24018; June 27,1988)). These rules established a graded structure for financial assurance that relates the amount of the financial assurance required of a licensee to the possession limits in his or her license. The graded structure is based on the reasonable assumption that the kinds and quantities of radioactive materials authorized in the license provide a reasonably good correlation to the amount of contamination that has to be remediated. Further, Part 30, 40, or 70 applicants or licensees whose possession limits exceed or would exceed a certain level, and all Part 72 licensees and license applicants must provide an estimate of the actual expected decommissioning cost as part of their application for a license or for license renewal. The estimated costs are reviewed and approved by the Commission. Before the license is issued or renewed, the applicant must provide financial assurance in one or more of the forms required by the rule (prepayment, surety, insurance or other guarantee, or external sinking fund with a backup surety).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same June 27, 1988, final rule also added a requirement that decommissioning plans include an updated detailed cost estimate for decommissioning, a comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for decommissioning, and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate funds for the completion of decommissioning. The intent in promulgating these rules was to ensure that adequate funds would be available to cover the costs of decommissioning NRC licensed facilities. At the time the decommissioning funding rules were promulgated, it was not anticipated that a licensee would move to decommissioning without having complied earlier with the financial assurance requirements. Since that time a number of licensees who were in timely renewal ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., licensees who had timely filed an application for renewal of their licenses and whose licenses, therefore, continued in effect while the renewal applications were being acted upon) when the June 27, 1988, rule became effective have decided to terminate their activities and begin decommissioning. Other licensees that only provided certification for the minimum amounts of financial assurance have also decided to terminate activities and begin decommissioning. In both situations, insufficient funding was in place when the licensee ceased operations and began decommissioning. These amendments are intended to clarify that financial assurances must be in place and updated when the licensee decides to cease operations and begin decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

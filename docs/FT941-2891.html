			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Guinness slips as sales volumesremain flat: Spirits and beer stagnate; Luxuries regain lustre; Reorganisation costs Guinness, the brewing and spirits group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 702m after exceptional charges of Pounds 173m related to a restructuring with LVMH. The figure compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 795m in 1992 when the group took a Pounds 125m charge to cover reorganisations of Scotch whisky production and the Cruzcampo brewing business in Spain. Sales increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 4.66bn, but would have been just 1 per cent higher without beneficial currency effects. Although the results were in line with expectations Guinness's shares fell 18p to 484p after Mr Tony Greener, chairman, cautioned: 'At this point of the year there is no sign of generally improved market conditions.' Nevertheless he expected a modest improvement in profits this year. Commenting on the 1993 performance he said: 'In a year of severe economic downturn in a number of major markets, pre-tax profits on a comparable basis were 1 per cent lower, demonstrating once again the resilience of the group.' United Distillers showed a 9 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 701m, while the contribution from Guinness Brewing Worldwide fell 7 per cent to Pounds 237m. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of exchange rates and other non-comparable items, Mr Greener said spirits profits slipped 3 per cent while beer was down 1 per cent. Spirits sales rose 7 per cent to Pounds 2.77bn, mainly due to exchange rate movements.  Volumes rose 1 per cent to 52m cases, with Scotch whisky up 3 per cent at 27m. However, sales growth was mainly in the standard and lower priced brands and premium sales were flat. Prices rose by an average 1 per cent, reflecting exceptionally competitive market conditions and depressed consumer confidence. Brewing sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 1.89bn. At level exchange rates, the rise would have been 2 per cent. Total volumes were level at 24.4m hectolitres, but excluding acquisitions they were slightly down. Net interest charges fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 188m. Net debt fell by Pounds 155m to Pounds 1.87bn at the end of December. Diluted earnings per share of 22.9p were 18 per cent lower but a final dividend of 9.18p lifts the total payment to 12.8p, an increase of 8 per cent. Lex, Page 20</p>

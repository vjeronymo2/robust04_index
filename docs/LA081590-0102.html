			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIMON BEAZLIE; AIDS PATIENT IN TIMES PROFILE  </P> <P> Kimon Beazlie, 46, a former Hollywood costume designer who with four other AIDS  patients was profiled Sunday in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, has died after  a yearlong battle with the disease, according to friends.  </P> <P> Beazlie, of Los Feliz, appeared on the cover of the magazine and was one of the  subjects of an article titled "To Live and Die in L.A.," about the crisis in  AIDS health care in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> He was admitted to the Chris Brownlie Hospice for AIDS patients two weeks ago,  soon after giving a short, final interview for the story, and died early  Monday.  </P> <P> Beazlie, an avid amateur rock climber who was born and raised in Hawaii, once  made $80,000 a year creating costumes for movies and television.  </P> <P> After developing early symptoms in the fall of 1988, Beazlie became ill in July  of last year with Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare skin cancer associated with AIDS. In  the magazine article he told of being forced to wait seven weeks, because of  overcrowded conditions, before being admitted to the AIDS outpatient clinic at  Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> Beazlie was treated at the clinic until this summer, when he dropped out of  therapy because of frustration with the quality of medical care and his own  worsening condition. For several months, until his health deteriorated, he was  a part-time volunteer at Being Alive, a nonprofit group run by AIDS patients.  </P> <P> Shortly before dying, Beazlie arranged for his own cremation. No services are  scheduled. A friend said his remains will be flown to Hawaii, where Beazlie is  survived by his father, Horace, and mother, Natsuko; a brother, David, and two  sisters, Karla and Nadine.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF SENIORS AT INDIAN WELLS;  </P> <P> TREVINO SPUTTERS, BUT HOLDS ON TO WIN  </P> <P> Lee Trevino won his third Senior PGA tournament in the last four weeks Sunday  at the Vintage Club, but it definitely was no breeze.  </P> <P> The magic putter that contributed to 11 consecutive sub-par rounds was just  another putter in the final 18 holes of the 54-hole Chrysler Vintage  Invitational.  </P> <P> By sinking an 18-inch putt on the last hole, Trevino posted a par 72 and a 205  total. When Don Massengale missed a 12-foot birdie try on the 18th, Trevino  just needed to get down in two from the fringe -- about 12 feet -- and he did.  </P> <P> Trevino went into the final round with a three-shot lead, but finished only a  stroke ahead of Massengale, Dale Douglass (67 on the final round), and Mike  Hill (66). He earned $60,000 to increase his yearly total to $220,000. When he  broke in on the regular tour it would have taken a dozen victories to earn that  much.  </P> <P> Before becoming eligible for the 50 and over tour, Trevino said he expected to  win four or five tournaments in his first year. The goal is practically a  cinch. But calling his shot has made him cautious and he won't make any  predictions.  </P> <P> For the first time in a decade, Trevino has played competitively for seven  weeks in a row. He started on the desert (the Bob Hope) and finished on the  desert. He conceded it was almost a day too long.  </P> <P> "I'm tired," he said. "It's a good thing I'm taking the next two weeks off. I  wouldn't have won this tournament if I had had three or four players close  going into the final round instead of just Don.  </P> <P> "I went out there trying for another round of four or five under, but my  putting, which was so good the first two days, wasn't today. If I had putted as  well today, it would have been over by the 11th. Instead, it was a struggle."  </P> <P> Trevino's lead was four strokes when Massengale three-putted No. 1. But by the  seventh hole, it was even. Trevino missed putts of three feet, two of eight  feet and another of six feet. Massengale sank birdie putts of eight feet on No.  2, seven feet on No. 3 and eight feet on No. 7 to pull even.  </P> <P> They remained even until the 11th when the wind, which was missing the first  two days, finally showed up. The 11th is a 185-yard par 3 with water on the  right. There was a cross win blowing to the left. After Massengale hit a  seven-iron to the left in the high grass, Trevino hit a six-iron right at the  pin. He was three feet to the right of the pin.  </P> <P> The complexion changed when Massengale chipped to within four feet, but blew  the putt. Trevino made his only birdie and the two-shot swing was just enough.  </P> <P> "I wasn't even sure I could make that one," Trevino said. "Until today I  thought every putt would go in."  </P> <P> Massengale also missed an eight-footer at 13, but he blamed his driving, not  his putting.  </P> <P> "My driving was so erratic, I couldn't be aggressive," he said. "I spent the  day trying for miracles."  </P> <P> Mike Hill and Douglass, the winner here in 1986, made late charges, but they  knew they didn't have a chance when Trevino needed only a par on the 18th, a  par 5 easy birdie hole.  </P> <P> "Lee has won three tournaments, but all have been by just one shot," said  Douglass, who lives in Phoenix and plays his best golf in California. "He is a  great asset to our tour, but we are showing we can play with him. This is the  best I've played this year. I'm ready for San Antonio."  </P> <P> There will not be Trevino to contend with at San Antonio in two weeks. He will  be resting.  </P> <P> It may be that Trevino will cause many of the seniors to rethink their  preparations for tournaments. Traditionally, during a tournament, players will  practice for more than an hour before tee-off time and another hour or so after  the round. Not Trevino.  </P> <P> "I do my practicing when I'm home and not playing," he said. "I usually go out  on the course half an hour before my starting time. I will putt just a few,  merely to get the feel of the putter. Then, I will hit a bucket of balls. I  don't practice after the round either. I go straight home and chase my daughter  (Olivia, age 1) and my wife (Claudia, 32 in May) around the house. I can't  catch either one of them."  </P> <P> Trevino will play in a non-tour event in Japan late in March, then return to  the tour in the Tradition at Scottsdale. There he will renew his rivalry with  Jack Nicklaus.  </P> <P> "It's always great to go head-to-head with Jack," Trevino said. "He brings out  the best in me. I know he'll be ready.  </P> <P> "I think he made the remark about marginal players winning over here just to  stir things up. He loves a challenge."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Each year the Vintage honors a golfer for his contributions to the sport. The  1990 recipient is Gene Littler. Littler, who won the first Vintage in 1981 and  also won in 1983, joins players such as Byron Nelson, Sam Snead and Arnold  Palmer. . . . George Archer, who won 12 tournaments on the regular tour despite  numerous physical problems, and his first on the senior tour after becoming  eligible on Oct. 1, is having back problems again. He will go to Centinela  Hospital today for an evaluation after finishing far behind with a 214.  </P> <P> Until this year the revenue came mainly from the amateurs, 200 of them who pay  $5,000 for a chance to play four rounds, two of them with senior pros, and, the  sponsor. That has changed with the record crowds. . . . The crowd Sunday was  even bigger than Saturday's. Most of the crowd followed and cheered Lee  Trevino. On the senior tour there is now a Lee's Legion to go with Arnie's  Army. . . . For the tournament there were 35 of the 54 golfers under par.  </P></p>

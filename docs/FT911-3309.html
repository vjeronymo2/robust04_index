			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: CRA forecasts lower profits CRA, the Australian mining group, will report lower profits this year because of weak metals prices and slack world demand, Mr John Ralph, chairman, said yesterday. Mr Ralph said profits earnings would be lower 'but not by much,' and stressed that forecasts were dependent on movements in metals prices and the strength of the Australian dollar. CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, reported net profits of ADollars 472m (Dollars 365m) last year, compared with ADollars 648m in 1989. Mr Ralph said he was confident that CRA's hostile ADollars 435m bid for Coal and Allied Industries (CAIL) would succeed.</p>

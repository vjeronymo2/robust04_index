			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Outflow of funds in day put at Pounds 10bn EXHAUSTED foreign exchange traders, many still at their desks after a 12-hour day of frantic dealing, were last night unfazed by sterling's suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism. Dealers estimated that more than Pounds 10bn of capital flowed out of the UK yesterday as fund managers and corporate treasurers tried to reduce their exposure to sterling. The suspension announcement, at the end of the most hectic day many traders could remember, came after intense speculation that a devaluation of sterling was inevitable. 'No one was really surprised. The pressure was just too great,' said Mr Julian Simmonds, head of foreign exchange trading at Citibank. 'Another day like today would have been impossible.' Earlier, the announcement of a five-point rise in official interest rates to 15 per cent failed to stem a massive outflow of funds from the UK financial markets. International fund managers and corporate treasurers joined foreign exchange dealers in a flight from sterling as their expectations of a devaluation of the currency mounted. One trader said: 'The central banks were buying sterling and the rest of the world was selling. It was no contest.' Even a rise in overnight rates to 100 per cent - a level that makes it extremely expensive to take short positions  -failed to dim the speculative ardour of foreign exchange dealers. 'Dealers have had such success in manipulating the central banks that they are prepared to play very, very hard,' said Mr John Clark, an arbitrage dealer at Tokai International. 'There is no fear of being caught the wrong way.' Traders continued to pursue the 'scent of blood', buoyed by handsome profits won on the devaluation of the lira. 'As soon as the lira went, it was curtains for sterling,' said Mr Richard Neville Rolfe, a foreign exchange trader at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. 'The feeling that there was going to be a devaluation became much stronger throughout the day, especially when the two rate rises made absolutely no impact on the sterling/D-Mark rate.' The extra 5 per cent on interest rates - later revised to 2 per cent with the announcement of sterling's suspension from the ERM - actually pushed the currency down further. 'In a currency crisis of this scale, interest rates at the margin are no protection,' one trader argued. While some analysts felt the market was getting carried away, others such as Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Midland Montagu, argued: 'The foreign exchange traders are behaving rationally in that they feel there is a snowball effect behind the weaker members of the ERM. There has been one devaluation, so why shouldn't there be another?' In any case, it was not the speculative bent of foreign exchange dealers that pushed sterling three pfennings below its floor in the ERM yesterday, during London trading. The massive flow of capital from the UK market yesterday could not have been orchestrated by speculative traders alone. 'Investors are selling pounds on an entirely rational basis,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'To safeguard the value of their money, investors are putting their money in D-Marks instead.' While UK-based funds, which are generally sterling-based, were relatively inactive, there was widespread selling of sterling by fund managers in Asia, continental Europe and the US.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Algiers term extended The mandate of Algeria's five-man presidency, which was due to step down at the end of the year, has been extended to January 31, the official news agency APS reported yesterday, Reuter writes from Algiers. The presidency, which is called the High Council of State (HCE), has ruled Algeria since the cancellation in January 1992 of a general election that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party was poised to win. The FIS was later banned. APS also said a long-planned national conference, designed to chart Algeria's path to democracy after a transitional period expected to last two to three years, would be held on January 25 and 26. Both announcements were made by the High Security Council, which is Algeria's highest constitutional authority, after a meeting yesterday. The conference is being organised by a National Dialogue Commission, named by the HCE two months ago to forge a consensus on the country's political future. Since the vote was cancelled, Algeria has been gripped by violence, blamed by the authorities on Moslem militants, in which 1,800 have died.</p>

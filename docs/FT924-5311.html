			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Management: When to contract out and when to stay in - Christopher Lorenz considers the view that outsourcing must be handled with care After all the action of the past few years on the popular but controversial topic of subcontracting and 'outsourcing', you could be forgiven for thinking that companies now understood all the competitive and financial benefits involved. Witness the recent flood of head office cutbacks in favour of 'outsourced' services such as computing and even accounting. Observe also the myriad of corporate decisions to subcontract the manufacture, and sometimes also the design, of a growing number of components and sub-assemblies. Witness, too, the considerable concern which has been expressed about the risks of taking the process too far, to the extent that a company becomes 'hollowed out' by outsourcing even products and processes which should be kept in house if it wants to retain vital 'core competencies'. So it comes as quite a surprise to find a senior executive at one of the world's leading manufacturers arguing that outsourcing has not gone nearly far enough. Too many companies are continuing to over-invest in the proprietary development and manufacture of simple commodity (or standard) components, he argues. But such is their confusion over sourcing policy that they are also subcontracting key items which are hard to make but which should be proprietary. In place of this confusion, Ravi Venkatesan, assistant to the group vice president of operations at Cummins Engine, proposes a practical and systematic way of deciding which components are 'strategic', and should be kept in house, and which can be subcontracted safely. Cummins' development of this approach in the late 1980s had painful results. For instance, an emotional three-year debate led to a decision to outsource the design and manufacture of pistons to two more advanced world-class suppliers whose scale enabled them to invest 20 times as much as Cummins in the development of new products and processes. Instead, Cummins decided to focus organisational energy and resources on other areas where it hoped to build leadership, notably electronics, ceramics and alternative fuels. Venkatesan then decided to look more carefully at other companies in Cummins' league which were facing the same conundrum. Between 1990 and this year, he studied six other large manufacturers, including John Deere, JI Case, and Navistar International (the former International Harvester). Venkatesan says in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review* that his investigations produced disturbing findings. He explains: 'Many of these companies have systematically over-invested in commodity parts and have neglected developing the proprietary components that could, and must, become sources of competitive advantage.' Among other disadvantages, this causes a low rate of improvement in manufacturing performance, as resources are spread thinly across thousands of parts. Venkatesan's 'strategic sourcing' process starts by examining the strategic or other characteristics not of individual components, but of the systems and sub-systems into which they fit. Only then is the status of individual components assessed. The first thing for each company to decide is which sub-systems will be key to its competitive position in subsequent product generations. This choice will vary between competitors and influence product differentiation fundamentally. Sub-systems should be classified as strategic when they: have a high impact on what customers perceive as the most important product attributes; require highly specialised design and manufacturing skills and specialised physical facilities, for which there are very few, if any, capable independent suppliers; involve technology that is relatively fluid and in which there is a significant likelihood of gaining a technological lead. Two key questions must then be answered. What are the supplier's design and manufacturing capabilities relative to the company? What would it cost to catch up with the best suppliers and can the company afford it? As with Cummins' difficult decision to outsource pistons, the answers to these questions may prompt a company to exit from a component business even when the item in question is deemed 'strategic'. But if design, as well as production, of the part has to be outsourced, Venkatesan claims that a company can still protect itself by controlling its design and production 'architecture'. In this sense, the term 'architectural knowledge' applies to the detailed and specialised power of translation which is needed to capture customer requirements and reproduce them as performance specifications for sub-systems. The ability to specify and control the performance characteristics of a sub-system is more important than in-house manufacture, or even design, concludes Venkatesan. But his advice carries a sting in its tail. If such outsourcing is carelessly planned and executed, it 'can result in the destruction of architectural knowledge within a single product generation', he warns. 'Lost architectural knowledge has always been difficult to get back. Today it is virtually impossible.' *Strategic Sourcing: To make or not to make. HBR Nov-Dec 1992. Reprint 92610.

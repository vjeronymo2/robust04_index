			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: IoD presses case for independent bank Sir, Having campaigned for more than a decade for an Independent Bank of England, the Institute of Directors is encouraged that the advantages of this ultimate privatisation are becoming accepted wisdom among a wider range of influential figures - not least the former chancellor of the exchequer and his predecessors - to whom we have made repeated representations. The government is naturally wary of relinquishing its hold over one of the levers of economic control, and claims that an independent central bank could not have brought down inflation more quickly than the government. Yet inflation would not have risen to such a high level and wrought so much damage on the economy and business so frequently, had the Bank of England been able to operate a rigorous anti-inflation policy. The objectives of an independent bank should be set by parliament, to which it should be accountable, openly and in detail, for the discharge of defined and limited responsibilities. The Bundesbank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand provide interesting precedents. Within these parameters the Bank would be free to operate in the best interests of the economy rather than for the benefit of political parties influenced by party politics and the electoral cycle. Given the uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate mechanism and European monetary union, the best signal the government could give to our European partners and financial markets of its commitment to low inflation and sound money is to grant independence to the Bank of England.

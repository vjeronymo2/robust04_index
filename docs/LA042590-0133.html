			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TRUMPETER DAVID BILGER IN AMBASSADOR RECITAL  </P> <P> Pity the poor trumpet recitalist; his repertory is meager in size as well as  substance. Trumpeters, if they wish to avoid transcriptions, must rely almost  exclusively on the second- and third-rate attempts of lesser composers.  </P> <P> Still, a strong advocate can raise this music above its weaknesses. But  trumpeter David Bilger -- a co-principal in the Dallas Symphony -- revealed no  such special virtue as a soloist Monday night at Ambassador Auditorium, and  despite his solid craftsmanship his recital remained steadfastly earthbound.  </P> <P> Best served was the dependable Sonata by Halsey Stevens, a trumpet standard,  with its Copland harmonies and Stravinsky rhythms. Bilger gave it a relaxed,  richly toned account. Also enjoyable was the concluding piece on the program,  Herbert L. Clarke's "The Carnival of Venice," a turn-of-the-century display  piece which Bilger, performing here on cornet, dispatched with acrobatic ease.  </P> <P> Throughout the evening pianist Linda Booth seconded Bilger's efforts, but they  consistently proved indifferent collaborators, separate musicians just playing  their parts.  </P> <P> The repetitive, bland Caprice by Joseph Turrin opened the concert followed by  Georges Enesco's mildly engaging, impressionistic Legende, both in  straightforward run-throughs. The brash Sonata, Opus 1, by Peter Maxwell Davies  came off tamely, with Bilger and Booth more concerned with correct execution  than dramatic statement. Bilger's own transcriptions of two Mahler songs,  "Fruhlingsmorgen" and "Erinnerung," received mundane readings.  </P> <P> The premiere of Reynoldo Oachoa's "Stills in Black and White," a conservative,  academic exercise in spacey lyricism, rounded out the program.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / US judge orders Microsoft recall A US federal judge has ordered Microsoft to recall versions of its personal computer operating system MS-DOS that contain data compression technology found by the court to have violated patents held by Stac Electronics, a small Californian software company. MS-DOS is used by millions of PC users. The worldwide recall covers offending ver sions of the MS-DOS operating system software, and computers containing the software, that are currently in computer stores. Copies of the Microsoft program already in use by PC buyers are not affected by the recall. The judge also issued a permanent injunction ordering Microsoft to stop making, using and selling MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 versions of the software that contain a feature called 'DoubleSpace' that doubles the amount of data that can be stored on a PC hard disk. The injunction follows a February jury decision that Micro soft's DoubleSpace technology infringes two patents owned by Stac Electronics. Microsoft was also ordered to pay Stac Dollars 120m in compensatory damages. Microsoft has said that it will appeal against the verdict and said yesterday it would also ask the Federal Appellate Court to stay the injunction and recall the order. Microsoft has already shipped a new version of MS-DOS with the offending features expunged, to 1500 PC manufacturers. The company was unable to estimate the volume of products that could be affected by the recall. Industry analysts said, however, that the recall could cause significant disruption in the PC market if thousands of computers are pulled off dealers' shelves worldwide.</p>

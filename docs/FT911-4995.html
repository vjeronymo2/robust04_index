			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Salvador peace talks stumble after killing PEACE talks in Mexico City between the El Salvador government and FMLN guerrillas have hit problems since the recent killing of a senior guerrilla leader. Mr Antonio Cardenal, known as Commander 'Jonas', was killed in El Salvador last week with 12 other guerrillas, in an ambush by a commando unit of the army's elite Atlacatl battalion, in what was considered a guerrilla-controlled area. The FMLN has angrily accused the government of killing 'Jonas' after he was taken prisoner and of trying to wreck the peace talks. An FMLN communique yesterday warned that guerrillas would launch similar attacks against army chiefs. It warned that any attempts by the army to push the FMLN out of territory it controls would be resisted. 'Jonas' was a member of the FMLN's political-diplomatic commission and was directly involved in earlier rounds of peace talks. He was Nicaraguan by birth, and a nephew of the Nicaraguan president Mrs Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Several big issues are at stake in the negotiations, aimed at establishing a ceasefire by April 30. The FMLN wants the government to recognise its de facto control of some territory during a period of 'armed peace' which will lead to an eventual disarmament of the FMLN. It also wants steps on constitutional reforms and the creation of an commission to oversee the purging from the armed forces of officers linked to human rights abuses.</p>

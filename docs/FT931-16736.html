			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Redland Redland had a busy end to 1992, judging by yesterday's string of disposals and acquisitions. The net effect on earnings will be small, probably to raise them only by around 1p per share which will not do much for dividend cover. But the market understandably took heart from the signal that Redland appears able to raise reasonable prices for those parts of the Steetley acquisition which it either does not want or has had to divest for competition policy reasons. Given the weak French economy, the Coverland purchase may look oddly timed. This is a strategic opportunity, though, and in the short run there should be margin benefits from rationalisation. Recovery in the US and Australia and lower capital spending should make Redland cash neutral in 1993. Together with reduced gearing from further disposals, that should lift uncertainty over the 1993 dividend, making the yield of just under 8 per cent attractive. This still assumes that German housing remains unaffected by recession. Doubts on that score may remain until well into the second half, limiting the follow-through to yesterday's 4 per cent advance.</p>

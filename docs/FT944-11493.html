			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The sale of stock by Geoffrey Brown, chief executive and major shareholder at CentreGold, an electronic games publisher and distributor, came soon after its final results. Broker Smith New Court took company executives to visit its institutional contacts, a move that generated considerable interest in CentreGold. But the resulting demand for stock could not be met in the market; thus, Brown's sale. Bluebird Toys featured a couple of weeks ago when chairman Torquil Norman sold 1.2m shares. Although he undertook not to sell any more, one of the executive directors, David Laxton, has now disposed of almost half his stake. The buying in Wickes is significant, if only because it is unusual to see quite so many directors buying all together. The share price has languished since announcement of final results in August. But such a show of unity should not be ignored completely.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       No of Company              Sector       Shares       Value  directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Bluebird Toys          L&amp;H        52,500     116,025    1 CentreGold Plc        Mdia     1,387,861    1,360104    1 Haynes Pub            Mdia         4,000      17,040    1 Holt (Jos)            Brew         1,050      35,175    1 Iceland Group         RetF       900,000    1,458000    1 Inchcape              Dist        15,000      63,000    1 Macallan-Glenlivet    SW&amp;C        40,000      84,000    1 McKay Secs            Prop        52,215      94,109    1 Prudential Corp       LifA       208,750     617,900    1* Ropner                DivI        30,000      37,500    1 Ross Group            Dist       250,000      22,500    1 SIG                   BM&amp;M        39,683      98,414    1 PURCHASES Anglo-East Plant      OS&amp;B       100,000      95,000    1 Bradford Prop         Prop         6,000      11,220    1 Brooks Service        SSer        20,000      12,200    1 Cattles (Hldgs)       OthF        11,460      14,898    1 Development Secs      Prop        50,000      11,500    1 Everest Foods         FdMa       250,000     140,000    2 Global Grp            FdMa       100,000      13,000    1 Kleinwort Second      InvT        20,000      17,600    1 Maunders (John)       BCon         5,000      11,050    1 McKay Secs            Prop        11,000      19,910    1 Olives Property       Prop        50,000      17,000    1 Plantation &amp;General   Uncl        30,000      16,200    1 Smiths Inds            Eng        30,807     140,172    3 Sunset &amp; Vine         Mdia        20,000      26,800    1 Tarmac                BM&amp;M         9,000      11,340    1 Tomkins               DivI         5,000      10,000    1 United Biscuits       FdMa        10,000      30,000    1 Wickes                BM&amp;M       114,112     102,701    8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

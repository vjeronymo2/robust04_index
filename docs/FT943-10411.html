			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Lloyd's outlines outsider reforms Lloyd's of London yesterday unveiled proposals to expand the membership of outsiders on its ruling council and to change the voting structure of the insurance market. It will ensure that there are six working, six external and six nominated members of the insurance market on the council from the start of next year. It will also change from the current position of 'one member, one vote' to a weighted system. Allocation of votes will be based on the overall underwriting capacity of each Name, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. The changes are among the 18 recommendations approved in full by the council on Wednesday which were made in a report, co-ordinated by Mr Mark Sheldon, a former president of the Law Society, and completed in June. The Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names group, gave a 'qualified welcome' to the proposals, saying that the change to voting rights would help give a say to Names regardless of their outstanding liabilities. Separately, the Lloyd's council said yesterday that it was investigating ways to close off underwriting syndicates that remain 'open' in years since 1985 as a result of outstanding liabilities. Open years cause considerable uncertainty to Names and make it impossible for them to cease being members of the market. The new initiative - if implemented - would extend the principle to more recent years, covering such liabilities as catastrophe reinsurance. Lloyd's also said yesterday that the council had invited Mr David Rowland, the chairman, to extend his term for a year beyond the three years expiring at the end of next year.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Just a handful of dust: A look at the fuss over Michael Atherton's behaviour It is not necessary to travel very far from Britain to realise what a very strange place it must seem to foreigners. To spend two weeks in the south of France is to be regaled with the most hair-raising stories of local corruption. Fingers point at this or that new development which would never have been allowed but for an even larger than usual bribe. The strange thing is that the local politicians who take these payments - no names here, I am afraid - are often spoken of extremely warmly. After one such encounter I returned to our rented villa and tuned into British satellite television news. Almost the entire bulletin was devoted to the fact that two Conservative MPs had been paid Pounds 1,000 each in return for asking a parliamentary question. Not very seemly, I agree, but southern French heads would shake in disbelief at an entire national news bulletin being dominated by such an item, particularly as it was generally agreed that the two MPs had broken no law. On my return to Britain I discovered that the newspapers were dominated by another story of less than global significance: a young man was being excoriated by every columnist of note for putting his hand in his pocket and rubbing a bit of dirt on a ball. True, the man in question, Michael Atherton, is captain of the English cricket team, and his action, during a Test match against South Africa, appeared to infringe one of the less well-drafted laws - never say 'rules' - of cricket. But I am sure that it is not just over-exposure to the heady air of southern French corruption which makes me think there is something absurd in the extent to which Atherton's folly has been elevated to the level of a national scandal, with leader writers being obliged to decide what retribution the readers of The Daily Brute or Beast would wish to see exacted upon a man, it is generally admitted, of outstanding qualities. Some calls for Atherton's resignation, such as from the BBC's cricket correspondent, Jonathan Agnew, are doubtless sincerely felt. But there is a self-serving element here which goes beyond cant and hypocrisy. It is that the newspapers love a story to be as big as possible, and that there is nothing bigger than an English cricket captain being sacked. It is also true that the press, like all good story-tellers, require a beginning, a middle and an end. First, with the aid of cameras, they find something out. Next they expose the malfeasance to public scrutiny and ridicule. Finally the evil-doer must admit the enormity of his error and resign, thus proving that the press were all along justified in their hysteria. We saw the same process in the case of Tory minister David Mellor (sin: adultery), who lost the game, and in the case of BBC supremo John Birt (sin: dodgy accountancy), who won. Those who win are highly embarrassing for the press, as The Times has discovered with John Major, who has survived its repeated assertion that he will not survive as prime minister with something bordering on insouciance. Generally the press have a stock response if one of those who were told to resign succeeds in not doing so. It is that standards of moral probity in British public life have declined lamentably. Older heads are fond of recalling the case of Sir Thomas Dugdale who resigned, 40 years ago, as minister of agriculture in the wake of the Crichel Down affair, in which the wrong-doing was wholly that of ministry officials. Sir Thomas declared that he was the minister responsible, and must fall on his sword - or plough. Which leaves me with one dangerously subversive thought. When was the last time that a newspaper editor resigned because of a blunder that he had committed (it does happen)? Or when, in the late lamented style of the late lamented Sir Thomas, did a newspaper editor last resign because of some wrong-doing on the part of one of his minions? Answers on a (very small) French postcard, please. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Snisarenko, TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA </F> parliamentary correspondent: "Duma Chronicle: Documents, Figures  and Commentary"]    [Text] In previous issues, the newspaper covered the  two-day session of the Tyumen Oblast Duma briefly and in general  terms. Today we offer readers a more detailed and documentary  analysis of the Duma's working agenda with commentary by our  "parliamentary correspondent" Vitaliy Snisarenko.  <H8>  A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE AGENDA ITSELF </H8>   It went without saying that the key issues in the session's  work would be the budgetary message and other socioeconomic  parameters of the oblast's life in 1994, including one of the  key "points," in general--the Duma's lawmaking work; it is here  that the foundation of our future would be laid.    However, the fact that it was proposed that precisely these  issues be discussed, for all practical purposes, only in the  second part of the session caused general perplexity among  representatives of the mass media. When the outgoing Duma  leadership in the person of N. Baryshnikov and V. [? illegible]  Tretyakov assigned numerical priority--and that has always been  understood as meaning priority in importance--for the deputies  arriving from local areas to problems of structure and staffing  and of material and technical supply (point 5), and to the  questions of approving estimated expenditures for the operations  of the Duma and even of allocating money for the remodeling of  the meeting hall (point 7).    To the credit of the deputies themselves, in the process of  approving the agenda they dropped the aforementioned points from  it. Although it should be noted that a decree "on the remodeling  of the principal hall," with the allocation of a full $1.5  million and "only" 80 million rubles for that "extremely  important" undertaking, had already been drafted for the  signature of N. Baryshnikov.    The Duma deputies did some counting and figured that, given  the fact that their corps numbered only 25 members, it was  extremely irrational to have their own 57-person business  administration. They did some counting and cut the business  administration: There is an analogous department of the oblast  administration close at hand that is capable of meeting the  needs of the Duma deputies.    In short, the eternal passion to spend money and inflate  staffs continues to beat ardently: A. Korelyakov and V. Yudin  spoke out harshly on that topic.    I shall express my own viewpoint. I believe that it is  necessary, in general, to change what is, for all practical  purposes, an obsolete staffing arrangement--with its  departments, deputy directors and chief and lead  specialists--for supporting new Duma. I think that each of our  new congressmen needs a two-person staff consisting of a legal  specialist and an economist, both of whom should be highly  professional: taken together, they would constitute the Duma's  intellectual apparatus, and along with them there should be a  common technical support group for all the deputies.  <H8>  CONCERNING THE COMPUTER DECREE </H8>   Another draft decree had also prepared, according to which  it  was proposed to allocate R1,483,690,000 this year for the needs  of the Tyumen Oblast Regional Agency for the Development of Data  Processing and Telecommunications, which had been established  back under V. Ulyanov. The Duma deputies also struck out this  point.    Although A. Korelyakov made a proposal simply to sell the  existing imported IBM equipment, and G. Polyakov did not rule  out the possibility of transferring it and placing it under the  aegis of another Duma deputy, A. Klepalov, chief physician of  the oblast hospital, I believe that the essence of the  fundamental objection lay elsewhere.    First of all, the unified Tyumen Oblast for which the  computer system in question was intended does not exist. Second,  it does not make sense in these times to spend scarce budgetary  money for this project, and it is possible that the system that  has been designated so far will prove suitable for the  commercial and state banks: let them assume part of the  expenditures.    That is what the Duma decided, resolving to think the matter  over and return to this matter later.  <H8>  Concerning the Draft Designs for the Tyumen Oblast Flag and </H8> Seal, the Problem of Unity, and the Plan for the Duma's  Legislative Work    The Duma decided that the draft designs for the flag and  seal  should be presented for consideration by the competition jury no  later than 1 August 1994: the prize fund consists of R3 million  and is to be indexed for inflation (the first prize is 1.5  million, the second prize is 600,000, and there are three  honorable mentions of 300,000 rubles each).    All that is fine. But in the course of the discussion of  this  and all the other matters on the agenda, one underlying issue  that has not yet been resolved could be heard: the essence of it  is that on 5-6 May the Duma, for all practical purposes,  considered only the "southern" part of Tyumen Oblast's specific  problems. If, in the future, the same budgetary questions with  regard to the autonomous okrugs are designated in documents only  by the meaningless phrase "on the one hand," that will be  intolerable for the oblast Duma (G. Polyakov sharply underscored  precisely this matter in his speech).    Well, why, then, speak seriously today about a single flag  and seal? Why, broadly speaking, should L. Roketskiy, who for  all intents and purposes is dealing only with the questions of  the south, continue to bluff? After all, the fact that the  questions of oil and gas were virtually not considered at all at  the current Duma session--they're not ours but the okrugs'--is  considerable, obvious and distressing nonsense.    And although I agree with the governor about letting the  okrugs keep their governmental sovereignty--it is absurd to try  to command from Tyumen in the old way, and inconvenient to  boot--oblast-wide programs that are greatly needed by everyone  have been halted in their development.    And let us, finally, ask the following ruthless question:  where will the tens upon tens of thousands of people from the  resettled North go--and they are already going--when the oil and  gas start to wane? Or the northern deposits become completely  exhausted? To whom will the dead cities and airports of the  North then be left?    People won't go somewhere in the near aborad, which has  become inhospitable for them, but to us, to the south.    That is why I claim that today the number-one question on  the  agenda for the current Duma is legislative work. And the main  thing is to adopt, at any cost, a Law on Relations Between  Tyumen Oblast and the Khanty-Mansi and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous  Okrugs That Are Parts of It--a functional law that is as  rational as possible and that has been agreed to at the federal  level. All the remaining legal acts--on local government, on  oblast taxes, and so forth and so on--will "flow" from such a  law, which will be fundamental for the oblast.    But it is extremely difficult to resolve this matter: the  "race of sovereignties" has gone too far,a nd too much time has  been lost.    On both days of the current Duma session V. Ulyanov sat  beside me--today he is head of the Center for Regional Strategy  that he himself "conceived." And he showed me, dated 24 April,  the official record of disagreements on this subject, which bore  the signatures of the heads not only of "our" okrugs but of  other RF autonomous entities: at the level of the Russian  Federation, it will evidently be necessary to pass a common  Russian law, one for everyone.    And so! So far the record in question bears a "No" writ  large, without any hint of any consensual "Yes" in the  foreseeable future. And V. Ulyanov is prepared to argue with  anyone who cares to that the Duma will not succeed in achieving  positive success in 1994.    But the Duma members have no intention of surrendering: V.  Yudin, V. Gorodilov [? poor legibility] and Ye. Panasenkova  answered me bluntly: "We didn't come to the Duma for that!"    Time will tell. In any case, for the time being, as  paradoxical as it may seem, it is not the Duma but the governor  who is raising and aggravating the problem of unity: it was  precisely L. Roketskiy who spoke the word "referendum," and it  was he who directed the Duma deputies toward Moscow, as long as  nothing but destructive reforms are coming from there.  <H8>  On the Budget and Social Forecast </H8>   Both documents presented by the administration were agreed  to  by the Duma practically without serious amendments. And the  reason for that lay in the following circumstances.    First, as L. Roketskiy noted, the budget message has not  been  put into final form; the reason for this lies in the  inflationary processes and the behavior of the federal financial  departments, which is by no means stabilizing the situation. In  addition, all the figures will be defined more precisely in the  process of thorough examination at working meetings with the  constituent parts of the southern part of the oblast--its rayons  and cities.    Secondly, the Duma is still not prepared for dealing in  detail with such documents in the course of its brief sessions,  when only during the present session were commissions on the  budget, finances and taxes (chairman, S. Kirichuk), on social  and economic questions (commission head, V. Yudin), on questions  of legislative activity and law and order (F. Sayfitdinov), and  on regional policy and local government (S. Sheregov) formed in  a preliminary fashion. The commissions' final makeup will be  decided before 20 May.    And so these commissions will deploy their "battle  formations," and then they will see. But for the time being even  the forecast of the social and economic future is not so  reassuring, which, however, is the same thing that can be said  about the present and future of Russia as a whole.    Although personally, for myself, I noted the obvious uneven  spots and disproportions. When the revenue from privatization  that is forecast for 1994 comes to only R9.5 billion, I believe  that figure is too small and reflects only the value of the  measure that has begun to be carried out, without taking into  account the forward progress of the "privatized national  complex." The forecast under the heading "timber revenues"--just  R2.9 billion--is also too small.    On the other hand, under the "expenditures" section, a  comparison of the following figures is extremely impressive.  Whereas it is planned to spend nearly R69.1 billion for the  operations of bodies of government and administration and notary  offices, the figure of 76.74 billion rubles is not much greater  than that, but it is for culture (37.275), physical culture and  sports (5.765), social security (26.62), the mass media (1.93),  the youth policy program (2.1) and the support of science and  higher schools (3.04).    An impressive discrepancy, isn't it?    But the point is not even that, but the fact that we all  would like to catch sight of the light at the end of the tunnel.  And A. Korelyakov, member of the Tyumen Oblast Duma, literally  pestered L. Roketskiy, governor and member of the RF Federation  Council: "When will the depression in the country end?" The  latter first cited general difficulties and then said, albeit  rather floridly, in reference to oil and gas: "We in the oblast  have maintained all our forces in order to wait it out until the  next oil and gas boom. I believe it will occur in a year and a  half to two years."    And my memory immediately suggested how exactly that  forecast  coincided with the end of the current RF president's term of  office.  <H8>  ONE SENTENCE ABOUT OTHER BUSINESS </H8>   The Duma authorized its chairman N. Baryshnikov to sign the  Contract on Social Accord on its behalf.    The deputies will demand that the RF government reduce  tariffs on gas and electric power produced in our oblast for  Tyumen goods producers.    It was decided to establish additional tax breaks with  respect to the profits tax for enterprises that employ disabled  persons.    It was also decided not simply to adopt "wholesale" for  implementation all the "unfinished" measures of the former  oblast soviet, but to take a close look at that legacy and only  then to "decide and decree."    In one of his speeches L. Roketskiy uttered the phrase "poor  and unimproved Tyumen," while at the same time Tyumen mayor and  Duma deputy S. Kirichuk justifiably hopes that it is precisely  the oblast Duma that has a duty to help turn Tyumen into a  genuine oblast capital.    One gets the impression that V. Bugayev, head of the Tyumen  Rayon administration, came to the Duma to defend and "push  through" the interests of precisely his rayon, and not the  oblast.    Ye. Panasenkova, Duma deputy and chief physician of the  Zavodoukovsk Hospital, believes that it is necessary to hold  closed working sessions of the Duma, since there is evidence of  the old habit of some comrades to "work for the public." For the  public, she believes, a press conference will be sufficient.    The next session of the oblast Duma is scheduled for 15-16  June.</p>

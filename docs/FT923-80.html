			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Public sector pay limit represents desperate ploy rather than solution Sir, The government, currently standing amid the ruins of its economic policy, has now latched on to a 2 per cent limit on public sector pay as a vital element of economic recovery. The CBI has followed up with a cry for a public sector pay freeze. Your leading article on the subject (September 25) heartily endorsed such an approach while failing to identify more precisely what the costs and benefits might be. Assuming that the total public sector pay bill amounts to about Pounds 70bn, a reduction in pay awards from perhaps 3.25 per cent next year to 2 per cent would cut the pay bill by some Pounds 800m; a not insubstantial amount that might be put to good use elsewhere. However, this figure should be put into perspective. It would amount to only 0.3 per cent of the government's planned spending next year and would only reduce the PSBR by about 0.2 per cent of GDP. Its material impact on the underlying problems of the economy would therefore be minimal. Furthermore, the costs of enforcing such a limit would be high. It would wholly undermine the existing systems of pay determination in the public sector and provoke unrest at a time of relative stability. It would demotivate public servants when the government is ostensibly trying to encourage better performance from them. It would undermine attempts to improve public services. Unless applied in perpetuity it would lead to public sector workers pursuing higher claims in subsequent years to catch up with their private sector counterparts. It would not lead employers in the private sector to take similar action since they will continue to reach settlements that are mainly determined by the cost of living, their financial circumstances, and their competitors' rates. More significantly, such a pay policy would do little to stimulate economic recovery in terms of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, better training, or consumer spending. The proposal to make real cuts in the pay of public sector workers at this point must therefore represent a desperate ploy to rescue the government from its current difficulties rather than a serious attempt to address the underlying weaknesses of the economy.

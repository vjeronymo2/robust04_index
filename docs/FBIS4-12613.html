			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian-Israeli talks on the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement will resume in Cairo today. The  Palestinian side will be chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser. The  Israeli side will be chaired by General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli  deputy chief of staff.    Shim'on Peres stated that there is a great possibility of  completing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho at the  end of the current month. Peres said in an interview with the  Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ that the forces of the Israeli army  have started withdrawing from the autonomy area.    Last night, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held a meeting with  PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas.    The foreign minister stated after the meeting that the  meeting is part of the framework of the continuing  Palestinian-Egyptian coordination in the peace process. He said  that they discussed the current stage of the peace talks, which  will resume this morning. He said this new round of talks will  continue for two or three days, after which the two sides will  be able to set the date for starting implementation of the  Declaration of Principles.    PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh stated  yesterday that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles  is in its death throes. 'Abd-Rabbuh demanded that immediate  talks should be started on the final position of all the  occupied territories. He said that autonomy talks with Israel  cannot continue because it wants total hegemony over the  Palestinian police force in the occupied territories.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (12): Site offered to Glamorgan - A refuse tip may become a county cricket ground and now the development corporation has made land in the bay area available to it. If the cricketers can find the money, a ground will be developed on a site alongside the dual-carriageway which sweeps round the southern half of the city. Glamorgan hopes that, with its easy access, ample space and new stands, the proposed new ground will become not just a home for the county but also an international ground. Gwyn Stone, secretary to the club, says: 'We have identified a site where we expect to build a new ground, to international standards, within the next four years. We would like to think we could play a part as a venue for matches during the 1998 World Cup.' The search for a ground is part of a campaign to lift the performance and profile of Glamorgan cricket, drawn up by the county under its new chairman, Newport businessman Tony Morgan, working with management consultants, Andersen Consulting. The new ground holds the key to the county's long-term hopes of being successful, profitable and widely-supported. The club does not own its own ground, but uses the facilities of Cardiff Athletic Club and other club or local authority grounds elsewhere in Glamorgan and other parts of Wales. The move to its own purpose-built ground would enable the county to develop boxes and other business entertainment facilities, and to improve the seating and catering available to all spectators, something it cannot do at its current Cardiff ground in the city's Sophia Gardens. Though the county would still tour, more matches would be held in Cardiff. The new site, which is likely to cost about Pounds 10m to develop, would also include a Welsh national cricket centre and an indoor cricket school, where new talent could be nurtured. Among possibilities being considered for financing the scheme are corporate donations and the issue of debentures. Public funding might also be available, because of the ground's location within the bay area. Plans for the new ground, which could be in place three years from the decision to go ahead, have been drawn up by Cardiff architects Hoggett, Lock-Necrews, part of the international Whinney Mackay-Lewis group. Terry Hoggett and Gwyn Stone visited Durham, which only entered the first-class scene last year, to see its development plans. 'A ground such as the one Cardiff Bay offers us,' says Mr Stone, 'would be part of our overall strategy to ensure the county has good facilities for players, members and spectators. It would also be a place of national excellence, one from which club cricketers and schoolboys could benefit.' The 13-acre site - about the same size as Surrey's test arena at the Oval, in south London - could be developed along the lines of Worcester's intimate ground, Mr Stone believes, holding a full-house of about 8,000 and having a number of smallish pavilions. Offering the cricketers these 13 acres has one other advantage for Cardiff Bay. The site at the moment is the cleared remains of a refuse tip. Development for housing or industry would involve the bay's authorities in the enormous expense of clearing the site, because of the possibility of noxious fumes affecting people living and working there. Ove Arup, the consultants to Cardiff Bay, have shown that an open-air activity such as cricket would be perfectly safe and an ideal use for the area.</p>

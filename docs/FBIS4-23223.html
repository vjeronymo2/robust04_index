			<p>BFN     [Text] President Joaquim Chissano will be the first citizen  to be registered in the Mozambican capital to vote in the  forthcoming October elections. The president of the Republic  will be registered in the Josina Machel School in Maputo. About  85 percent of electoral registration posts in Maputo will begin  operating today. The process is also scheduled to begin today in  all provinces, although in some areas it will be delayed due to  logistical problems. In some provinces, the Mozambique National  Resistance has not permitted the beginning of electoral  registration in areas under its control.</p>

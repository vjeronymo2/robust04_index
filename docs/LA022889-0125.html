			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS TO FINISH OFF FUTILE MARCH AT HOME  </P> <P> The Clippers have come home, by all appearances, to finish their obituary for  the 1988-89 season.  </P> <P> They have 11 victories, second-fewest in the National Basketball Assn., but  will play 18 of their final 26 games at the Sports Arena, starting tonight  against the Philadelphia 76ers.  </P> <P> Once, when the Clippers had a forward named Danny Manning, a coach named Gene  Shue and a goal of respectability this season, that would have been something  to look forward to. Now, though, even surpassing the 1987-88 total of 17  victories appears a lofty goal. Just the same, Coach Don Casey continues to  talk optimistically.  </P> <P> "My thinking is to rejuvenate our players, to make a stand, to make our march  in March and end on a high note," he said. "We want to give the fans and the  franchise some real good feelings about the future."  </P> <P> If that's going to happen, the Clippers have to start now, and beat some good  teams in the process. They have lost nine consecutive games, 28 of 29 and are  11-45 overall. Philadelphia, tonight's opponent, trails only New York in the  Atlantic Division. Still ahead at the Sports Arena, among others, are  Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit, Boston, Golden State, the Lakers and Utah.  </P> <P> The Clippers, after losing by an average of 14.2 points on the just-completed  five-game trip, are different from the ones who left after a pair of five-point  Sports Arena losses, one in overtime.  </P> <P> For one thing, they are younger. The roster is the same, but the emphasis  isn't. The young players -- four rookies and four second-year pros -- will be  given more playing time, the better to evaluate them, especially with another  expansion draft coming up.  </P> <P> In turn, 10-year veteran Norm Nixon has seen his playing time dwindle from 26  minutes through the first 51 games to 20.8 in his last five appearances in  favor of rookies Gary Grant and Tom Garrick at point guard, just as Nixon,  returning after serious injuries, reached a level of consistently good play.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's good all the time, but we're going in the right direction  of playing competitively with the young guys, and we could win a couple with  the older guys, but where does that get us?" Casey said. "That's the issue as I  see it: When you play young people primarily, you jeopardize a victory."  </P> <P> Indeed, the young Clippers may have returned as the worst team in the NBA.  </P> <P> "There's no one problem," Casey said. "You have a rookie point guard who is  playing with rookies. . . . The young guys have not established outside games  (as shooters), Charles (Smith) is still trying to get an inside game by pro  standards, (Joe) Wolf and Reggie (Williams), after missing so much of last  season with injuries, are practically rookies because of that."  </P> <P> Will Casey strike out?  </P> <P> He remains interim coach and no decision has been made about his future, so the  final 26 games are as important to his future as any player's. He has brought a  certain enthusiasm that was missing in Shue's final weeks, but, clearly,  consistent double-digit losses can't be what owner Donald T. Sterling had in  mind when Casey was told to be competitive.  </P> <P> At the same time, the decision to lean strongly to youth came from above.  Moreover, Sterling isn't exactly rushing to douse rumors that talks have  already started to find a new coach.  </P> <P> For his part, Casey, in his first stint as a NBA head coach, refuses to spend  time worrying about the situation.  </P> <P> "The (interim) label is there," he said. "I thought when they asked me to take  it over, it was a dilemma. . . . The way it was presented to me, was to get  them to play hard and then we'll see what's best for the franchise at the end  of the year. I think we're accomplishing that, but I think along the way they'd  like to have some Ws mixed in.  </P> <P> "It has been more difficult than I thought it would be. I have talked to a lot  of coaches at games who say that I didn't know what I was in for when I took  over a team on a losing streak and with a lot of problems. In my mind, I  thought I had all the magic answers, and when they didn't occur, I got  disappointed and upset.  </P> <P> "When you're an assistant coach in this league and have not been a head coach,  you don't understand. You can't fully appreciate the dilemma of a head coach. .  . . We're talking about a team that has won 12 and 17 games the last two years.  Things like that do not change overnight."  </P></p>

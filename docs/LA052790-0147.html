			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BETTER THINGS TO DO  </P> <P> I'm in agreement with that editorial, "Hey, Let's Not Have a Cow, Man," (May  12) about some Orange County school administrators barring the Bart Simpson  shirts on their campuses.  </P> <P> It is undemocratic, unconstitutional and closed-minded to prevent students from  expressing themselves. As Assemblyman John Vasconcellos stated: "In those cases  where students do wear Bart Simpson as an expression of their self-doubt,  administrators who send them home to change are missing a great opportunity to  help."  </P> <P> Also, La Habra City School District Supt. Richard Hermann misued his authority  by banning the shirts. School officials have other things to worry about, such  as the basics of reading and writing about the right to freedom of expression.  </P> <P> JAIME B. VEGA  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

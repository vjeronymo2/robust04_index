			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GRADUATION '90;  </P> <P> CLASSICAL STUDIES;  </P> <P> A CANADIAN PHYSICIST FINDS UNDERSTANDING OF THE AGES AS A STUDENT AT THOMAS  AQUINAS COLLEGE.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Edward De Vita was living in Vancouver, B.C., earning more than  $30,000 a year as an engineering physicist. Age 32 and single, he lived in an  apartment, drove a Mazda and had good friends. Not a bad deal for most people.  But one day, he noticed some books on a friend's bookshelf, and it changed his  life.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, De Vita received his bachelor of arts degree in liberal arts from  Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula. He has spent the last four years and  $55,000 of his savings living in a dorm with a curfew, a dress code and men 10  years his junior, enrolled in a unique curriculum based solely upon selected  classics of Western civilization dating from 2500 B.C. to the early part of  this century.  </P> <P> "I came here to study the 'Great Books,' the theology and philosophy," said De  Vita, his accent betraying his Canadian origin.  </P> <P> "This was the kind of education people used to get," he said. The opportunity  of a lifetime -- to be generally, liberally educated.  </P> <P> De Vita already had a B.A. in applied engineering physics. Before deciding that  once was not enough, he had worked for nine years at a company called TRIUMF,  where he designed giant magnets for the cyclotron used in hospital treatment  that creates radioactive isotopes.  </P> <P> "In high school, I wasn't as interested in literature, but I became more  desirous of broadening my education as I got older," said De Vita. "What we  read in philosophy could be applied in math, science lab and even literature  classes."  </P> <P> Thomas Aquinas College only offers one degree, a B.A. in liberal arts. It is  one of a handful of colleges nationwide that offers a four-year curriculum  using the "Great Books" as its formidable reading list.  </P> <P> Regardless of previous education, students must enroll as freshmen. There are  no elective courses, and the responsibility for learning is on the students,  who participate in tutorials and small seminars after reading works by such  writers as Machiavelli, Descartes, Einstein and Aristotle. A professor presides  at these sessions, but learning is based upon the Socratic method of question  and answer, not lecture.  </P> <P> According to Dean Thomas E. Dillon, students read the "Great Books" in order to  understand for themselves the principles and methods of various disciplines,  rather than being told by experts what they mean.  </P> <P> "In the mathematics tutorials, we read Euclid and Apollonius on conic sections  so that we are well prepared to read the texts of Galileo and Newton  themselves," Dillon said. "Then we read Descartes' application of algebra to  geometry."  </P> <P> Students also study Latin for the first two years and read some classics in the  original language.  </P> <P> Each student is assigned a writing tutor his first year and must produce a  senior thesis. De Vita's 58-page work, "On the Nature of Time," compared the  Aristotelian and relativistic views of time.  </P> <P> Established in 1971, Thomas Aquinas College is a private, coeducational  independent Catholic school not affiliated with any religious order or diocese.  Although about 90% of the students are Catholic, participation in religious  activities is not required.  </P> <P> Enrollment is 176, there are 18 faculty members, and classes have 14 to 18  students.  </P> <P> Despite the rigorous curriculum, about 70% of the students complete the  four-year program compared to 20% in traditional colleges. While Dillon  observed that "students don't come here to get a job after four years," he  added that a higher percentage of their alumni go on to graduate and  professional schools than from traditional college programs.  </P> <P> Nestled on 163 rolling acres adjoining Los Padres National Forest, the college  has few distractions aside from the sounds of nature. Thomas Aquinas is a  residential campus with a goal of fostering a 24-hour educational process. With  rare exceptions, such as married students, everyone lives in the dorms all four  years. To show respect for their pursuits, students do not wear jeans or  sneakers outside of sporting events. Women wear dresses or skirts, and men  avoid collarless T-shirts. In class, students are addressed as Mr. or Miss.  Possession of alcohol or drugs is strictly forbidden, along with any dorm  visitation by members of the opposite gender.  </P> <P> Students are encouraged to help each other with their education.  </P> <P> "Ed's mature, got a wealth of wisdom and is very affable and quick-witted.  People come to him for almost everything," said David Houseal, De Vita's  26-year-old roommate.  </P> <P> "When papers are due, I'll come in at night and find three or four guys on the  bed asking questions," said Houseal. "Because he's had more life experience and  is a bright man, Ed can make sense out of a lot of things."  </P> <P> Besides study groups, men and women students socialize at school dances,  intramural coeducational sports and recreational activities such as horseback  riding and hiking.  </P> <P> Despite the age difference, De Vita has made friends and become involved in  many aspects of campus life.  </P> <P> "Do I dance? Not very well, but I give it the old college try," he said. "But  the lambada is out."  </P> <P> De Vita plays classical guitar and enjoys hockey, tennis and chess. He was the  college's volunteer choir director and helped select videos for campus  screenings.  </P> <P> "Ed has a good sense of humor and a dry wit. He's good at impersonations and  voices." said Carl Schmitt, 22.  </P> <P> "He does a great Bogart," said John Goyette, 20. "Ed loves old, classic films."  </P> <P> Both classmates were very impressed that De Vita returned to school because he  felt he had missed out on a liberal arts education.  </P> <P> De Vita is not the only older student at the college. About 10 students ages 26  to 31 are currently enrolled, and this fall, two 26-year-old freshmen with  business degrees will join them.  </P> <P> De Vita said that coming from a more mature perspective required an adjustment.  "For the first month, I thought I had made a mistake. For instance, in the  classroom, the younger students were more rambunctious."  </P> <P> But he is glad he stayed. The product of a strong Italian Catholic background,  De Vita now is considering entering the priesthood after returning home this  summer. He would eventually like to teach in a program similar to that of his  new alma mater.  </P> <P> One thing's for sure. Those books made an impression on De Vita.  </P> <P> "I want to reread Homer's 'Iliad.' "  </P></p>

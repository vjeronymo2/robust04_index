			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Byatt leaves the tap on Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, will take more flak from environmental groups than from the City after yesterday's price review. Most of the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies should be able to deliver real dividend growth of perhaps 3-4 per cent through the second half of the decade. That should satisfy even the institutions which had urged the industry to stand its ground. Cash flows should support capital spending without pushing gearing to uncomfortable levels or prompting rights issues. Yesterday's rally in the sector is more than justified. Yet not all the companies have benefitted equally. Mr Byatt's trick of pleasing investors while keeping water bills relatively low has been achieved by paring capital expenditure to the bone and setting demanding efficiency targets. Companies that anticipated this by trying to keep capital spending low (in the case of Welsh) or being rigorous in pursuit of efficiency (especially North West) have been rewarded. South West, which asked the regulator to sanction large increases in household bills to fund an ambitious capital programme, has come off worst. Even if it misjudged the regulatory game, though, South West has reason to feel hard done by. Its appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will be on the basis that spending allowed by the regulator - barely 40 per cent of what the company asked for - is insufficient to meet legal obligations. But the real fight will be over Mr Byatt's methodology. His approach in assessing the capital value of the companies at flotation - market capitalisation less cash - is particularly cruel to South West, which was endowed with cash to cover its particularly large environmental spending needs. It gives an initial value of around Pounds 150m, which looks unrealistically low and therefore exaggerates its actual return on capital. The MMC must decide whether to overturn a methodology which produced roughly the right answer in nine out of 10 cases.</p>

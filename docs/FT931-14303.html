			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Daiwa Bank downgraded THE senior long-term rating of Daiwa Bank was downgraded yesterday from A1 to Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, which referred to 'uncertainty' over the leading Japanese commercial bank's asset quality. The downgrading highlights continuing doubts about the health of Japanese banks, whose non-performing loans and those of their affiliates, have risen as sharply as property and stock prices have fallen. Moody's said the amount of Daiwa's lending to the domestic property market 'remains significant in relation to its comparatively weak core earnings' and the bank could face further problems if asset prices continue to decline. Moody's also downgraded the long-term rating of Fujitsu, the Japanese computer company, from A2 to Aa3, citing concern over its earnings potential given the softening of demand for mainframe computers.</p>

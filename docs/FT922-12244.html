			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (22): It's hard to explain, but Z is much clearer than English - IBM UK/Oxford University Computing Laboratory IT MIGHT not be very easy to understand, but Z notation has quietly spread its influence to computerised applications in in daily use by people across the world. In conjunction with a programming application called the Customer Information Control System (CICS), it has saved costs, improved quality and reliability - and been driven by an impressive collaboration between academia and industry. At least the assessors of the Queen's award for technology managed to wade through sufficient technicalities in their decision to present a prize jointly to IBM UK Laboratories and Oxford University Computing Laboratory (the first time a university department has won a second award). For most people, comprehension of CICS and Z notation rapidly fades away. 'It's always a problem trying to explain,' sighs Mr Tony King, a press officer with IBM, wearily. 'It's something invisible, but used unknowingly by millions every day.' CICS, which Mr King calls 'one of the most successful pieces of hardware in the world', is a family of software products used for managing business information involving a large volume of transactions. It is 'enabling' software which exists between the operating system that drives computer hardware and any specific computer program designed for a particular application. It is designed to process great quantities of information with accuracy, integrity and speed. It is an essential part of the driving force behind cashpoint machines, and crops up in retail, insurance, airline and a wide range of other applications. CICS, which was developed by IBM, has been in use for a number of years, with initial applications during the 1970s. The IBM Laboratories at Hursley Park in Hampshire - which previously won a technology award in 1988 for entirely different work - employ 1,500 people and have had worldwide responsibility for CICS since 1975. As demands for the use of CICS grew more sophisticated and complex - driven by developments in both hardware and software - programmers faced difficulties. Limitations in the techniques they were using to prepare the code restricted their ability to take advantage of the latest developments. The main problem was that the specifications for CICS - the requirements and instructions used as the basis on which the program is written - were being drawn up in the English language. With the latest versions of CICS running to 800,000 lines of program code, English was fast proving itself not up to the task. 'English is ambiguous, woolly and incomplete,' says Mr Paul Mundy, a development programmer for CICS at IBM. 'When you use it to write a description of what's going to happen, it is liable to different interpretations and it may leave things out. It is often far too sketchy.' At the same time, he stresses, any attempt to use a simpler, higher level computer code instead of English is also fraught with problems. 'When you write something in a pseudo-code, you have already taken some of the decisions about how the software will work.' The challenge was overcome after a chance meeting at a conference in 1981 between Mr Tony Kenny, CICS manager at IBM, and Professor Tony Hoare, of the programming research group at the Oxford University computing laboratory. An initial research contract has been expanded and developed ever since, forging a collaboration that has now been in operation for more than a decade. The Oxford team were had been developing a theoretical,mathematically-based language called Z notation, which is based on elementary set theory and logic. With IBM, they had the chance to test it out with a major industrial application. By working together with IBM's software engineers, the Oxford academics could examine CICS and gain a detailed understanding of its operations and future requirements. They were able to modify and expand Z notation as a result. 'With Z you are much more certain,' says Mr Mundy. 'You have an unambiguous, understandable, complete description of what is going to happen. It is abstract and doesn't force you to make any design decisions. Problems can be found much earlier and more cheaply.' Even so, Z still allows the use of English alongside more mathematical concepts. 'It's not just a bunch of hieroglyphics,' he says. The first product launched using Z notation to specify the CICS requirements showed both a significant increase in quality and a reduction in development costs. Z itself has not had to evolve very far since the early days. But it has been extended as CICS continues to be transformed over time. Work is now under way to standardise Z, with a draft version being prepared for the British Standards Institute. 'The work that has won the award is at the frontiers of software development,' says Dr Geoff Robinson, director of the IBM Hursley Laboratory. 'We are proud and grateful to have been associated with Oxford University. I believe will continue to be a partnership of great mutual benefit.' Prof Hoare at Oxford adds: 'Our long-term partnership has contributed simultaneously to commercial advantage, to the progress of pure science and to the improvement of academic education.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik by an  unidentified correspondent in Brussels on 3 February--recorded;  monitored in progress]    [Excerpts] [Luik] [passage omitted] Yesterday [2 February],  I  also had a meeting with Mr. [Hans] Van der Broek, the European  Union's foreign affairs commissioner. This was also an  exceptionally successful meeting. We discussed mainly Estonia  joining the European Union via an association agreement.    [Correspondent] A document has now been signed, but what  steps are now expected from us? What do we need to do to be  suitable partners to NATO, so to speak?    [Luik] A suitable partner must present a document about our  major needs for the building of the defense forces in Estonia.  Work on drafting this document has already begun in Tallinn. A  corresponding NATO team is in Tallinn today to provide us with  preliminary advice on composing such a document. Then we will  put this document together--our Foreign and Defense Ministries.  We will definitely also involve members of parliament and  experts. The document must fairly precisely list the needs  existing for the Estonian defense forces at the moment. NATO  will then select the aspects where it can provide support.    [Correspondent] Did this unfortunate fact also come up in  your discussions--that the Estonian-Russian round of talks, from  which quite a lot was in fact expected--ended, in essence, with  a fat zero? A timetable for the troop withdrawal was not  presented.    [Luik] Yes, this came up at the European Union, as well as  at  NATO. I also spoke about this to journalists at a news  conference. This is, of course, extremely unfortunate, and  everybody I met expressed amazement that the Russian side had  failed to produce the relevant documents. At the moment, it  seems that the Russian side is violating one of its basic  promises, not to link the troop withdrawal to any other issues.  A clearly evident link has been made between the troop  withdrawal and the fate of military pensioners. This is a link  we cannot accept, and this is what I have also said here in  Brussels.</p>

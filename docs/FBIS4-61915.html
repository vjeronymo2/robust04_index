			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" article: "The New Order. Rich and Poor </F> Countries Stand By Their Interests"]    [Excerpts] The contours of the new world economic order  have been outlined in the Moroccan city of Marrakech where a  meeting has been held of trade, foreign, and agriculture  ministers from 112 of the 125 countries in the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade and also countries with associate member  status.    Russia, which has lodged an application to join the  agreement  in June this year, participated in this meeting as an observer  and carefully following the course of the sessions. In the  opinion of foreign economic relations specialists, the Russian  Federation's entry into GATT has enormous significance from the  viewpoint of integrating the country into the world economy.  Let us remind readers that approximately 90 percent of the  total volume of world trade is handled by GATT member countries,  whose collectively formulated decisions ensure greater  predictability of trading volumes. It is no secret that Russia  is encountering harsh protectionist measures from international  markets designed to prevent its commodities being imported.  This applies in particular to Europe, which receives the  majority of our country's trade turnover. In order to uphold  the interests of our domestic enterprises on the world market  and negotiate with our trading partners on an equal basis (in  accordance with procedures formulated by GATT over the decades),  we need to participate in GATT, an organization which we intend  to tie ourselves to -- following established practice -- not for  weeks or months but for a much lengthier period of time.  [passage omitted]    For Russia, full GATT membership will mean that it will  become impossible for us to arbitrarily set import tariffs  designed, generally speaking, to protect our domestic producers'  interests.

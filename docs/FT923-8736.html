			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Swiss go border-hopping in search of food bargains: Subsidies for Alpine farming are producing high prices and more 'consumer tourists' EUROPEAN consumers appear to be much more savvy and less inhibited than they used to be about crossing borders in search of lower prices. A recent study in Switzerland estimates that Swiss food retailers could lose about SFr1bn (Pounds 400m) in custom this year - or about Pounds 60 per Swiss resident - to supermarkets in neighbouring EC countries. To those unfamiliar with Swiss agricultural policy, it may seem odd that anyone would want to buy food in the European Community, where the notorious Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) keeps market prices for most farm products far above international market levels. But Switzerland's farm supports are much more generous than even those provided by the CAP, reflecting the higher costs of production in small mountainside farms and a national consensus that preservation of the Alpine way of life is a good thing. Food prices are on average 50 per cent lower in Germany and France than in Switzerland. As most Swiss live close to a border with an EC country, the practice of shopping in the neighbouring country has long existed. However, it used to be on a modest scale, partly because people were less mobile and partly because the Swiss border guards were thorough in inspecting incoming motorists to see if, for example, they were breaching the severe limit of 0.5kg of meat per person. According to a University of Basle study sponsored by Coop Schweiz*, the amount of such shopping has soared in the past couple of years, with the value of foreign purchases up roughly 40 per cent. Coop, the second largest Swiss food retailer, says that most of it is concentrated in only a few products. It estimates that Swiss consumers this year will spend in neighbouring countries SFr100m on butter and oils, SFr200m on milk and cheese products, SFr250m on wines and spirits and SFr300m on meat. While the study attributes this spending mainly to the excessive prices of agricultural products in Switzerland, it mentions several new factors. For example, German and French supermarket companies have become much more aggressive in appealing to Swiss consumers. Their advertisements in Swiss media stress that there is not even any need to change currency. Swiss francs are welcome. Also, trans-border consumers have found that as their numbers have increased, weary Swiss customs officers have become increasingly nonchalant over inspections. That in turn has encouraged many more to play the game. Until recently, it was mainly the 1.8m Swiss who live close to the German and French borders who participated, but now even those living in the middle of the country are joining in. According to the study, one in 10 residents of Lucerne goes across the borders at least once a year to buy food. Obviously, this is having a significant effect on the trade of Swiss retailers. Coop points out that SFr1bn is equivalent to one third of its annual sales. It also means lost sales for Swiss farmers. Sales of Swiss meat and dairy products are flat in spite of a growing population. The growth of consumer tourism is also working in the other direction. A surging flow of Italian motorists from adjacent Lombardy seeking cheap petrol has forced the cantonal government in Ticino to close access roads at night. A year ago, following a petrol tax increase in Germany, business in the forecourts of north Switzerland surged. According to Erdol-Vereinigung, the Swiss petroleum industry association, about 13 per cent of all petrol sold in Switzerland is bought by visitors from neighbouring countries. That represents a retail value of about SFr700m a year. The tax take from this is sufficiently large to make the Swiss tax collector worry about how much much he can raise petrol taxes in Switzerland without jeopardising his windfall gain. German, French and Italian consumers also like to buy cigarettes in Switzerland, as tax there represents only 50 per cent of the retail price. The Swiss Tobacco Merchants Association says its members in border areas do brisker business than those elsewhere, but it has no clear idea of how significant the cross-border trade is or how fast it is growing. In the capital markets these days, differences in prices for identical securities on different bourses tend to be eliminated in seconds by arbitrageurs. But governments have hitherto been able to block effective arbitrage in the retail trade of consumer products even when differentials have been very large. The Swiss experience suggests that this is becoming more difficult. If so, the creation of the single EC market is well timed. Switzerland, of course, is not an EC member and even if it approves the creation of an expanded free trade area, the European Economic Area, next year, nothing much will change because trade in food products is excluded from the pact. Presumably the Swiss government could reduce the haemorrhage on its food account by stiffening border controls. But as Coop points out, at a time when Bern is promoting liberalisation of markets and increased harmony with the EC, this would be a strange response. * Consumer Tourism and Switzerland's Retail Food Market, Department of Economics, University of Basle.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SWITZERLAND AND EC PRICE DIFFERENTIALS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Product prices in SFr          % Price difference Product   Switzerland   Germany    France     Germany      France  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pork         27.15/kg  15.60/kg  13.35/kg       -42.5       -50.8 Beef         39.35/kg  20.55/kg  21.40/kg       -47.8       -45.6 Milk         1.90/ltr  1.10/ltr  1.40/ltr       -42.1       -26.3 Cheese       25.00/kg  11.20/kg  14.35/kg       -55.2       -42.6 Butter       16.75/kg   6.80/kg   8.00/kg       -59.4       -52.2 Oil          4.50/ltr  1.50/ltr  1.70/ltr       -66.7       -62.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Economics, University of Basle, for Coop Schweiz  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

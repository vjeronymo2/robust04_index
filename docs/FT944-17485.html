			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries little changed ahead of jobs data After three turbulent sessions, the US Treasury market took a breather as traders awaited this morning's jobs data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off 1/32 at 94 7/8 , with the yield rising to 7.944 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.704 per cent. With no important economic news on offer, attention turned to today's report on the labour market last month. Economists are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 250,000, which would suggest moderate growth. An increase that exceeded that level would probably trigger fresh declines, especially in long-dated bonds, traders said. In recent sessions, fixed-rate investors have become concerned that the Federal Reserve is allowing the economy to grow too fast to contain inflation. If the payroll increase exceeded 300,000, many are predicting the Fed would act immediately to put up short-term rates. Anxieties over the economy's strength and its implications for monetary policy have upset the market for weeks. Yesterday provided an opportunity to regroup before a crucial piece of evidence arrived. A firmer dollar and receding commodity prices provided a calming backdrop, allowing traders to ignore the release of September sales data from leading retailers. Two snapshots on jobs allowed the market to appreciate a little during the morning. The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefit had risen by 7,000 last week and the Conference Board said its 'help-wanted' advertising index had declined from July to in August, adding that there are signs the labour market is cooling in the second half. But there was not enough activity to sustain the upturn and prices quickly receded. European government bonds won a small reprieve yesterday, recouping some of their recent losses in moderate turnover. Weaker-than-expected economic data in Germany and the UK lent some support, but traders said most of the gains came from short-covering after Wednesday's sharp sell-off. They said investors remained reluctant to commit themselves to any new positions so close to today's keenly awaited US employment numbers, which many fear could trigger another interest rate increase by the Fed. UK gilts once again outperformed most of Europe. The December long gilt future on Liffe rose  21/32 to 99. Gilts received a boost from lower than expected industrial production and manufacturing output data, which indicated that the economy is not overheating and eased fears of inflation and monetary tightening. This boosted especially the short end of the yield curve, where the December contract rose by 0.12 to 93.30. 'People realise that even if rates go up, they won't rise as sharply as was factored in earlier,' said Mr Adrian James, of NatWest Markets. Gilts gained further support from continued buying by UK pension funds and some continental investors. The 10-year gilt spread over bunds narrowed again, to 127 basis points from 133 on Wednesday. German bunds recovered some of Wednesday's losses, with the December bund future on Liffe ending about 0.27 points higher on the day. Support came from news of a 2.2 per cent drop in manufacturing orders for August. However, with bunds overshadowed by the elections and key US data, dealers see little scope for clear progress until the second half of the month. French bonds ended a shortened session slightly higher after dealings were halted around lunchtime when union workers from French car manufacturer Renault occupied the trading floor. Italian bonds bounced back from Wednesday's precipitous fall, with the BTP future on Liffe rising some 0.54 points to 97.85. However, the market is likely to remain jittery amid political tensions and uncertainty over the budget bill's parliamentary approval.</p>

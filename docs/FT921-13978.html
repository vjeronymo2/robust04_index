			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Circulation is not a problem Sir, Your report on the Pounds 125m management buy-out at the Birmingham Post &amp; Mail (January 3) referred to the Birmingham Post as 'the problem paper of the group'. While it is undoubtedly true that every newspaper seeks to attract new readers the Birmingham Post is widely read by the most influential men and women in the West Midlands and, as a result, it is generally recognised as an important advertising vehicle. As the Financial Times will testify, a relatively low sales figure does not mean that a newspaper cannot be profitable. To say that the Birmingham Post is 'the problem paper of the group' when compared with the mass circulation Evening Mail is a little like calling the Financial Times a problem paper because it is out-sold by the Sun. Nigel Hastilow, deputy editor, Birmingham Post, 28 Colmore Circus, Queensway, Birmingham B4 6AX</p>

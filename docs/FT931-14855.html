			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Dutch investment group takes over Bank of Athens HANWHA First Investment, the Dutch-based investment subsidiary of Korea's Hanwha group, is to take control of Bank of Athens, a small state-owned bank offered for sale under the Greek government's privatisation programme. Hanwha, bidding in partnership with Rabo Bank of the Netherlands, offered Dr6.8bn (Dollars 34m) for 66.7 per cent of the bank's common shares in the first privatisation carried out through a public tender offer on the Athens stock exchange. Hanwha's bid of Dr6,180 per share for 1,106,020 shares of common stock was ahead of Dr6,150 offered by Eteva, a Greek investment bank which made the only other bid. Minority shareholders were given an opportunity to accept the offer before the state-owned National Bank of Greece, which controls 75 per cent of Bank of Athens equity, released its shares for sale. Hanwha, a Korean conglomerate with interests in financial services, chemicals and oil products, is the first Asian investor in Greek banking. Bank of Athens had profits of Dr2.06bn for 1991. First-half profits last year declined by 9 per cent to Dr1.01bn.</p>

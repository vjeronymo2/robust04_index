			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Post Office presses for sell-off decision The Post Office yesterday urged the government to change its ownership 'without delay' if privatisation is favoured as the best way to give it more commercial freedom. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, said: 'If privatisation is the means by which the government decide to give us more freedom, let's have it as soon as possible. Any further delay would be very damaging.' His outspoken remarks, which came on the eve of today's inquiry into the Post Office by the Commons trade and industry committee, are aimed at injecting a note of urgency into the government's decision-making process. They also reflect concern that, unless a bill to privatise the corporation is put forward in the next session of parliament, it is unlikely to take place before the next general election. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is to appear before the committee today. He is expected to tell MPs that the government's own review into the Post Office, which has taken 19 months, is nearly complete. The Post Office hopes today's committee meeting will put pressure on Mr Heseltine to bring the DTI review to an immediate conclusion in favour of privatisation. Post Office managers have always said the ownership of the corporation is a matter for the government. However, they are understood to have told ministers that privatisation is the only option which would enable them to take on international competitors. Mr Heseltine is understood to have ruled out privatisation for the foreseeable future. Mr Cockburn and Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, are expected to press him to give the corporation more commercial freedom. Mr Heron said restrictions were giving foreign rivals the opportunity to poach key customers and forge ahead. 'Government restrictions on the Post Office are giving aggressive foreign sales teams the opportunity to poach key Royal Mail customers,' he said. 'This could lead to higher prices, lower quality and the threat of job losses.' He will today tell MPs that the days when UK companies automatically looked no further than the Royal Mail for mailing services have gone. The Mail Users' Association, which represent more than 100 businesses, described the government's new financial targets for the Royal Mail - equal to a 2p tax on every letter - and its refusal to give it more commercial freedom as 'a recipe for disaster'. The Post Office Users National Council warned that the Post Office faced a crisis if the government did not change the financial regime under which it operates. Decision in the post, Page 18</p>

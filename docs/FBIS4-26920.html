			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Jingyue (1776 0079 6460) and correspondent </F> Zhou Xiangyu (0719 7449 3768)]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- At a forum on  consolidation and reform of business operations sponsored by the  General Staff Department today, Zhang Wannian, member of the  Central Military Commission [CMC] and chief of general staff,  stressed that consolidation and reform of military-run business  operations represents a major policy decision the CMC has  adopted on the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army  building, the overall interests of the party and state, the  military's fundamental functions, and its long-term development.  The General Staff Department must play an exemplary leading  role in the consolidation and reform.    Zhang Wannian said: Consolidation and reform of business  operations has a bearing on the preservance of our military's  nature and objectives and on the overall interest of army  building and national development. It is a solemn political  task. We must unswervingly attend to this task with a high  sense of responsibility for the army, the state, and the people  and carry out this task through to the end until success.    Zheng Wannian pointed out: The CMC and its chairman Jiang  Zemin have emphasized repeatedly that it is necessary to run the  military with strict discipline. The crux of the various tasks  in the military lies in implementation. We must implement the  guidelines of the various CMC decisions to the letter and  accomplish the task of consolidating and reforming production  and operations with high quality work and high standards. While  enhancing discipline in production and operations, efforts  should be made to conduct education or rectification in regard  to weak points in work of military organs. Special attention  should be paid to units that are not supposed to engage in  business operations as well as consolidation and reform of  business operations run by army units stationed in the special  economic zones.</p>

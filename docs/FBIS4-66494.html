			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] Tests are officially under way on the thermal  structural model of the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite  (ADEOS), which is being developed with Mitsubishi Electric Corp.  serving as the prime contractor for the National Aerospace  Development Agency of Japan (NASDA).    The functional performance checks of the ADEOS satellite  with  various sensors and electrical systems carried on board have  already been confirmed using the engineering model (test model  No. 1). The purpose of the thermal structural model is to check  whether the satellite can withstand harsh changes in the space  environment by testing the model in a simulated environment.    Various tests are scheduled to be completed by the end of  FY93, and the manufacture of the actual satellite (to be  launched) will start in the autumn of next year if the test  results are good, to be ready for the first launch scheduled in  February 1996.    ADEOS is intended for obtaining global-scale observation  data  on environmental changes such as global warming, destruction of  the ozone layer, receding of tropical rain forests, occurrence  of abnormal weather, etc., in order to contribute to and help  the international earth environment observation. It also employs  innovations such as data relays between satellites, which will  be an essential factor in the earth observation system of the  next generation, in order to improve space advancement  technology itself. This research and development of this  satellite started in the early '90s, and the total investment is  expected to reach &yen;80 billion.    Eight different kinds of sensors are carried on ADEOS in  order to observe the land and sea areas, as well as the  atmosphere. The sensors have been developed by manufacturers  involved in space activities such as Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and  NEC.    The tests using the thermal structure model will be  conducted  at NASDA's Tsukuba Space Center. They are to verify whether the  satellite itself can function as specified in a space  environment whose temperatures range from 200C to  -200C and whether the command system can withstand the  vacuum that is simulated by the test facility.</p>

A  small piece of information that may appear insignificant to  citizens may lead to important positive results for the security  agencies, he said.    Speaking after honoring three citizens who helped in the  arrest of terrorist Sayyid Salah Sayyid Sulayman, who is  suspected in the unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Prime  Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, the minister praised the positive  contribution of the Egyptian public. He said that the  successful efforts of security forces at this stage depend on  cooperation from the public.    Al-Alfi said the enlightened Egyptian masses have realized  that confronting the challenges facing the homeland requires  unity against all criminal attempts against the security of the  country and the safety of the citizens.    [In a Cairo-datelined report, Paris AFP in English at 1642  GMT adds: "Three informers on Saturday shared a reward of  $30,000 for the arrest of nine suspects in the attempted  assassination of Egypt's Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi."]</p>

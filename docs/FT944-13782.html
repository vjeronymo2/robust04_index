			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / MPs spark row over risk from 'green' fuel An all-party committee of MPs and the UK oil industry became embroiled in a fierce argument yesterday over whether unleaded petrol poses more of a threat to health than the leaded petrol it set out to replace. The row broke out after the Commons transport committee called for a ban on the sale of super unleaded petrol, and a government review of 'premium' unleaded, after scientific evidence showed it to be more likely to cause cancer than leaded fuel. The MPs' findings, contained in a report into air pollution in London, overturn many popular assumptions about the use of 'green' petrol. Their report came on the eve of the publication of a detailed study of the impact of the car on the environment by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. A principal issue identified by the inquiry was the use of additional 'aromatics', an important component of petrol, in the blending of unleaded fuels. Aromatics such as benzene have been linked with cancer. Many motorists using unleaded petrol 'are chucking out greater quantities of pollutants than an old banger', the transport committee said. The UK Petroleum Industry Association, representing 15 large oil companies, denied there was any justification for banning super unleaded petrol. Apart from the lead, there was no significant difference between unleaded petrol and four-star leaded petrol. Additional aromatics had not been added to replace the lead, it said. The MPs urged that super unleaded, used in high-performance engines, should be phased out by the end of 1996. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, and Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, expressed surprise at the criticisms in the report. Transport Related Air Pollution in London. HMSO.

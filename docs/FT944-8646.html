			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Capital spending cutbacks batter construction groups - Construction Japan's construction contractors are continuing to suffer from industry's long abstinence from capital investment, but their performance seems to have passed its worst. The country's leading contractors yesterday reported a sharp fall in profits for the six months to the end of September, but said order books were starting to grow again for the first time in four years. Capital expenditure accounts for 75 per cent of the turnover at the leading companies, and so an increase in revenues from housing construction could not offset a fall in office building business and lower private investment projects. Delays in the government's budgetary process caused a slump in public works projects. Among the four largest companies, only Kajima was able to increase sales in the period. However, the overall decline in turnover was less than expected  -combined sales at the four companies fell by 5 per cent - and Kajima and Obayashi both raised their recurring profit forecasts slightly for the full year. Profits for the first half were still well below last year's already depressed levels, however. Aggregate recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - at the big four fell by more than 15 per cent as intense competition in the sector forced prices down. However, a revival in private sector capital investment plans led to a 16 per cent rise in order books at Taisei, while Obayashi's orders were down slightly. Kajima alone reported a steep fall, as the company was shut out of public works projects because of its involvement in bribery cases. Capital spending by Japanese corporations expanded rapidly in the late 1980s, as asset prices increased and companies borrowed heavily to finance growth. Since 1990, however, investment has collapsed along with asset prices. The share of non-housing building in gross national product has fallen to 4.2 per cent, its lowest level for 35 years. The decline has forced companies to restructure, reducing staff levels and administrative costs. However, Mr Bernard Siman, construction analyst at UBS in Tokyo, said capital expenditure was expected to increase as the economy began a gradual recovery. 'These results suggest that with orders rising and margins improving, thanks to rising prices and restructuring efforts, the contractors' performance should improve substantially over the next few years,' he said.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                INTERIM RESULTS TO SEPTEMBER 1994 (YBN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                          Shimizu    Kajima    Obayashi   Taisei  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sales                     878.0     837.9      740.9     675.8 Change on year (%)         -8.1      +5.2       -5.7     -14.4 Recurring profits*         38.9      31.0       27.9      15.2 Change on year (%)        -20.7      -2.6      -25.7     -52.5 Forecast, year             33.0      62.0       43.0      35.0 Change on year (%)        -72.6      -8.0      -25.0     -52.0 Net profits                11.6       6.0        8.5       5.6 Change on year (%)        -25.0     -59.5      -25.0     -59.6 Forecast, year             10.0      10.0       11.0      13.0 Change on year (%)         -4.0      -1.1       +0.6      27.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *Before extraordinary items and tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

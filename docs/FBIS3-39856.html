			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt by </F> correspondent Jan Mosander in Hamburg; date not given]    [Text] Prime Minister Carl Bildt today discussed EU  negotiations when he met German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  in Hamburg during the Christian Democratic Union Congress there.  One of the questions during the meeting was the hardening  Swedish EU membership negotiations where Spain among others has  thrown a wrench into the works; but Carl Bildt does not want to  talk about a crisis in the negotiations.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are on our way toward a  decisive  stage in the negotiations, and therefore it is natural that  there are difficulties both when the Twelve are formulating  their positions and tensions between the Twelve and the  different countries seeking membership -- it can be Sweden or  Austria or Finland or Norway depending what the questions are.  And if we do what Helmut Kohl and I have done, we say that we  need political strength on both sides for this to succeed, but  we both believe that this will be managed.    [Mosander] Have you asked the big boys, Helmut Kohl and  Germany, to help in pressurizing Spain?    [Bildt] No, I have not. But during the whole of this process  we have had very close contacts with the German Government, as  with other governments, and it is clear that we will do this  also at the final stage.    [Mosander] You definitely believe that this will be solved  by  1 March?    [Bildt] I have great hopes that the decisive round of  negotiations we are now entering, only now, during these days in  Brussels, and then after that we have a meeting of Nordic  premiers on Friday [25 February], this will lead to success,  definitely.

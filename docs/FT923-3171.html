			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Australians win gold mines access A SMALL Australian company said yesterday it had won the first foreign stake in Russia's closely guarded gold mining industry by paying Dollars 200m (Pounds 101.5m) for a deal giving it access to the country's largest proven hardrock deposit. Star Technology Systems said a joint stock company in which it holds 31 per cent would have exclusive rights to develop Sukhoi Log, a prime mine with unexploited reserves estimated at 1bn tonnes of gold ore (with a yield of 2.5 grammes per tonne). Feasibility work on development is expected to start next year. Lenzoloto, the state-owned enterprise which holds the licence to Sukhoi Log, produced 10 tonnes from its existing alluvial mining operations last year. But it has sought a foreign investor to improve its efficiency and start work on Sukhoi Log, which could yield 20 tonnes a year by 1996. The registration of the new joint stock company, also called Lenzoloto, ended a battle with and among Russian authorities over whether Sukhoi Log should be offered to other potential bidders. The deal is an impressive coup as standing behind Star is a tiny listed company called Central Mining Corporation, which made losses in 1989, 1990, and 1991 and was suspended from the Australian stock exchange from November to April this year. It is also a victory for Lenzoloto, which encountered fierce resistance to bringing in foreigners of its own choice from Russia's collapsing state gold mining monopoly structure, Rossalmazzoloto.</p>

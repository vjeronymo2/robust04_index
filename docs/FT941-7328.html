			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Lack of consensus plagues councils shake-up The government's attempt to re-draw the map of English local government on the back of consensus by local politicians looks certain to fail. In at least nine counties - Cheshire, Cumbria, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and West Sussex - county councillors are refusing to agree to abandon the two-tier system of districts and counties, while district councils want the areas to be carved into all-purpose 'unitary' authorities. Pressure from local Conservative MPs could be critical to the outcome in these areas. Consensus has been reached on some significant changes. Several cities and large towns - including Brighton and Hove, Leicester, Milton Keynes, Stoke-on-Trent and Plymouth - seem certain to become all-purpose authorities, in a return to the status many once enjoyed as county boroughs. Several counties - including Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, Hertfordshire and Shropshire - also seem certain to abandon the two-tier structure, although there is still room for disagreement over the shape of the new unitary authorities. But the failure of many areas to reach any agreement is bad news for the government, which aims to set up new authorities for 30 per cent of rural England by May next year, with the rest to follow in May 1996. It believes this can only be done if councils present consensus plans to the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, changed his guidance to Sir John last September after his plans for the first tranche of counties had met with fierce criticism from local interest groups. The commission is now to give priority to locally agreed proposals. If no agreement can be thrashed out locally the commission and the government will be left to impose one. The Association of District Councils supports the government's preferred position of creating unitary bodies, and has urged its members to agree mergers. Districts are doing so, although in most counties they are keeping the number of mergers to a minimum. The Association of County Councils initially objected to altering the two-tier structure and now recommends its members to look for new unitary councils that are as large as possible. Even counties that are volunteering to split into unitary bodies find themselves in dispute with local districts. Cambridgeshire, for example, is in favour of two unitaries, while the districts want five. Oxfordshire hopes to become one large unitary county, with more power devolved to towns and parishes, while similar proposals are being explored by Surrey, where districts have announced plans for five or six unitary bodies. Disputes are becoming increasingly acrimonious, with both sets of authorities accusing their rivals of overspending on publicity and propaganda. Huntingdonshire District Council and Kent and Surrey county councils have been accused by local rivals of spending too much on local 'information campaigns'. Big cities have the strongest case for unitary status, as metropolitan authorities in London, the West Midlands, South and West Yorkshire and Manchester and Merseyside are already unitary. Several counties therefore seem content to allow cities to become unitary, but to keep the rest of the area unchanged. Devon is likely to allow Plymouth to become unitary, but will probably call for a continued two-tier structure for the rest of the county. Staffordshire and Leicestershire are likely to make similar proposals for Stoke-on-Trent and Leicester. Yet districts are unlikely to concur with 'doughnut' agreements, and in Devon they strongly support creating six new unitary authorities. In Wiltshire, Thamesdown District Council, which includes Swindon, is likely to become unitary, while Bournemouth, Luton and Bedford also seem certain to be part of unitary structures. But Hampshire is holding out against even a 'doughnut' arrangement and wants Portsmouth and Southampton to stay within the two-tier system for the rest of the county. Support is growing among several counties and a few districts, such as Congleton in Cheshire, for compromising by reforming the two-tier structure to remove anomalies and transfer some powers to the districts. The argument is that this could achieve many of the benefits of reorganisation without the costs and confusion. The ACC's vice-chair, Ms Josie Farrington, believes that this could be achieved within the commission's legal framework. But Mr David Curry, the local government minister, believes improvements to the two-tier system are disallowed by the legislation which framed the review. The ADC strongly backs Mr Curry. Mrs Margaret Singh, the chairman, said 'minor grace and favour' concessions from the counties would be unacceptable. With compromises hard to find, the government may soon be in the position it wanted most to avoid - arbiter of an increasingly heated struggle between entrenched interests.</p>

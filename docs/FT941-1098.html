			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Rescue prompts hopes of thaw with Malaysia: PM gives Mahathir 'warm thanks' after missing soldiers found safe The successful Malaysian search for five British soldiers missing in Borneo prompted renewed hopes yesterday of a thaw in Britain's frosty relations with Kuala Lumpur. After weeks of sharp exchanges over Malaysia's Pergau dam project, the search provided a rare opportunity for non-controversial contact between the two governments. Mr John Major used the opportunity to write to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, expressing 'warm personal thanks'. Mr Major's aides refused to release the text of the letter, which was said to be a personal communication between the two prime ministers. However, officials said it was intended to leave Dr Mahathir in no doubt that Britain was highly impressed by the 'tremendous' performance of the Malaysian armed forces. The five missing soldiers were located on isolated Mount Kinabalu in the Malaysian province of Sabah after a two-week search. Malaysia used helicopters, troops, park rangers and local residents in the search for the men, who had been on a climbing expedition. Senior officials said Mr Major's letter of thanks did not refer directly to the dispute over British press reports about the controversial Pergau dam project. Malaysia decided four weeks ago to withhold future government contracts from UK companies because of press reports of alleged bribes offered to Malaysian politicians. The Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating the project, has also heard allegations of a link between Pounds 234m in loans to Malaysia and a Pounds 1bn arms contract. Dr Mahathir insisted in a letter to the Financial Times last week that there would be no change of policy. 'The die is cast,' he wrote. However, the impression that Downing Street remains hopeful of a diplomatic thaw was increased by the disclosure that Britain has not pursued suggestions that the European Union is prepared to retaliate against Malaysia. The EU, which has sole competence in trade matters under the Treaty of Rome, is understood to be willing to consider reciprocal action if Malaysia refuses to back down. Downing Street said the dispute had not been discussed with the EU.</p>

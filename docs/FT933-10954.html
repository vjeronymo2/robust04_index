			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: 'Shell' stocks look ripe for reincarnation - The potential for revival by moribund companies THE GROWTH in business confidence in recent months has prompted talk about reviving 'shell' stocks - moribund companies ripe for reincarnation under new management. While this type of stock market activity has been dormant for several years, it is not difficult to see why using such companies should again become popular. There are, after all, a considerable number of potential candidates which have only just weathered the economic blizzard. There is also a new generation of managers which, having served its apprenticeship in an established conglomerate, is now ready to create one of its own. Knowing there is potential shell activity around is tantalising to the private investor because of the chance of making some very quick and large capital gains. But where does the average private investor find 'shells' before the all-important emergence of new management to transform that dormant quote? How can the private investor shorten the time between making a decision to buy shares and then seeing some take-over activity? There is no certain method of picking either the right company or the right time. But there are several steps a private shareholder can take in an effort to reduce the odds from 'rank outsider' to 'short favourite' and see more rapid results. First, look at the capitalisations of the various companies quoted on the stock market. Any entrepreneur seeking a suitable vehicle with which to realise a stock market ambition will generally be seeking a company with a low capitalisation, since it will not only be more affordable but its share price will move disproportionately once other people realise what is happening. Therefore, rule number one is to consider only those companies with a capitalisation below Pounds 6m. Before their transformation, such companies as Bel Air Cosmetics, Polly Peck, Mellins, Excalibur Jewellery and DSC all had values well within that limit. Armed with the Financial Times, or the Stock Exchange Official List, and ignoring USM companies, pick out only those companies which satisfy that capitalisation limit. It will probably leave you with a list of some 250-300. A further narrowing of the field is achieved if only those companies which are making poor profits (or even losses) are chosen - strange advice from which most sane individuals will tell you to steer well away. But there is method in this madness. Companies which are well managed and producing increasing profits each year are better able to resist take-overs and, in any case, will not be capitalised at under Pounds 6m for long. It takes time and effort to glean information on small companies' past performance. The FT, Investor's Chronicle and the Business Library are the best sources, and a few hours devoted to this task will be rewarding. But, in a post-recessionary period, you will still be left with a formidable number of companies from which to choose. Watch price movements over a period, plotting these at least once a week on some graph paper. A rising price, often over a period of several weeks, is inconsistent with a company which has hit hard times. Someone always knows more than you do; and while insider trading rules have limited severely the use which can be made of 'price sensitive' information, an examination of share prices and subsequent corporate activity suggests this legislation has succeeded only partially. When a company is on the receiving end of take-over activity, it is involved in talks with its advisors (such as accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers and bankers). People notice such things. But how does a would-be investor know if two and two is being added to make five? An observer could, very easily, draw a wrong conclusion - and that could mean a very expensive mistake. Many years ago, William Pickles plc trebled in price and everything looked set fair for a very profitable run - only for the shares to be suspended and the company to enter receivership. So far, we have achieved nothing other than risk money and have the dubious pleasure of watching the share price gyrate until the company announces what is happening. We need now to try to introduce some degree of certainty into the selection. By looking again at the financial press, company reports or information in the Business Library, you will be able to find out who owns large stakes in companies. If you seek out those where, in particular, the board of directors has a holding (say, up to 30 per cent), you can be reasonably sure that it might at least have the wit to know when it is beaten and seek to sell its shares before the company goes bust. That directorial shareholding could, therefore, become the all-important stake a budding entrepreneur requires. So, there you have it - a simple system. Below Pounds 6m capitalisation, making losses/small profits, rising share price, and a boardroom shareholding to help underpin your stake. What could be easier? Your way to riches is assured - or is it? First, you will have to contend with your stockbroker's stunned silence when you ring to place your buy order. He will suggest so many other more rational ways in which to invest your money. He could also be right. I can remember buying my second tranche of shares in Excalibur Jewellery when the price had risen from 11p to 13.75p. They subsequently went to Pounds 1.40. Alas, his caution was all too prophetic when it came to Ramar Textiles. If, however, you have decided to try the 'shell' game with a portion of your funds, do not be dissuaded. Later, though, when you have established your credibility as a shrewd punter, you could have to be careful to spread your buying instructions over several brokers so that they do not start following you, forcing you to pay more on subsequent purchases. How often have you had a call from your broker suggesting you buy something because 'one of our other canny clients has just bought very heavily.' Second, you will have to be prepared to buy in relatively small lot sizes. Gone are the days when you could pick up sizeable chunks of small companies without being made to pay excessive premiums over the share price. But there is often time, and your patience will be rewarded by being able to buy at reasonable levels. Third, you will worry that, if the price has started moving up, it might be too late to jump aboard. An examination of many 'shell' operations reveals that, almost always, the initial rise in share price is followed by either a plateau or even a drop - presumably, as other investors get cold feet and decide to pull out. I referred, at the start, to the reincarnation of shell activity, which pre-supposes there are dormant periods. How do you recognise when such a period is about to descend on your efforts at making a fortune. A wise old US investor suggested, many years ago, that 'when the bellboy in the lift starts giving you share tips, you know that the market is riding for a fall.' Nowadays, there are not many bellboys around so, for its modern equivalent, beware the time when your bank manager gives you tips to buy speculative stocks. They always seem to have yesterday's news.</p>

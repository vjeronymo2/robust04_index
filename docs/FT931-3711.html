			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The risks of bluff and counter bluff - The concern surrounding GPA's Dollars 5.5bn restructure GPA Group's shareholders and its banks are involved in a game of bluff and counter bluff. At stake is the future of the aircraft leasing company which hopes to complete its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn) restructuring by the end of the month. Lenders to GPA have made it clear that the restructuring is dependent on investors taking part in a Dollars 200m rights issue of convertible preference shares. But some shareholders are having difficulty in taking the banks at their word. After all, what is Dollars 200m, asked one investor, to a group with debts of Dollars 5.5bn? Most of GPA's banks have already agreed to support its plan of halving its borrowings over the next three years. GPA confidently expects others to follow suit in the next few weeks. The aircraft manufacturers have also agreed in principle to cancel or change contracts, reducing firm orders for new aircraft from nearly Dollars 11bn to between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn. Having got this far, some shareholders doubt whether the banks would be willing to jeopardise the company's survival by saying no to a restructuring just because they failed to raise Dollars 200m. The banks, however, say they could not be more serious in warning of the dire consequences if shareholders do not come up with the cash. By not taking up the convertible - which convert into shares at Dollars 1  - they would be saying something about the perceived price of the shares which most lenders do not want to hear. As one of the bankers involved in the restructuring put it: 'If GPA's investors do not think it is worth subscribing for new shares at Dollars 1, with a yield of 7 per cent, then they are effectively saying they are not worth anything.' One of the group's US shareholders has already effectively said this by writing off its entire GPA stake. Overseas Shipholding Group, one of the biggest publicly-quoted bulk shiping companies with a market capitalisation of Dollars 552m, is providing Dollars 13.1m against its GPA investment. OSG reissued its fourth quarter results for 1992 to take the provision retroactively. As a consequence its net income for last year fell from the previously reported Dollars 29.1m to Dollars 16m. Ms Catherine Mathis, director of OSG's corporate relations, said: 'The write-off of our investment was based upon information that recently became available'. Although she would not elaborate it is understood that the company was referring to GPA's decision to price its convertible preference shares at Dollars 1. GPA's advisers have made it clear that the third attempt to raise cash in less than a year is the last. It is not as if they could come back with yet another proposed preference share issue with an even lower conversion price. Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the convertible, has told shareholders that without their participation the banks will have no choice but to take effective control of the company. By not underwriting the issue Nomura, which itself has 1.75m GPA shares bought at an average of Dollars 20 a share, has made it clear that only shareholders' involvement can ensure the company's survival. If the group was forced to abort the rights issue its lead banks might look at the possibility of reducing the burden of borrowings through a debt for equity swap. But with more than 100 banks involved in the restructuring the biggest lenders do not think they would stand a chance of winning approval. Yet it is still not clear that investors will subscribe to the new shares. Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, the Wall Street firm specialising in bank debt trading, said: 'GPA's new shares are being sold as an option on the basis that the company manages to survive without more restructuring. The low option price signifies the low likelihood of success.' Nomura has accepted that around 80m of the shares will have to be marketed to new institutions. But existing GPA shareholders will have to subscribe for at least 120m new shares if the issue is to succeed. The company must be hoping that a majority of its investors do not call the banks' bluff by refusing to take part.</p>

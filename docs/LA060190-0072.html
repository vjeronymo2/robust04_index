			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FALLBROOK MAN INDICTED IN UTAH OVER TOXIC WASTE  </P> <P> A Fallbrook man and his defunct storage firm were indicted Thursday in Utah on  federal charges of conspiring to illegally dispose of hazardous wastes,  including surplus napalm bombs from the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station.  </P> <P> "This case represents perhaps the most serious type of environmental  misconduct," U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> Named in the 12-count grand jury indictment in Salt Lake City were EKOTEK and  Steven M. Self, the company's president and sole registered agent. The company  was involuntarily dissolved by the state of California on Nov. 1 for alleged  violations of environmental health laws.  </P> <P> Self could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that the company knowingly burned, poured and stored a  variety of hazardous wastes in violation of an array of state and federal laws.  </P> <P> Company Vice President Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday to three  felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal resource conservation  and recovery laws and the Clean Water Act, Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> Miller, of San Francisco, was allowed to plead guilty in exchange for his  cooperation in the prosecution of Self, officials said. Neither Self nor Miller  was in custody Thursday.  </P> <P> If convicted on all charges, the defendants face fines of more than $24  million, and Self could be sentenced to up to 45 years in prison.  </P> <P> The indictment, the first federal prosecution of environmental crime in Utah,  alleges that the defendants purchased millions of gallons of oils and solvents  and burned them as fuel in their refinery in northern Salt Lake City.  </P></p>

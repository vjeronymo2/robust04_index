			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Tarmac gets extra PSA cash TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, is to be paid some Pounds 5m more than originally announced to take over the Property Services Agency's projects division, the government disclosed yesterday. Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said in a parliamentary written answer that Tarmac would receive a total of Pounds 54.9m as a result of the most recent changes in the net liabilities to be transferred. This would consist of a Pounds 44.4m cash subscription for shares in the privatised company and a Pounds 13.3m cash asset for which the company would pay the government Pounds 2.8m. It was estimated last month that the consideration payable to Tarmac would amount to some Pounds 49.75m. Replying to a question from Mr David Evans, Tory MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Mr Redwood said that final details would not be available for 'some considerable time.' The final amount would depend on the number of transferred staff remaining with the business for more than five years from the date of sale, he said. The Pounds 10.5m net cash asset related to 'the excess of the estimated value of amounts owed by Projects to sub-consultants and others for work done up to the point of sale over the estimated value of assets being transferred to Tarmac. These assets exclude the estimated Pounds 40m owed by customers at the point of sale. This will be retained in government. The Pounds 10.5m figure will be further increased by between Pounds 3.1m and Pounds 6.3m after one year depending on staff still in the business. Government liability for severance payments to PSA staff is limited to Pounds 40.33m.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Benefactor digs deep to save the miners' gala The Durham Miners' Gala, the biggest and most evocative annual working class demonstration in Britain, has been given a new lease of life by a wealthy businessman. The self-made man, a New Zealander now living in Ireland, is providing substantial financial backing for tomorrow's gala, the 110th, and has offered to underwrite the event for the next two years. In addition to this pledge, which may cost him more than Pounds 60,000, he has said he will consider backing the event beyond 1996. The mystery benefactor, who has requested anonymity but will be on the gala platform tomorrow, is believed to be Mr Michael Watt. His Wimbledon-based company, CSI, is one of the leading agents representing sporting organisations selling broadcast rights to television companies. Staff at Mr Watt's London office confirmed he was to attend the gala. Mr Watt recently represented Rugby Union authorities when they invited tenders for the television rights of the Five Nations tournament. He has also represented the West Indian cricket board in Test match coverage. Mr Watt owns several successful racehorses, including Loki, trained by Mr Dermot Weld, one of Ireland's better-known trainers. Earlier this week, Mr Watt sponsored two races at the Bellewstown racetrack in the Irish midlands under the title of the Durham Miners' Gala Festival Extended Handicap. An IPounds 5,000 prize went to each winner. The benefactor came forward after leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers in the north-east, faced with the sudden demise of the Durham coalfield's remaining pits, appealed for help in staging the Pounds 20,000 gala. The union declined yesterday to name him, saying it must respect his wish for anonymity. 'He's an excellent bloke,' Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of the north-east NUM, said yesterday. 'He has a very strong commitment to working class people. He's a committed trade unionist, he's been through the mill and understands what workers are about. He feels the miners have had a very raw deal.'</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Air France discounts US fares AIR FRANCE fell into line with other European Airlines yesterday by cutting fares on transatlantic flights originating in the US. But Mr Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, said the price war was 'worrisome', and warned airline profits would be damaged. Air France is offering discounts of up to 35 per cent in line with fares introduced last week by most airlines operating across the US. Mr Attali said the fare-cutting was the inevitable result of US airlines' increasing their summer capacity 30 per cent. The fare war was 'to the detriment of the results of all companies'. Discounts are for dearer tickets and aimed at business travellers. Airline passenger numbers have recovered this year from a 1991 depressed by recession and the Gulf war. But they are barely higher than in 1990; the improvement largely results from a rise in leisure travellers buying cheap tickets. A row has been simmering between France and the US over the growing market share taken by US carriers of flights between the two countries. Under an accord earlier this year, US carriers can raise their capacity to France 30 per cent this summer, but below the 45 per cent the US sought and above the 15 per cent France wanted. Mr Attali said he would like a new pact to match capacity and the number of airlines flying more closely to market growth.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Brussels bows to UK on Ulster aid: Objections to Pounds 61m grant for Taiwanese plant overruled after heavy lobbying The European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials earlier this month in approving a Pounds 61m UK government grant for a Belfast textiles plant to be built by a Taiwanese group, two of whose top managers have been charged in connection with an alleged share fraud. The Pounds 157m project, the largest industrial investment in Northern Ireland since the De Lorean car venture which collapsed with heavy losses in the early 1980s, has been backed by heavy lobbying in Brussels by British ministers, MPs and MEPs. According to senior Commission officials, one unnamed minister told Mr Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner in charge of vetting the project, that failure to approve it would have political consequences in London as well as in Belfast. The plant is to be built in a political stronghold of the Ulster Unionist party by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese conglomerate. Mr Oung You-ming, chairman of the division, jumped bail and moved to Malaysia in 1991 after being charged by Taiwanese authorities with breach of trust in a stock market scandal that led to the resignation of a Taiwanese cabinet minister. Mr Oung Ta-ming, his brother, who heads the Hualon group, has been convicted on the same charges and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. The sentence was reduced on appeal to two-and-a-half years. Mr Oung is appealing against his conviction before Taiwan's supreme court. Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board, which handled negotiations on the project and is due to sign a contract with Hualon on June 9, said it knew of the investigations into the Oung brothers and of their outcome. The IDB said it had not met or talked to any Oung family member involved in the court cases. It said it had 'a well-established procedure for assessing all relevant aspects of any project and its promoters'. Mr Clifford Forsythe, Ulster Unionist MP for South Antrim, where the plant will be built, and Mr Jim Nicolson, Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist MEP, said the IDB had never told them of the allegations surrounding Hualon and the Oung family. 'I was not aware of any of this . . . and I have never heard anyone mention it before,' Mr Forsythe said yesterday. 'In any of these situations you expect the government department responsible to look at the situation very carefully.' It has also emerged that the Republic of Ireland twice turned down similar proposals from Hualon. Mr Des O'Malley, then industry and commerce minister, said yesterday: 'We decided not to go ahead with the deal because the chairman of the company was arrested in Taiwan over an alleged share fraud.' The Commission approved the Belfast project, expected to create 1,800 jobs, on May 4 after a 10-month investigation. Officials in Brussels admitted yesterday that the decision was politically influenced and said the project would probably have been refused if it had been judged strictly on competition criteria. Commission officials investigating the case argued that it breached European Union restrictions on state-aided investments in the troubled synthetic fibres industry by adding to existing excess production capacity. However, Mr van Miert and fellow commissioners concluded the plant would not directly affect existing EU producers because it would use much less sophisticated technology. They argued that it would probably be built outside the EU if they blocked it. Their analysis appears to conflict with statements by the IDB that Hualon will use advanced and highly automated production methods to enable it to compete with low-cost imports from Asia. UK and other EU textile manufacturers object that the project will create unfair competition.

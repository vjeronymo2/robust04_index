			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / House prices to rise 'steadily' HOUSE PRICES will rise steadily in most of the UK this year, although there is unlikely to be a surge in property values either this year or next year, says the UK economics team at Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank. In a report issued yesterday it says that the housing market is on the road to recovery and that prices will rise at or above the rate of inflation next year, with an increase of 5 per cent for the UK as a whole. They believe that the scale of the price rise is likely to be held back because the recent slump in the property market has diminished the percep-tion of borrowers and banks of housing as an invest-ment. The report says that the problem of negative equity remains a constraint on the market. Morgan Grenfell estimates that 2m households have mortgages higher than the value of their houses, a figure equivalent to one in five people with mortgages. It estimates that the average value of negative equity is Pounds 8,500 and that 75 per cent of those with negative equity are first-time buyers. The report says that house-price inflation of 5 per cent a year should, by itself, reduce the number in negative equity by about 50 per cent to just under 1m by the end of 1995 and to zero by the end of the decade.

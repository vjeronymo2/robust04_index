			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Wary Bundesbank tiptoes forward again ADVANCING slowly and carefully covering its rear, the Bundesbank almost lived up to market expectations with yesterday's cut in the discount rate to 7.5 per cent. But not quite. A 0.5 point reduction in both rates had been predicted almost unanimously by Bundesbank watchers. By leaving the Lombard rate unchanged at 9 per cent, the bank further enhanced its reputation for unpredictability. More importantly, it opened up a little more room for manoeuvre in its management of money market rates. Frankfurt economists pointed out that when rates are moving generally downwards, the discount rate, the official floor level, was a far more important indicator than the Lombard. Mr Ulrich Beckmann of Deutsche Bank Research said that at one percentage point, the gap between the two had been exceptionally restrictive. The 'normal' gap was 1.75 points. Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer, said leaving the official ceiling rate unchanged was partly intended to prevent a rapid appreciation of the US dollar against the D-Mark. The day's decisions, announced without a showpiece press conference, suggested that the central bank, assisted by the government/opposition solidarity deal last weekend, low wage rises and flattening growth in money supply, feels while not all the political and economic variables are fully under control, they are less volatile. If these conditions persisted, inflation continued to improve and the government spelt out clearly where it will make public spending cuts, economists said there were few obstacles in the way of a slow and cautious downward progression in the official rates. Larger steps - Mr Wolfgang Roth, the Social Democrat opposition economics expert, called for full one point cuts instead of 'tiptoe steps' - were widely ruled out on the risks of sharp exchange rate reactions and on the basis that guarding the stability of the D-Mark was the central bank's prime mandate. Although in present circumstances the Lombard rate played 'no role', Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, said the central bank was offering a subtle warning. 'It is making clear it wants to proceed with small steps, and telling markets: 'Be careful with your expectations and do not get carried away',' he said. In contrast to the cautious appraisal of economists, government politicians were enthusiastic. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, congratulated himself on his contribution as one of the architects of last weekend's solidarity pact. The bank's decision would 'give a positive impulse to economic growth in Germany,' he said. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, called the cut an important signal which would strengthen the domestic economy's capacity for growth, and at the same time allow European neighbours' central banks to follow suit and enjoy similar benefits. In the wake of last weekend's political deal he said the responsibility for maintaining stability now lay with wage negotiators who had to ensure that future pay deals were related to productivity. However, most economists regarded the dire state of German industry, underlined by the 87 per cent slump in car-maker Volkswagen's profits, revealed this week, and February's money supply figures, released yesterday while the bank's central council was meeting, as far more telling factors in the decision than the solidarity pact. Provisional reckonings showed that according to the M3 measure, money supply contracted again last month, although at a much lower rate than the 2.4 per cent a year shrinkage in January. Even so, the 0.1 point fall reduced the annual rate of growth for the six months to March to 5.5 per cent - within the central bank's target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Economists, sitting patiently before their screens, promptly reworked their forecasts, concluded that M3 was destined to stay on target, and spoke. Bank Julius Baer's Mr Grebe went on the record immediately: 'They must do something.' Less than two hours later, they did.</p>

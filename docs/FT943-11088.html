			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Largest fall for years in French jobless French unemployment recorded its biggest fall for four years in June, declining by 13,000 to 3.33m, or 12.6 per cent of the workforce, the labour ministry said yesterday. The figures support official claims that the underlying unemployment trend is stabilising and should start to decline towards the end of the year. They will provide encouragement for the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which has targeted France's acute unemployment problem as a priority before the presidential elections which are due to be held next spring. Officials and private sector economists, however, expressed caution about the statistics. A statement from Mr Balladur's office said that the figures were a sign that unemployment was under greater control. But it said there was still a lot to do in tackling the problem. The French unemployment rate, although down from the record 12.7 per cent reached in May, remains the highest among the Group of Seven industrialised nations. Most private sector economists forecast a volatile pattern of unemployment statistics over the next few months, as school-leavers enter the jobs market and as the economy continues along an uneven recovery path. 'The worst may be over, but there will probably be a bumpy patch until we see signs of a clear downward trend,' said one economist at a Paris-based merchant bank. Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, said that some of the improvement in June reflected the number struck off the registers at employment agencies following their failure to respond to surveys. She said that the fragile nature of France's economic recovery could also limit employment growth. The labour ministry figures showed particular improvement in youth unemployment. In the first half of 1994, the number of unemployed between the ages of 16 and 25 fell by 18,900, compared with a rise of 24,200 in the same period last year. The problem of long-term unemployed, however, has continued to deteriorate. The number of those out of work for more than one year reached 1.16m in the first half. Industry leaders have expressed concern about the structural nature of France's unemployment problem. Mr Jean Gandois, former head of the metals and packaging group Pechiney, and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Patronat, France's employers' association, said at the weekend that social charges and employment costs facing business needed to be reduced. 'Growth can help. But it cannot resolve the problem of unemployment,' he said.</p>

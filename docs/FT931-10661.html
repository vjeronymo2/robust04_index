			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance ministers of G7 to meet soon FINANCE ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are to meet soon, probably in London or Bonn. The meeting is likely late this month or early March, with the February 27-28 weekend a strong possibility. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US treasury secretary, has pressed for a meeting before the next scheduled G7 gathering, at the end of April. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, is also keen for ministers to meet to discuss ways of boosting activity in the world economy. The bleak outlook in Japan and Europe is casting a shadow over the US upturn. The problems of Russia would probably be on the agenda. The meeting would allow Mr Bentsen and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the new Japanese finance minister, to meet other members of the group. The finance ministers' meeting would not be concerned with preparations for the next economic summit of G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, which will be held in Tokyo from July 7 to 9.</p>

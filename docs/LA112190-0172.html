			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC BUILDINGS FOR HIRE;  </P> <P> SEVERAL SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES OFFER SCENIC FACILITIES THAT RESIDENTS MAY  RENT FOR PARTIES, WEDDINGS OR OTHER OCCASIONS  </P> <P> The Monrovia Municipal Plunge made a big splash when it opened in 1925. And by  next summer, the narrow, Spanish-style building may once again be swimming with  people.  </P> <P> "It's a sort of kissing-cousin arrangement," explained Joan Bonholtzer,  president of the Monrovia Historical Museum, which will move into the  structure, once the site of Monrovia's only public swimming pool. "We'll rent  the building out for parties and use the money we raise to help pay for  exhibits and for the museum's upkeep."  </P> <P> Whatever the reason -- raising money, providing a service, or both -- many  cities in the San Gabriel Valley have public buildings that they rent to  residents for private affairs.  </P> <P> Some are down-home, such as El Monte's log cabin, which rents for $25 a day and  is used for family picnics, scout meetings and children's birthday parties.  Others are elegant, such as San Gabriel's Grapevine Park and Adult Recreation  Center, which is part of the ornate Civic Auditorium complex and can be rented  for about $500 a day.  </P> <P> Renting municipal buildings is easy, but knowing what's available can be  difficult. As the holiday party season approaches, here is a sampling of public  buildings for hire in the San Gabriel Valley:  </P> <P> * The Monrovia Municipal Plunge, with its arched entryway, red-tiled roof and  narrow wings on either side of the central lobby, was built just after World  War I. It is bordered by a residential neighborhood and by Recreation Park, and  it is the only city structure in the Spanish Colonial Revival style.  </P> <P> What was once the outdoor pool was filled with dirt after the facility closed  in 1983. Under a 50-year contract, the historical society will rent the  facility from the city for a dollar a year.  </P> <P> The society plans to plant a garden on what was once the pool and use it, along  with the building's lobby, for weddings, reunions and parties. Kristin  Mariconda, a historical society volunteer in charge of raising money to restore  the structure, said several groups and individuals already have expressed  interest in renting the facility.  </P> <P> * The War Memorial Building in South Pasadena, built in 1923, has two rooms  where parties and weddings are often held. Both rooms look provincial with  large stone fireplaces, wood floors, exposed beams and big windows, some of  which face the bougainvillea-covered Oaklawn Bridge. The rooms, which are  connected, are decorated with old war-bond posters.  </P> <P> Jim Bowers, a member of the South Pasadena American Legion Auxiliary Post 140,  which uses the city-owned building as its headquarters, says the city is  spending about $190,000 to refurbish the kitchen, and to install heating and a  new air-conditioning system.  </P> <P> * La Casita Del Arroyo in Pasadena, which has a beautiful view of the old  Colorado Street Bridge, was built in 1933 by the Pasadena Garden Club, which  later gave it to the city. Tucked away in a residential neighborhood, the small  wood-and-stone building was constructed as part of the Works Progress  Administration, the New Deal program that provided jobs for laborers and  artists.  </P> <P> La Casita Del Arroyo was virtually a no-budget project. Boulders for the walls  and fireplace were carried up from the Arroyo Seco. The original roof shakes  were split from nearby fallen oaks, and wood timbers and siding came from the  bicycle race track of the 1932 Olympics. Even the building's hinges and other  hardware were forged from discarded streetcar rails.  </P> <P> With its exposed beams, picture windows, stone footpaths and stairs, the house  is in a tranquil setting overlooking the east bank of the Arroyo Seco. Recently  refurbished, it has been designated a city Cultural Heritage Landmark.  </P> <P> * The courtyard at City Hall in Pasadena is one of the San Gabriel Valley's  more popular places for weddings and parties. Surrounded by the  Mediterranean-style building, the courtyard has a large fountain at its center,  old-fashioned street lamps and blooming bushes and small gardens.  </P> <P> City Hall, which was opened in 1927, is a rectangular-shaped building. The east  side is a one-story arcade, whereas the other sides are three stories high,  each with a small tower at the corner. A large dome over the west side  distinguishes the entrance to the building.  </P> <P> "People really like getting married here," said Trini Lopez, who is in charge  of renting the space for the city. "It's a very pretty spot that has a lot of  character."  </P> <P> Another distinguished Pasadena building, the recently refurbished Central  Library, was rented out to City Director Chris Holden for his wedding  reception, but library officials said that was an experiment that will not be  repeated because it took too much staff time.  </P> <P> * Grapevine Park and Adult Recreation Center in San Gabriel is part of the San  Gabriel Civic Auditorium complex and, like Pasadena City Hall, its grassy  courtyard is the main attraction.  </P> <P> The patio and garden, billed as having the oldest grapevine arbor in  California, is where most weddings and parties are held. Behind the grapevine  area, and connected by a wrought-iron passageway, is a second courtyard, which  has picnic tables beneath an arcade and two large barbecue grills. Wine and  champagne are the only alcoholic beverages allowed on the property.  </P> <P> Run by the Parks and Recreation Department, the building has two rooms with  high ceilings, exposed beams and wooden floors. The rooms are primarily used  for San Gabriel's senior citizen services, community group meetings and classes  ranging from ballroom dancing to karate. But when not in use for city  activities, the rooms can be rented along with the courtyard area.  </P> <P> * The Mounted Posse Building in Arcadia has a rustic atmosphere. Built in 1956  for the city's mounted police -- equivalent to today's civilian police reserves  -- the building is a long, narrow room with wagon-wheel light fixtures, a  fireplace and outdoor barbecue.  </P> <P> The mounted posse represented the local police in parades and other public  events. "They donated their time, horses and equipment," said Police Chief Neal  Johnson. "This was a chicken ranch area. A lot of people were horse owners, and  they used to have a bridle path right up Santa Anita Avenue. But times have  changed, and this area changed from a rural atmosphere to a real city."  </P> <P> The Mounted Posse turned its clubhouse over to the police in 1980. The corrals  have been torn down to make way for a parking lot, but the building still  maintains its cowboy flavor.  </P> <P> * The log cabin in El Monte is not really appropriate for a wedding or fancy  affair. Located in Pioneer Park, it is a small cabin with split logs on the  outside, a wood-shingle roof and a concrete floor. Outside is a picnic table  and barbecue grill. The windows are barred to protect the building from  vandals, and that, unfortunately, detracts from the frontier fantasy the park  tries to foster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT'S AVAILABLE  </P> <P> Here are some of the San Gabriel Valley's public buildings-for-hire.

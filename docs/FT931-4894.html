			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US smelters' power supply problem may continue A DROUGHT-induced electricity shortage that has cut aluminium production in the Pacific north-west US by about 25 per cent may continue through this year, causing smelters to scramble to find alternative power sources or keep production capacity mothballed. With world aluminium supplies burdensome, the output reductions are not likely to support prices, but the economic impact on the region and individual producers is significant. The Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets electricity from more than 30 dams in the Northwest has began 'temporary' energy curtailments to to aluminium producers on January 16. Now, with spring thaws approaching, and water levels rising, power officials and aluminium industry executives say the situation may not improve to the point where it pays to restart closed aluminium pot lines. 'I expect current power supply problems will last at least until the end of this year,' said Mr John Carr, executive director of Direct Service Industries, the organisation that represents eight aluminium companies and other industrial users arranging power contracts with Bonneville. Of eight aluminium companies in the region, two, Reynolds and Vanalco, did not cut production after the announcement. Reynolds' Troutdale smelter was already shut in response to low prices, leaving power available to its second plant. Privately-owned Northwest Aluminum is buying higher-cost alternative power to maintain output. However, since January, Kaiser Aluminum's two smelters have reduced annual capacity by about 68,000 tonnes, the Alumax unit of Amax has cut output by 68,000 tonnes, Alcoa's is down about 42,000 tonnes, and Columbia Ventures and Columbia Falls aluminium have each pared output by more than 40,000 tonnes. Mr Jack Speers, power manager at Alcoa, said Bonneville might have power available to provide full service to smelters for 8 to 10 weeks in late April and May, the annual 'fish flush' period when dams release water to sustain Salmon migration. However, with the cost of restarting a pot line around Dollars 1m and no assurance that full power will be available through the summer, 'it's unlikely that we would bring potlines up again,' he said.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Machine order book reduces recovery hopes MACHINERY orders by the Japanese private sector showed a modest increase in June compared with May, the second seasonally adjusted improvement in a row. But against the same month of 1992 orders suffered their 15th successive fall. Releasing the figures yesterday, which are taken as a guide to manufacturers' capital spending plans, the Economic Planning Agency said earlier signs that orders had bottomed out had now receded. Machinery orders - excluding those placed for ships and electricity generation, where demand is volatile - showed a 0.8 per cent month-on-month increase in June after a 3.7 per cent rise in May. However, they remained 13.3 per cent below their level of a year earlier. A particularly poor April left orders for the second quarter as a whole down 16.7 per cent compared with the preceding three months and 16.0 per cent adrift of the same period in 1992. The EPA's third-quarter forecast is for a 10.2 per cent rise from the April-June level - continuing a pattern of alternating quarterly gains and losses which set in at the beginning of last year. Against the three months to last Sept-ember, though, it expects a 14.8 per cent fall. Food, agriculture and transport were the only sectors to show increased demand in the latest three months. A second successive quarterly rise in demand from abroad, which makes up around a quarter of all public and private orders, is expected to be reversed next time following the latest appreciation in the yen. The EPA also said it expected a decline in orders from the domestic public sector in the current period. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, told a press conference yesterday he would seek to ensure the implementation of a Y13,200bn (Pounds 84bn) package of public works spending and tax concessions to stimulate the becalmed economy, agreed in April by the previous Liberal Democratic party government. Outlining the maintenance of a conservative fiscal policy, he said his seven-party coalition would aim for sustainable economic growth driven by domestic demand. According to figures yesterday from the Bank of Japan, outstanding loans by the country's commercial banks grew 1 per cent last month, the slowest on record. Central bank officials said this reflected the wariness of companies to invest in plant and equipment, as well as a shift to other forms of financing such as commercial paper issues. Lending growth was likely to remain low, they added. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, meanwhile, that industrial use of electricity in June, a more immediate measure of economic activity, was 1.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

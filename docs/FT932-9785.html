Profits emerged at Pounds 299,000 (losses Pounds 715,000) on turnover some Pounds 200,000 lower at Pounds 16.7m. Operating profits from continuing businesses rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 963,000) after administrative expenses declined to Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 6.16m) following rationalisation. Lower interest rates meant a reduced charge of Pounds 451,000 (Pounds 511,000) and exceptional items, again relating to reorganisation and empty property costs, fell to Pounds 471,000 (Pounds 1.05m). Mr John Holmes, chairman, said that borrowings had shrunk by Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 8.5m since the year-end and that there was only 'minimal' deferred consideration - a blight on the whole sector since the acquisitive 1980s - still outstanding. He said that although public relations and medical marketing were still subdued, there were 'positive indications of increased activity' in design and sales promotion. Earnings were 1p (losses 2p).</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Chinese delegation on Gulf tour MR LI LANQING, a Chinese vice-premier, has begun a tour of the Gulf region at the head of a delegation aimed at cementing trade ties that last year were worth more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Mr Li will be accompanied by officials of some of China's leading trading and industrial companies, including the China National Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation. Mr Li told the official Business Weekly that his delegation would meet counterparts in Iran and member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council to discuss trade, labour co-operation, contract engineering and investment. The paper quoted figures from China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation showing trade between China and members of the GCC - the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait - grew by more than 20 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. China's exports to GCC states in 1992 were worth Dollars 1.1bn; imports reached Dollars 600m. Trade with Iran topped Dollars 400m. Mr Li told Business Weekly that current trade volume was small compared with 'the huge potential'. China's need for oil products matched market opportunities in Gulf states for textiles, foodstuffs, light industrial goods, technology and machinery manufactured in China, he said. China announced a Dollars 30bn shopping list for technology imports yesterday which it hopes will boost its drive to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), Reuter reports from Beijing. Mr Liu Shanzai, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation, said the import buying plan would stretch over the next seven years and include equipment for projects in agriculture, infrastructure and energy. 'This is a concrete step by the Chinese government to enhance the transparency of foreign trade policy in line with the requirement of resuming contracting party status in Gatt,' Mr Liu told reporters. The announcement, made jointly by the ministry and the State Planning Commission, was the first time Beijing has publicised state buying plans so far in advance. Mr Liu said the import scheme was valued at about Dollars 30bn, most of which would be funnelled into purchases for capital construction projects and technological renovation. The ministry plan covers 210 projects ranging from irrigation networks and hydropower stations to roads, harbours, airports, optical fibre communications systems and education programmes.</p>

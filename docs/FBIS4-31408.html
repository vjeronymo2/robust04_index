			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "E.Cz.": "CBOS on Politicians and Moods in May; </F> Kuron, Pawlak, and Religa Are Leading"]    [Text] According to the Public Opinion Research  Center [CBOS], Jacek Kuron, Waldemar Pawlak, and Zbigniew Religa  continue to be the most popular politicians. Social moods did  not change substantially in May. Society assesses its financial  living conditions better than it did in April.  <H5>  SLD Politicians Less Popular </H5>   Since March, confidence in Zbigniew Religa (chairman of the  Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms), deteriorated the most.  This can be explained by society slowly understanding the  change in Religa's role from an excellent heart surgeon to a  politician. Confidence in three politicians of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD] also went down in May: Wlodzimierz  Cimoszewicz (by 7 points), Leszek Miller and Aleksander  Kwasniewski (by 4 points each). A lack of confidence in trade  union leaders also increased: Ewa Spychalska, who was opposed  to the strikes (by 6 points), and Marian Krzaklewski, the leader  of the recent strikes (by 4 points.) Slight increases in social  confidence were reported for Leszek Moczulski, Jaroslaw  Kaczynski (he continues to be distrusted the most), and Wieslaw  Kaczmarek.  <H5>  Better Moods on Living Conditions </H5>   After the April-May strikes, price rises on some merchandise  and services, and a slight increase in salaries, social moods  did not change significantly in May. Compared with April,  slightly more people think that the situation in the country is  heading in the right direction. Managerial cadres and private  entrepreneurs have the best views on the situation, and  unskilled laborers and farmers the worst. Close to 60 percent  of those polled have a negative assessment of the economic  situation (only 6 percent think it is good), while farmers have  the most negative views in that regard. Skilled laborers,  farmers, managerial cadres, and entrepreneurs are the most  critical concerning the country's political situation.    Compared with April, the respondents' own standard of living  (and of their closest family members) is perceived as better (by  4 points), as well as their material living conditions (by 6  points). Managerial cadres, nonmanual laborers, and private  entrepreneurs are most satisfied with their financial standing,  while farmers and unskilled laborers are the least satisfied.  The slight increase in optimism levels is probably linked to an  improvement in the overall economic situation and to a salary  increase that was a result of the lifting of the popiwek  [enterprise tax on above-normative pay].    The CBOS respondents say that, over the next year, the  political, economic, and family situations will not change. But  what also happened was that the percentage of people convinced  that the country's general situation will deteriorate decreased  slightly. Managerial cadres are the most optimistic when it  comes to forecasting the economic situation.    The CBOS poll on the popularity of politicians was conducted  between 7 and 10 May, using a 1,219-person representative random  sampling of the country's adult residents. The one on social  moods was conducted between 19 and 23 May, using a 1,209-person  representative random sampling of the country's adult residents.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Overseas earnings help Boral climb to ADollars 102.8m A RISE in overseas earnings helped Boral, the Australian construction and engineering group, reverse a downward trend in its earnings. The company raised net profits by 12.7 per cent to ADollars 102.8m (USDollars 73.4m) in the first half to December, from ADollars 91.3m a year earlier, on a 10.4 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 2.09bn, from ADollars 1.89bn. The interim dividend is being held at 8 cents a share. The directors have forecast higher profits for the full year, but said: 'Low levels of economic activity in Australia continue to constrain demand for many of Boral's products. 'It is hoped that confidence will improve following the forthcoming federal election. Non-dwelling building is still at low levels, but government expenditure on infrastructure should produce a positive contribution in the next financial year.' Australian Gas Light, the Sydney-based petroleum utility, has come through a period of big asset acquisitions and disposals with a strong rise in first-half earnings. The company yesterday declared a rise in interim dividend to 7 cents a share from 6 cents, following a 32.6 per cent advance in earnings to Dollars A42.4m for the six months to December from Dollars A31.8m. Revenue rose 1.5 per cent to Dollars A477.1m. Woodside Petroleum, the Australian offshore gas producer, has held its annual dividend at 8 cents a share, despite dipping into the red in 1992. A deferred tax provision of ADollars 85.8m against a nil charge previously sent the company tumbling to net losses of Dollars A22.6m, from profits of ADollars 116.5m the year before.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro disclosed yesterday upon  returning from her official visit to Mexico that the two  countries will sign a free trade agreement this year.    The Nicaraguan president said that her trip to Mexico and  her  working meetings with both public and private sectors had been  productive.    [Begin Chamorro recording, in progress] ... with President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari the signing of a free trade agreement.  We think it will probably be signed before the end of the year.  We also discussed [words indistinct] issues related to the debt  inherited from the Sandinists, the previous administration, ten  years ago. We agreed that both countries' finance ministers  should search for a viable solution for us to be able to repay  that debt, most likely with Nicaraguan assets. In spite of  that, Mexico will open a $10-million line of credit for us  through private commercial banks.    We also discussed the meat problem, which we hope will be  resolved within the Nicaraguan-Mexican free trade agreement that  we expect to sign this year. We expect all sectors to benefit  from the agreement because it will boost our economy and exports  to Mexico.    In terms of social programs, we also discussed issues  related  to the continuation of a solidarity program with Mexico.  Regarding my administration's social programs, we hope to  continue with an exchange of technical expertise. We also  signed a health and social welfare cooperation agreement with  the Mexican Health Secretariat and the Mexican Social Security  Institute. That means special attention will be given to the  many services provided by [Nicaraguan] social security to its  affiliates.    I also had the opportunity to meet with Mexican businessmen  during a breakfast engagement. I was accompanied by my  ministers and four Nicaraguan business representatives. This  gave us the opportunity to exchange opinions and invite everyone  to visit Nicaragua to check out its investments opportunities.  The Nicaraguan business sector representatives who accompanied  me during the breakfast were Mr. Alberto Chamorro, president of  the Nicaraguan Chamber of Industries; Mr. Roberto Teran,  president of the Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Juan Chimilino, vice  president of the National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen; and  Gerardo Segura, president of [word indistinct].

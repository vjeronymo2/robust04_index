			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Turkey-Russia debt accord Turkey and Russia agreed terms yesterday to settle a Dollars 480m debt under which Ankara will be repaid in cash and barter over the next two years. The deal was signed in Ankara at the end of a two-day visit by Russia's first deputy prime minister, Mr Oleg Soskovets. The debt represents credit lines provided by Turkey's Export Import Bank to finance Russia's imports of Turkish goods and construction services, on the back of a 1984 natural gas protocol, under which Turkey takes delivery of Russian gas in exchange for supply of goods and services. The agreement envisages Turkey will be repaid Dollars 90m in cash by the end of September and a further Dollars 100m before the end of 1996. In addition, it will take goods worth Dollars 100m in 1994, and the balance of goods over the next two years. Turkey is understood to be considering taking Russian-made MI-24 Hind-D combat helicopters to bolster its war effort against Kurdish rebels. Under the gas protocol, Turkey currently receives 6bn cubic metres of gas a year for household and industrial use. It has agreed to take an additional 2.5bn cubic metres from 1997.</p>

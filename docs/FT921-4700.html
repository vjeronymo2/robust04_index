			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / 4,000 Maxwell pensions cut MORE than 4,000 pensioners will suffer severe falls in their income from July following the raid made on their pension fund by Mr Robert Maxwell, the publishing tycoon who died last November, it was announced yesterday. Pensions are likely to be cut by between a half and three-quarters. These are the first people to be told of definite cuts in pension payments as a result of the diversion of more than Pounds 400m of assets. Since then 30,000 current and former Maxwell employees have feared the loss of their pensions. The pensioners affected are members of the Maxwell Com munication Works Pension Scheme (MWS), mostly from the printing industry. The scheme had assets of Pounds 155m but only a small fraction of that money is left. Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's British newspaper business, has been using company funds to finance pension payments to MWS members, and will do so until the end of June. However, Mr Charles Wilson, editorial director of MGN, said MGN could no longer fund the payments to non-MGN pensioners without jeopardising the pensions of its own employees. The news comes days before the Commons social security committee is expected to report on the UK pension industry and Mr Maxwell. Mr Frank Field, chairman of the committee, which is due to report on Monday, said pension funds should be governed by company law, not trust law. He said: 'I think voters will demand radical change.' Kenneth Trench, of the Maxwell Pension Fund Association, said: 'What we are calling for is a compensation scheme to be set up straight away.' He said pensioners had been financially mugged. MGN took responsibility for the MWS in 1989 when the pension schemes of nearly 90 Maxwell companies were consolidated. The MWS scheme will continue to pay reduced pensions from its remaining assets and any assets recovered will go towards making good the shortfall in payments.

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Clarke fills his VAT hole Parliament sank VAT on domestic fuel on Tuesday evening. Yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke responded, in a sensible fashion. The idea of VAT on fuel is not in itself objectionable. A uniform VAT would distort consumer choices less than the VAT the UK has; combined with suitable tax and benefit offsets for those on low incomes, a uniform VAT could also be more progressive than the taxes the UK has. What was wrong with this proposal was the inadequate compensation to lower-income households, other than pensioners. The measure was thrown out for other reasons as well. Among them was the perception that taxes were being raised this year, to be lowered next. Such a switch may be politically acceptable if the unpopularity of the increases is less than the popularity of the subsequent reductions. In the case of VAT on fuel, that was hardly the case. The chancellor could have forgotten about the lost revenue, on the grounds that it was marginal. But total revenue is raised from a series of individually marginal taxes. Once made, a budget judgment needs to be adhered to, unless economic circumstances have altered dramatically. More important, the Commons has to appreciate the basic disciplines of budget-making. Once a budget has been devised, any loss of revenue entails additional revenue or additional expenditure cuts. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, yesterday's changes are progressive. Because the replacements are also taxes on sin (in which category driving is now included), there should be little political opposition. What are the lessons of this experience? One is to avoid multi-year budgets, since taxes may not look as urgent when they are introduced as when they are announced. Another is to eschew particularly unpopular taxes if you have a small majority. They seem painfully obvious now. They have certainly been painful.</p>

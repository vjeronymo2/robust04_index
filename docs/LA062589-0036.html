			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYA VISTA PLAN CALLS FOR A MIX;  </P> <P> HOMES WITH OFFICES ON NEARBY LOTS  </P> <P> Playa Vista, the massive residential and commercial project proposed for south  of Marina del Rey, is shaping into neighborhoods with a mix of mid-rise office  buildings and low-rise residential complexes.  </P> <P> At public meetings on Thursday and Friday, Nelson C. Rising, who heads the  development team for Maguire Thomas Partners, unveiled preliminary drawings  that showed three- and four-story residential courtyard complexes down the  street from five- and six-story office buildings in a campus-like setting.  </P> <P> Rising said he does not expect any residential complex to be taller than six  stories, or any commercial office building to be taller than 10 stories, which  is below the ridgeline of the nearby Westchester bluffs.  </P> <P> Besides providing some early glimpses of the development's overall  architectural look, the latest plans show several significant changes from  earlier versions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open Space  </P> <P> About 2,300 residential units and 70,000 square feet of retail business space  that had been planned for the southwest corner of Lincoln and Jefferson  boulevards have been relocated. Those 47 acres will remain open, although an  interpretive nature center may be built.  </P> <P> The elimination of development on this site is contingent on settlement of a  lawsuit filed against the developers by Friends of Ballona Wetlands, a  preservation group.  </P> <P> The previous developer had agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41  acres of sand dunes, and had pledged $10 million to the National Audubon  Society to restore and maintain the wetlands. These provisions have been  incorporated by Maguire Thomas Partners.  </P> <P> A six-story senior citizen housing complex that had been planned for the far  west corner of the parcel is being replaced with a one- or two-story recreation  center that will be accessible only by foot, bicycle or shuttle.  </P> <P> The number of streets will be increased in the southeastern part of the  957-acre tract, where most of the development will be concentrated. Rising said  this will allow for a mix of shops, homes, offices and parks rather than  clustering each use in separate areas that are accessible only by car.  </P> <P> In some neighborhoods, people will live above street-level retail and office  space.  </P> <P> Overall, the developers plan to build 11,100 residential units, about 5 million  square feet of office space and about 680,000 square feet of retail space.  </P> <P> "We're trying to create neighborhoods where everyone is within six minutes'  walking distance of town centers," Rising said. "People will not need their  cars to get from one place to another."  </P> <P> In effect, said principal architect Andres Duany of Miami, the developers will  attempt to build a new city by borrowing many of the elements of small towns  before 1940. Ideally, many residents will be able to work and shop within  walking distance of their homes.  </P> <P> Almost all the housing will be in multifamily complexes of apartments,  condominiums and townhouses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residents Consulted  </P> <P> Since becoming the lead developer for the project in February, Maguire Thomas  has engaged in extensive consultations with residents in communities  surrounding the project. The revised plans announced last week -- showing a  significant increase in the number of residential units coupled with cuts in  the amount of commercial space -- were a product of those meetings.  </P> <P> New plans for the northwest quadrant of the parcel -- which was to include a  40-acre marina with up to 900 boat slips, 1,800 hotel rooms, 1,226 residential  units and 150,000 square feet of retail space -- will be discussed in late July  or early August after an environmental study is completed, Rising said.  </P> <P> Last week, the team of architects, designers and planners met at the Playa  Vista center on the corner of Lincoln and Jefferson boulevards. As late as  Thursday morning, designers were still sketching on yellow tracing paper,  traffic consultants were eliminating some proposals as unworkable, and  architects were moving around blocks representing buildings to see where they  fit best.  </P> <P> Renderings were still being colored in for Thursday night's presentation.  </P> <P> "We're a lot further along than I thought we would be, but we're still a long  way from a finished plan," Rising said.  </P> <P> The changes represent a victory for residents living near the project and for  Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who defeated former Councilwoman Pat  Russell in 1987. Russell's support for the project as envisioned then was  widely viewed as a major cause of her ouster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vow to Reduce Scale  </P> <P> In her campaign, Galanter said she would fight to have the project scaled back,  even though it had already been approved in 1986 by the city and the state  Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Last August, Galanter called for a new environmental impact report, the  preservation of a larger portion of wetlands and a 40% reduction in the amount  of office space.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Galanter said she would not evaluate the project until all the  proposed changes are made.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas, whose other projects include the 73-story First Interstate  World Center under construction in downtown Los Angeles, bought into Playa  Vista in February for an undisclosed sum and took over as managing partner.  Howard Hughes Properties Inc., a subsidiary of Summa Corp., remains as a  limited partner. JMB Realty Corp., which owns and built much of Century City,  also purchased an interest in the project.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas' core group of consultants is being directed by the architect  Duany and his partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zybeck, and by the Santa Monica-based  firm of Moore, Ruble, Yudell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLAYA VISTA PROJECT  </P> <P> SIZE  </P> <P> 957 acres, including a 70-acre parcel that is owned by the state.  </P> <P> 4.9 million square feet (down from 5.9 million) of commercial space.  </P> <P> 680,000 square feet (down from 970,000) square feet of retail space.  </P> <P> 11,100 (up from 8,800) residential units.  </P> <P> 2,400 hotel rooms.  </P> <P> 40-acre marina with up to 900 boat slips.  </P> <P> DESCRIPTION  </P> <P> Mixed-use community with housing, recreational, retail and commercial uses on  the largest undeveloped tract in the city of Los Angeles. The land was part of  estate of billionaire Howard Hughes, who died in 1976. DEVELOPERS  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas Partners, managing partners. Howard Hughes Properties and JMB  Realty Corp., limited partners.  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL  </P> <P> Preservation of 175 acres of wetlands and 41 acres of sand dunes and bluffs.  </P> <P> $10 million pledged to National Audubon Society to maintain wetlands.  </P></p>

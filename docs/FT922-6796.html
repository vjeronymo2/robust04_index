			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Westpac puts brave face on losses - The impact of a bank's pessimistic view of the Australian economy THERE WAS precious little sign of Australia's long-awaited economic recovery in the massive losses announced yesterday by Westpac Banking Corporation, the country's largest bank in terms of assets. The level of Westpac's write-offs and problem loan disclosure reflects an extremely pessimistic view of the Australian economy, precisely at a time when some encouraging recovery signs are beginning to emerge. The bank has not only written down the bulk of its property portfolio by more than a third, but has also virtually doubled its problem loan provisioning. Westpac's brutal accounting treatment also throws down the gauntlet to its competitors in an Australian banking industry still wracked by a 1980's lending spree to the country's remarkable crop of failed entrepreneurs; notably Mr Alan Bond, Mr Christopher Skase and Mr John Spalvins. National Australia Bank is due to report interim results today, followed by ANZ next week. However, widely varying write-off and provisioning approaches have long been a feature of the Australian banking industry. Westpac's action suggests that anything less dramatic by rival banks may mean that they will meet stock market disapproval. In its latest full year, National wrote off Dollars A955m (USDollars 729) in bad loans and raised problem loan provisions to Dollars A3.9bn while corresponding figures for the ANZ were Dollars A1.04bn and Dollars A3.6bn. The stock market is likely to demand much more 'blood on the floor,' mindful that on an international scale, the Australian banks can afford bigger write-offs. They enjoy comfortable capital adequacy ratios, especially the all important Tier 1 measure. Even after yesterday's deck-clearing, Westpac is claiming a Tier 1 ratio of 5 per cent against the 4 per cent minimum demanded under central bank regulations. National boasted a Tier 1 ratio of 7.6 at the end of last year, with ANZ on 6 per cent. Even so, Westpac's decision not to have it's ADollars 1.2bn rights issue underwritten was surprising; especially in the light of some worrying information buried in the fine print of yesterday's announcement. The fine print showed that the big write-downs have reduced the company's net asset backing from Dollars A5.66 to Dollars A3.75 a share, but 74 cents of that valuation is in future income tax benefits which are not allowable for capital adequacy purposes. As a consequence, on a strict interpretation, Westpac's asset backing is perilously close to the Dollars A3 price of the rights issue. The shares closed at Dollars A3.89 in Sydney yesterday. Westpac's managing director Mr Frank Conroy put a brave face on the results yesterday, pointing to an improvement in core profitably. He noted that operating earnings before tax totalled Dollars A687m in the latest half. Although that was a decline on the Dollars A892m recorded for the corresponding six months of last year, it was higher than the Dollars A655m earned for the second half of 1990-91. Mr Conroy said that the bank did not expect any negative response from the ratings agencies, and shortly afterwards Moody's confirmed all Westpac's ratings. 'We do anticipate a positive reaction as we proceed with the capital raising and the bank's performance continues to improve'. 'I want the market and the media to have no misunderstanding on the following points: I can assure proprietors, staff and customers that our reviews have been thorough and conservative. The bank is sound, and what we are reporting today will increase our financial strength. We expect a sound profit in the second half and we can look forward to the future with confidence,' Mr Conroy said. Analysts, however, were less than happy last night as they digested the enormous breadth and impact of the Westpac statement. Some were puzzled that the property exposure involved properties with a book value of Dollars A6.3bn. Some analysts' estimates put Westpac's total property exposure in excess of ADollars 12bn. Much of Westpac's property exposure is held through the Australian Guarantee Corporation (AGC) subsidiary which made a loss of Dollars A719m and has necessitated an Dollars A850m capital injection from the parent. Mr Conroy said that AGC's affect on the group was actually more serious than it appeared on paper because a number of the finance arm's problems had been transferred to the bank. 'If you include Bill Acceptance Corporation, Westpac General Finance in the UK, and the cost of the support arrangements from the bank, AGC and its related activities accounted for Dollars A1.1bn of the Dollars A1.67bn group half-year loss,' he said. He added that the bank would reduce AGC's exposure to major property developments and would turn its attention to specialist activities. Mr Conroy's final comments on AGC underlined, if they did not understate, the plight of the entire group. 'Of course mistakes have been made,' he said. 'Hopefully we have learnt from them.'</p>

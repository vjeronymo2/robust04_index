			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Third quarter rise at Paramount PARAMOUNT Communications, the publishing and entertainment group which last month agreed to buy a string of US theme parks for Dollars 400m, yesterday unveiled a 12 per cent rise in net profits for its third quarter, ended July 31. Net income was Dollars 113.3m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars 101.2m, or 86 cents a share in the same period of 1991. Revenues for the three months were Dollars 1.06bn, against Dollars 963.9m. Publishing operations, led by traditional second-half strength in educational areas and gains in consumer publishing, reported Dollars 112.5m of operating income, up only marginally year-on-year. Entertainment operations, including the Hollywood studio, had Dollars 60.8m of operating income, compared to Dollars 55.3m in the same period last year. Paramount also earned Dollars 10.7m of net interest and other income in the quarter. Results from theatre operations declined because of lower contributions from Paramount's Famous Players and partly-owned Cinamerica chains. Madison Square Garden posted a smaller operating loss, thanks largely to the leasing of the arena for the Democratic National Convention in July. For the first nine months of Paramount's fiscal 1992, net profit totalled Dollars 160m, a solid recovery from Dollars 38.9m in the first nine months of fiscal 1991. Revenues for the period were Dollars 3.06bn, against Dollars 2.72bn. On Wall Street, Paramount's share price closed yesterday at Dollars 45, up by Dollars 1 1/8.</p>

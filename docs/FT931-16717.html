			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wimpey disposes of Liverpool shopping site for Pounds 20m GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group, has conditionally agreed to sell its shopping development site at Clayton Square, Liverpool, for Pounds 20m. The group said the sale would lead to a provision of Pounds 11m which would be taken through the profit and loss account of its annual results for 1992, due in March. However, it said the disposal would have a minimal impact on the balance sheet, as the Clayton Square development had already been written down in the 1991 accounts, which included a write-down of Pounds 27.6m in the value of the group's investment properties. Wimpey repeated its warning, given at the time of its interim results in September, that a year-end evaluation of its land bank and commercial activities was 'expected to result in substantial further provisions.' Analysts now expect these provisions to exceed Pounds 100m, leading to pre-tax losses of about Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 16.1m losses last time. Wimpey's shares closed 1p higher at 115p. The sale means that Wimpey has raised more than Pounds 300m since it announced a planned Pounds 400m disposal programme to reduce gearing in 1991. Year-end debt is put at less than Pounds 180m, which on estimated shareholders' funds of Pounds 500m gives gearing of about 35 per cent. Wimpey halved its interim dividend to 2p, and is still expected to halve its final payment to 3.25p. In November, Sir Clifford Chetwood, who has just retired and been replaced as chairman of Wimpey by Sir John Quinton, forecast that the recession in the construction industry could last until 1995.

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Taking fright at hints of bad news: The effect of a London Stock Exchange rule on trading statements The City of London is being accused of overreacting to companies' downbeat trading statements in the current round of annual meetings. Following recent new guidelines from the London Stock Exchange these statements are much more detailed than in the past and some companies believe analysts are assuming they must contain bad news. Mr John Duncan, corporate affairs director at Inchcape, the UK motors marketing and services group, says: 'When anybody puts out a full statement the market inevitably thinks it is a profit warning.' For their part, some analysts and investors are unhappy that annual meetings are now being used to release more detailed trading information, even though the statements are released through the Stock Exchange at the same time. Says one analyst: 'If you need any clarification of the statement on the screen, all the people who can help are at the agm. You either have to trek out to the meeting or wait in the queue for them to return calls.' Inchcape saw its shares fall 4 per cent last Tuesday after it gave a detailed trading update at its annual meeting. Yet Mr Duncan insists that the statement was not a profit warning and that most of the information was already in the market. 'When the new guidelines were introduced by the Stock Exchange we were assured that the market would soon get used to them. But how long is it going to take?' Last week also saw a very full agm statement from Ladbroke, after which the leisure group's shares fell by 16.5p to 182.5p. Ladbroke said the level of detail in the announcement, which, for example, included sales growth figures for Texas Homecare for the first four months of the year, reflected its new policy of openness as well as the new Stock Exchange guidelines. Yet in this case there was important new information - that group profits were running below last year because of a downturn in credit betting - and since the market was hoping for an optimistic statement the price reaction was only to be expected. Knowing there would be much interest in the announcement Ladbroke put it out over the Stock Exchange news service at 9.30am, well before the statement was made to shareholders at the 11.00am meeting. The company said this allowed analysts to telephone in with queries before the meeting and helped them decide whether it was worth their while going. One fund manager, who is against companies giving important new information to the annual meeting, believes Ladbroke's approach is at least some help. 'It makes it more likely investors and analysts can get quick answers to any queries or it may persuade them they are better off jumping in a cab.' But Inchcape's Mr Duncan argues that releasing the statement early is unfair to those shareholders who are on their way to the meeting and he believes that the communications problems are greatly exaggerated. 'Unless you are holding the agm in the Orkneys and the phone lines go down people are overreacting.' One problem is that the response from companies to the new guidelines has been uneven with many giving no more details on current trading than before, particularly if the news is good. If group profits are 'showing an improvement . . despite difficult trading conditions' many companies will leave it at that. For those gazing at their City screens the rule of thumb still holds: the longer the trading statement the worse the news. Lex, Page 14</p>

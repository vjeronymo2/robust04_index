			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Wu Bangguo, the party  chief of Shanghai, today expressed full support for  macroeconomic control measures taken by the central government.    Wu said a growth rate of nine percent for the national  economy in 1994 set in the government work report delivered by  premier Li Peng is both "positive and appropriate."    A four percentage points markdown from last year's 13  percent  growth is "very necessary" because it will help balance total  supply and demand and ease the pressure on "bottleneck" sectors  of the economy, said Wu, who is here attending the annual  session of the National People's Congress.    It will also create a relaxed environment for promoting  economic restructuring.    "I think that, from a long-term point of view, it is  conducive to the achievement of a sustained, rapid and sound  development of the national economy," he noted.    "Shanghai will, as always, implement macroeconomic control  measures taken by the central authorities," he added.    Wu Bangguo also expressed Shanghai's support for the  establishment of a national tax assignment system.    Shanghai will try to contribute more to state coffers every  year on the basis of economic growth, he said.    Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju expressed appreciation of the  central  government's repeated statement that its policies on the city's  Pudong New Area and on Shanghai paying back its own foreign debt  will remain unchanged.    This shows that, while pushing ahead with reforms, the  central authorities have taken into account local interests and  needs for further economic expansion.    The mayor pledged to improve Shanghai's economic performance  by following guidelines for achieving a sustained, rapid and  sound economic development.    "Meanwhile, we will continue to speed up readjustment of  Shanghai's industrial structure," he said.    At the end of 1993, the service sector accounted for 38  percent of Shanghai's gross domestic product and the ratio is  expected to grow by two percent this year, he said.    Huang Ju predicted that the ratio will rise further to 45  percent by the end of this century.    Shanghai's imports and exports shot up 20 percent in the  first two months of 1994 over the same previous period, a record  growth in the past 10-plus years, he said.</p>

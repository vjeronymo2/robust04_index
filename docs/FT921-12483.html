			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Gardening: How Virtue can learn from vice - Some inspiration from the Renaissance IN GARDENS, improvements wage a constant battle against idleness. During the 1980s, gardens were being improved everywhere. Conservatories sprouted like white mushrooms, designer trellis reached for the sky like orderly bindweed, topiary was back, and neat new house-owners wanted neat little rooms of green. I met one of these tidy gardeners only last week. In the 1980s, he had his garden designed on the strength of his Christmas bonus. In the 1990s, though, it still needed height and asked for something better than bullrushes in its central oval pond. I suggested that he should fill in the pond and start again, but the old energy failed him. It sounded, he said, like too much work. As he turned away, I put an immediate image to his answer, probably because I had just seen it on show in the Royal Academy in London. You can study it for yourself in one of the further rooms of the exhibition of the Renaissance art of Mantegna, one of the capital's best art shows in years. The painting in question has been overshadowed previously by neighbours in the Louvre, and it does indeed have a Louvre-like combination of yellowing paint and crowds of figures from myth. Nonetheless, it strikes me as a frontispiece for gardeners in the 1990s. I have come to see not what Mantegna meant but what his painting still can mean to us. On the face of it, the picture is a learned puzzle. The goddess Pallas Athene is shown breaking in to a garden from the left, and joining her attendants in driving all sorts of sinful characters out of the light. On one side, a very slender lady has turned into a tree and her inconsiderable bosom is sprouting leaves of laurel, although the exhibition catalogue expresses unjustified doubt. Plainly, she is the unfortunate Daphne, who was turned into a tree when one of the gods tried to rape her. This scene, we infer, is a symbol of vice in the absence of Virtue, the garden-owner. She herself is not shown but is implied, wittily, to be in captivity (to judge from the Latin message on a little label on the large painting's right-hand side). Good Athene is winning the battle, meanwhile, and soon Virtue will be back in her garden, a neat little bower of evergreen buttresses where trees of orange and lemon have been clipped to form tall windows, framing the view beyond. In outline, the painting's theme is obvious, but the details always are important. There is a good reason to look closely. Mantegna had been asked to paint it for the private study of a fine young lady of talent - Isabella, of the d'Este family, who had gone to live in Mantua at the tender age of 16. In her private study, she did not want pin-ups, madonnas or raffish musicians: she wanted puzzling, erudite paintings which she could discuss and explain to her friends. She ought, of course, to have been swotting for a place to read classics at Oxford in 1502, but Mantua and Oxford did not then have an exchange agreement and she had to make do with Mantegna and a private tutor instead. The more closely you look, the more Mantegna's mind has run riot and the more grateful you are to the academy for giving you the chance to see it in close-up. At first, you agree with triumphing Athena. The worst of the sins are wallowing in the foreground in the garden pond. Sloth is tugging at Idleness, a deformed creature with no arms; Eternal Hatred is wading in the water, carrying three black bags of seed labelled Bad, Worse and Worst (which I assume to be the white-flowered bitter cress, giant bindweed and fluffy Mares Tail in ascending order of awfulness). On the right-hand side, Ignorance is being carried by Ingratitude and Greed, who also are leaving the water. How timely, I began to think, is good Athena's arrival: I would hate to find those vices in my swimming pool, especially as it seems to encourage them by some natural power of attraction. On second thoughts, the certainties waver. In the air above Athena, cupids with spangled wings are dropping their arrows and fleeing from the Moral Minority. Some owl-faced flying creatures are bossily arresting an errant cupid with its armour. The exhibition catalogue says nothing about them, but these owl-like policemen must be minions of owl-faced Athena, carrying out her orders. Below them, a dreamy, golden-haired Venus is preparing to streak for safety without any more clothes than a bracelet; the naked figure of Lust is making the same arrangements although scaly, misbegotten babies are crawling on her fair upper half. What, I wondered idly, would the garden look like when these revellers were gone? Too much, I felt, like the designer-patio of my friend with the bonus who had been decorator-turned-gardener in the richer years of the 1980s. Virtue is all very well, but she has planted her evergreen hedges too closely. She has clipped them into arches which are much too tall and has misplaced the windows in the greenery which frame the view. In the sky above, there are some sinister, shining presences. Three Victorian Values are preparing to return to earth - Temperance among them - while faces have been sketched subtly in the accompanying clouds. Beneath them, a lady warrior of more than human status is fighting the good fight for Virtue: in one of the clouds, I began to think I saw the features of John Selwyn Gummer. Without some visiting vices, in short, is Virtue's garden really so excellent? Artfully, Mantegna has scattered inscriptions in curious places, several in Latin, one in Hebrew and one in a piece of non-writing which the academy catalogue misdescribes in Greek. Their message, like that of the painting, came home to me at several levels. Without constant warfare, you might wish to say, Sloth and Idleness will always sit in a virtuous garden and help it to go to ruin. True; but they also stop virtuous owners from improving the mistakes of their own designs. There is also the matter of vain Venus and her attendant cupids. By driving out Leisure, says one of Mantegna's inscriptions, you break the bow of Cupid. You also, I think, lose the wilderness and romance of a garden's design. Let Virtue loose and she always get it wrong: too neat, too tidy and somehow lacking the art of abandon. We tended to lose it in the 1980s but, under the banner of Mantegna's moral painting, we need to think again and restore it to the gardens of the next few years.</p>

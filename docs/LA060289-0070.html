			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Housing and Urban Development Department said it will resume subsidies,  under new rules, for the rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by  low-income and moderate-income families. Secretary Jack Kemp had suspended the  program in April, canceling awards made this fiscal year, after the  department's inspector general reported it had been mismanaged and riddled with  favoritism for former high-ranking Republicans serving as consultants to  developers. The announcement said new awards will be based on numerical  rankings -- which will involve area poverty, crowding and quality of housing --  for the poor in a competitive process for available funds.  </P></p>

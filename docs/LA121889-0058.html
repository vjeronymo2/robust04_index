			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> IT'S TIME NFL ACTS TO KEEP UP WITH TELEVISION  </P> <P> Television so completely controls America's major sports decisions that one has  to wonder what the NFL is going to do in order to keep the cash flowing to its  teams at record levels. With the league's contract up for renewal, speculation  is rife that changes must be made for the NFL to keep its megabuck image in a  changing TV world.  </P> <P> Pro football, of course, was the first American sport to truly understand the  power of television. Back in the days when "knowledgeable" people argued for  restrictions on the number of televised games in order to protect gates, the  NFL offered maximum exposure to its teams in their home markets. The result was  that a barely noticeable sport of the 1950s -- you could buy Giants tickets on  game day quite easily -- became the spectator giant of the '60s.  </P> <P> Now, baseball and basketball, both college and pro, are threatening football's  television pre-eminence. With Major League Baseball looking at $1.5 billion in  national television revenues in the next four years, college basketball netting  at least a cool $1 billion in the next decade, and the NBA rights at more than  $600 million annually, pro football is no longer the unchallenged rights-fee  leader.  </P> <P> The NFL's current TV package funnels about $11 million annually to its teams,  but not everything is wonderful about the way that deal works. For one thing,  NBC simply doesn't have the guns to match CBS on Sunday coverage because it is  stuck with the weaker American Football Conference. The AFC is not only less  attractive on the field, it lacks the major market impact of the National  Football Conference, so NBC loses in two ways: audience appeal and potential  viewer reach.  </P> <P> In a perfect world, the NFL leaders would recognize the easiest way to solve  that problem is realignment. Although there would undoubtedly be much gnashing  of teeth, such a straightforward bow in the direction of TV's needs would  probably net the league increased long-range revenues. Not only would it solve  the immediate imbalance between CBS and NBC's properties, but a "made for TV  sales" alignment might even entice ABC to bid for Sunday afternoon games, thus  driving up the price.  </P> <P> How might such a divisional setup look? Try something like this:  </P> <P> CBS divisions  </P> <P> East: Giants, Jets, Patriots, Eagles, Redskins.  </P> <P> Central: Vikings, Lions, Packers, Chiefs.  </P> <P> West: 49ers, Raiders, Chargers, Seahawks, Saints.  </P> <P> NBC divisions  </P> <P> East: Dolphins, Buccaneers, Falcons, Bills, Steelers  </P> <P> Central: Bears, Colts, Browns, Bengals  </P> <P> West: Rams, Cardinals, Cowboys, Oilers, Broncos.  </P> <P> In such a setup, each network would retain eight "home" teams and acquire six  new ones. The keys, obviously, would be the Rams and Bears moving to NBC,  giving that network strong attractions in those major markets. CBS would gain a  monopoly in New York as partial compensation and would keep the strong San  Francisco, Washington and Philadelphia markets.  </P> <P> There is another reason why the NFL ought to consider such an apparently  radical change as it heads for the new decade. The growing power of regional  sports networks could make them realistic players in the TV rights game by the  end of the next decade. It behooves leagues -- right now -- to realign along  smart geographic lines to avoid the type of cable TV problems we see in  Connecticut, where NBA and NHL territorial rules cause market confusion.  </P> <P> Whether the NFL thinks along these lines or not, the fact is television ratings  and markets are the key elements in healthy leagues.  </P> <P> While the above is pure speculation, there is one NFL-TV move that seems quite  likely to occur. That's the expansion of the ESPN cable package from its  current eight Sunday nights to a full season of 16. It's a clear-cut way for  the NFL to increase its cable revenue.  </P> <P> The success of ESPN's NFL coverage was anticipated, of course, but the fact  that there has been so little criticism of the league for removing those eight  games from "free" television might well encourage further commitments to cable.  That's another reason to plan ahead for the day when regional networks can  offer their own megabucks for properties.  </P> <P> Right now, cable remains only a source of additional revenues. Even its most  optimistic proponents recognize that the inability to reach the whole nation  remains a drawback. The next decade will see cable closer to 75 percent  national penetration, but 100 percent coverage seems well into the future.  </P> <P> That's why the broadcast networks are still so important to major sports, just  one more reason why it makes sense for the NFL to deal with the Sunday  afternoon imbalance in some concrete way. Realignment of the conferences and  divisions is just one of the ways they might come to grips with television's  "real" world of ratings and advertising sales.  </P></p>

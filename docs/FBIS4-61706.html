			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [No dateline as received] -- In a conversation  with a UNIAN correspondent on 6 May, Heorhiy Kopchynskyy, former  first deputy chairman of the state committee for nuclear and  radiation safety, who left his post several months ago, noted  that the state of Ukraine's nuclear power now is reminiscent of  the preperestroyka situation, when safety problems were kept in  the background. The tendency to return to monopolism in the  sector, secrecy, and the adoption of decisions without taking  account of the opinions of specialists and the public has been  observed over the course of the year. "The endeavors of the  state committee for nuclear and radiation safety to counteract  this," Heorhiy Kopchynskyy said, "have led to a situation where  over time they stopped inviting us to consultations at the  government level where the fate of nuclear power was being  decided. Our attempts to introduce world approaches to safety  problems evoked active counteraction on the part of the  government. This was capped by the adoption of the decision on  the further operation of Chernobyl nuclear power station, when  the opponents of the decision -- the Health Ministry, the  Environment Ministry, and the state committee for nuclear and  radiation safety -- were not considered either in the government  or in parliament."    "While supporting the existence of nuclear power," Heorhiy  Kopchynskyy observed, "I consider the priority task to be its  safety, which the state committee for nuclear and radiation  safety should be observing. But when the committee becomes a  burden for the government and decisions are taken behind its  back, then I consider it impossible to remain there. I do not  want to bear the responsibility for others' decisions that run  counter to the very philosophy of safety."</p>

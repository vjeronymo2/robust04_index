			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: IF DEBT'S A GOOD IDEA, WHY IS BLOOMIE'S FOR SALE?  </P> <P> What does it mean that some of the country's largest retail companies, the  Allied and Federated department store groups that were acquired in 1986 and  1988 by Campeau Corp., may have to seek protection from creditors?  </P> <P> It means that financial market assumptions of the past decade, that takeovers  were healthy and debt was wise, are proving unsound. The assumption was that  retail stores could always come up with cash to service debt.  </P> <P> But the Campeau stores (Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and many  others) now say the burden of paying interest on $5 billion of buyout debt may  force them into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of January. Another assumption  was that stores could be sold and proceeds used to repay debt. But Campeau is  having a hard time getting a good price even for Bloomingdale's, one of the  most famous names in retailing.  </P> <P> Other debt-burdened retailers are staggering. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., which went  through a leveraged buyout in 1986 and borrowed more last year to acquire  Bullocks stores in Los Angeles, said last week that losses are running higher  than expected in a "chaotic" retailing climate. Macy Chairman Edward  Finkelstein said the company hoped to muddle through by cutting capital  spending and refraining from opening new stores until 1991.  </P> <P> So what? So trouble for some means opportunity for others. Retailers less  afflicted by debt may take customers away from the troubled and make gains in  the stock market, where the focus now is on companies with leading stores in  big cities.  </P> <P> Fittingly, the darling of Wall Street in the past year has been Dayton Hudson,  owner of the leading stores in Minneapolis/St. Paul and Detroit, as well as the  Mervyn's and Target chains. Dayton Hudson stock is up about 60% for the year --  even after nervous fluctuations last week on worries about Christmas sales --  and security analysts are high on the company.  </P> <P> Which is curious and instructive because two years ago Dayton Hudson fought off  a buyout offer from Dart Group of Landover, Md., and its owners, the Haft  family, by calling on the Minnesota legislature for an anti-takeover law --  which was duly passed.  </P> <P> Dayton management said the Hafts' offer failed to reflect the company's  potential, but financial types howled. "For management to stand in the way of  people willing to sell is not necessarily looking out for shareholder  interests," said one analyst back then.  </P> <P> But the analyst was wrong. Dayton Hudson has produced rising earnings in the  intervening years, boosting the stock price and the return to investors beyond  what the Hafts offered. And the company retains its potential and its sales  leadership in Minneapolis and Detroit. Had a buyout succeeded, Dayton Hudson  might have cut back service and given opportunity to Carson Pirie Scott and  Jacobson's, the runner-up stores in those markets.  </P> <P> Being first is important. "The dominant store in a market enjoys advantages,"  explains Will Danoff, who manages a mutual fund of retail issues for Fidelity  Investments. "If you're dominant, Estee Lauder introduces a new cosmetic in  your store, Donna Karan gives you a one-year exclusive on a new line." That's  not to mention economies of scale -- advertising expenditure spread over more  sales dollars. Leading stores often can pay higher commissions to salespeople,  motivating them to cater more to customers, which brings the customers back  again.  </P> <P> In retailing, financial formulas don't define leadership -- something like  stage presence does. "When you go to a town, you know immediately which is The  Store," says analyst Marcia Raley of Minneapolis' Dain Bosworth brokerage.  </P> <P> So who's dominant? According to figures compiled by Sanford C. Bernstein  analyst David Poneman, The Broadway leads in Los Angeles and San Diego, Macy's  leads in the New York area and also in San Francisco and Philadelphia. Marshall  Field leads in Chicago, Foley's in Houston and Dallas, Nordstrom in Seattle,  Dillard's in Phoenix.  </P> <P> But next year some leading positions could change. "Those with debt, even  Macy's, will lose flexibility," says Danoff. Dillard Department Stores, which  has a strong balance sheet, could make gains in Texas and Ohio.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an ill wind will benefit whoever acquires Chicago's Marshall Field,  which is up for sale because its British owner, BAT Industries, is  restructuring to escape a takeover by raider James Goldsmith.  </P> <P> Marshall Field, which analysts say may be bought by its own managers, is the  kind of property that financial markets dote on today: a store so well liked  that it becomes synonymous with its community. Dayton's of Minneapolis is like  that -- customers went to bat for it two years ago when the Minnesota  legislature sought voter sentiment. Nordstrom, which is renowned for customer  service, has attracted a huge investor following in recent years.  </P> <P> So why, then, are some of the biggest retailers in trouble? Simple: In all the  calculations about cash flow and debt service, those companies never mentioned  customers. That customers would come to the stores was taken for granted.  There's a powerful warning for every business in the name Campeau.  </P></p>

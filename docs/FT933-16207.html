			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Sugar plans to oust Crystal at Spurs egm MR ALAN Sugar, the chair-man of Tottenham Hotspur, is planning to call an extraordinary general meeting of the company in an attempt to oust Mr Jonathan Crystal from the board. Mr Crystal is the only remaining director who supports Mr Terry Venables, the former chief executive sacked by Mr Sugar, following their bitter court battle over control of the London football club. Mr Sugar is expected to announce within the next two or three days that an egm will be held on July 30. This will be just inside the minimum 21 days' notice required for such a meeting. Mr Sugar has stated his intention to force Mr Venables out of the company, but has undertaken not to oust the former chief executive from the board until High Court hearings over their dispute are complete some time this autumn. The Sugar camp yesterday said it would abide by this undertaking. The move against Mr Crystal has been long expected. During the battle between Mr Sugar and Mr Venables, Mr Crystal has been a solid champion of Mr Venables' cause. Although individual shareholders will be invited to the egm, the meeting is likely to prove a formality. Mr Sugar owns 47 per cent of the company and his long-time ally Mr Tony Berry a further 5 per cent. Neither Mr Crystal nor Mr Venables was available for comment.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China seeks to allay UK trade cut fears MR Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, yesterday sought to allay concerns that Britain's trade with the People's Republic would be damaged by the continuing row over Hong Kong. Responsibility for the row and potential harm to economic ties lay with Britain, Mr Qian said. China did not wish to see a deterioration in the trading relationship. His remarks coincided with renewed demands for the removal of Mr Chris Patten's, Hong Kong's governor, published in an official Shanghai newspaper, which described him as 'a colonialist throwback'. China has been enraged by Mr Patten's plans for democratic reforms in the lead-up to its takeover of the colony in 1997. The Liberation Daily commentary, by one of China's leading commentators, He Minze, contained bitter allusions to Britain's colonialist past. 'You've kept Hong Kong for more than 100 years, what have you done for democracy? Nothing] ,' Mr He observed, likening Britain's performance to that of a prostitute who, on her retirement, urges chastity for others. Mr Qian denied there was any comparison between China's insistence that political issues such as human rights should not be used to undermine its most favoured nation status in the US, and threats against British trade over Hong Kong. He had been asked about a statement of Mr Li Lanqing, China's foreign trade minister, that if the row over Hong Kong persists Britain economic ties with China would 'inevitably be affected'. Sino-British trade was worth Pounds 1.38bn last year, with the balance heavily in China's favour. China's exports to the UK totalled Pounds 954m, up 35 per cent on the year before. Mr Qian ruled out an early meeting on the vexed Hong Kong issue with Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, saying conditions were 'not ripe' for such an encounter. He warned that if Mr Patten's reform plan was presented to the Legislative Council it would create fresh obstacles to talks. Mr Qian also said China was strongly opposed to UN sanctions against North Korea over its refusal to accept inspections of its nuclear facilities. He said there was 'no international precedent' for the punishment of countries withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty after refusing inspections.</p>

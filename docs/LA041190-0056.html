			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BIRMINGHAM HOLDS ON TO CLAIM TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> HOLT-GOODMAN FINAL: WHEN POLY RALLY FALLS SHORT, SINK ENJOYS A LONG-AWAITED  VICTORY.  </P> <P> This is, after all, Coach Wayne Sink's final season at Birmingham High after 26  years.  </P> <P> And this is the event, the traditional Holt-Goodman baseball tournament, for  which he was the organizer and planner for many of those years. It is also a  tournament that has never seen Birmingham reach the finals under Sink.  </P> <P> So what in the name of party poopers were the Poly Parrots doing Tuesday at  Birmingham's Ramirez Field by mounting a furious, seventh-inning rally against  Sink's Braves and closing a five-run deficit to just one run with none out and  the bases loaded?  </P> <P> Just making it interesting.  </P> <P> Faced with that precarious position Sink called on Noah Kirshbaum in relief.  Kirshbaum, who had pitched just once this season before Tuesday, eventually  ended the game by inducing a line-drive double play and a ground out to give  Sink and the Braves a 7-6 win in the tournament's title game.  </P> <P> With that, Sink went to the team's field house and took out the monstrous  trophy that for so long had gone to other teams. But this time, he kept it.  </P> <P> "We took a couple of cheap hits and some big plays to do it, but we did it,"  Sink said, proudly wearing a fresh white T-shirt that read "1990 Holt-Goodman  Champions." He added, "But that's baseball. And that's a helluva team we beat.  I'm glad we could do it."  </P> <P> Coming into the title game, Poly (14-3) was riding a 12-game win streak and had  defeated North Hollywood, Kennedy and San Fernando to reach the final.  </P> <P> Particularly eye-opening was the 11-10 win over San Fernando in which Poly  fought back from a 6-1 deficit and endured a four-run Tiger seventh inning  before winning in the 10th. So it was no shock when Poly mounted its  last-inning bid Tuesday against Birmingham (11-5-1).  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-2, the Parrots lashed out at eventual winner and tournament MVP  Josh Brown (7-2), who had held Poly to six hits entering the seventh. Francisco  Flores doubled to start the rally and, after Steve Chavez walked, Wil Molina  stroked an RBI double to make the score 7-3.  </P> <P> Sink summoned senior second baseman Matt Mowry -- whose three-run double in the  second inning had given Birmingham its early, comfortable lead -- as a  reliever. Poly's Roy Lozano greeted Mowry with a run-scoring infield single and  when No. 3 hitter Jonathan Campbell singled to right to make the score 7-5,  Sink removed Mowry in favor of Kirshbaum.  </P> <P> Poly's Gabe Chavez singled to left to load the bases and, after Rodrigo Dorame  legged out an RBI infield single, it was 7-6.  </P> <P> But Kirshbaum bore down and stopped the threat there.  </P></p>

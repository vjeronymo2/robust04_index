			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Christoph Bertram: "Playing With the Bomb"] </F>   [Text] There is talk about war again, possibly even  nuclear war. Such talk may be exaggerated, premature, or  perhaps even totally out of place, and some people may find  comfort in the thought that it refers to a distant region in  northeastern Asia, the Korean Peninsula. But once before, at  the beginning of the Cold War, a Korean war shook the world.  This time, too, we should let ourselves be deceived: The  conflict simmering there now is explosive enough to rouse us  from our self-contemplation.    The talk about war has been caused by North Korea's refusal  -- even though it is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty -- to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  to fully inspect all its nuclear facilities. Since the spring  of 1993, the regime in Pyongyang has fooled the inspectors. It  is true that, following tough negotiations, they were  occasionally admitted into the country, but they were never  permitted to carry out the decisive inspection, namely, examine  how much plutonium had been secretly extracted and put aside.  In these weeks, the North Koreans are hurriedly exchanging the  fuel rods in their nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, obviously in an  intention to definitely thwart such examination.    Since then, the world has increasingly been calling for  economic sanctions. The North Korean "Committee for the  Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland," a mouthpiece of the  regime, has threatened that "sanctions mean war, and war is  merciless."    Optimists are trying to persuade people that this is just  bluff, and North Korea does not want war or the bomb. They say  that the regime of the country, which is isolated, economically  ruined, and overshadowed by uncertainty about the successor to  the old Stalinist ruler, Kim Il-song, is only seeking  international recognition and support to stand its ground  against the successful south and avoid the fate of the GDR.    Granted, no one can say with certainty today whether the  country already has some atom bombs, whether it intends to build  them or can build them. However, the optimistic assessments  meanwhile increasingly resemble broken straws, because there is  no doubt that, despite all its efforts to hush up this fact,  North Korea has long pursued a nuclear arms program. Following  its recent move to sabotage inspection, it now even has an  opportunity to secretly extract sufficient fissionable material  for half a dozen nuclear weapons; more efficient reactors are  already under construction. If the North considered the bomb  only a barter object to win the largest possible international  support, there would probably have been enough opportunities in  recent months for such a barter deal. The United States, Japan,  and South Korea all said they would be willing to make  concessions if the IAEA inspectors could do their job unhindered.    That is why North Korea's behavior suggests a much gloomier  assumption. The country wants the bomb, it has only used the  negotiations to cover up its intention to continue and step up  its efforts. This concretely shows a dual danger. First, other  countries in the region -- Japan, Taiwan, South Korea -- could  follow the North Korean example, and the region could be driven  into a nuclear arms race. Second, elsewhere, would-be nuclear  powers could feel encouraged. The Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty would be nothing but a scrap of paper.    Therefore, what is happening in Korea is not an Asian  crisis;  it is an international crisis. What should be done to cope with  it? Economic sanctions are not an appropriate instrument; they  are rather an expression of embarrassment. Even if China and  Russia in the UN Security Council agreed to an embargo  resolution, and even if subsequently China and Japan, the key  states, energetically carried out the embargo -- both cases are  more than uncertain -- this could not force North Korea to stop  its nuclear arms production. Military sanctions, which U.S.  Defense Secretary Perry does not rule out, could destroy North  Korea's visible nuclear facilities, but they could not destroy  the bomb, if it exists at all, because it can be easily hidden.  Then there would only be the certainty of war.    Instead of threatening sanctions and rattling the saber,  the world should therefore remember that confrontation has never  made a country give up its nuclear arms plans -- on the  contrary. The fact that the number of nuclear arms states is  today much smaller than had been predicted by experts several  years ago is not attributable to the displeasure of other  countries, but to the realization of possible nuclear candidates  that the development of their own bombs is unnecessary or even  harmful for their security -- Argentina and Brazil, which  discontinued their bomb research; South Africa, which scrapped  its half a dozen operational warheads when the apartheid regime  collapsed; the nuclear successor states of the Soviet Union,  which agreed that only Russia should have nuclear weapons.    The attempt to make North Korea give up its nuclear program  in exchange for special material benefits has failed. The  attempt to exert pressure on the regime by imposing sanctions  will also fail. As long as Kim Il-song's regime considers its  own bomb more important than the whole Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, the international community will confront the nuclear  shark like a paper tiger in its attempt to push through the  contractual obligations. Antiproliferation policy should rather  concentrate on the following three aspects:     -  Good old  deterrence: It must be made clear to North Korea that the bomb  will not give it any military edge over the South. This requires  more support for the defense of South Korea;    -  Damage limitation:  Pyongyang must be prevented from exporting nuclear material and  nuclear carrier weapons. This requires a blockade of North  Korean exports, possibly already in the near future;    -  The  readiness of the other countries in the region to discuss, and  thereby possibly reduce, Pyongyang's security policy concerns.  That is why the Russian proposal to call an international  conference with the participation of North Korea deserves to be  approved.     An appeasement program? Not at all. A guarantee of success?  By no means. However, it is the consequence of the realistic  realization that nuclear armament can at best be controlled  indirectly, and that this is the only way to de-escalate a  conflict, which may lead to war.</p>

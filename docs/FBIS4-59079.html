			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives met today in the  presence of the parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist  Party. It discussed the issue of the illegitimate and  unconstitutional moves and activities abroad by brother Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister. The conferees supported  the issuance of a circular to all embassies and official and  diplomatic quarters in the sisterly and friendly countries and  the international bodies and institutions, asking them not to  officially deal with brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas,  currently abroad, because he was not on an official mission. He  was not entrusted to undertake such a mission by the legitimate  and constitutional political leadership nor has this mission  been approved by the Council of Ministers.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Charge pushes RJR back into red RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group which was subject to a Dollars 25bn buy-out in 1989, slipped back into the red during the first quarter of 1992, due to a Dollars 159m extraordinary charge related to the repurchase of debt securities. The after-tax deficit amounted to Dollars 15m, compared with a small Dollars 5m profit in the first quarter of 1991. For 1991 overall, RJR made a net profit of Dollars 368m. The company's operating income, struck after amortisation charges of Dollars 152m (Dollars 153m) but before interest costs, totalled Dollars 664m, against Dollars 647m a year earlier. Net sales overall were 5 per cent higher at Dollars 3.64bn. Tobacco sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn, driven by the international business. Excluding the effects of a significant Russian order in 1991, overseas sales would have been up by 10 per cent, with volumes increasing by 8 per cent  - principally in the Middle East and Asia. In the domestic market, there was 'a slight volume increase'. The results benefited from price increases but this was more than offset by higher marketing expenditures. The total 'business unit contribution' - before amortisation  - was Dollars 651m, against Dollars 648m. Net sales of food products were just 2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.54bn, and the business unit contribution increased from Dollars 171m to Dollars 189m. In contrast to the flat operating performance, RJR Nabisco's interest costs fell sharply because of relentless financial restructuring. Cash interest payments fell from Dollars 307m to Dollars 250m, while non-cash interest charges were Dollars 126m, compared with Dollars 294m.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: PowerGen sizes up ventures - Generator looks overseas to honour commitment to regulator PowerGen is considering joint ventures with other European companies as a means of honouring a commitment to try to dispose of 2,000MW of plant. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said putting some generation plants into a European grouping was one of a series of options under consideration as a means of meeting the commitment to the electricity regulator. Mr Wallis was speaking as the generator reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 118m (Pounds 108m) on turnover of Pounds 1.14bn (Pounds 1.27bn) for the half year to October 2. Earnings per share were 10.8p (9.71p) and the interim dividend is 5p (3.95p). Mr Wallis said that PowerGen had examined the possibilities of selling plant to UK companies and was now looking at options involving overseas concerns, including asset swaps and forming joint ventures in which PowerGen would have a minority stake. He said that a demerger, whereby a company could be split off from PowerGen with 2,000MW of plant, looked unlikely. 'A company of that size would be not be big enough or viable enough on its own,' he said. 'The overseas option now looks the best for us, although we have not ruled out a UK buyer,' he said. PowerGen also announced the confirmation of its second significant overseas project. It is to be lead project developer of a 900MW power plant at Tapada in Portugal. Mr Wallis said the company's stake would be more than the 22 per cent it has in its German generation project at Schkopau. The total cost of the Portuguese project would be about Pounds 300m plus interest charges during its construction, with about 80 per cent financed from debt and 20 per cent by equity. The company is also looking at projects in India, China, Malaysia and New Zealand. Among developments in the UK, Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said coal stocks were down to 9.2m at the end of the period from 13m in March. He expected them to be 5m by the year end and 3m by March 1996. The total number of employees fell by 200 to 4,185 during the six months, but Mr Wallis said the main push on staff numbers had finished. COMMENT Other companies faced with falling market share and the imminent sale of a 40 per cent shareholding would probably be feeling uncomfortable. Not so PowerGen. Moving from its position as the second to the third largest generator in England and Wales has its compensations as market share is now below 25 per cent. That decreases the likelihood of a MMC referral should the company be unable to reach terms for selling off 2,000MW by the end of next year. Profit growth may have slowed but, with dividend cover so high, there is nothing to stop PowerGen increasing dividends by 16 to 20 per cent in the next two years at least, especially if overseas expansion goes to plan. The shares are trading on a yield of 3.4 per cent, assuming a full year dividend of 15p - up 18.6 per cent. That is a high rating in a highly rated sector but the fundamentals look strong.</p>

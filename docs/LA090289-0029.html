			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROSSMONT 3-A FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> MONTE VISTA MIGHT THREATEN BIG THREE  </P> <P> If there is one thing nobody can say about Ed Carberry, Monte Vista's  first-year coach, it's that he doesn't have any drive.  </P> <P> Carberry, an assistant at Tustin High School in Orange County last year,  commuted to Monte Vista three to five times a week after he was hired last  spring. Fortunately for Carberry, he wasn't alone; he took an entourage of  eight assistant coaches and helpers.  </P> <P> "Those were long days," said Carberry, who has since moved closer to his work.  "We'd put 200 miles a day on the car. I knew Camp Pendleton like the back of my  hand."  </P> <P> Although Monte Vista won't knock any of the Big Three -- Helix, Granite Hills  and Mt. Miguel -- out of the front seat, the Monarchs are causing them to keep  an eye on the rear-view mirror.  </P> <P> The Big Three have won or shared every Grossmont League 3-A title since 1984.  And it doesn't look as if the trend is going to change.  </P> <P> But the Big Three are saying Monte Vista could have an impact this year.  </P> <P> "If Monte Vista comes into league 4-2, 3-3 (after their nonleague games), they  could be the team to beat," Helix Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "They're working hard,  and they have good athletes. If he can bring them around, they could have a  real impact."  </P> <P> THE RACE  </P> <P> Top contenders: Helix (8-2-1), Mt. Miguel (7-4), Granite Hills (7-3-1).  </P> <P> Surprise potential: Monte Vista (1-9)  </P> <P> Hoping for improvement: El Capitan (4-6).  </P> <P> Game of the year: Helix at Mt. Miguel, Nov. 9. Could be any game involving the  "Big Three," but this is the last of the year and probably will have the league  title riding on the outcome.  </P> <P> THE PLAYERS  </P> <P> The man: Last year, Rob Ippolito was the man with the mono. This year, he is  the man with the arm. Ippolito was expected to start at quarterback for Helix  last year but contracted mononucleosis. By the time he was ready to play, Tory  Winrow had taken over. Every coach in the league said Ippolito (6-3, 180) will  be the dominant force this year.  </P> <P> Who will fill Brian Giles' shoes? Giles signed with the Cleveland Indians as a  17th-round draft pick, but while dallying on the football field last year, he  led the league in rushing (1,592 yards), scoring (136 points) and yards per  carry (6.8). But Granite Hills Coach Jim Mann doesn't see a change in the  school's tradition of producing league-leading running backs. Shane Spencer was  a top back on the junior varsity two years ago, but with Giles around, he  played linebacker last year. All he did there was make all-league after never  before having played the position.  </P> <P> Others to watch on offense: Tackle Chris Donica (6-5, 277) anchors a solid line  for Granite Hills. The Highlanders return a pair of excellent receivers in  Frank Nunez (28 reception) and Ale Campos (19). Mt. Miguel has three quality  running backs, and tackle Jim Hoffman (6-5, 265) will be responsible for giving  them some room to run. Monte Vista's Deron Claiborne threw for 100 yards a game  last season.  </P> <P> Others to watch on defense: The league has a tradition of hard-hitting  defenses. Gary Walton (6-4, 215) is just a junior, but he will continue a line  of strong linebackers at Helix. Eric Zenor (6-2, 210) returns at outside  linebacker for Granite Hills. El Capitan nose guard Greg Gutierrez (5-9, 190)  is a solid lineman.  </P> <P> THE INTANGIBLES  </P> <P> Buddy, can you spare a quarter: Running backs have been the strength of the  league the past few years, but this year, three of the five teams returns a  starting quarterback, and a fourth -- Helix -- probably has the league's best.  Only El Capitan does not return a quarterback with varsity experience. Besides  Ippolito, who played a few downs last season, the returners include Mt.  Miguel's Steve Lindley (6-0, 190), Claiborne and Granite Hills' Bobby Howe.  Lindley completed just 42 passes, but for 1,009 yards and 11 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Who will be back on top? There has been an all-section caliber running back  returning the past five years. But new people will run the ball this season.  Along with Spencer at Granite Hills, Mt. Miguel has three backs to replace Gene  Ethridge (1,363 yards, 13 TDs). Victor Ware (5-9, 170) saw some playing time  last season for the Matadors, but he will have to contend with sophomore Earl  Bryers and senior Corey White, who started at tailback for Glendale last year.  Arnaiz thinks he has a solid back in junior Jarret Parr (5-11, 170), who played  in Maryland last year and in Texas as a freshman.  </P> <P> Looking for a banner year: If Carberry needs to be reminded of the job he has  to do in order to get Monte Vista to the top, all he has to do is look for  championship banners in the Monarchs' gym.  </P> <P> "It's going on 30 years, and there is only one bullet up there," said Carberry,  referring to the 1984 league championship Monte Vista shared with Mt. Miguel.  "There wasn't a lot of pride in the football program."  </P> <P> The first thing Carberry is working on is restoring that pride. Since the 1984  season, Monte Vista has steadily declined and last year had the worst record  (1-9) since the Monarchs were 1-7 in 1969.  </P> <P> "Everybody felt they were second-class because they hadn't won," Carberry said.  </P> <P> SUNDAY: The Metro Conference.  </P></p>

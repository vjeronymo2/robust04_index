Each fourth case is the so-called  stage of the clinical AIDS development. Six patients have  already died (five died of AIDS, while in one patient the HIV  infection was an accompanying sickness). Three victims were  from Minsk. The key mode of transferring HIV infection is  sexual. The largest part of the virus carriers is between 20  and 40 years of age. The actual number of people infected with  HIV in Minsk is estimated at 900-1,200.    We obtained this information from Valentin Bykovoy,  epidemiologist of the Belarusian AIDS Prevention Center.</p>

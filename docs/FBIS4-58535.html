			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The ball is now in the Israeli court  following U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks in  Damascus with President Hafiz al-Asad. Christopher has said his  talks reached a serious, substantive level, and that he has  conveyed ideas from Damascus.    The Israeli foreign minister has acknowledged that the  questions conveyed by Christopher were serious and complicated.  President Hafiz al-Asad had briefed the U.S. secretary on  Syria's view, which stems from a true desire to achieve a just  and comprehensive peace that guarantees the rights of all  parties. President al-Asad stressed that addressing the basic  issues in the peace process would ensure progress.    There is no doubt that full Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan  and the occupied territories is a major issue. Without  acknowledging the principle of complete and speedy withdrawal,  it is impossible to realize progress. The question of the Golan  is not only that it is Syrian territory occupied by force; there  are also tens of thousands of displaced Syrians who were forced  to flee from their land and are now awaiting return. There is  also the question of the towns destroyed by Israel, especially  the city of al-Qunaytirah that was turned to rubble and is now  awaiting reconstruction. It is unreasonable to reconstruct this  heroic city of martyrs while Israeli threats are still a reality.    The occupation has left behind deep, bleeding wounds that  must be dressed. This is impossible without a speedy Israeli  withdrawal. Syria has for some time now been offering full peace  for full withdrawal. If we are to deal with Israel through  citing the statements of its officials, then peace, as Rabin  himself has acknowledged, is the best guarantee of security.    Syria is offering honorable, true, firm, and lasting peace;  Israel, on the other hand, will only be withdrawing from Syrian  territory that was occupied by force and responding to the  resolutions of international legitimacy by putting the record  straight and putting an end to many years of illegitimate  practices on the Golan.    Syria can only understand Israel's reluctance to accept full  and comprehensive withdrawal as a way to evade the obligations  of the peace process.    If we revisit the past, we will find that the leaders of  Israel have been shouting loudly, since 1948, calling for peace  with the Arabs and appealing to the world to intervene to hold  Arab-Israeli peace talks. Yet, as soon as the United States  announced a peace initiative in the Middle East, through former  President George Bush, the Israeli officials started creating  impediments and obstacles to it. Thus, they unwillingly  participated in the Madrid conference and wasted two years of  the Washington talks. Instead of the comprehensive peace  proposed by the Arabs, they have propagated piecemeal peace over  long stages in order to prolong the occupation and suffering --  despite the fact that a piecemeal peace is not a solution, nor  does it lead to a solution. Rather, it nurtures tension in the  region.    The Israeli officials are today facing a new test. They have  been crying out for some time now that they are concerned about  a lasting peace with Syria. Secretary Christopher has taken  along with him from Damascus ideas that will lead to a lasting  peace if Israel responds to these ideas and truly responds to  the UN resolutions and the foundations of the Madrid conference.    The Israeli officials are well aware that Syria will not  engage in phased settlements and partial solutions and that it  looks forward to regaining its occupied territory, and  consequently, to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. The  Israeli officials are also well aware that Syria keeps its word  and that it makes peace honorably and fights war honorably.  However, peace is impossible to build as long as occupation and  threats continue. There is no alternative to fully removing  occupation, establishing justice, and removing all  manifestations of threat and expansion in the region.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws inherent in R&amp;D scoreboard I was pleased to see Dennis Henry's letter ('Added value should be real value for R&amp;D', August 1) regarding his concerns about the recent publication of the 'UK R&amp;D scoreboard'. This annual record is produced by Company Reporting in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry and takes data from company annual reports. This is where the first problem arises; not all companies define R&amp;D in the same way, despite the guidelines which are available to accountants (Statement of Standard Accounting Practice). Second, the amount of R&amp;D spend required by businesses within a particular sector can vary. Some companies rely on impeccable service to generate high profits, whereas others achieve the high profits through well planned R&amp;D. Third, the tables are misleading in that some companies are much more efficient in how they manage their R&amp;D projects than others. One company spending 5 per cent of turnover on R&amp;D might be producing benefits equal to a more efficient company spending only 1 per cent on R&amp;D. In the present competitive environment it is essential to ensure that there is better project selection and evaluation with continuous monitoring, followed by assessment of the project's achievements. Dennis Henry is right in looking at the ratio of R&amp;D to added-value rather than to sales. The added-value which the R&amp;D brings to the company is what is really important, but that is not something which can be measured easily and quickly. If the 'UK R&amp;D scoreboard' is going to encourage companies to spend more on R&amp;D, then I fully support that. The best way to generate wealth for the country is by being efficient technology leaders, who can move rapidly into new markets. Alan Smith, Tebworth, Bedfordshire LU7 9QQ</p>

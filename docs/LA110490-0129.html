			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A' IS FOR AWFUL  </P> <P> Shearer's blast at public schools included a little throwaway line that  teaching was once the province of women too squeamish for nursing. His  dismissal of a generation of female teachers, as if they were the least  ambitious career women of their time, seems to me to overlook the very heart of  our present-day education crisis.  </P> <P> Public schooling in the 1930s and '40s rested on the bedrock abilities of  talented, intelligent and, indeed, ambitious but underpaid women who had almost  no other career choices open to them besides teaching school. By Shearer's  time, the standard may have been two good teachers per school, as he says. But  I was one of the fortunate children of the earlier era. In ordinary public  schools, in "melting pot" neighborhoods, we learned not only reading, writing  and arithmetic but history and geography and spelling and music. In fourth  grade, we all learned to read music as a matter of course, as part of a good  basic education, taught by our classroom teacher, not by a "specialist" brought  in for "enrichment." The caliber of our teachers was so high, we were all  enriched every day, by the simple process Shearer laments: teaching something  one knows to someone who doesn't.  </P> <P> Even if we find the way and the will to deal with the appalling problems that  swamp our public schools today, we will never restore the quality of teaching  to that of 50 years ago, unless and until the profession of teaching offers the  income, status and working conditions that bright, multitalented, competent and  ambitious women, as well as men, now command in other fields.  </P> <P> JOAN GRAY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

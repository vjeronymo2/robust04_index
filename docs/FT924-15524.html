			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Councils may form pool for self-insurance BIG COUNCILS are examining the possible formation of a self-insurance pool in the wake of the troubles experienced by Municipal Mutual, the insurance company that insures the great majority of councils. Accountants Touche Ross have been retained to advise on how councils could combine forces to insure risks such as public and employers' liability for which the insurance market is reluctant to provide cover. Municipal Mutual, which is owned by its policyholders, ceased writing new business and temporarily suspended payment of claims om Wednesday after rescue talks with Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires broke down. A number of councils whose insurance policies came up for renewal this week have experienced difficulty obtaining cover. For example, Gwynedd County Council paid a substantially higher premium for a temporary policy. 'In a full year, the council would have to find at least Pounds 500,000 over and above the present budgetary provision to meet the increased cost of premiums,' a council official said yesterday. The council's annual budget is about Pounds 160m. A number of insurers are also demanding that councils retain larger excesses, keeping larger amounts of risk on their own books and reinforcing the move towards self-insurance. An increasing number of London boroughs already self-insure. Their control of education gives them particularly large budgets - typically above Pounds 200m - allowing them to carry all but very large public liabilities. Islington has had a borough insurance fund for 10 years and has progressively shifted to self-insurance over the period. About 80 per cent of its risk is now self-insured. Concern is growing among Municipal Mutual's 2,000 staff that a scheme of arrange-ment would entail job losses. Many staff enjoy subsidised mortgages, paying 6 per cent interest on the first Pounds 25,000 borrowed. Mr Tony Whiteley, national officer of the MSF technicians' union, which represents 1,500 MMI staff, said: 'Workers could not only lose their jobs and redundancy rights, but also their homes, which are mortgaged to the MMI.'</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bramalea to default on two debt payments BRAMALEA, the ailing property developer controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is to default on two debt payments while it puts the finishing touches to a corporate restructuring plan. The company said yesterday it is negotiating an 'arrangement' with senior debenture holders under which they would refrain from taking bankruptcy action against it until at least the end of August. The restructuring is due to be cleared with all lenders by then. Bramalea has debts of CDollars 4.9bn (USDollars 4.15bn). Its troubles stem largely from purchases of undeveloped land, at the peak of the last property boom. Plans to pay down debt by selling assets have been stalled by the severe slump in North American real estate markets. The company said yesterday its five major Canadian bank lenders, as well as Trizec, its controlling shareholder, have agreed in principle to the terms of the plan, including providing financial support for the next five years. The main thorn in Bramalea's side in recent months however, has been its smaller lenders, including several foreign banks, which have less to lose if it is forced to file for court protection. The two debt payments to be skipped are a CDollars 5.2m interest payment on a series of senior debentures, on which the grace period expired yesterday; and a principal payment on another series of debentures. Under the restructuring plan, Bramalea hopes to cut its debt - largely through asset sales - to about CDollars 2bn by 1997 and to produce a positive cash flow by next year. It has suspended all dividends.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(1). An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided. The system shall maintain pressure differentials and directional airflow as required to assure inward (or zero) airflow from areas outside of the greenhouse. Differential pressure transducers shall be used to sense pressure levels. If a system malfunctions, the transducers shall sound an alarm. A backup source of power should be considered. The supply and exhaust airflow shall be interlocked to assure inward (or zero) airflow at all times. The integrity of the greenhouse shall have an air leak rate (decay rate) not to exceed 7 percent per minute (logarithm of pressure against time) over a 20-minute period at 2 inches of water gauge pressure. Nominally, this is 0.05 inches of water gauge pressure loss in 1 minute at 2 inches water gauge pressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(2). Exhaust air from the greenhouse facility shall be filtered through high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and discharged to the outside and dispersed away from occupied buildings and air intakes. Filter chambers shall be designed to allow  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in situ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decontamination before filters are removed and to facilitate certification testing after they are replaced. HEPA filters shall be provided to treat air supplied to the greenhouse facility. HEPA filters shall be certified annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d. Other (BL4&hyph;P) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(1). Sewer vents and other ventilation lines contain high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters. HEPA filters shall be certified annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(2). A pass-through dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an equivalent method of decontamination shall be provided to ensure decontamination of materials and equipment that cannot be decontaminated in the autoclave. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(3). Liquid effluent from sinks, floors, and autoclave chambers shall be decontaminated by heat or chemical treatment before being released from the maximum containment greenhouse facility. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets may be decontaminated by heat or chemical treatment. Autoclave and chemical decontamination of liquid wastes shall be evaluated by appropriate standard procedures for autoclaved wastes. Decontamination shall be evaluated mechanically and biologically using a recording thermometer and an indicator microorganism with a defined heat susceptibility pattern. If liquid wastes are decontaminated with chemical disinfectants, the chemicals used must have demonstrated efficacy against the target or indicator microorganisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;d&hyph;(4). If there is a central vacuum system, it shall not serve areas outside of the greenhouse facility. In-line high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters shall be placed as near as practicable to each use point or vacuum service cock. Other liquid and gas services to the greenhouse facility shall be protected by devices that prevent back-flow. HEPA filters shall be certified annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;III. Biological Containment Practices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appropriate selection of the following biological containment practices may be used to meet the containment requirements for a given organism. The present list is not exhaustive; there may be other ways of preventing effective dissemination that could possibly lead to the establishment of the organism or its genetic material in the environment resulting in deleterious consequences to managed or natural ecosystems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;III&hyph;A. Biological Containment Practices (Plants) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;III&hyph;A&hyph;1. Effective dissemination of plants by pollen or seed can be prevented by one or more of the following procedures: (i) Cover the reproductive structures to prevent pollen dissemination at flowering and seed dissemination at maturity; (ii) remove reproductive structures by employing male sterile strains, or harvest the plant material prior to the reproductive stage; (iii) ensure that experimental plants flower at a time of year when cross-fertile plants are not flowering within the normal pollen dispersal range of the experimental plant; or (iv) ensure that cross-fertile plants are not growing within the known pollen dispersal range of the experimental plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

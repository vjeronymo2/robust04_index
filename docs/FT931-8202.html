			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Carmakers: some win . . . some lose - FT reporters investigate who will bear the brunt of the priceeffects of devaluation in five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers, consumers, UK manufacturers pr suppliers abroad? SUCH is the global nature of the motor industry of the 1990s that devaluation's impact on UK manufacturers, markets and dealers is one of swings and roundabouts. For big multinationals such as Ford and Vauxhall, the 15 per cent higher cost of importing cars and components from Germany and Belgium is partly offset by exports of UK-built Fiestas and Escorts, plus engines and other components for which the UK is Ford's only source. For Rover Group, devaluation has mostly been a boon. Of its total Pounds 2.2bn annual spending on components, 80 per cent is in the UK and only 11 per cent in continental Europe. Not only is it benefiting from being more competitive abroad - reflected in the planned doubling of Montego and Maestro output - but its UK dealers have more market leeway because of price rises forced on some of their importing rivals. Ford's loss-making subsidiary Jaguar can afford a pained smile, too. Heavily dependent on US sales, its losses have shrunk as sterling has sunk from Dollars 2 to under Dollars 1.45. For big component makers, devaluation's net effect is variable - not just because of sterling's widely varying shifts against other currencies. As part of the globalisation process, GKN, T&amp;N, Lucas and other large components groups have set up a network of overseas plants. In sterling terms GKN is a beneficiary of its German plants serving German carmakers, and of its dollar-based businesses in North Carolina. Less than a quarter of GKN's output is in the UK, requiring more expensive raw materials. But, as with T&amp;N, much of this output is exported and, with its low-cost UK labour content, more price-competitive. The real crunch is for importers of German cars because recession-plagued Britons do not want to know about the price increases importers need to offset devaluation. Given the market's plunge of 700,000 units to fewer than 1.6m units in three years, they barely want to know about car purchases at all. As a result BMW's wholly owned sales subsidiary has struck a novel agreement with its 160 UK dealers. BMW(GB) has been very profitable, making more than Pounds 22m on its 38,000 car sales in 1991 and further profits last year. But the 1992 figures will not reflect devaluation because BMW bought currency forward at a 1992 average of DM2.84. Having obtained cover for this year's first quarter at DM 2.50, it increased retail prices by only 3 per cent in December. But the pain will be much worse if its next forward buying has to be around DM2.36. So it is insisting that dealers share it by capping their profit margins. Volkswagen has raised list prices by 7.5 per cent since September. But having taken over UK distribution from Lonrho it wants a substantially larger market share and so is leaving dealer margins unchanged at about 15 per cent. Nevertheless, this leaves dealers with the same problem as that causing friction elsewhere - including at market leader Ford. Ford price rises last month left UK-built Fiesta retail prices only about 2.5 per cent higher than in early 1992, but those of Escorts are about 7.6 per cent higher and German-built Granadas and Sierras 13 per cent higher. Mr Alan Pulham, a director of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, says consumers will not tolerate such increases. Even though dealers are being charged more, their effective margins - officially unchanged  - are being further squeezed. Mr Pulham said: 'We believe that the time is right for manufacturers to reduce wholesale prices - it is appropriate that questions should now be asked about where and how wholesale prices of new cars are set and achieved.' Manufacturers, he claims, grab 90 per cent of any price increases at a time when car dealers have the lowest net margins of any retail sector. Manufacturers reject the charges. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford's chairman, points to Ford's big losses in the UK and says no manufacturer can ignore the devaluation and last year's 4 per cent inflation.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S GAMES  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE  </P> <P> NO. 16 UCLA (11-2, 5-0) at STANFORD (10-3, 2-2), 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- ESPN. Radio -- KMPC (710).  </P> <P> UCLA, a 73-67 winner over Arizona last Saturday, hopes to keep its perfect  conference record intact against a Cardinal team that has won 19 of its last 20  home games. Stanford is led by forward Adam Keefe, a 6-9, 230-pound sophomore  from Irvine who is the Pac-10's No. 2 scorer and No. 1 rebounder, averaging 21  points and 10.5 rebounds a game. Forward Andrew Vlahov, who is averaging 9.6  points and 5.7 rebounds, is the only returning starter from a team that was  26-7 last season, including two victories over UCLA. The Cardinal won its first  eight games but has since lost to No. 1-ranked Kansas and to Oregon State and  Washington in Pac-10 play.  </P> <P> USC (6-6, 1-4) at CALIFORNIA (12-4, 3-2), 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070).  </P> <P> Tonight's game matches two of the top freshmen in the Pac-10, USC guard Harold  Miner and Cal center Brian Hendrick. Miner has averaged 23.3 points in his last  six games. Hendrick, a 6-foot-8 redshirt freshman from Diamond Bar High, is  averaging 15.4 points and 7.9 rebounds. He led the NCAA in field goal  percentage last week with 70.5%. Cal's three-guard offense has been effective.  Point guard Keith Smith is averaging 16.5 points and 7.4 assists, and backcourt  mate Ryan Drew is averaging 10.6 points. Forward Roy Fisher has also played  well, averaging 15.1 points and 6.1 rebounds.  </P> <P> BIG WEST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> CS FULLERTON (8-6, 2-3) at CS LONG BEACH (11-3, 4-2), 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- SportsChannel. Radio -- KORG (1190).  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach has won five of its last six games and is 6-0 in its  campus gym. Rebounding from a defeat at UC Santa Barbara, the 49ers defeated  first-place New Mexico State, 72-56, Monday night as guard Tyrone Mitchell had  11 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals. Forward Kevin Cutler had  his best game in a month, scoring 17 points against the Aggies. Cal State  Fullerton, which lost, 66-60, at San Jose State Monday night, is 2-6 on the  road. Forward Cedric Ceballos is averaging 21.6 points a game, and guard Mark  Hill is averaging 20.9. The teams have split their last four games.  </P> <P> UC IRVINE (2-13, 0-6) at NEVADA LAS VEGAS (11-3, 5-1), 8 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- Channel 56. Radio -- KORG (1190).  </P> <P> A loss tonight would clinch Irvine's second consecutive losing season and only  the third in Coach Bill Mulligan's 10 seasons. Irvine has not won since  defeating San Diego State, 75-62, on Dec. 16, a streak of eight losses. UNLV,  the nation's ninth-ranked team, is tied for the conference lead with New Mexico  State. Irvine is in last place. UNLV returns home after four road games,  including victories at Temple on Saturday and Fresno State on Monday. An NCAA  investigation into an unpaid school loan sidelined guard Anderson Hunt, the  Rebels' third-leading scorer, for the Temple game. But Hunt, who averages 15.1  points, returned against Fresno State. Forward Larry Johnson leads the Rebels,  averaging 20.6 points and 10.7 rebounds. Center Ricky Butler averages 15.1  points to lead Irvine.  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banks begin to face the facts - In the second of a series on exporting, Richard Gourlay and Ian Hamilton Fazey consider the role of lenders Hardly a day goes by when UK industry is not encouraged to export; with equal regularity there is a chorus of protest from exporters saying that banks do not understand their needs. According to Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Exports, the biggest challenge exporters face is in dealing with their lenders. Finding flexible forms of finance comes before arranging insurance or even planning a marketing strategy. 'Banks' understanding is very limited at the local level, although there are good people at the head office,' says Campbell. A 1993 study by the institute showed that banks were the first call for advice on exporting for 80 per cent of smaller companies but 72 per cent of them said the advice they received was of no use. One of the most common complaints from exporters was that banks lack adequate understanding of their customers' foreign markets. 'When exporting you need to be far more flexible if you are going to gain contracts,' says Roger Walker, managing director of Long Products, a manufacturer of anti-corrosion and water proofing materials based in Rye, East Sussex. The company exports about 85 per cent of its Pounds 3m annual sales. Ideally exporters should be in a position to offer a financing package when they go into negotiations with customers. But many complain that their commercial position is undermined by their banks not matching the flexible finance offered by overseas competitors. Exporters cannot, however, be exonerated from all blame. Often they turn to their banks far too late in the day. According to Stuart Natus, head of international trade services at Barclays Bank, it is common for customers to say: 'I have something which is being shipped tomorrow, how do I finance it?' or, 'what can I do, the letter of credit has not arrived?' Alternatively, companies may simply be talking to the wrong people in their banks. It is unrealistic to expect most branch managers to be conversant with collection methods in Italy, for example. While a number of banks are setting up business centres with a resident international trade specialist, exporters need a far more professional approach to ensure their export finance is properly lined up. 'Companies should look at export finance quite separately from their ordinary retail banking needs,' says Walker. 'It is up to individuals to assess the quality of the banks and the people in the bank they are dealing with.' Walker's knowledge of shopping around is the result of bitter experience. Four years ago Long Products had to turn away orders that cost the company Pounds 400,000 of profits over two years. With no warning, his bank started withdrawing its export financing facility from the market, giving him no time to make alternative arrangements. The bank told Walker that head office was trying to reduce its capital lending ratios. After much research and an expensive two-year transition, Walker now does his foreign business with Barclays in London and his domestic banking with the Royal Bank of Scotland. 'When we unscrambled our banking arrangement, we got our sales and profitability back up because we could go into the export market with renewed confidence,' he says. Whistling a tune composed in head office is not uncommon for local branch managers. Elaine Thomson, managing director of Frederick Thomson in Crewe, faced a similar situation with NatWest. Having won a Pounds 260,000 order to make specialist baking machinery from Fazer of Finland, Thomson says she was assured by her branch manager that he would provide a guarantee to return a deposit if the equipment was not shipped. Then, on the instruction of the regional office in Liverpool, NatWest said it would not issue the guarantee and Frederick Thomson lost the order. Thomson rescued the order when an insurance company agreed to provide the guarantee, but only with the help of the Bank Relationship Consultancy, a group that advises companies how to get more from their banks. NatWest says Thomson, which had been losing money, had unusual trading patterns and that the bank had tried to be as supportive as possible. Another significant problem is that UK banks, when judging how much security a debtor book can support, will usually ascribe no value to foreign debt receivables, however large the customer, unless they are backed by credit insurance. 'When the banks take a charge over the assets, they may allow 60 per cent against domestic debtors but nothing against overseas debts,' says Mark Runiewicz of the Bank Relationship Consultancy. Barclays' Natus says the bank is currently considering changing its policy to take a 'more educated view' of the risk of foreign debtors. If the attitude is relaxed, exporters would immediately be able to tap a new source of security against which to raise finance. But as long as the policy remains, companies will continue hiding their export receivables in their debtor book, undermining the trust on which relations with banks is best built. Elsewhere there are signs that the banks may be responding to exporters' needs. After a gap of some years, NatWest has reintroduced an export finance scheme aimed at the smaller exporter whose overdraft is insufficient to support its foreign trade. What is more, there is growing recognition among banks that the service they offer exporters could be improved. Andy Nemes, of NatWest's international trade and banking services division, admits that the barrage of complaints at last year's exporter forums chaired by the Financial Times was an 'eye-opener'. A former deputy head of the bank's staff training college, Nemes says NatWest is going to modify its training programmes as a result of what he and his colleagues learned. And the institute is working with NatWest to devise a course for bank staff on exporting.</p>

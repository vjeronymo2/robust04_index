Grondahl, president of the 165-member Storting, remarked  that  Norway faces a similar problem with Russian nuclear dumping near  its own borders, government officials said.    She said Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who canceled  plans to visit Japan in January because of a cold, hopes to  visit in the near future to discuss the problem.    Hosokawa said Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata plans to raise  the issue when he visits Russia this month.    Grondahl is visiting Japan at the invitation of the House of  Councillors.</p>

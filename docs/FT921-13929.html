			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Frankfurt considers electronic trading THE FRANKFURT stock exchange, the largest in Germany, is considering plans for a fully electronic trading system by the middle of the decade, a move which would transform Germany's financial markets. The first step would be to abolish floor trading in the shares of Germany's 30 largest companies, according to proposals debated yesterday by the board of the Frankfurt exchange. The exchange will decide by April whether to adopt the plans. News of the proposals came a day after the federal government launched a package of measures designed to strengthen Germany's role as a world financial centre. Chief among these were plans to introduce a centralised body to regulate the securities industry and to implement laws against insider dealing. Both measures are to be introduced by the year-end. A move to a fully electronic system could be just as significant for the future of Germany's financial markets. It is likely to have a profound effect on the structure of securities trading in Germany by concentrating business now spread between four separate market systems. It will also act as a catalyst for further centralisation of securities trading around Frankfurt, which already handles more than 50 per cent of the business conducted on Germany's eight exchanges. Mr Rudiger von Rosen, chairman of the exchange, said such a move would be consistent with developments in other markets. It would strengthen Germany's position as a financial services centre by enhancing liquidity and transparency in German share-trading and reducing transaction costs. Details of the proposals, contained in a report prepared by the McKinsey consulting firm, have not officially been made public. However, the essence of the report has leaked out, provoking a furore among the so-called Freie Makler, the official brokers who act as intermediaries on the official market on which the bulk of domestic trading in the 30 largest companies is done. The Maklers fear they will lose business to the banks which will be able to buy and sell directly via the new computer system. At present, they are responsible for setting prices on the market floor, which is open for business for three hours each day. The McKinsey report is believed to conclude that there is no long-term future in running a screen-based system in parallel with floor-trading. Any full computerisation would follow the introduction of the Ibis screen-based trading system in April last year which allows dealing in shares in the DAX 30 index as well as in certain widely traded bond issues, alongside floor trading. After a slow start, Ibis has gathered importance. But the planned system would be more sophisticated and would, in time, replace floor trading altogether.</p>

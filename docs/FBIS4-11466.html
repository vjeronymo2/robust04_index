			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil will participate in the  reconstruction of Vietnam, especially in connection with  infrastructure projects and the exploitation of oil in the Sea  of China. The IMF and the World Bank will lend the Vietnamese  Government more than $10 billion to rebuild the country, and  Brazil wants a share of the market that will be created with  these funds. A Brazilian business mission -- the first in the  history of relations between the two nations -- already has  spent two days in Vietnam. On 23 April, the mission will travel  to Malaysia, one of the most developed Southeast Asian nations.    Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai visited Brazil in  October 1993 and conveyed Vietnam's interest in improving  commercial relations with Brazil. In 1993 Brazil had a trade  deficit with Vietnam: It exported goods worth $4.2 million and  imported Vietnamese products worth $30.3 million (mostly rice  and chemical products).  <H5>  A Tiger </H5>   The Brazilian Foreign Ministry Promotion Department has  pinpointed several business opportunities for Brazilian firms in  Vietnam. Oil looks like the most promising field. Vietnam has  large unexploited oil and natural gas deposits in the Sea of  China. Brazil also is interested in infrastructure projects such  as highways, hydroelectric power plants, basic sanitation  projects, civil construction, and low-income housing.    Even before the U.S. commercial embargo on Vietnam collapsed  two months ago, several U.S. companies had set up shop in  Vietnam. "Vietnam is a cat that will become a tiger," according  to a Brazilian Foreign Ministry official. Vietnam, which has a  population of 60 million and a per-capita income of barely $200  per year, has established an economic system along the lines of  the "Asian Tigers," and has been receiving investments from  Japan, the United States, and European countries, mainly Germany.</p>

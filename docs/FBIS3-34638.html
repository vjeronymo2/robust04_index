The size of the  Jericho area will be decided upon in a meeting between Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Israel  and the Palestinians also agreed on several security issues, on  the powers of the Palestinian authority under autonomy, and on a  number of other disputed issues. The agreement and the  accompanying maps were signed by Foreign Ministry Director  General Uri Savir and PLO representative Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad  Quray']. The foreign minister and the PLO chairman added their  signatures.    Our correspondent in Cairo Moti Amir reports that the signed  agreement will be valid for one year after which a committee  established by both parties will be able to reexamine it. As  for the Gaza Strip, the parties last night agreed that it would  have three settlement areas which would also contain the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] bases responsible for the Jewish  settlers' security. Major General 'Uzi Dayan clarified that  Israel would retain exclusive responsibility for the east-west  roads which the settlers would use to drive from the Gaza Strip  into Israel. The areas on the side of the road would be under  Israeli responsibility in coordination with the Palestinians.  Israeli security forces would have the right to act against any  elements who either seek to harm or actually attack Israelis  moving on the agreed upon roads. At a certain stage, the  Palestinians will assume responsibility for the pursuit of the  perpetrators.    Israel will retain full control of the border area in the  Gaza Strip, as well as full responsibility for the security  arrangements at the Rafah border crossing. On the Allenby  Bridge, Israel will have the inviolable right to check any  person crossing the bridge from Jordan and will be authorized to  prevent the entry of any undesirable individual. Those barred  entry will not be permitted to appeal the decision. An Israeli  security guard will be stationed on the bridge. There will be  two inspection rooms at the border terminal, one room for Israel  and the other for the Palestinians. The agreement also  stipulates arrangements for the Jericho area but the size of  this area will be decided upon during the meeting between  Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat.    Egyptian President Husni Mubarak welcomed the agreement. He  telephoned Prime Minister Rabin and invited him to visit Egypt.  Mr. Rabin thanked the Egyptians for their contribution to the  peace process and said he would gladly visit Egypt after the  implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians had begun.  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reported that the prime  minister approved all the details of the agreement. The chief  of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of the  Intelligence Branch, and the director of the Shin Bet arrived at  the prime minister's bureau, examined every detail of the  agreement, and conveyed their approval to Cairo. Our political  correspondent reports that the military, civilian, and economic  talks will resume next week in Taba and Paris. The two parties  will also discuss the issue of the Gaza Strip roads in detail at  the Taba talks.    Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  the IDF will be capable of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and  the Jericho area within one month if it is required to do so.  Army sources nevertheless asserted that an additional 300  million shekels, on top of the already authorized sum of 250  million shekels, would be required to finance the redeployment.</p>

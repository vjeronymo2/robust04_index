			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The environmental assessment includes an estimate of potential exposure from all accident types combined. Regulatory Guide 1.49 requires calculation of accident doses at 102% of uprated thermal power, or 3510 MWt. Although direct comparison with the original analyses is not meaningful because of changes in methodology, a comparison on a consistent basis would show that the expected dose is approximately proportional to power. The original calculation was done at 3439 MWt. The estimated potential exposure from all accident types combined will therefore change by about the ratio of 3510/3439, or about 2 percent, which is not a significant change compared to the uncertainty in the probability estimates. No revision of these analyses is therefore required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Liquid radwaste throughput may increase up to 5% to a level which is within the processing capability of the system.) The activity levels of some radwaste streams containing coolant activation products may increase up to 10%, due to the 4.5% core flux increase and a 5% crud increase to the reactor which are assumed to occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the power uprate level of 3441 MWt is not significantly different from that analyzed previously, it is not anticipated there will be a significant increase in radiological effluents. Also, pre-power uprate technical specification limits will be maintained. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has concluded that the NRC's FES (NUREG&hyph;0564) is valid for operation at the proposed uprated power conditions. The staff also concluded that the plant operating parameters impacted by the proposed power uprate would remain within the bounding conditions on which the conclusions of the FES are based. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRS staff has reviewed the licensee's re-evaluation of the potential radiological and non-radiological environmental impacts for the proposed action. On the basis of this review, the NRC staff finds that the radiological and non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed small increase in power are essentially immeasurable and do not change the conclusion in the FES that the operation of Susquehanna would cause no significant adverse impact upon the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed license amendment, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not significantly reduce the environmental impact of plant operation but would restrict operation of Susquehanna, Unit 2 to the currently licensed power level and prevent the facility from generating the approximately 50 MWe that is obtainable from the existing plant design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2,'' dated June 1981. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Bureau of Radiation Protection, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.

The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 24, 1993.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (2): New finance minister wins support - The economy Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, has entrusted the mission of leading his country out of recession to Mr Eduardo Catroga, a genial, silver-haired businessman who was sworn in as finance minister following a cabinet reshuffle last December. Mr Catroga, respected in the corporate world for his capacity for decision-making, is a former company manager with practical experience of the problems of Portuguese industry. His down-to-earth approach has already won sympathy from a business and financial community often at odds with his younger, technocratic or academic predecessors. Support for the minister to pull the country out of its first recession in eight years is strong, but he has no illusions that the task is going to be easy. 'Recovery may be slow and difficult,' he warned in his first speech, delivered to a conference of industrialists. After eight years when its growth rate was higher than the European Union average, Portugal fell into recession in 1993 with output dropping an estimated 0.5 to 1 per cent. Exports were hit hard by recession in the EU, which accounts for three quarters of the country's trade, falling by a forecast 3-5 per cent in volume. External difficulties were compounded by policy mismanagement at home as the tax machine virtually collapsed, leading to a doubling of the budget deficit over the original forecast. Markets were confused by a rift over interest-rate policy between the finance ministry and the central bank. In the face of a deepening slump, the government, which had originally forecast 3 per cent growth in 1993, was forced to abandon the premise that Portugal was an oasis of expansion in a Europe laid low by recession. Recession, most analysts agree, was an inevitability that the government tried too long to ignore. 'The cycle of growth in Portugal had been so extraordinarily long that an adjustment could no longer be avoided,' says one bank economist. The slump will get worse before it gets better, but there are signs that it will bottom out during the first half of 1994. Portugal should register positive growth of 0.5-1 per cent this year, most probably remaining below the EU average. Recovery is expected to take a firmer grip in 1995, moving gross domestic product growth close to 3 per cent. An improvement in some of Portugal's main markets, most notably the UK, should boost exports towards the end of this year. An expected gradual 2-3 per cent devaluation of the escudo in 1994 against the currencies of the country's main trading partners will help make export prices more competitive. The government has been maintaining a strong escudo since 1990. The central bank made expensive interventions to maintain the currency's parity during the foreign exchange crises of 1993. Nevertheless, the escudo devalued by some 10 per cent last year against an average of European currencies. But now that inflationary pressures are more subdued and the currency has achieved stability within the EU's exchange rate mechanism, the central bank is likely to adopt a less interventionist approach to exchange rate policy. Transfers of EU funds will almost certainly make the most important contribution to recovery in Portugal. The country's Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 will benefit from Es3,500bn in subsidies from Brussels. 'This is double the amount Portugal received from 1988 to 1993 and represents about 3 per cent of GDP a year,' says Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist with Banco Portugues de Investimento. Most of these funds, scheduled to begin arriving this summer, will be channelled into transport infrastructures, telecommunications and industrial grants, mobilising total public and private investment of some Es10,000bn over the six-year period. Grants for professional training will provide at least temporary occupation for some 50,000 workers. Mr Catroga's other main instrument for fostering recovery will be interest rates. Portuguese industry has been heavily penalised by the high cost of money. After a fall of 4 percentage points in 1993, small and medium-sized companies were paying interest rates of 16 per cent for 30-day credit at the end of the year, a real rate of 9.5 per cent. 'Recovery requires a sustained reduction in the costs of corporate financing that brings Portuguese interest rates much closer to those in other European countries,' the minister says. The central bank has already cut its liquidity absorption rate four times this year by a total of 0.75 percentage points, signalling a reduction in short-term credit rates. Further substantial reductions are expected through the year. Mr Catroga has made clear that a reduction in interest rates can only be achieved against a background of budgetary control and wage restraint if inflation is to be kept in check. He is likely to be less successful with budgetary control than with wage restraint. Portugal succeeded in cutting its budget deficit from 12 per cent of GDP in 1984 to 4.7 per cent in 1992, but it soared to 8.2 per cent in the recessionary climate of 1993. Improvements in tax administration are urgently needed to boost public finances but even with progress in this direction the budget deficit is unlikely to fall much below the 1993 level either this year or in 1995, an election year. Negotiations for a national wage pact for 1994 collapsed late last year, but the government has set a tough example for the private sector by keeping public administrative sector pay rises to 2.5 per cent. Private sector workers fearful of unemployment, which is expected to grow from 6.2 per cent in 1993 to some 7.5 per cent this year, are likely to settle pay claims at below 4 per cent. In this climate, average annual inflation should fall from 6.5 per cent in 1993 to around 5.5-6 per cent this year. But an expanding budget deficit could lead to a slight rise in inflation in 1995 to about 7 per cent. 'I have great confidence that Portuguese companies will grow more and more competitive,' says Mr Catroga. He is as aware as anyone of the difficulties that process will entail. Industrial production has been falling steadily since 1991. Achieving greater competitiveness through restructuring will be a politically painful process involving company closures, large-scale dismissals and relocations.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Protests for jobs in Italy THOUSANDS of Italians yesterday demonstrated over job prospects to increase the pressure on a government which opponents say is reaching the end of the line, Reuter reports from Rome. Some 50,000 building workers, angry over the effects of the country's huge corruption scandal on employment, demonstrated in central Rome, while steelworkers protesting against EU production cuts went on strike in the southern port city of Taranto. Italy's two main opposition parties, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the fast-growing, pro-autonomy Northern League, are pushing hard for early elections. In Rome city centre, traffic ground to a halt for the second successive day as a result of demonstrations. On Monday, traffic wardens took to the streets to protest against privatisation plans and to demand better benefits. Construction work has virtually come to a halt in Rome as city officials suspend investment while a storm rages over bribes paid for public sector contracts. Officials say some 120,000 jobs in the construction sector have already been lost in 1993.</p>

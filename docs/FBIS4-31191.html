			<p>BFN     [Text] In the spirit of the agreement between the liberal  parties, the leaders of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  have informed the leaders of the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] that in the coming days they will begin coalition  discussions with the Socialists. All the signs indicate that  this is the last act of the liberal parties' cooperation  concluded before the elections. Laszlo Kover [head of the  Fidesz parliamentary group] is at the microphone with Dora  Adorjan:    [Begin Kover recording] [Fidesz Presidium member] Janos Ader  and I received Gabor Kuncze [head of the SZDSZ parliamentary  group] and [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto, who, in the terms of the  agreement with the SZDSZ, informed us that they have received a  request from the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] to take part  in the coalition discussions and that, as is known, they were  given the mandate for this by the delegates' assembly.    Apart from this, they inquired what would be Fidesz's  possible reaction to a coalition invitation. To this we were  able to reply by saying what we have already said, namely that  we cannot reply to a nonexistent invitation. If an official  request arrives from the MSZP, then the national board will  satisfy the duties that devolve upon it from the statutes. It  will discuss a possible invitation and decide on it.    If the SZDSZ raises this issue at the talks with the MSZP --  incidentally, although it has the right to do this, it can only  do so on its own behalf -- we have asked them that in any event  they should do it in such a way that it should be clear that it  is their opinion and that they are not conveying some kind of  message.

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / People: Chatham House plugs environment gap The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Britain's premier foreign-policy think tank, has plugged an embarrassing gap at the top of its research staff by promoting Michael Grubb, 33, to be director of its energy and environment programme. Grubb, who has worked at the Royal Institute's Chatham House headquarters since October 1988, replaces Gerald Pollio. The latter had been hired in July 1992 from Chemical Bank - where he had been a senior adviser on energy  -to take over from the widely respected Jonathan Stern. Under Stern the institute had made quite a name for itself in the energy and environment world. Its programme has twice as many corporate sponsors as any other in the institute and Pollio's abrupt departure after less than six months in the job led to a leadership vacuum in an important part of Chatham House's research effort. Grubb, previously at Imperial College and the Cavendish Laboratories, Cambridge, has been the energy and environment programme's senior researcher. His appointment means that the research programme can return to normal. The Institute is scheduled to publish next Wednesday three of the pieces of research which have been held up. These include a 200-page analysis of the Rio Earth Summit Agreements from last June; a 100-page report on environmental profiles of European business; and a report on the current stalled state of EC climate policy.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: ICCO may sell cheaply to Russia THE International Cocoa Organisation is to discuss whether to sell cocoa from its buffer stock to Russia on favourable terms to boost world prices, Reuter reports. But the ICCO, which starts a four-day meeting at its London headquarters today, will concentrate on administrative issues, delegates said. Negotiations for a new economic cocoa pact under the auspices of UNCTAD in Geneva, Switzerland, will continue. Producers and consumers have still not agreed on the mechanism to be used.</p>

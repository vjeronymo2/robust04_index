			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "hen": "The Petroleum Business"] </F>   [Text] Unless Polish petroleum refineries are thoroughly  modernized, they will not be able to stand up to competition  from Western petroleum concerns after 1997. The capital  investment projects required for their modernization will amount  to $3-3.5 million. If we fail to find enough money to finance  these, it is possible that the entire petroleum refining  industry will have to be liquidated. The refineries themselves  should be able to produce a significant share of the funds.  Modernization is a much more urgent priority for this sector of  the economy than ownership transformations.    This view is shared by the leadership teams heading our  industry sectors. An intersectoral group set up by the prime  minister will elaborate a project of restructuring the  petroleum-extracting and -refining industry, which is expected  to require about 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. Experts believe that  the banks, together with petroleum refineries, which at present  make profits on the order of 15 percent, will be able to produce  this sum over the next few years. There is no shortage of  opinions claiming that, if the petroleum sector were to be  privatized, the budget's losses would overtake the revenues from  the sale of selected elements of this industry to foreign  concerns. Only partial privatization would be considered. The  state does not intend to willingly relinquish control over the  fuels market and its development strategy.    Foreign concerns are not particularly interested in  participating in the modernization of Polish petroleum  refineries. They find the prospect of taking over our fuel  market a much more attractive proposition. The Central Agency  for Petroleum Products remains the largest purveyor of fuels in  Poland, selling them at 1,370 gas stations throughout the  country. Private distributors sell much less gas, despite the  fact that they have as many as 2,500 gas stations. Foreign  petroleum concerns invest increasingly large sums of money in  the development of the retail distribution network. Recently,  16 large fuel stations were built by foreign petroleum  companies, including three by Esso and six by the Neste concern.  The U.S. petroleum concern Conoco is very active in Poland. To  date, it has built four fuel stations in Poland. A fifth  station is currently being built in Radom, and the construction  of another three--in Czechowice-Dziedzice, Tychy, and Lublin--is  to be launched in the next few weeks. The Conoco concern has  already invested some $7 million in the expansion of its retail  distribution network in Poland.</p>

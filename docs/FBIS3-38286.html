			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner for  Refugees on Tuesday [1 February] protested to Belgrade against  the mobilisation of Bosnian Serb refugees in rump Yugoslavia  (Serbia and Montenegro), and denounced a new wave of ethnic  cleansing in western Bosnia.    Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the mobilisation of hundreds of  Serbian refugees to fight on the warfronts in Bosnia was  "illegal."    She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at  night  to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also  protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia  with Croat refugees from Bosnia.    Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of  killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are  trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region  and confiscating their property.    The bodies of three old men were found with their throats  cut  on January 22 at Prijedor. Sixteen mosques were destroyed in  the region in December and there have been 40 emergency  evacuations every week, she said.    Expelled refugees were moreover being made to pay for their  entry visas into Croatia and were forced to sell their  belongings, she added.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Researchers favour Labour economic plan A LABOUR victory in Thursday's general election would boost UK growth prospects over the next two years, cutting the jobless total by up to 70,000, according to two forecasts published today by independent research groups. The forecasts - from the London Business School and the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club - say the effect of higher interest rates that are likely after a Labour win would be outweighed by more expansionary economic policies. Although unemployment is likely to be lower by an average of up to 70,000 over the next two years under Labour rather than the Conservatives, inflation and the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) would probably be higher. According to the LBS, the economy would expand by 1.5 per cent this year under Labour, compared with 1.2 per cent under the Conservatives. That would be followed by 2.8 per cent growth next year under Labour, or 2.5 per cent under the Tories. Item, a panel of economists that bases its forecasts on the Treasury's computerised economic model, says Labour would preside over growth of 0.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent this year and next, compared with 0.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent for the Conservatives. According to Item, a coalition government of Labour and the Liberal Democrats would lead to growth this year of 0.7 per cent, higher than for either a Labour or Tory administration governing on its own. Most of the higher growth would be due to extra tax-financed public spending. The LBS foresees unemployment under Labour this year and next averaging 2.64m, 70,000 less than the average figure under the Tories of 2.71m. Item says the average under Labour would be 2.87m, 50,000 less than the figure for the Conservatives of 2.92m. The forecasters base their calculations on proposals outlined by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, as against the effect of continued Tory policies. According to the LBS, under Labour the retail prices index would grow by 4.6 per cent this year and 3.7 per cent next, compared with 4.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent under the Conservatives. Item puts those numbers at 3.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent, and 3.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent.</p>

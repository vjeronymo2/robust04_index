			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rally in futures market helps Nikkei advance 2.5% A RALLY in the futures market prompted small-lot index buying in cash stocks, and the Nikkei average advanced 2.5 per cent, moving above the 17,000 level for the first time since June 12, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 418.01 to close at the day's best of 17,201.73, after a low of 16,742.27 registered in the morning session. Volume, however, plunged to 180m shares from Friday's 310m. Rises outnumbered declines by 622 to 265, with 191 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks improved 15.37 to 1,298.95. In London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.50 to 1,028.06. In spite of the rise, traders were discouraged by the inactivity of investors. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities said: 'It is like looking into a cloudy crystal ball - you cannot read too much into price movements.' He added that investors will not become buyers until 'fundamentally good reasons appear'. In contrast to the lethargic cash market, active buying supported futures. 'There was constant large-lot buying which seemed to be short-covering,' said Mr Masa Sato, derivatives trader at Dai-Ichi Securities. Due to the lack of news, dealers continued to target short-term theme stocks. Taiyo Fishery, a leading fishery company planning to breed blue-fin tuna, rose Y12 to Y495 and Meiji Milk Products, currently developing an anti-Aids drug, climbed Y17 to Y987. Low-priced high-technology and car issues, viewed as potential takeover targets, were in demand. Fuji Heavy Industries, the car concern currently restructuring itself, was the most active issue of the day and put on Y5 to Y400. Ricoh, the office automation company, added Y9 at Y582. Banks were firmer on small-lot buying by investment trusts. Industrial Bank of Japan moved forward Y30 to Y1,700 and Sakura Bank Y18 to Y980. Mazda Motor appreciated Y12 to Y475. Investors were encouraged by reports that the company plans to tie up with Mercedes-Benz in the development of anti-pollution cars. Raito Kogyo, the civil engineering group, lost Y80 to Y2,050. The stock fell by its daily limit last Friday on reports of alleged defective construction on a dam project. Investors were further discouraged by reports that a two-month suspension from public works has been placed on the company. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 229.15 to 19,599.17 in volume of 4.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y11,300 as a stabilisation in currency movements made some leading blue chip exporters attractive. Roundup TOKYO'S recovery was not reflected elsewhere in the region. HONG KONG saw heavy buying in HSBC as the bank replaced Midland Bank, its long-sought acquisition, in the FT-SE 100 index. HSBC closed at a 1992 high of HKDollars 52, up HKDollars 3. Brokers said HSBC's agreement to sell its 10 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific for HKDollars 3.39bn also encouraged buying. The sale also boosted Cathay's price, which jumped 70 cents to HKDollars 12.60. The Hang Seng index closed 104.49, or 1.75 per cent, higher at 6,085.85, with turnover up from HKDollars 3.34bn to HKDollars 3.64bn. KUALA LUMPUR rose further in active trade. Volume rose to 89.2m shares from 95m as the KLSE composite index added 4.51 at 616.08. Utility Tenaga, which sparked the current rally when fund managers bought the stock aggressively last week, gained 10 cents to MDollars 10.10 after an intraday low of MDollars 9.70. Volume was a heavy 4.7m shares. AUSTRALIA lost ground on poor retail trade figures, the All Ordinaries index slipping 5.5 to 1,638.9. Most retailers were hit, but QIW, embroiled in a hostile takeover battle with Davids Holdings, was a notable exception, rising 16 cents to ADollars 6.76 as two strong buyers bid up the market. SINGAPORE was pulled down by selective blue chip selling, particularly of Overseas Union Bank. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.17 to 1,482.88 in volume of 60.9m shares (51.2m). OUB fell 30 cents to SDollars 5.10 in brisk volume of about 3m shares. Sembawang Shipyard declined 20 cents to SDollars 7.65 following a weekend fire aboard a chemical tanker under repair at the yard. The fire killed six people and injured 60. TAIWAN fell in thin, nervous trade, the weighted index weakening 72.14, or 1.7 per cent, to 4,312.38 in turnover of TDollars 19.8bn, against TDollars 15.7bn in Saturday's shortened session. SEOUL's index lost 6.96 to 512.54 on rumours that a second scandal was about to break. MANILA's investors took to the sidelines as the composite index retreated 31.55 to 1,444.73.</p>

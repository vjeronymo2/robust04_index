			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Tian Huiming (3944 1920 2494) and Yu </F> Donghui (0151 2639 2547)]    [Text] Beijing, 15 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- While many  managers of state-owned enterprise are considering the issue of  how to extricate themselves from the predicament of losses, Luo  Bingsheng, general manager of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Company,  is thinking about ways to expand the company's businesses in two  directions -- extending its influence over Southeast Asia and  gaining access to markets in Europe and the United States with  the aid of Hong Kong's position as a financial and trade center  and its advantages as a free port.    During an exclusive interview with these reporters a few  days  ago, Luo Bingsheng summarized the overseas development strategy  of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation as a "two-step" plan.    Shougang Overseas Headquarters, which has a staff of 6,000  people, has been established. General offices in Hong Kong and  New York, which are subordinate to the headquarters, were set  last year. Earlier this year, Shougang Southeast Asia Holdings  Corporation was registered in Singapore. The company's overseas  development strategy -- standing firm in Hong Kong, unfolding  its two wings, opening up new battlefields, and building new  bases -- has begun to take shape.    Luo Bingsheng said: In the course of reform and opening up,  the gates of Shoudu Iron and Steel Company must not only open to  the domestic market, but must open to the outside world as well.  The company must march into the international market to compete  with the largest corporations in the world.    Luo, an expert in iron and steel production who graduated  from Guizhou Industrial College in the 1960's, has such ideas:  "It is necessary to set up a concept of operating in debt and  courageously borrowing money and utilizing foreign capital to  develop ourselves."    In October 1992, the board of directors of Shoudu Iron and  Steel Company made a decision within 24 hours to join hands with  Hong Kong's tycoon Li Ka-Shing to take over Hong Kong's Tung  Wing Steel Holdings Limited. Later, it consecutively gained  control of four listed Hong Kong companies, comprising Eastern  Century Holdings Limited, Santai Manufacturing Limited, Kader  Holdings Company Limited, and Hoi Sing Holdings Limited. This  series of actions shook the Hong Kong stock market.    According to Zhou Guanwu, chairman of the Shoudu Iron and  Steel Company, the above actions were not giant strides but  small ones for the company in marching into Hong Kong.    In the meantime, the company took a major step to acquire a  steel works in California and a large iron mine in Peru, which  evoked repercussions both at home and abroad.    Luo Bingsheng added, smiling: Our business in the United  States is merely at a "stage of laying out chess pieces" and our  goal for the next step is to enter the U.S. stock market.    Luo Bingsheng said: The overseas development strategy put  into practice was the brainchild of Zhou Guanwu, the "chief  architect" of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation. In every  country, a number of backbone enterprises seek access to  international markets. Similarly, Shoudu Iron and Steel  Corporation is ready to enter international markets because it  has grown in strength and possesses this capability as a result  of 15 years' of reform.    According to Luo Bingsheng, a milestone of historic  significance in the development of the Shoudu Iron and Steel  Corporation was Deng Xiaoping's inspection on 22 May 1992 and  his instructions on that occasion that the company should take  the lead in the country's iron and steel industry.    Afterward, leading cadres of the State Council, including Li  Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came to inspect Shoudu Iron and  Steel one after another, and, centering around the development  objective of building the company into a large transnational  enterprise, decided to grant "three powers"--investment power,  financing power, and decisionmaking power in foreign trade--to  the company.    With these three powers, Shoudu Iron and Steel, like a tiger  with wings, began to operate international businesses as it  already had the important prerequisites for the exploration of  overseas markets.    Looking forward to the company's future, Luo Bingsheng said:  At the turn of the century, the output of the company's iron  and steel production base in Beijing will reach 10 million  tonnes a year, and that of the Qilu production base, which has  yet to be built, will also reach 10 million tonnes a year. With  the construction of an overseas iron and steel base with an  annual output of 5 million tonnes to be completed, the Shoudu  Iron and Steel Corporation will fully deserve the name of the  largest iron and steel company in the world.    Why can China's large enterprises not operate on an equal  footing with the big companies of the world? This is an issue  the general manager of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is  always thinking about.</p>

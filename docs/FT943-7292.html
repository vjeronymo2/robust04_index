			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Widespread support for blank tape levy Sir, Emma Tucker ('Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan', August 18) makes several misguided predictions about the effects of the European Commission's proposal to protect music copyright through a Europe-wide levy. Though the government has opposed this initiative in the past, the Music Copyright Reform Group, which represents those who create, own, publish or administer copyright music or lyrics, has found widespread support for the proposal among backbenchers of all political parties. Indeed, harmonisation of private copying legislation in the EU has even been welcomed by blank tape manufacturers. The suggestion that a levy would 'punish ordinary consumers' is not borne out by the experience in other European countries. In France, Germany and Austria, prices have fallen after the introduction of the levy due to intense competition between blank tape manufacturers. We believe that a reasonable levy for audio tapes could and would be fully absorbed by the blank tape manufacturers, who have benefited enormously from the public's ability to copy copyright music (research shows more than 90 per cent of blank tapes are used for this purpose). The proposals would not be bureaucratic, as suggested, since the organisation necessary to administer the distribution system for the levy exist in the UK. Nor would the blind and other disadvantaged users of blank tapes be hit as the proposal allows member states to exempt or compensate them. The UK government should realise that the proposed levy aims fully to compensate composers and music publishers for widespread, illegal private copying of pre-recorded music. The MCRG hopes that ministers will give their full support to protecting the interests of the UK music industry which plays such a vital role in the heritage of the UK and Europe.

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal prices lose Russian crisis gains METALS PRICES reacted only briefly yesterday to the threat that political turmoil in Russia might affect exports to the the west. After opening strongly, most prices dropped back when it became clear that consumers were not panicking and rushing to buy. Although Russia is a big supplier of aluminium, copper and, especially, nickel, London Metal Exchange stocks are at present very high and highly visible. Gold, which leapt Dollars 10 to Dollars 365.50 a troy ounce in New York immediately after the news that Russian premier Mr Boris Yeltsin had dissolved his parliament, closed last night in London less than Dollars 1 ahead of Tuesday's close at Dollars 354.25. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at the T. Hoare and Company financial services organisation, said she expected gold to 'spend a little more time between Dollars 348 and Dollars 360 before staging a convincing move into a new trading range based off Dollars 360, probably by the start of October'. That would represent the start of the second leg of the bull market. 'This does not mean rapid appreciation, but a solid, underlying upward trend.' Mr Nick Moore, analyst at the Ord Minnett financial services group, pointed out that 'huge western inventories will ensure there is no immediate consumer concern about base metals availability'. Nevertheless, market sentiment, at present very depressed, should improve after the events in Russia. However, there was danger if prices rallied to a point where western metal producers delayed desperately needed cuts in capacity. 'This is what happened in the Gulf war and that delayed necessary supply rationalisation for a year.' Reuter reported from Moscow that Russian traders, accustomed to political upheavals, said it would be business as usual during the latest crisis. Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest producer of that metal, said business would not be affected and contracts would be honoured.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (12): A guide for the businessman - What to look out for on your visit, and what to avoid, how to get there, where to stay and what to eat The country and the climate MOROCCO lies on the north-west corner of Africa, three hours' flight from London. It is the oldest kingdom in the Moslem world, the present Alaoui dynasty having been in power for more than three centuries. The climate varies considerably, from the northern coast, which is Mediterranean, to the old imperial city of Marrakesh at the foot of the High Atlas mountains, which is a favourite winter resort for Europeans and boasts dry, temperate winters and very hot summers. Along the Atlantic coast, the temperature is usually mild and often very damp, especially at night and during the winter. Morocco has a great variety of mountainous ranges, the highest peak, Jebel Toubkal, rising to over 4,000 metres. The region beyond Agadir is true desert climate, more pleasant to visit in winter and spring than summer. The resort of Agadir is open all year round and boasts 300 days of sunshine a year. Most of Morocco's 27m people are of Berber stock and speak Arabic. French is commonly spoken, though not in country areas. Getting there Most major western air companies fly to Morocco. Royal Air Maroc and GB Airways between them provide daily flights from the UK. Visas are not required for European Community citizens. The Dirham currency cannot be bought outside Morocco. Business hours Moroccan companies and administrations work a five-day week, from Monday to Friday, with a slightly longer lunch hour on Friday to allow those who wish to pray. During the Ramadan fast, which lasts one month, it is best to avoid travelling to Morocco. In winter, hours of business are 8am to noon and 2pm to 6pm; in summer (end of June to end of September) the hours are 8am to 4pm. Car hire Cars are easy to rent at major airports and hotels, but do not expect them to be in perfect condition. By European standards, car hire is expensive. Roads between major towns are good, though often narrow. A fast and regular rail service and a motorway now connect the political capital, Rabat, to the economic hub of Casablanca, 100 kilometres away. Hotels Hotels are easy to find and in general not expensive, especially if you get a discount from the official price. However, many four or five star hotels do not deserve their rating. In Rabat the choice is between an overpriced Hyatt Regency and the Tour Hassan, whose five-star de luxe rating is a standard joke. In Casablanca, the Royal Mansour remains true to its grand style and excellent service, while the Sheraton and the Holiday Inn offer good value. The Idou Anfa and Kandara hotels provide good average comfort and service. On the corniche, just outside the city, the Riad Salam is an attractive hotel. In Marrakesh, the world-famous Mamounia underwent a refurbishment 10 years ago, which was not a success, though its reception rooms, restaurant and garden remain very attractive. The four-star Hotel Nassim provides excellent service at competitive prices. Taroudant, in the southern foothills of the Atlas, boasts the Gazelle d'Or, a perfect resting place for the seriously rich, set in gardens outside the small walled town. In Fez the Palais Jamai provides spectacular views of the old religious capital of Morocco, though the service it offers is unworthy of its five-star de luxe status. The Minzah in Tangiers remains, arguably, the most attractive hotel in Morocco. Eating out Moroccan cooking ranks, alongside Turkish food, as the most refined in the Mediterranean. Good French and Italian food is also available in the large cities. You can safely shop by the roadside and eat 'keftas', skewers of meat sprinkled with saffron. Casablanca boasts one outstanding French establishment, Ma Bretagne, on the corniche just outside the city. Other good French restaurants include Neroli (which has just been taken over by Pierre, as one of Casablanca's oldest French master cooks is known), Le Pretexte, Le Volubilis in the Royal Mansour Hotel and La Gondole in the Centre 2000, near the railway station. This establishment is run by Pierre Viaud, who left the Le Cabestan, where he was chef, to open his own restaurant. The food at Le Cabestan has not recovered. For Italian food, try Le Valentino in the Hyatt Regency Hotel or Le Fellini and for Moroccan food, Al Mounia. Le Pekin offers good Chinese food and Le Beyrouth excellent Lebanese fare. In Rabat, L'Entrecote et le Vert Galand offer good French food. In Marrakesh, L'Orangerie offers fine French food, Villa Rosa good French and Italian fare; for traditional Moroccan food, the Yacout and Tobsil are best. Arts and crafts The variety of crafts in Morocco remains great. Carpets are plentiful and varied but the wool they are made from is not always of good quality. Good pottery from Fez, which is famed for its intricate bleu patterns, can be ordered from Hidaya Tazi in Casablanca (tel 445638); excellent pottery can also be found in the Potteries de Sale which are to be found in Rabat, at the foot of the old walled medina. The town of Safi also has very attractive wares. State-run craft centres exist in most big towns but haggling in the souk, while time-consuming, can be rewarding. The Habous district of Casablanca has a wealth of traditional jewellery and caftans. Casablanca also provides scope for getting good leather artefacts, which are cheaper if bought directly at the factory gate. Morocco has many modern painters whose works are keenly sought in Morocco and abroad. Galleries such as Bab El Rouah in Rabat and Meltem in Casablanca are worth a visit. Unfortunately, no museum regularly displays such works, which can best be seen in the private galleries of the Banque Commerciale du Maroc or the Office Cherifien des Phosphates. Economics For economic information about Morocco, the best source is the weekly L'Economiste, whose reports and analysis are very reliable. The Centre Marocain de Conjoncture produces regular studies on the state of the economy but they are rather too academic for the average businessman. New financial services such as Upline (tel 985855) or the Casablanca Finance Group (tel 441244), both in Casablanca, are reliable and good. Books to read John Warterbury's Commander of the Faithful, unfortunately out of print remains as good a guide as any to the monarchical system of Morocco. Wyndham Lewis's Travel in Barbary is a wonderfully evocative description of the Berber society of southern Morocco. Remy Leveau's Le Fellah Marocain, Defenseur du Trone provides a good political introduction to the kingdom while Bruno Etienne's Les Arcanes du Sultanat recently published by the French cultural review Autrement (September 1990), is a pointed analysis of how King Hassan exercises his considerable powers.</p>

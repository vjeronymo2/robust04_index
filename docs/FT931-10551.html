			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Devaluation fillip expected for manufacturing areas WALES and the north of England will benefit most from sterling's devaluation, says a report published today by Cambridge Econometrics, the research group. In 1995 exports from Wales will be some 4.6 per cent higher than they would have been if sterling had not left the European exchange rate mechanism in September last year, the report says. The north of England will also benefit by some 4 per cent because of its relatively high manufacturing base. In contrast Greater London, with relatively little manufacturing, can expect only a 1.6 per cent increase in exports. Northern Ireland, which traditionally has had relatively low exports, will see the least impact with a rise of only 1.4 per cent. The report, which also surveys the outlook for each region, expects Greater London and the west Midlands 'to have the highest rate of job loss as the shake-out continues'. In spite of the benefit to the north from devaluation, the report argues that 'the tendency for regional disparities to narrow during the recession' will reverse in the longer term. The south-east, 'by far the worst-affected region during the recession', will see growth of gross domestic product catch up or overtake that of the north between 1993 and 2005. Overall, the report finds that the UK's GDP will be just under 2 per cent higher in 1995 than it would have been without devaluation.

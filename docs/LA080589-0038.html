			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINKERS WITH DIPLOMACY, DEFENSE;  </P> <P> CONGRESS DETERMINEDLY MEDDLES IN POLICY-MAKING  </P> <P> Whenever former President Ronald Reagan accused Congress of tinkering too much  with national security policy, his antagonists on Capitol Hill always had a  ready answer: They were forced to do it because the President never consulted  them.  </P> <P> But now that relations between the White House and Congress have entered a new  era of cooperation and consultation under President Bush, it appears that  Reagan's complaint may have been justified after all.  </P> <P> In the final weeks before Congress' monthlong August recess, members of the  House and Senate once again engaged in their annual ritual of trying to  legislate the jots and tittles of American foreign and defense policy --  everything from overall nuclear strategy to the smallest personnel policies.  </P> <P> Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) sees these latest efforts at micromanagement as a  bad faith response by Congress to the pledge of cooperation that Bush made in  his inaugural address.  </P> <P> To Boren, it proves that his colleagues are more interested in seeking  sensational headlines than assisting in the development of a coherent foreign  policy.  </P> <P> "It appears to me that the Administration is seeking to do its part, and I am  disappointed that we, as an institution, have failed to live up to our  responsibility to work in a responsible way, a non-sensational way" to resolve  concerns through consultation, Boren told his colleagues in a recent floor  speech.  </P> <P> Congress' unflagging passion for fiddling with the details of foreign and  defense policy has been most apparent in the Senate, which during the last  three weeks has made numerous adjustments in the legislation authorizing  spending for the State Department and the Pentagon for fiscal 1990. In all, the  Senate considered 83 amendments to the defense bill and 78 amendments to the  State Department measure.  </P> <P> Some amendments challenged the fundamental principles behind the Bush  Administration's policy. On the defense bill, for example, some senators called  into question Bush's decision to fund the development of new strategic nuclear  weapons at the expense of many less costly conventional weapons and of domestic  programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower-Level Issues  </P> <P> But most of the Senate amendments focused on issues that are usually decided  not in the Oval Office but at the lower levels of the bureaucracy -- issues  such as a $100,000 contribution to the Ukrainian Famine Commission or Coast  Guard policy for apprehending drug smugglers.  </P> <P> If fact, many amendments call for actions that are not even within the power of  the U.S. government to carry out. One such amendment, proposed by Sen. Connie  Mack (R-Fla.), called for a plebiscite in Cuba.  </P> <P> Quite frequently, opponents of these amendments urge their colleagues to vote  against them on grounds that they represent unwarranted micromanagement of  foreign policy. However, even some senators who make this argument are later  accused of micromanaging government policy themselves.  </P> <P> During consideration of the State Department bill, for example, Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N. C.) railed against micromanagement when Sen. Daniel Patrick  Moynihan (D-N.Y.) proposed an amendment designed to prevent a recurrence of the  Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> But, when Helms later offered a proposal to halt negotiations with Palestine  Liberation Organization leaders, he was accused by Senate Majority Leader  George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) of doing the same thing.  </P> <P> One of the favorite tactics of congressional micromanagers is to require the  bureaucracy to provide Congress with a report on any matter of concern. As a  result, according to a study conducted by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), the  government must now submit an estimated 5,000 reports a year to Congress on  everything from arms control to morale in the military.  </P> <P> Boschwitz said that the proliferation of these reports proves that "Congress  has become a micromanager that can't manage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waste of Money Cited  </P> <P> "Is there really a need for the secretary of defense to report biennially to  Congress on special pay for health professionals?" Boschwitz asked. "These  kinds of reports do not improve our management of the Pentagon. They only waste  money and distract us from our more important responsibilities of oversight."  </P> <P> It is estimated that the Defense Department annually devotes 370 man-years to  producing more than 600 reports required by Congress. And the House-passed  defense spending bill for fiscal 1990 calls for an additional 215 reports from  the Pentagon next year -- a 32% increase over the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Boschwitz sought to eliminate all Pentagon reporting requirements in the  defense spending bill, which cleared the House on Wednesday, but his amendment  was ruled out of order.  </P> <P> Although Reagan often complained bitterly about congressional micromanagement  during his eight years in office, leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress  usually dismissed his lament as nothing more than partisan sour grapes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Team Fights Meddling  </P> <P> Over the last few years, however, the bipartisan team of Boren and Sen. John C.  Danforth (R-Mo.) has made it a personal mission to reduce congressional  tinkering in national security policy by speaking out on the issue whenever an  opportunity has arisen.  </P> <P> Boren and Danforth thought they had finally made some progress earlier this  year when Bush, after pledging cooperation with Congress in his inaugural  address, established a formal mechanism to provide for consultation on all  matters of national security.  </P> <P> Congressional leaders as well as ranking members of the House and Senate  committees on foreign relations, armed services and intelligence now meet  regularly with the President to discuss important decisions facing the  Administration.  </P> <P> But the two senators now realize that that effort has changed nothing. Members  of Congress still believe -- as Boren puts it -- "that, at least for 10 minutes  on the Senate floor, they should act as secretary of state of the United States  or perhaps try to act on behalf of the President of the United States in making  foreign policy for this country."  </P> <P> Boren, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, contends that the Senate's  habit of meddling with foreign policy not only usurps the prerogative of the  President to conduct diplomacy but sends a confusing signal to U.S. allies and  enemies alike.  </P> <P> "Nothing diminishes the influence of this country more than our failure to  speak to the rest of the world with a single voice," Boren said. "Nothing is  more damaging when we are dealing with sensitive international issues than to  have amateur hour on the floor of the United States Senate in which each and  every one of us decide to weigh in on sensitive issues that have been  delicately balanced and negotiated between our country and other nations."  </P> <P> And how do Boren and Danforth hope to deal with the problem now? A report, of  course.  </P> <P> The Senate earlier this week voted for a Boren-Danforth amendment to the  defense spending bill that requires the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in  consultation with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, to issue a report by  Dec. 31 on "the appropriate relationship between the legislative and the  executive branches with respect to the formulation of United States foreign  policy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHEN CONGRESS STEPS IN  </P> <P>  Some amendments considered by Congress in recent weeks to the authorization  bills for the State and Defense departments:  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BILL:  </P> <P> Amendment: To increase the number of auditors by 400 to 6,488 at the Defense  Contract Audit Agency.  </P> <P> Sponsor: Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio)  </P> <P> Outcome: Approved, voice vote  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amendment: To provide bonuses of $2,000 to $5,000 for military psychologists.  </P> <P> Sponsor: Sen.

Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> Sponsor: Sen.

David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and John C.

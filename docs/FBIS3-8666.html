			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Mar (TANJUG)--During the talks in  Belgrade today Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and [Greek]  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that the EU [European  Union] plan for the settlement of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia should remain in force.    They also agreed that the abolition of sanctions against the  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] must be seriously examined,  given that the Serbian side has met all conditions regarding  this plan.    Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic also took part  in  the talks that lasted two and a half hours.    In a statement for the press, Papoulias assessed the talks  as  useful and said his impression was that he would "return" to his  colleagues in the EU "with very nice messages." Simic said that  the talks were "exceptionally open and fruitful."    "The thinking prevailed during the talks that any form of  discrimination at this stage--when one of the sides involved in  the conflict is being pushed aside--cannot politically be either  appropriate or effective," stressed Simic.    "The EU plan remains in force and I think that this plan is  the core of any new initiative or action," said Papoulias.    In this context "the question of abolishing the sanctions is  very significant," he said, adding that the stand of Greece on  this subject was well-known and Greece was sticking by it.    Papoulias explained that Greece, as the chairman of the EU  Council of Ministers, ought to reassure its partners that the  question of sanctions should be examined both in general and in  the case of Yugoslavia, in particular.    "If in principle the abolition of the sanctions contributes  to a peaceful settlement of this crisis, this question ought to  be examined seriously," the Greek foreign minister pointed out.    "Yugoslavia was particularly pleased with the fact that in  Greece, which is the current president of the European Union,  our view on the futility of the sanctions and the damage that  the sanctions have inflicted on the neighboring countries and  the entire Balkan Peninsula enjoys support," Simic stressed.    "It is well-known that the Serb side has fully complied with  all the EU conditions that were set several months ago,  including the territorial concessions in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he  recalled, "but the EU reneged on its obligation to alleviate or  lift the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."    The Yugoslav deputy prime minister said that "the  application  of sanctions against anyone at the end of 20th century is an  anachronistic act."    "In our opinion the only way to restore a permanent peace is  to apply those democratic principles advocated by Greece since  the very outset of the crisis on the territory of former  Yugoslavia," Simic said.    According to him, these are three elementary principles: a  cessation of all hostilities, negotiations that have to be based  on democratic principles, and respect of the will of all three  sides and the search for a solution that will not be to the  detriment of any of the warring sides.    Papoulias announced that the Bosnian crisis will be the main  topic of a EU ministerial meeting on 26th and 27th March in  Athens, adding that details will be discussed at the meeting and  decisions adopted "as required by the current situation."    Asked about Greece's reaction to Turkey's attempts to send  its forces to former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias reiterated  his country's well-known position that neighboring countries  should not send their troops as peacekeepers.    However, violations of this principle--accepted by both NATO  and the European Union--would create a new situation and in such  a case Greece would reach new decisions aimed at defending  national and broader regional interests, Papoulias explained.    Asked whether relations with The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia [FYROM] were discussed, Papoulias replied that "the  issue of relations with the Skopje republic was reviewed from  all angles. Mr. Milosevic--and this is no secret--is expressing  great interest in the resolution of the crisis in the relations  between Greece and Skopje," he said.    The talks also focused on the overall situation created by  the meddling of nonBalkan countries in the Balkan crisis. "All  who wish to contribute to a peaceful resolution are welcome, but  they should not complicate matters even further," Papoulias said.    Deputy Prime Minister Simic added that the talks also  covered  bilateral issues and the development of the traditionally good  relations between Greece and Yugoslavia. He thanked Papoulias  for his personal contribution to the resolution of the crisis in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek Government "which  acknowledged political reality and advocated principles in the  spirit of ancient Greece" since the beginning of the crisis in  the region of former Yugoslavia.    After a luncheon with his hosts, the Greek foreign minister  left Belgrade for Athens.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / EU lifts arms embargo against Syria The European Union lifted its eight-year arms embargo on Syria last night following a thawing of relations, a move criticised by Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, as a mistake unless Damascus was willing to negotiate peace with Israel. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told reporters the decision had been nodded through at the General Affairs Council. The embargo was put in place in 1986 after allegations of Syrian involvement in a thwarted attempt to smuggle explosives onto an Israeli El Al airliner at London's Heathrow airport. Other sanctions, such as bans on low-level diplomatic meetings were gradually lifted between 1987 and 1990, when Syria sided with the west in the Gulf War. 'Before the Syrians move, why lift. . . the embargo? Let them move and maybe then there won't be a need for an arms embargo?' Mr Peres told reporters. 'I don't know why the Syrians were so shy. If they want to have peace, why hide away?' At the same time, Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation made some progress towards ironing out their differences over the Palestinian peace process. Both men, visiting Brussels on the eve of an international donor conference intended to speed up aid flows to the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho, emphasised that recent acts of violence in the Middle East would not be allowed to scupper progress made so far. 'We will make this peace process a success,' said Mr Peres. 'We will not stop en route.' There were few details on the talks. Neither side was particularly forthcoming on the issues dividing them, including Israeli delays in withdrawing from the West Bank and its action in sealing off Israel to Palestinian workers resident in Gaza or the delays in holding elections in the Palestinian territories. Referring to the recent bloody clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and both Palestinian police and his own Fatah faction, Mr Arafat said: 'I insist on very rapid elections to see who has the support of the people; Hamas or Fatah?' 'In my opinion the Israelis understand our need for a quick election, but at the same time we have to understand their necessity for security which is one of their main items,' said Mr Arafat. He said that the most important thing for the Palestinians was that all donors kept their promises, pointing out that the Palestinians had so far only received a fraction of the total promised. A senior British official said Mr Hurd had 'floated some ideas' on taking Israeli-Palestinian negotiations forward. 'There is a real need on all sides to make clear what the tangible benefits of the peace process are,' said the UK official. A successful outcome to the Palestine donors conference today and tomorrow is regarded as a vital first step in this direction.</p>

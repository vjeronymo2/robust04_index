			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aid for Environmentally-Friendly </F> Techniques in German Companies"; as released by Brussels  Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] The European Commission has approved regional aid  to MAN Nutzfahrzeuge to underwrite investment in  environmentally- friendly techniques in this firm located in  Salzgitter, Germany. The project provides for the expansion of  facilities and the installation of new machines, with the aim of  increasing production of buses and bus parts at the Salzgitter  site. Environmentally- respectful techniques will be used to  enlarge the painting workshop. The project runs from 1991 to  1994 and will cost a total of 92.2 million DM (48.1 million ECUs  [European Currency Unit]), of which 89.8 million DM (45.6 mECUs  [million ECU]) are eligible for regional aid. The number of  people permanently employed at MAN will grow from 3,914 to 4,534  by 1994 and capacity will increase to 900 units per year. The  aid proposed will take the form of a three million DM (1.6  mECUs) grant, to be disbursed in 1994 and 1995, the equivalent  of an aid intensity of 2.8&percnt;. In approving this state aid,  the  Commission concluded that the project met regional criteria for  state aid to the motor industry.    The Commission has also decided not to raise any objections  to a proposal by Bavarian authorities to help a pulp plant in  Kelheim maintain production until December 31, 1993. This plant  belongs to Bayerische Zellstoff GmbH, which is facing  bankruptcy. In 1992-1993, the plant switched from a  sulphite-based process to an organocellular one developed by the  Technocell group, to which Bayerische Zellstoff belongs. This  production method does not use sulphur or chlorine and is  therefore less harmful to the environment. A planned 350 million  DM investment in this plant eventually cost twice this much due  to technical problems. The temporary aid offered by Bavarian  authorities will take the form of a credit guarantee in the  amount of 17.5 million DM and a bank loan for the same sum. The  Commission feels that the form and limited duration of this aid  meet its general conditions for an exemption from the EC's ban  on anti-competitive state aid.</p>

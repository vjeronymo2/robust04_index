			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROBBINS ASKS COURT TO ISSUE ENTIRE TAPE MADE BY INFORMANT;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE STATE SENATOR ARGUES THAT THE VIDEOTAPE SHOWS HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT  MONEY TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION.  </P> <P> A secret tape-recording of state Sen. Alan Robbins made by an undercover  informant during the FBI's Capitol sting operation should be made public in its  entirety, attorneys for Robbins argued in court papers filed Friday.  </P> <P> Robbins (D-Tarzana), allying himself with television stations that have  requested release of undercover videotapes, asked U. S. District Judge Milton  L. Schwartz to release portions of the tape not yet made public by federal  prosecutors.  </P> <P> Robbins' attorneys contend that the entire tape will show that the senator  turned down an offer of money from informant John Shahabian in exchange for  supporting a bill.  </P> <P> "The full transcript contains substantially more content than the edited  version and demonstrates conclusively" that Robbins offered his commitment for  the legislation "without hesitation, did not seek anything in return for his  commitment and rejected Mr. Shahabian's suggestion of remuneration in return  for supporting the legislation," the document says.  </P> <P> The request to the court does not identify Robbins by name, using the same  designation "legislator XX" used by federal prosecutors on the portion of the  transcript already made public.  </P> <P> But legislative sources confirmed that the legislator in question is Robbins.  </P> <P> The tape of Robbins, as well as a number of other secret audiotapes and  videotapes, will be offered by prosecutors as evidence in the ongoing trial of  state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) on 12 counts of extortion, bribery,  racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> Montoya's attorneys have opposed release of the videotapes, arguing among other  things that they could be used by political opponents of the senator in his bid  for reelection in 1990.  </P> <P> "Release of audio and video tapes to the news media, with the attending  likelihood that portions will be aired out of context and in a sensational  manner, may have a very damaging effect in Sen. Montoya's reelection campaign,"  attorneys Bruce Kelton and Michael Sands said Friday in a letter to the judge.  </P> <P> Robbins has been identified by sources familiar with the probe as a subject of  the FBI investigation and is on a list of witnesses who may be called by the  prosecution to testify against Montoya.  </P> <P> Portions of the transcript released earlier show that Robbins suggested to  Shahabian, a Senate staff member who was cooperating with the FBI, that Montoya  would be willing to trade his vote for a $3,000 honorarium.  </P> <P> Shahabian, working on behalf of a bogus company set up by the FBI, asked  Robbins what he would need to do to win passage of a bill ostensibly sought by  the "company."  </P> <P> "Well, you need to make some arrangements with Joe" Montoya, Robbins said.  </P> <P> Asked what that would entail, Robbins said, "I mean what it'll take with Joe  is, uh, a little envelope."  </P> <P> Moments later, Robbins said, "I would say three" thousand dollars "would be  sufficient. Twenty-five hundred'd probably" be "OK. . . . But if you wanna,  y'know, make certain that he's absolutely committed, that's where Joe's at  these days."  </P> <P> An undercover agent subsequently gave the recommended $3,000 to Montoya at a  breakfast meeting near the Capitol.  </P> <P> A videotape of the breakfast and the delivery of the money to Montoya will be  introduced as evidence in the trial, said U. S. Atty. David Levi.  </P> <P> Montoya has said the money was an honorarium that was not connected to his  support for the bill.  </P> <P> Judge Schwartz is scheduled to decide Tuesday on the request that copies of the  tapes be made available to television stations and the public.  </P></p>

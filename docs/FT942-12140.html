			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: The bizarre appeal of 'Princess Babs' - Antony Thorncroft asks the ultimate question, is Streisand worth it? Everything is odd, different, alarming, slightly bizzare at a Barbra Streisand concert. It is odd that the singer has the hair of an Afghan hound and the face of a borzoi; it is different that the audience manages to move its collective body slowly in time to music without a suspicion of rhythm; it is alarming that the workmanlike bars of Wembley Arena are selling champagne and smoked salmon while the merchandising stalls offer gold stamps (whatever they might be) for Pounds 60 and crystal paperweights for Pounds 40; and it is bizarre that my seat cost Pounds 260. That is the ultimate question: is she worth it? For much of the time you feel that she should be paying you to listen to her life story. Streisand has spent a fortune on shrinks who fulfill exactly the same role as an audience. This enables her to say very puzzling things like 'it cost me millions to be able to sing this song but it was worth it' before slipping into 'On a clear day', not many people's idea of a spiritual challenge. Is any song worth that, you wonder ? Aren't you glad you can take it or leave it. Shrinks are not just throw-away jokes. They are a major part of the act. Streisand talks to them, and they ask pre-recorded questions on tape in that bored, non-committal, petulant way that psychiatrists adopt. They are important players in what is basically a two hour dissection of the Streisand life, from Brooklyn baby to committed millionaire. With this amount of investment in self-awareness you can choose your own personality and Streisand seems to have settled for 'Jewish Princess'. In a striking opening image to the show she steps on to a balcony (which leads down to a vast drawing room, all white drapes and busts of Shakespeare, the kind of set favoured by Liberace in his more louche phase), and stands drowning in applause, like a Royal in the days of deference. In her chat she refers to meeting Prince Charles (and, yes, there they are sharing a cup of tea in one of the many film clips that flesh out the evening) and she confesses that only committment to work prevented her from charming him into courtship. 'Can you imagine it. Princess Babs, the first Jewish princess'. We don't have to imagine; it is there before us. Watching Barbra Streisand excercises the same kind of morbid fascination as when you come across a Royal going about their business. It is a mix of total confidence in her own fascination, combined with an uncanny lack of confidence in her performance. She cannot appear on stage without suspended idiot cards giving the words to songs she has sung a thousand times; spelling out the jerky dialogue, written with all the imagination of a diplomatic communique. She shares our wonder, and admiration, that this ugly duckling has become the highest paid entertainer in the world. As for the actual show: on the credit side the Streisand voice is surprisingly good, and she hits the top notes like a sledge hammer. But she puts little feeling into some of the most beautiful ballads of all time ('Lover man', 'Can't help loving that man of mine') and for a Broadway legend she is low on energy and there are few up-tempo smasheroos to raise the joint. The lighting was unsubtle and the band not totally happy until the cumbersome set disappeared in the second half. Can it be worth Pounds 260? Oddly enough there is such a sense of occasion, a feeling that you are part of an important ritual, that few will have been disappointed. Perhaps it is because you feel that Streisand needs us more than we need her. As she sings 'now I'm standing centre stage I've come home at last' you agree that for all the money and time spent on therapy, on love affairs, on political aspirations, Streisand only really believes in herself when the audience claps itself into hysteria.</p>

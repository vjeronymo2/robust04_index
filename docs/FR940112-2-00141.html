Under the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a cooperative effort to link and strengthen the nation's manufacturing extension programs and activities, NIST will make merit-based awards to states to help improve their planning, coordination, and implementation of their technology extension activities. This funding will also be available to multi-state partnerships which seek to expand the scope of technology assistance related services regionally available to small- and medium-sized manufacturers. MEP assumes a broad definition of manufacturing, and recognizes a wide range of technology and concepts, including durable goods production; chemical, biotechnology and other materials processing; chemical, biotechnology and other materials processing; electronic component and system fabrication; and engineering services associated with manufacturing, as lying within the definition of manufacturing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Funding Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Approximately, $2,500,000 will be available to support cooperative agreements on a matching funds basis under this program. Funding size will vary according to the project category and scope of work. For example, program planning projects have typically averaged less than $100,000 in past years. Program Planning projects that include pilot testing of the proposed extension plan will be eligible for NIST funding up to $150,000. For Program Implementation projects and Regional Linkage projects, awards will also vary, but NIST funds may not exceed $250,000 per project. States will be able to submit proposals for each of the three project categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cooperative agreements entered into under this program will be available for one year. NIST will have no obligation to provide any additional future funding to applicants selected for funding under these projects. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance will be at the local discretion of NIST.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Program Planning Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> Project Objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs; into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services, such as technology deployment, worker skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export and market development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may conduct planning activities on a regional basis within a state, when regions are defined by the state. Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally oriented, versus state-wide, and how the regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or interact such that state-wide coverage is achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot's success in implementing the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> Program Planning Projects Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive review panel. Each proposal should address all five selection criteria and selection criteria 1&hyph;3 will be weighted more heavily than criteria 4&hyph;5. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Target population (25 points):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potential applicants should specify a methodology for identifying a population of beneficiary companies (the target population) and their technology assistance-related needs. Factors that will be considered include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Methodology for defining the size and demographic characteristics of the target population to be served by the program plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Methodology for determining the target population's assistance needs, e.g. technology, training, information, quality improvement, management, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Methodology to ensure that the plan is appropriate for addressing identified industry needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resource identification and assessment (20 points):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants should describe the methodology for collecting information about the number, size, technical sophistication, type, and relevance of industrial assistance activities that will be part of the coordination effort. Factors that will be considered include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

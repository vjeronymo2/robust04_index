			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Gilt securities win Bank's approval THE Bank of England gives a clean bill of health today to the UK government bond market - a part of Britain's financial sector vital to the government's ability to borrow funds from the investment community for public spending. The vote of confidence in the gilt-edged securities market - which only last year emerged from a period of sustained losses - comes in a report from the Bank on the financial arrangements underpinning the operations of marketmakers in the securities. Gilt marketmakers encompass 18 financial groups which buy and sell bonds in a secondary market for the securities, mainly on behalf of customers such as pension funds. The marketmakers - through their role in buying gilts from the government and selling them to the international investment community - are likely to be important in the large programme of gilt issues expected this financial year. Up to Pounds 15bn of new gilts may be issued during the year, as the government is in deficit after four years of surplus. Details of the financial system helping the gilt market to work smoothly are contained in a report published by the Bank, before its quarterly bulletin on Thursday. It says the amount of outstanding lending on short-term positions by marketmakers - an indication of the amount of liquidity in the gilt market - rose nearly threefold between 1986 and last year, from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn. The arrangements for channelling funds to and from the gilt market on a short-term basis were altered at the time of financial deregulation in the City in 1986, otherwise known as Big Bang. This introduced a greater element of competition into the market and attracted a number of new overseas entrants, causing a squeeze on margins and a run of losses which ended only last year when the gilt business as a whole made a small profit. The Bank says the new information about liquidity illustrates confidence by the marketmakers in their ability to borrow. It shows too that the specialist groups lending to the gilt market may be well placed to increase their financing operations in other fields such as equities, underpinning London's role as an international financial centre. The report mainly covers the activities of the nine specialist stock-exchange money brokers, which lend money and stock to gilt marketmakers. The specialist groups are James Capel, Cazenove, Lazard Brothers, Prudential-Bache, LM (Moneybrokers), Sheppards, King &amp; Shaxson, Lehman Brothers and Rowe &amp; Pitman.

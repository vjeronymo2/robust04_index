			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Brussels warns US of tax retaliation MRS Christiane Scrivener, the European Community commissioner for taxation, has warned that US companies could face retaliation if the US acts unilaterally on tax issues in a way that discriminates against European businesses. Mrs Scrivener, on a visit to Washington to meet US Treasury officials and members of Congress, issued a particular warning about unitary taxation, the formula used in the past by California, which is the object of a long-running lawsuit by Barclays Bank. Under the system, companies are taxed on a proportion of their worldwide profits calculated by the size of their payroll, sales and assets in a state, rather than on the profits they actually make there. The US Supreme Court is expected to decide on Friday whether it will hear Barclays' claim against the California unitary tax system, which the British bank argues is an unconstitutional infringement of the federal government's prerogative to regulate international commerce. Mrs Scrivener said yesterday that she was concerned by the possibility that, if the Supreme Court should eventually rule against Barclays, other states might decide to adopt the unitary taxation approach. She said that no retaliation was currently planned by the European Community, although the UK has already passed a law authorising retaliatory measures.</p>

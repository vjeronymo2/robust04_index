It is well known that the Madrid conference was merely a  general conference in which general speeches were delivered  determining general outlines for the general policies of all the  concerned parties, including the Palestinian side and the  Israeli enemy.    The impasse through which the talks are going was caused by  that massacre which was committed against the Palestinian people  in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. Initial investigations proved  that the Israeli Government, Rabin's government, and the Israeli  Army were directly or indirectly responsible for overlooking  [the threat caused by] those settlers, though they were aware of  a possibility for such a massacre being committed.    Thus, the impasse which the talks have reached does not  require going back to zero, but it is in need of the guarantees  which the PLO has demanded; security guarantees for the  Palestinian people. These guarantees can never materialize  before an international force, in one form or another, becomes  available to help and protect the Palestinian people. At the  same time, the occupation forces should perform their duties  toward the security of the Palestinian people.    Matters were moving in a natural way before this massacre.  There were timetables and measures which would have been taken  a few days later were it not for the perpetration of this  massacre.    Thus, I am saying that if guarantees to protect the  Palestinian people were offered to us in Madrid, Washington,  Cairo, or Taba, we would not be against any meeting, anywhere,  but it should secure for us such guarantees, on condition that  we do not go back to the starting point, but to what we have  reached, i.e. [Israeli] withdrawal should start within days and  conclude before 13 April, the previously agreed on date during  the signing ceremony in Washington.    [Correspondent] Do we understand that if the Security  Council  does not sanction in its meeting today, or tomorrow, a  resolution regarding your requests, the Palestinians will  boycott the talks?    [Abu-al-'Izz] If the Security Council does not sanction an  orientation which contains security guarantees for our people,  it could mean that the Security Council is not really concerned  with the progress of a genuine and just peace that would achieve  security and stability for the peoples of the region, including  the Palestinian people, and the United States bears the  responsibility for this. As it is clear, the latter is the one  which actually prevents the Security Council adopting a  resolution to this effect.</p>

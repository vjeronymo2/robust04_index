			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH FEELS 'LIKE A SPRING COLT' BUT PHYSICAL REVEALS GLAUCOMA  </P> <P> President Bush emerged from a five-hour health examination Thursday and  pronounced himself "like a spring colt." White House doctor Burton Lee agreed  that Bush is in excellent health, although the routine physical did turn up "an  early glaucoma" in Bush's left eye.  </P> <P> The diagnosis was made at Bethesda Naval Hospital outside Washington. Bush, 65,  will be required to take eye drops daily for the ailment. Extensive tests  showed no visual impairment.  </P> <P> "I haven't felt a thing, felt it at all," Bush told reporters. "I'm taking  drops now . . . one in the morning and one at night, but the vision is very  good."  </P> <P> With early detection and continual treatment, the President should not develop  vision problems, doctors said. Glaucoma can lead to blindness if not treated,  but can be controlled by drugs or laser surgery. The disease is characterized  by increased pressure and hardening of the eyeball.  </P> <P> As has been the case in past physicals, doctors reported that Bush has "mild  degenerative osteoarthritis" in his hips and neck.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Negotiations Are Over. The </F> Negotiations Are Ahead"]    [Text] When the meeting between the delegations of the  Crimean and Ukrainian Supreme Councils started, observers were  convinced that representatives of the Crimean Parliament were  fundamentally not ready to cooperate. According to one of the  members of the Ukrainian delegation, the Crimeans saw nothing  but military stratagem in all proposals on the part of the  Kievans. This is not surprising though, since, among the  participants in the negotiations on the Crimean side, only N.  Bekyrov, a member of the Majlis, was not a military man, while  the rest were colonels and lieutenant colonels, both in the  active army service and retired. Notwithstanding that, following  lengthy and difficult discussions that ended late in the evening  on 3 June, the Kiev and Simferopol leaders reached an agreement  and adopted a summing up document in which the sides "reached an  understanding of the fact that the Constitution of the Crimean  Republic adopted on 6 May 1992 contains some clauses, which do  not conform to Ukrainian legislation, in particular, on the  definition of the status of the Crimean Republic as an  autonomous constituent part of Ukraine." In order to resolve  the constitutional and legislative collision that had taken  shape, the delegations favored the creation of a joint working  group, which would, by 15 June, "advance proposals for  coordinating the Constitution and legislation of the Crimean  Republic with the Ukrainian Constitution." Both delegations  appealed to President L. Kravchuk and called upon him not to  introduce, until 15 June, the mechanism provided for by the  corresponding Ukraine's Supreme Council decree and to Crimean  President Yu. Meshkov and the local parliament not to take  measures that might disrupt interaction between the state power  bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea.    Just like in Simferopol, the negotiations in Sevastopol were  also difficult. Russian and Ukrainian groups of experts on the  Black Sea Fleet met there. However, certain progress was  achieved there, too. According to Commander of Ukraine's Naval  Forces Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, experts managed to  specify the list of the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels that  will be allocated to each side after the division, even though  the Russian representatives insisted that those ships and  vessels that were given to Ukraine in 1991 as sailing means for  military schools and had never been a part of the Black Sea  Fleet be included in the general list. However, this problem  could also be settled. The negotiations on the problems of  dividing the Black Sea Fleet will continue at a higher level in  Kiev on 8-9 June.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Nordbanken to absorb parts of Carnegie unit Nordbanken, the Swedish state-owned bank, has decided to increase significantly its services in money and bond markets to both Swedish and international customers, Reuter reports from Stockholm. 'This will happen by taking over the Swedish money and bond market operations in brokerage Carnegie,' the bank said. However, it made no comment about what would happen to Carnegie's other operations, including its equity brokerage. Carnegie is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nordbanken. Earlier this year, Nordbanken said its goal was to spread the ownership of Carnegie. It is not clear how this policy will be affected by the latest move. In March, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale pulled out of talks to buy Carnegie.</p>

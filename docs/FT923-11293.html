			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (6): All the feel with none of the effort - Automatics / Power-assisted steering is so pleasant that many motorists have vowed never to buy a car without it again A SECOND car is often as vital a part of the household equipment as the washing machine, food processor and vacuum cleaner. Women who drive them reckon they ought to be as simple and straightforward to operate. Here is one man who is entirely on their side. I am among a rapidly growing body of motorists who consider there are only two kinds of car: those with power steering - and the others, which are a struggle to park. Should one wish to go a stage further, then the power or non-power steered cars can be divided into those with automatic or manual transmission. Power-assisted steering is so pleasant - and having to wrestle a car into a meter bay so disagreeable and unnecessary - that many motorists have vowed never to buy a car without it again. The same goes for two-pedal control. A century ago the car gearbox was invented by a Frenchman, Mr Gregoire. It was, he said, a brutal device but it would have to do until something better came along. Some years ago, it did. At first it was suitable only for large engined cars with power to spare. But now the benefits of automatic transmission are being appreciated at motoring's broad and modestly priced base; not least by wives and mothers driving small cars on their shopping and school runs. Enthusiasts once argued that power assistance smothered feedback through the steering, so road grip could not be assessed. Automatic transmissions were sneered at for allegedly blunting the edge of a car's performance and ruining its fuel economy. There was something in this once, but not any more. Today's power assistance systems simply take all the effort out of the steering, none of the 'feel.' Modern four-speed automatics no longer waste up to 10 per cent of every litre of fuel put in the tank. Performance blunting allegations do not hold water, either. Never mind what the 0-60 mph acceleration figures in the magazines say. They are obtained by brutal driving; by dropping the clutch at 5,000 rpm and leaping away in a cloud of tyre smoke. In the real world, automatics are usually first away from the lights. Most two-pedal cars are still slightly thirstier than manuals. A sensibly driven automatic will use perhaps 5 per cent more fuel than a manual, though some of the latest ones with five speeds offer almost the same economy. It is a small price to pay for the sheer convenience of two-pedal control. Price remains a problem. Automatic transmissions cost more to make than manual gearboxes. The smaller and cheaper the car, the greater the premium one has to pay, though the amount varies widely. Why automatic transmission adds Pounds 1,260 to the price of a Pounds 12,495 Rover 216 SLi 16v, but only Pounds 649 to a Pounds 11,731 Vauxhall Cavalier 1.6L, is hard to understand. The fact that the automatic package includes optional power steering on the Rover is only a partial explanation; the Cavalier has power steering as standard. Rover's latest two-pedal Metro, the delightful 1.4S three-door, is listed at Pounds 10,163, which is Pounds 1,365 more than it costs with a manual gearbox. Yet a Pounds 5,765 Fiat Panda 1000 Selecta with a similar kind of continuously variable automatic transmission is only Pounds 490 dearer than a manual Panda 1000 CLX. Neither, though, is offered with power steering. No carmaking country has done more to bring two-pedal, power-steered motoring within financial reach of the budget-conscious private buyer than Japan. For example, a Daihatsu Charade CX 1.3 with both features is listed at Pounds 8,410; a Mitsubishi Colt 1600 GLXi 16v is Pounds 10,720; a Toyota Corolla 1.3 GL Pounds 9,990. One of their few European rivals with a conventional automatic transmission is the two-pedal, power steered Peugeot 205 XL three-door at Pounds 9,803. None of these list prices, to which delivery charges of about Pounds 350-Pounds 400 must be added, should be taken at face value. Always negotiate a discount. Small, powered-steered automatics are ideal for people who use a car mainly in town and spend as much time parking as driving. Mature motorists will find that as the years roll by and middle age starts going the way youth went long ago, their attraction grows greater.</p>

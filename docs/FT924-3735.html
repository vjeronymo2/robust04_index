			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: An uncertain outlook for dividends - Investment in UK equity income unit trusts UK EQUITY income funds seemed at one point to offer a one-way bet. As their name suggests, they offered a higher income than rival equity trusts aiming for capital growth. But statistics showed that, if income from these trusts was re-invested, they would grow more than growth funds. Over long terms, this relationship still holds good, but over shorter periods, the returns from the two sectors are closer. According to Micropal, the average UK equity income unit trust has increased by 370.48 per cent over 10 years to December 1, while the average growth unit trust has grown 268.54 per cent. But taken over three years, growth funds show 6.26 per cent growth, while income funds show growth of 6.33 per cent. Over one year, the figures are 2.93 per cent and 3.02 per cent respectively. The reason for this is the 'yield effect'. Income funds, aiming for a high distribution to unit holders, select companies with a high yield - where their dividend represents a relatively high proportion of the share price. Such companies are often small, and the share prices of small companies, during the 1980s' bull market, tended to out-perform. Income funds outperformed with them. However, high-yielding companies are also more speculative. The yield is high because the price is depressed as traders tend to be more wary about the company's prospects. Those who buy high-yielders are thus betting that traders are wrong. Income funds thus became 'bull market' plays. While the economy boomed and companies were producing better-than-expected profits, they out-performed. When the economy slowed, income funds were badly affected. The recession has caused many UK companies to cut their dividend payments, and this has had a knock-on effect on income funds. According to Income Fund Analysis, of Llandudno, Gwent, 16 of 27 income funds monitored reduced their distribution last month, while one remained unchanged and ten increased. This may diminish the appeal of the funds just when the difficulty of getting a worthwhile yield from cash deposits might tempt investors back into equities. According to Nigel Legge of James Capel: 'If the economic recovery takes hold, recovery in dividends will be slower than the recovery in profits because companies want to rebuild their dividend cover.' However, the advent of personal equity plans, which allow income funds to pay distributions free of income tax, means many funds may still look attractive. Investors should not get too excited, but the tax-free yields of six per cent or more on offer from income unit trust Peps would be hard for top-rate taxpayers to match in deposit accounts. The target yields of income unit trusts vary. Some, such as James Capel Income, have very precise targets for their yield (125 per cent of the yield on the FT-A All-Share index), which preclude them from trying any broader strategies aimed at capital growth. Others have a less precise yield target, and effectively aim for total return (capital gain plus income). Those who are investing just for income should be aware of this. According to Micropal, six 'income' funds are yielding less than four per cent, with Gartmore UK Equity Income the lowest at 3.18 per cent. The FT-SE 100 Index is presently yielding around 4.38 per cent. Most funds have yields greater than the index. The highest, 11.96 per cent, is Exeter's high income fund. This invests in the income shares of split-capital investment trusts, and is technically a different proposition from conventional trusts. The chances of capital growth are slim compared with other income funds. Indeed, capital growth might well be a problem across the sector. The ground rules for investing for income have changed since the end of the 1980s bull market. Jonathan Powell, manager of Newton Income, the top performer over five years, says: 'There are two schools of thought. One is that we must ensure that the dividend stream grows over the years by investing in high-yielding stocks. There's a second school of thought which says the only way in the medium term to safeguard your income in real terms is to guard your capital base. We strongly adhere to the second school.' At present, Newton Income is heavily invested in convertibles, utilities and overseas earners. Buckmaster Income, second in the sector over five years with growth of 94.43 per cent, has a similar approach. According to Tim Gregory, the fund's manager, this was achieved by taking a very defensive position after the Gulf war and buying fixed-interest convertibles. This has given them the strength to buy stock in companies which have already cut their dividends, but remain on a high yield - Gregory cites BPB. Out-performance is possible, but the winning strategy appears to be defensive. N&amp;P UK Income and Capability Income &amp; Growth, both managed by Capel-Cure Myers, are first and second in the sector over 10 years, with increases of 609.5 per cent, and 525.69 per cent. But over five years they stand 63rd and 22nd. This is the classic 'high-yield' approach. Fund manager Leonard Klahr says: 'In the case of N&amp;P, we were very much in smaller companies in the early '80s, and then got slightly stuck in the late '80s with too high a small company weighting.' He says they have tried to avoid 'recovery'-style stocks, which has denied them the recent 'bounce' which some funds have achieved.</p>

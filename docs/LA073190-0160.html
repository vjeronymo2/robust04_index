			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AFL-CIO NEUTRAL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Leaders of the AFL-CIO, wrestling with the abortion issue, agreed today that  the powerful labor federation should continue its decade-long path of  neutrality on the subject.  </P> <P> The Executive Council of the 14.2-million-member organization voted not to take  a position on abortion.  </P> <P> "The overwhelming view of the council was that this was a matter of deep  conscience, conviction and religion" on the part of union members, AFL-CIO  President Lane Kirkland said.  </P> <P> Kirkland said only two or three members of the 34-member council dissented  during today's voice vote. He said the group did not think any stance taken by  the union as a whole could change the minds of individual members.  </P> <P> Three members of the council are women.  </P></p>

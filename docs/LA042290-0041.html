			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KFAC RECORDINGS: STUCK IN THE STACKS  </P> <P> A critical lack of funds has made a virtual prisoner of the 50,000 recordings  donated to Stanford University by KFAC, Los Angeles' late classical music radio  station.  </P> <P> Nearly eight months after being officially donated, the collection is  languishing behind locked doors of a second-story, environmentally controlled  storage area in the Braun Music Center on the Palo Alto campus. The collection,  with strengths in opera and in classical music from the Baroque period through  20th-Century compositions, could remain immobilized and uncatalogued for as  long as two years.  </P> <P> Barbara Sawka, head of the university's Archive of Recorded Sound, said that  the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake has caused the university to be in a "tighter  than usual" budget period.  </P> <P> In addition, storage areas slated for the record collection are being used to  house materials moved from earthquake damaged areas of the campus. She also  said existing funds are being redirected to repair those damaged facilities.  </P> <P> Jim de Castro, station manager at KKBT, formerly KFAC and now an urban  contemporary format (92.3 FM), said he had not been informed about the stalled  status of the recordings.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised," said De Castro, who estimated the donation's value between  $50,000 to $750,000 depending on whether it is evaluated as a collection or as  individual items. "We worked with the movers at our expense to ship the  recordings."  </P> <P> Public access to the collection remains in the distant future. Sawka said it  may take as long as two years before her staff of three full-time workers could  unpack the 481 boxes of the collection and computer-catalogue all the items.  Her first priority: shelf space.  </P> <P> "I would hope we could start (unpacking the recordings) within a year's time  (but) the budget is hard pressed because of the earthquake," she said. "The  critical problem is shelf space. One could hope for budget help from outside  donors, but shelving is not a very glamorous item."  </P> <P> Because of the size of the KFAC library, acquired over more than half-century  during the station broadcasts in classical music, Sawka said that even if the  university authorized another staff member it would take a year to complete the  project.  </P> <P> The KFAC donation increased the archives' holdings of classical music  recordings by a third, but that figure may be reduced once duplicate recordings  are culled by Sawka's staff. "At the very least 50% (of the donation) would be  new material," Sawka said, "I would be very happy if we got 50%."  </P> <P> A similar KFAC donation of about 5,000 compact discs made to the Los Angeles  Public Library last year are also unavailable for public use. But at least part  of the CD collection will gain its freedom as early as mid-summer, according to  Joan Bartel, Los Angeles Central Library assistant director.  </P> <P> Shackled with similar financial and space constraints as Stanford, the L.A.  library, Bartel said, is negotiating to have an outside firm catalogue the  materials. "If we go with the (outside) processing," she said, "the first 500  might be available by the end of June or the first of July.  </P> <P> "If cataloguing is done by the (library) staff, it may be the same time period  but with far fewer titles."  </P></p>

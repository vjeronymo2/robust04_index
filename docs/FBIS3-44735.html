President of the Tibetan trust and investment corporation  Chen Irui said that satellite communications will link the  Tibetan trading house and the stock exchanges in Shanghai and  Shenzhen. The computer system in the Lhasa stock exchange is  already for operation.    Entrusted by the autonomous regional government, Chen's  company is responsible for the establishment of Tibet's first  stock exchange. Like many other undertakings, the establishment  of Tibet's stock market also gained support of other regions of  the country.    The company is now the 381st member of the Shanghai stock  exchange, which has donated a full set of equipment to the  Tibetan exchange and helped in its installation, Chen said.    The Tibetan exchange will also be the first in China to have  two- way communication links with the Shenzhen stock exchange,  Chen said.    He added that the four-star Tibetan hotel in Chengdu,  capital  of Sichuan Province, has applied to be listed. If the  application is granted, it will be the first shareholding  company in Tibet.    Chen stressed that what matters is not that stocks are  available to Tibetans, but that Tibet is keeping pace with other  Chinese regions in establishing a modern banking and investment  system, and a modern enterprise system.    As more Tibetan companies are considering adopting  shareholding systems, stock trading faces a bright future in  Tibet, the Chen said.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Italian minister under investigation MR Gianni Prandini, the outgoing Christian Democrat minister of public works, has been served notice by Rome magistrates that he is being investigated for alleged abuse of public office over road contracts in Calabria. He is the second minister in the outgoing Andreotti government to be put under investigation for corruption. Mr Carlo Tognoli, the socialist minister of tourism, was served notice by magistrates seven weeks ago as part of the Milan municipal corruption scandal. Mr Prandini's case is unrelated to the three-month-old Milan scandal, but it comes at a time of unprecedented public pressure to clean up public life. In Milan, over 40 prominent businessmen and politicians are accused of involvement in a sophisticated network of rigged contracts and political party pay-offs. The money was allegedly used for illegal funding of the parties represented on the municipal administration and split according to their percentage of the vote. Seven members of parliament are being investigated over the affair. The latest is Mr Luigi Baruffi, a national organisers of the Christian Democrat party and linked to Mr Giulio Andreotti, the premier. The Italian Finance Ministry said it would ban the sale, distribution and import of BAT Industries Kent cigarettes in Italy for 30 days from today under anti-smuggling legislation, Reuter reports. The law, passed last year, automatically bans any brand if more than five tonnes of contraband are discovered.</p>

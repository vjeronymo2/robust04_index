			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Welded mesh potential offered in Vietnam Mr Bill Gregory was appointed general manager in July last year of BRC Weldmesh (Vietnam), jointly owned - through Singapore based BRC Weldmesh (SEA) - by Hall Engineering and BHP, the Australian steel and resources group, writes Andrew Baxter. 'Some people say we're here a little bit early. But if we'd waited another year before we'd started, we'd be too late. The potential is enormous,' he says. The venture is the most ambitious step so far in Hall's regionalisation strategy. Operating from an old US military base in Ho Chi Minh City, the company, which began production this spring, has a dual role. Using imported steel and production equipment, it is producing bar chairs - spacers used in welded mesh - for export to Singapore and Hong Kong. But Mr Gregory is also trying to develop a local market for welded mesh to reinforce concrete, and introduce a low cost housing system based on the European 'lattice girder' system of lightweight prefabricated concrete beam reinforcement and filler blocks. Welded mesh costs a bit more than the mild steel reinforcing bar used in Vietnam, says Mr Gregory, but is much stronger, so less needs to be used. 'We're using up a lot of hard shoe leather, spending a lot of time on the ground,' he says. 'You need to estab-lish a base here, and not just come in to make a quick killing.' Because of welded mesh's advantages, the Ministry of Construction in Hanoi has been '100 per cent behind us,' he says. The company is even helping the government to develop astandards code for welded wire products. Turnover is growing quickly from a standing start, but setting up the venture has not been easy. Finding the right employees was a problem, but the workforce of 25 is now performing well, says Mr Gregory. Having got to grips with all the formalities of setting up a business in Vietnam, his seven-day weeks are now down to a mere five and a half, giving him time to spend on his martial arts hobby by teaching karate to young Vietnamese.</p>

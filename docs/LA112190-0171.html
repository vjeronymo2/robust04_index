			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PRESLEY AVOIDS A GRAND IMAGE  </P> <P> Priscilla Presley says her 3-year-old son and year-old granddaughter are being  raised like brother and sister.  </P> <P> The 46-year-old actress says she spoils her granddaughter, Danielle, but "I  won't let her call me Grandma."  </P> <P> "It has such an image, and I don't want it," she said in an interview in  Woman's Day magazine.  </P> <P> Priscilla's son, Navarone, was fathered by Marco Garibaldi, a 33-year-old  Brazilian the actress has known for five years.  </P> <P> Danielle's mother, 22-year-old Lisa Marie Keough, is the child of Priscilla's  marriage to Elvis Presley, which ended in divorce in 1973.  </P> <P> "When she takes her baby home, mine cries," Presley said. "She adores him, and  he adores her."  </P> <P> She said she is positive Elvis' death 13 years ago was not a suicide, and she  calls the "sightings" and reports that he is still alive "ridiculous, another  way for people to earn a buck."  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Mistake over Pep form - Briefcase In the 1991-92 tax year, I sold 2xPounds 3000 shares in Legal and General and transferred the proceeds into personal equity plans for myself and my wife. She completed the correct single-company application form but I completed a general Pep form by mistake. Despite appeals, and its agreement that I did not intend to breach the rules, the Inland Revenue's Pep unit has declared my Pep invalid because I already held a general Pep for 1991-92. Is this correct? No explicit provision for discretion is needed; the relevant powers and duty to exercise discretion in such cases are bestowed and imposed upon the authorities by the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. It is clear from section 114 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 that the Revenue must give effect to the common intent and understanding of any document, submitted by a subject or other taxpayer, which is intended to have effect under any provision of the taxes acts from the consequences of similar types of mistake etc. (except where a particular provision contains explicit words along the lines of section 114 itself). If, by chance, the Pep unit still fails to act reasonably in the circumstances, ask for the free leaflet 'How to Complain About the Inland Revenue'. You might also wish to write to your member of parliament so that the matter can be raised in the House if need be. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The contents of a new action program being drafted  by the government to improve the government procurement system  have been revealed. Key points in the draft program are that:  1) open competitive bidding will be carried out in a more  thorough manner; 2) initially, application of the open bidding  will be expanded to projects of more than 500,000 SDR [special  drawing rights] (from the current 1,000,000 SDR); 3) a  comprehensive evaluation system which takes into consideration  factors other than price will be introduced; and 4) a new  complaint arbitration body to deal with overall government  procurement will be inaugurated.    The government decided earlier on a plan to open up public  works projects, and is now discussing procurement of  communications equipment and medical equipment in Japan-U.S.  economic consultations. The government wants to stress its  position on market liberalization by presenting a comphrehensive  action program which attaches importance to transparency and  internationality even in government procurement in nonspecified  sectors.    In a meeting of the Action Program Implementation Promotion  Committee (chaired by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura) on 27  January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa formally instructed  Deputy Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara to prepare a new action  program aimed at improving the government procurement system.  The program is expected to be finalized by early February and  to be announced at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February.    While past plans aimed at improving the government  procurement system have dwelled on such specific commodities and  fields as supercomputers and public works projects, the new  action program will apply in principle to all equipment,  commodities, and services procured by the government. It is an  action in recognition of criticism against "the  bureaucrat-businessman colluded structure" that arose in the  wake of the scandals involving general construction companies.    According to the draft, the new actiaon program first of all  advocates thorough application of opening tenders. Under the  Accounting Law, government procurements are supposed to be  conducted through open bidding in principle, but they are mostly  conducted by designated bidding or free contracts in actual  practice. Given the circumstances, the draft restricts the  cases wherein designated bidding and contracts ad libitum are  allowed, and specifically note when they are allowed. The draft  also proposes announcing the numbers and value of procurements  have been conducted through opening bidding, designated bidding,  and free contracts, and what part of them are from local sources  and what part from foreign sources.    In addition, with regard to large value procurements which  are required to be announced in advance, the value of the  procurements for announcement will be lowered from the current 1  million SDR TO 500,000 SDR. All concerned offices will be also  required to hold seminars on their purchase plans at the same  time.    While under the current bidding system, the lowest bidders  are basically supposed to win, the new system will have an  element of a comprehensive evaluating system. At present, such  a system -- adding equipment performance to the price as a  factor in deciding on winners -- is used in procuring  supercomputers, but in the future the government wants to apply  it to telecommunciations and medical equipment.    The new action program, in addition, proposes activating a  neutral review committee (complaint arbitration committee) which  will handle complaints on procurements on areas other than  specific sectors like supercomputers. The program suggests  empowering the committee with such rights as ordering the  suspension of certain bidding processes.</p>

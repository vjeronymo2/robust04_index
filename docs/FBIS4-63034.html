			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Sergey Filatov, the Russian president's chief of  staff, told Interfax Wednesday morning that he did not intend to  resign.    He said that reports of resignations, dismissals and  reshuffles in the top echelons were planted in order to obstruct  the reforms and consolidation of society.    IF Note: Filatov was appointed to his present position late  in January 1993 following resignation of Yuriy Petrov. Before  that, as first deputy of Supreme Soviet chairman Ruslan  Khasbulatov he advocated constructive cooperation with Boris  Yeltsin and won the reputation of the sole president's supporter  in the Supreme Soviet leadership. The differences between him  and Khasbulatov were brought to a head in the aftermath of the  Seventh Congress of People's Deputies in December 1992.    Filatov thought that the top authorities had to work for  civil peace and economic reform. This kept him so busy that he  could not think of rumors, even about himself.    Reports of his pending resignation appeared Monday [16 May],  simultaneously with dismissal of Sergey Shakhray from the  position of the nationalities and regional policy minister.  Oleg Lobov, now the National Security Council secretary, was  named as a possible replacement for Filatov.    Some observers thought that the rumors of Filatov's  resignation had to do with the report of a meeting the president  had with the prime minister at which the president called for  improvement of the government performance and for having its  decisions carried out.    The State Duma decided at its Wednesday session to hear  Filatov's explanations of the president's letter to the Duma in  the wake of signing the Deputy Status Act into Law. At the May  13 session Ruslan Orekhov, head of the legal department in the  presidential headquarters, could not answer numerous questions.    In his letter the president mentioned that the act was  inconsistent with the Constitution. This was true, in  particular, of benefits which might not be liked by the  electors. Orekhov could not explain what benefits the president  had in mind and who enjoyed more benefits, the president's staff  or the deputies or those who compiled the letter for the  president.</p>

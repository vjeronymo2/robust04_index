			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Heavy selling hits New York cotton market NEW YORK Cotton futures struggled to catch a footing today after a three-day price slide that left the March contract below its 2-cent a lb limit on Tuesday and down another 2 cents in early trading yesterday. The plunge ended a 2-month-long rally that was built on perceptions that while there were abundant global supplies of cotton, the only bountiful source of high quality cotton in the world was the US. New York Cotton futures specify delivery of top-grade Memphis cotton. While the assumption of short supplies of high grade cotton was correct, analysts say, the rally was deflated by a government report on Friday that showed an inordinately large number of long positions in the cotton futures market were held by speculative traders. In futures jargon, that meant that the cotton futures had been bought by 'weak hands' and not commercial interests, leaving the market vulnerable to a sell-off. Smelling an easy kill, commodity funds and other dealers triggered the sell-off Monday, successfully forcing speculative longs out of the market as prices tumbled. Cotton futures for March delivery bounced off the 57.80 cents a lb level at midday, with analysts noting substantial buying interest by domestic cotton mills and Asian importers as the prices reached attractive levels. The quality concerns had driven March cotton futures from about 58 cents a lb at the start of the year to over 63 cents late last week. The 5 cent loss since Friday's close has come amid heavy trading volume. The contract low of 51.32 was set in October, and few expect a return to that price. Mr James Steel, senior commodities analyst with the brokerage firm Refco, believes the week's wash-out is near bottom, and that fundamental demand for high quality cotton will again push prices higher. 'I am unreservedly telling my clients to buy this dip,' he said. China, one of the world's largest cotton producers, and also a net importer, is in the process of harvesting its crop. Drought and boll weevil pests have made China's crop production estimate a controversial 21m bales, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Mr Steel says regardless of the Chinese crop size, it is fair to bet that Chinese crop quality will be poor, further widening the spread between world and US cotton prices. Traders are also aware that while there is a world cotton surplus, more than half the world's stocks are sitting in Asia and China, with fewer than 4m bales in storage in the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Boyon, former minister and president of </F> the National Defense and Armed Forces Commission of France's  National Assembly: ``France's and Europe's Reaction to New  American Defense Industry Policy'']    [Excerpts] Concerned by recent developments in the defense  industry, which is suffering from the drop in and staggering of  programs for the armed forces, keen U.S. competition on  shrinking export markets, and difficulties in European  cooperation, the National Assembly's Defense Commission visited  the United States from 12 to 17 September. (The delegation was  headed by Defense Commission President Boyon and included Daniel  Colin, Dominique Dupilet, Pierre Favre, Rene Galy-Dejean, and  Patrice Martin-Lalande.) They discussed the outlook for the  American arms industry with the new Administration, industry,  members of Congress, top Pentagon officials, and consultants.  [passage omitted summarizing U.S. defense policy]    All of these new orientations are clearly and precisely set  out in a document entitled ``Bottom Up Review,'' which should be  taken into consideration by those responsible in France. What  conclusions can be drawn for our own industrial policies?  <H5>  Research and Development </H5>   Research and development must be given solid support to  maintain our skills base and know-how both at the level of  researchers and production teams. There has been a tendency  over the past few years to ask manufacturers to finance an  increasing part of research themselves to alleviate government  costs. If our main competitor is financing research from the  taxpayers' money, France should do the same. Failing this,  i.e., if our export products also have to integrate research  costs, they will no longer be competitive and our overall  research effort will become increasingly insufficient. However,  the government must draw up a program and industry must reduce  the size and number of its research centers. There are  certainly too many of them and they lack coherence in their  activities.  <H5>  Subcontracting </H5>   Subcontracting must be given stronger support. The quality  of our arms industry is based not only on the excellence of its  major armaments, systems, and equipment manufacturers, but also  on the existence of a dense fabric of small- and even  medium-sized companies which have a proven capacity for  innovative products, materials, and techniques. A drive has  been launched to remove the reluctance of large companies to  farm out research, but this drive need be reinforced.  <H5>  Exports </H5>   The government should give priority to exportable arms and  equipment in its programming. Programs which are  technologically or industrially advanced in relation to their  competitors should not be staggered. We know that France only  exports arms used by its own forces and tested under real  conditions. We should avoid delays in transferring weapons  systems to units when they are expected to make a rapid  breakthrough on foreign markets. Here again, we have to resist  the temptation to delay such programs because of their potential  to put us ahead of competitors. On the contrary, this potential  should be strengthened. The Rafale fighter aircraft is a good  example of this, but there are others.  <H5>  Cooperation </H5>   Finally and above all, our objectives in terms of  cooperation  should be redefined. This was the focus of all our talks, and  our American counterparts were no exception. Everyone is, in  theory, favorable to this cooperation.    However, as soon as we tried to go deeper in our talks, we  were cut short by our counterparts. However, the idea of  French-American or Euro-American cooperation was is being  considered by the Pentagon, which, more than ever, is aware of  budgetary constraints and realizes that cooperation would reduce  cost prices and enable armies to buy more for less.    In Congress, however, despite the good intentions of Senator  Nunn, president of the Senate's Armed Forces Commission, or in  the Administration, the idea of cooperation still remains  somewhat abstract. Nearly all cooperation projects between  France and the United States, and there were many of them at the  beginning, never got beyond the phase of exchanging expertise  and information. In the initial stages of research and  development, they rarely got beyond the ``R'' stage and turned  turtle on the ``D.'' The RITA [Integrated Automatic  Transmission Network] case is the only exception.    However, we must continue to believe in it, but we may not  put all our eggs in one basket, because France can try to  cooperate directly with the United States, but also with Europe.    Direct cooperation with the United States is desirable in  cases where Americans themselves say they are open to it and  where Europeans seem unmotivated, unskilled, or where it is too  small in scale compared to the United States. This is the case  in the area of antimissile systems, which was the only area for  which the various people we met made cooperation proposals.  France will undoubtedly need to brace itself for this  cooperation with the United States, and it should do so  vigorously both at the industrial and political levels because  there will be strong misgivings on the other side of the  Atlantic.  <H5>  European Strategy </H5>   In other fields, European cooperation should be relaunched  while there is still time. We have a maximum of two to three  years ahead of us to succeed because, after this period, there  will only be one or two U.S. suppliers left to contend with and,  considering the respective sizes of the American and European  markets, Europe will only survive competition if it has a single  supplier for each major category of material and equipment.    There is an urgent need to emerge from this period of  hesitation currently marking Europe. Our country has without a  doubt a specific responsibility to raise the awareness of the  highest European political authorities of this need and urgency.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Finally, the American Administration's determination, which  is stronger than ever, to support the defense industry on export  markets must also be taken into account. We have seen that a  simple personal telephone call from the President to a head of  state can carry considerable weight and provide effective  assistance in penetrating markets. Even if this is not part of  the French Government's tradition, it should face facts and  learn to use this strategy surreptitiously. The exchanges of  view the National Assembly's Defense Commission managed to have  with different American officials lead to the conclusion that  more than ever, France's defense industry must not be considered  as a mere supplier for its own army. It holds and must continue  to hold an important position both in France's economic and  international strategy.</p>

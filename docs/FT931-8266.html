			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (12): Wine ...and song - A saint's blessing RECESSION has hit the pockets but not the spirits of the 20,000 people who earn their living from making and selling Beaujolais. It is, perhaps, Rhone-Alpes' best known product internationally . The mood was jovial as the wine growers around Anse, in the south of the area that produces Beaujolais Nouveau, gathered for their annual seven course lunch on St Vincent's day last month, to celebrate the wine industry's patron saint. As foil-covered numbered bottles were passed round for a blind pre-lunch tasting, the consensus was that the wine to come on to the market next autumn would be of excellent quality. Riotous singing floated up to the rafters of Anse's Maison Rurale as celebrations wore on through the late afternoon. Like the rest of the French wine industry, Beaujolais has recently been through hard times. Wholesale prices fell by an average of 27 per cent last year for Beaujolais Nouveau, the refreshing young wine released world wide every year in the third week of November, which accounts for half the region's production of 170m bottles a year. Prices now stand at their lowest since the 1960s, and well below some growers' production costs, says Mr Gerard Canard, director of the Union Interprofessionelle des Vins du Beaujolais, the local wine industry association. Price falls have been lower for the higher quality Beaujolais Villages which, unlike the so-called primeur, can be drunk up to two years after bottling and represents another quarter of Beaujolais output. The highest quality Beaujolais wines, the 10 crus such as Morgon and Brouilly, have never been known to sell below cost. 'Prices had risen to unreasonable levels in 1989, so this is no great surprise.' Even so, he says, growers of the cheapest Beaujolais Nouveau have experienced 'some difficult situations.' Fortunately volumes have kept up, with an estimated overall rise in sales of five or 10 per cent last year. Within this, exports rose by 25 per cent in volume - but were static in value - in the first 10 months of 1992. The Beaujolais industry remains a striking mixture of craft production and international marketing clout. Typically, Beaujolais wine properties are owned by small family businesses, unlike the food and quality goods giants which dominate Bordeaux and Champagne. Bottling, distribution and marketing is handled by a handful of large wholesale merchants such as Georges Duboeuf or Ferraud - a function of the investment required to deliver 85m bottles across the world in the few weeks during which Beaujolais Nouveau is marketed. This is why merchants handle a much higher proportion of Beaujolais sales - on average 85 per cent, Mr Canard estimates - than they handle in other wine-making regions of France. However, the proportion of direct sales has gradually risen in recent years, as supermarkets and the catering business seek keener prices by cutting out the merchants. The Beaujolais tradition of releasing at least half the region's production over a period of just a few weeks is partly historical accident, partly marketing technique. In the early years of the century, the so-called Beaujolais primeur had an even shorter shelf-life than it has now - so Lyon brasserie owners used to order it by the barrel before it had even finished its four to five day fermenting period. When some bar owners started putting up notices proclaiming that the Beaujolais Nouveau had arrived, the wine merchants saw a marketing opportunity. 'The merchants have played a very important role in marketing us,' says Mr Canard. Their ability to keep export sales rising steeply during a world recession indicates that Beaujolais merchants have not lost the knack.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Saatchi claims PC status as profits leap 68% Mr Maurice Saatchi declared the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group a '100 per cent politically correct organisation' yesterday, as the group announced higher than expected interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m, up 68 per cent on the previous Pounds 9.1m. The 'politically correct' status claimed by Mr Saatchi, chairman, comes from the fact that the group now has no one on a contract longer than three years. At the annual meeting in June, Mr Saatchi renounced his five-year rolling contract, worth Pounds 625,000 a year, and moved to a three-year fixed-term contract at a base salary of Pounds 200,000. Bonuses will be linked to revenue growth. The semi-public row between Mr Saatchi and Mr Charlie Scott, chief executive, over the management of the organisation, appears to have subsided, with Mr Saatchi yesterday describing relationships as 'magnificent'. Mr Scott agreed: 'I have worse arguments with my wife than I do with Maurice, and I've only been married four weeks.' Mr Scott described the volume and quality of new business wins this year as the best since he joined the group at the beginning of 1990. The impact of the new accounts, which include the National Lottery, Compaq Computer and Qantas, are not expected to feed through until 1995. The share price leapt 15p to close at 176p. Turnover slipped 6.1 per cent to Pounds 379.4m (Pounds 404.1) in the six months to June 30. The decline had been expected because of the loss of two important US accounts, Chrysler and Helene Curtis, together worth Pounds 16.8m in revenue. Other factors were the negative impact of exchange rate movements, and the fact that businesses were sold. Operating profits from continuing operations were up 15 per cent to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 18.9m), following an attack on costs last year. Operating margins increased from 5.3 to 5.7 per cent and Mr Scott said his target remained 10 per cent by 1996. Earnings per share rose 53 per cent to 2.9p (1.9p). No dividend will be paid  -Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott said the position on dividends would be kept under review. Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst with SG Warburg Securities, said yesterday that Saatchi had 'certainly turned the corner'. She is forecasting full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m and earnings per share of 5.7p.</p>

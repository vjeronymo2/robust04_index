			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Inchcape falls back - The week ahead MONDAY: This year has not been a happy one so far for Inchcape, the international motors, marketing and business services group. Its share price has fallen by a third since January and analysts will be anxious for reassurance when the UK-based organisation reports results for the six months to June 30. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 115m-Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 130m last time. MONDAY: The stock market will be waiting to see if Hammerson provides details of the planned sale of its Pounds 175m Australian property portfolio along with its interim results. With around 50 per cent of its assets overseas, Hammerson is among the most international of UK property companies, so its comments on market conditions in Australia and Canada - where it acquired three shopping malls in July - will be watched closely. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 22m, against Pounds 15.2m last time, and a dividend unchanged at 3.5p. TUESDAY: Multi-media will be the buzzword when Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of highly illustrated reference books, reports its annual results. Distribution problems last autumn are expected to have cut pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.7m to about Pounds 8.5m. But most interest will focus on prospects for the group's latest CD-ROM products: five educational packages which combine text, sound and vision for use on home computers. TUESDAY: Exceptional re-structuring costs obscured last year's results from Sears, the clothing retail group. But, on a directly comparable basis, it is forecast to report an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 39.5m to about Pounds 46m. Interest charges are likely to be down and both British Shoe Corporation and Selfridges department store are expected to show strong performances, but the picture from the clothing multiples is likely to be mixed. TUESDAY: Half-time pre-tax profits from Tarmac, the housing and construction group, are expected to fall within the range of Pounds 19m to Pounds 25m. Last time, profits were Pounds 2.5m. It is thought that the dividend will be maintained at 3p. The housing division and aggregates market are forecast to produce improved performances. WEDNESDAY: Good results recently from house-building companies are expected to be repeated when Beazer Homes, floated out of Hanson in February, reports interim results. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 28m and Pounds 31m. THURSDAY: Improved half-time results from Redland are forecast, with the building materials group expected to turn in pre-tax profits of around Pounds 130m, against Pounds 108m last time. The continued recovery in the continental European building market is likely to be a key component of any improvement. THURSDAY: Forte announces half-year results, with pre-tax profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m expected compared with Pounds 37m last time. The results come at the end of one of the most momentous months in the hotel and restaurant group's history. It has been given a formal say in the management of the Savoy group, although it has not won overall control. More significant from a commercial point of view, it won control of Meridien hotels, the French chain controlled by Air France. Attention is likely to focus on Forte's success in holding on to contracts to manage Meridien properties.</p>

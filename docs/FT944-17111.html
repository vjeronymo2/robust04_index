			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Zurich - Other markets Third-quarter sales figures are due from Ciba on Wednesday ahead of Roche's figures next Monday. Analysts are forecasting a satisfactory set of figures from Ciba, with a 4 per cent rise in sales in local currency terms translating into a 1 per cent fall in Swiss francs, with the continuing strength of the domestic currency still taking a toll. This is, however, unlikely to deflect investors from their main preoccupation and further sounds of the growing battle for influence between UBS and Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision will be eagerly awaited, ahead of the EGM called for November 22 to discuss the bank's proposed share restructuring. Merrill Lynch expects UBS management, in all probability, to carry the vote, but says BK Vision is likely to challenge the move in the courts as well as at the meeting. It describes the situation as confused and says both the registered and bearer classes of stock have been driven substantially above fundamental value. 'Although resolution may be some way off, we think that any solution to the dispute will lead to a sharp fall in the price of both stock classes. There is more money to be lost than made here and we remain sellers,' it says.</p>

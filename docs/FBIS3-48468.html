Japanese Government officials in charge of the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks predict that Japan's stimulus measures,  tax cuts, and the microeconomic area will be at the top of the  agenda for the summit talks, but they do not hide their  embarrassment at the present situation wherein political turmoil  makes it impossible to set a specific schedule for the  compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994.    The question is whether the government will be able to  compile the budget before the summit talks. U.S. Treasury  Secretary Bentsen, who arrived in Japan on 23 January, asked the  Japanese Government to "take vigorous and continued fiscal  measures" and other senior U.S. Government officials echo his  view. If the House of Representatives were resolved and general  elections held, the compilation of the budget for fiscal year  1994 would undoubtedly be deferred until after the summit talks.  Many government officials are in favor of putting off the summit  talks, saying, "The summit talks, even if held, would be  meaningless," (says a senior official in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry).    An analysis by the same senior official in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] says that if the Finance  Ministry manages to work out an internal draft budget bill after  averting the worst situation where the House of Representatives  is dissolved and generation elections called, it is highly  possible that the summit talks will be held as planned. The same  senior MITI official predicts that even if the Hosokawa  government remains incapacitated, the U.S. Government has a  "mythological view" of Prime Minister Hosokawa and the U.S.  Government is not expected to refuse to hold the summit talks."    Treasury Secretary Bentsen, however, pressed Japan for  agreements at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  asserting, "If the agreements are inadequate, it is better not  to hold the summit talks, and the United States will seek to  review the basis for the bilateral economic framework talks." It  is hard for the Hosokawa government to reach bold agreements  with the U.S. Government that could weaken its power base.  Hence, the Hosokawa government will have limited options, (says  a senior official in the Foreign Ministry). The government  officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  are increasingly feeling a sense of crisis concerning the  Hosokawa government.</p>

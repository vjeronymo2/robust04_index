			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Back to Essex"] </F>   [Text] Nobody who stayed up to watch the April 1992  general election results will be able to forget the mixture of  astonishment and elation on the face of David Amess as the  returning officer for Basildon announced that he, the  Conservative candidate, had won. It was the first indication  that, despite all the polling evidence, the Tories were set to  capture their fourth general election in a row. The voters of  Essex had spoken.    Yesterday John Major returned to speak to them. Visiting  Basildon and Harlow, the citadels of Essex man and woman, the  Prime Minister was clearly hoping to trade on his personal  rapport with the electorate, the soapbox strategy that many  believe won his party the last election against all the odds.  What better way, his advisers must have told him, to show up  the few remaining advantages he still possesses over his chief  rivals, Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine? Whatever can be  said of them, neither has been miserably unemployed. Neither  can understand from personal experience what many people have  gone through, particularly in the South of England, during this  last recession.    The difficulty for Mr Major is that no amount of charm,  friendliness or empathy can make up for the patent inadequacies  of his record and that of his Government since that surprise  general election victory. He arrived in Essex on the day that  taxes on both incomes and spending were due to rise, brought in  by a party that not only promised to cut taxes at the last  election but scared voters away from voting Labour by predicting  the very tax "bombshell" that is now about to be dropped.    And those tax rises are necessary because the Conservatives,  possibly in the belief that they were likely to lose the  election, spent taxpayers' money in 1991-92 as if there was no  tomorrow. The tomorrow has become today, and taxpayers are  being asked to pay off the Government's debts. They are also  paying for the Governments economic incompetence in prolonging  the recession unnecessarily by clinging to membership of the ERM  [Exchange Rate Mechanism].    Will the voters of Essex forgive him? He should not take  their loyalty for granted. The Conservatives have won four  elections in a row mainly thanks to people like them. They  voted Labour until 1979, but switched when they saw that the  Tories under Margaret Thatcher seemed to have their interests at  heart. They bought council houses, started new businesses,  profited from tax cuts and generally prospered in the 1980s.    Now many of them have had houses repossessed, seen their  businesses go bankrupt, are paying higher taxes and remember  prosperity as but a distant dream. They are not tribal Tories;  if Labour seems to be offering them a better deal at the next  general election, there are no historical or familial ties to  deter them from switching.    Hardline Essex voters, and others like them, thought at the  last party conference that their concerns were at last being  addressed. For years they had made their populist points at the  rostrum while the platform listened politely but ignored their  pleas. Last October they seemed to have spurred a desperate  Cabinet into action. Law and order was to be toughened, basics  were back on the political agenda and the march of European  federalism was to be stopped.    What do they now see? There is a Home Secretary stumbling  from one pitfall to another on his Criminal Justice Bill; a  back-to-basics programme that has destroyed the careers of too  many ministers and now lies in tatters; and a Prime Minister who  promises to stand up to his European partners one week but backs  down the next. Mr Major's courage in visiting Essex cannot be  faulted. But, true to form, he chose a battleground on which he  never had a chance of winning.</p>

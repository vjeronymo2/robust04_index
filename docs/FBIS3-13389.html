He accused U.S.  decisionmakers of being more Israeli than the Israelis  themselves. He said: The U.S. Administration has lost its  credibility and cannot be a fair broker or a sponsor of the  peace process. He added: There might be a need to reassess the  overall peace process by the Palestinian party in particular and  the Arab parties in general. [passage omitted]</p>

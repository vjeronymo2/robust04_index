			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 7 May--"If there is good will and moderation  in actions, then any problems can be resolved," Max van der  Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for minorities, stressed at a news  conference. Having familiarized himself with the state of  interethnic relations in Ukraine, his mission there is to get an  opportunity to make certain recommendations to the government in  order to prevent the emergence of conflict situations. Mr. van  der Stoel visited Crimea and Donetsk Oblasts. He intends to  pass his recommendations to the Ukrainian Government in the near  future.    Although there are certain problems in the regions, I did  not  notice any symptoms of interethnic hostility, the high  commissioner noted. He also noted the liberality of Ukrainian  legislation in issues of ethnic minorities. As far as the  situation in Crimea is concerned, I did not notice any cases of  forced Ukrainianization in the autonomy. On the contrary, one  could describe some of the Crimeans' views as separatist ones,  van der Stoel noted, and emphasized that the international  community is in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The  CSCE high commissioner noted that consultations between the  leaders of the state and the regions would be of great benefit  to both sides and stressed the necessity of avoiding any  provocative actions, which could lead to the situation becoming  more complicated.</p>

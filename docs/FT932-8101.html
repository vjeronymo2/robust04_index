			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK takeovers Nervous poorly-performing companies may be surprised but relieved by the deathly quiet on the UK takeover scene. There is, however, little prey of obvious value in the market. Since devaluation the FT-A All-Share index has risen by 25 per cent. That figure masks an even stronger performance from recovery shares: the FT-SE Mid 250 index has risen by some 46 per cent. Such increases run well ahead of any likely improvement in corporate earnings over the next 18 months. Economic growth may be sluggish, and much of the easy cost cutting has already been forced on even the weakest managements by the three-year recession. Under the circumstances, it is hard for predators to justify paying hefty premiums for control. Management psychology has also turned against bids after some scarring experiences in the late 1980s. Many friendly bidders find that vendors are still asking unrealistically high prices. Hostile bids, however, offer little opportunity for due diligence examination of the target's finances, increasing the risks at a time when buyers lack confidence. Bank finance is hard to come by for cash bids - indeed some predators have risked losing existing banking lines if they considered acquisitions. Paper bids are a good deal harder to sell to sceptical institutions. In any event, takeovers often feature much later in the economic cycle. Bid activity last hit bottom in 1983 - some two years after the recession had ended. But bids have not fallen permanently from fashion. Some institutions regard a bid as the cleanest and most effective way to shake up a poorly performing company. And doubtless a few situations still remain overlooked by all but the sharpest eyes.</p>

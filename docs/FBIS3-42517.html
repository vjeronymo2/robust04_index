			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. D. Noskov, Tomsk State University; UDC </F> 524.7-77]    [Abstract] According to radio astronomy data, many cosmic  radiation sources have a spectrum in which F(_n_) is  proportional to _n_[.sup]-_a_[/] in the frequency range of  10[.sup]6[/]-10[.sup]9[/] Hz, with F(_n_) representing the  radiation intensity. The spectral value of the radiation, _a_,  is usually 0.5-1. Its distribution is gaussian, with a mean  value of 0.75 and a standard deviation of 0.15. Since that type  of spectrum cannot be attributed to thermal radiation, the  nonequilibrium cosmic radiation is generally described with a  synchrotron model. Particle polarization and the spatial  coincidence between the system of cosmic magnetic fields and the  sources of the nonequilibrium radiation point to the verity of  such an approach. In proposing a new mechanism for the origin of  the power-law spectrum of the cosmic radio emissions, the  researcher demonstrates that, under the right conditions, the  power-law spectrum can be a consequence of the fractal geometry  of the spatial distribution of radiating relativistic electrons.  Fractal dimensionality D of the distribution is related to  spectral value with the formula D = _a_ + 1/3. As obtained from  an analysis of observed values of the spectral values, the  distribution was found to be 1.08 +/-0.15 in the range of  10-10[.sup]5[/] cm. References 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

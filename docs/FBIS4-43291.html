			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Traditional Parties Face a Tide </F> of Rejection -- Abstainers, Extremists, Blank and Void Ballot  Papers: The Party of Those Who Reject `The System' Has a  Majority in Wallonia and Brussels"]    [Text] Sunday's [12 June] European elections were marked by  an indescribable electronic fiasco (which drove [Liberal  Reformation Party president] Jean Gol to compare it to a  Corsican situation). But the elections broke on most of the  traditional parties like a tidal wave in both the north and  south of the country. With 10 percent absenteeism, 10 percent  blank or invalid ballots, and 10 percent of the votes going to  the extreme right, the "rejection party" now has a majority,  even, if not above all, in the French-speaking college. This  creates a totally new and worrying situation which must be  answered by the traditional parties both in the majority and  opposition. And nearly all these parties suffered in  yesterday's vote.    For example in Flanders, the CVP [Christian People's Party]  lost 6.8 percent in comparison with the 1989 European elections,  but climbed 0.4 percent when compared with the last  parliamentary elections.    The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] also fell back (17.7  percent, minus 2.3 percent), but avoided the worst, primarily  due to Louis Tobback's good score among the preference votes.    However, in Flanders it is the poor performance of the VLD  [Flemish Liberal Democrats] which is the big event. With three  seats and 18.4 percent (up 1.3 percent), [VLD president] Guy  Verhofstadt's party is very far from the score he dreamed of (30  percent) and which was regularly promised him by the opinion  pollsters. They too will have to ask themselves questions.    Is the VLD dead before it has lived? In an interview with LE  SOIR, Herman De Croo [VLD] distanced himself from the  ultraliberal program defended by Verhofstadt.    The other big victim in the elections is of course the PS  [French-speaking Socialist Party]. Falling to 30.4 percent  (minus 8.11 percent) and losing two seats, Busquin's party could  nevertheless be tempted to say: That could have been worse.  Still, Jose Happart's [head of PS candidates] personal  performance and the fact that many PS voters have apparently  deserted the party to join the extreme right are two factors  which will not make life any easier for the party. Watch out  for a split?    The PSC [Social Christian Party] is certainly the coalition  party which emerged from the ordeal with the least damage,  recording a drop of 2.2 percent in comparison with 1989. In  Brussels it got its fingers fairly well burnt, as expected after  the scandals which implicated Jean-Louis Thys and the  Demaret-Vanden Boeynants duo, and the party just lost its  position as second biggest party in Wallonia (by 6,000 votes).  It consoled itself by taking the first European seat devolved  to the German-speakers. Therefore it can claim that it equals,  in seats at least, the performance of the PRL-FDF [Liberal  Reformation Party-French-speaking Front], which was finally  credited with 24.3 percent. A score subject to caution,  according to Jean Gol, who was astonished at the "disappearance"  of thousands of votes.    [PSC president] Gerard Deprez went through every possible  mood yesterday. In the morning, in a state of extreme  irritation, he could not find words hard enough to berate the  colleagues who did not get involved at his side during the  campaign. In the afternoon the president's smile returned when  he found that he personally had got 97,000 preference votes, or  20,000 more than in 1989. Suddenly he decided to launch his  candidacy for a fifth term as president.    His most serious challenger will be former minister Raymond  Langendries who positions himself as the candidate for renewal.    It is a theme repeated at Ecolo, at a time when the Greens  are also asking themselves questions about their setback (13  percent, minus 3 percent).  <H5>  Like in Italy? </H5>   Beyond these minor and major new factors in traditional  politics, an essential question remains: How to counter the  extreme right which won 10 percent of the votes and a seat in  Wallonia and Brussels, due to fear, disgust, rejection of the  political system or xenophobia?</p>

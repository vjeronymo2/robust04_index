			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Viktor Dmitriyev] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "I do not share the view that  Latin America is far from Russia's foreign policy interests",  the speaker of the Russian parliament's upper house, the  Federation Council, said on Thursday.    Vladimir Shumeyko met with newsmen ahead of an official  visit  by a Federation Council delegation to Latin America, which is  due to start on Sunday. During the tour, the Russian delegation  will visit Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador.    According to the speaker, Russia can profit considerably by  using the experience of democratic consolidation in Latin  American countries.    In particular, he said, has gone through processes in its  development very similar to those underway in Russia, namely a  transition from early democracy to authoritarian rule, then to  renewed democracy and market relations.    Shumeyko also believes that Argentina has one of the most  perfect civil codes on peace, which proves to mature democracy  in this South American country. Apart from this, Argentina has  already achieved national accord, which Russia is seeking at the  moment.    The present-day Russia is not guided by ideological  considerations when choosing its partners, the Federation  Council speaker noted. The main motivation is just mutually  beneficial contacts. The potential foe such contacts with Latin  American countries is enormous, and they should be certainly  stepped up.    Shumeyko confirmed his profound respect for Cuban leader  Fidel Castro. "During my visit to Cuba, I had three-hour talks  with Fidel, which showed that his assessment of the current  political and economic situation, as well as of the global  processes, has very little to do with its interpretation by the  mass media", the speaker stressed. "Politicians of this level  should not be spoken about in passing. Fidel Castro is the  world's property, and I will never go back on my words".</p>

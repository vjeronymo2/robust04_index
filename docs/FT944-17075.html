			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (20): Watering place that holds its popularity - Staying on / Chris McCooey sniffs the bracing air of Ostend If you drive into Ostend from the motorway that connects it with Calais or Brussels, you cannot fail to see the imposing bottom of a huge female statue about a kilometre from the seafront. The lady, wrought in green-tinged copper, reclines on her side looking out to sea, although her view of the waves is blocked by an ugly concrete edifice. The well-built lady straddles the central reservation of the wide Leopold II Laan and although her nakedness is partly concealed by fountains she seems to symbolise the worldly pleasures of Ostend, including the good food and drink that I found here during a one-week stay. Ostend's fortunes have fluctuated over the centuries. The old fishing village on the flat and windswept North Sea coast was given a town charter in the 13th century, in recognition of its growing importance as a port for trade across the Channel. Flanked on both sides by an empty expanse of sand dune, it remained the only important harbour along this stretch of coast until the construction of Zeebrugge in the 19th century. It was at this time that Ostend began to get pretensions. Or rather, the newly created King Leopold I of the Belgians wanted to do for Ostend what England's Prince Regent (later George IV) had done for the Sussex coast village of Brighthelmstone. On January 20 1831, the London Conference recognised Belgium's independence from Holland and proclaimed the country 'a perpetually neutral' state. The crown was accepted by Prince Leopold, son of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and the uncle of Queen Victoria (he was much in demand for performing regal roles: in 1816 he had married Charlotte, only child of the British Prince Regent and heiress presumptive to the throne, but she died in childbirth the following year - and in 1830 he was offered but declined the Greek throne). Leopold chose Ostend for a royal residence in 1834 and set about taking the town upmarket. The rail connection with Brussels meant that it was easily accessible. First, the king ordered that the old city walls (it had been attacked and besieged many times over the centuries) be pulled down so that it could expand along the seafront. Elegant summer houses and swish hotels were constructed and parks laid out. By the seaside, wide promenades were built for the fashionable to stroll along, taking in the bracing air, clearing the head, for the hedonistic delights of the evening to come which invariably centred around the Casino-Kursaal on the seafront. Completed in 1852, it was where concerts were performed by the great orchestras of Europe, ballets danced, operas sung and paintings admired. There were also gaming rooms and restaurants which catered for those who came to the resort in the appropriate seasons to see and be seen. The grandly named Wellington Hippodrome (after the Iron Duke, who performed his most heroic deed on Belgian soil) was built just out of town, literally a stone's throw from the sea; trotting and flat races were held here (and still are). A tram system - still in use today - was laid out. Leopold II kept up the good work and then his son Albert, in turn, continued to patronise the resort. By 1900, the Baedeker travel guide distinguished Ostend as 'one of the most fashionable and cosmopolitan watering places in Europe'. This century two wars and two periods of German occupation have taken their toll, as have periodic downturns in economic activity. Ostend has lost its exclusiveness but retains popularity for many laid-back Belgians - today 'raffish' seems a more appropriate adjective then 'fashionable'. During the last war Ostend was in the front line - bombs destroyed much of what remained of the old fishing and port town that predated the royal connection - as well as the fine buildings that the royal family encouraged in the 19th century. In their place, concrete and glass hotels and apartments have been hastily erected, functional for those that live in them but unappealing to the eye. Typical is the casino on the same site as the original. This is the edifice that blocks our female friend's view of the sea (the statue is called De See - The Sea - and was sculptured by Georges Grand of Tournai in 1965). Built in 1953 in the austere post-war years, the building's concrete facade is crumbling as the salt air eats into its fabric. But inside, it remains the cultural heart of the town. Modern painters and sculptors exhibit in the galleries, and there is a fine auditorium. However, this is no longer the Belgian equivalent of Glyndebourne: the Chippendales, a couple of Flemish stand-up comedians, a Broadway company on tour with the sex and drugs anti-Vietnam musical Hair and the Glen Miller Band - to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Belgium from the Nazis - were on the bill for the summer months. There are still restaurants and gaming rooms (although a private club, visitors can secure a daily membership by paying BFr100 and showing a passport). When the sun shines, the miles of lifeguarded and sandy beaches that stretch from the harbour entrance all the way west to De Panne attract tens of thousands, especially families with young children. Cafes spill on to the foreshore with glass screens to keep the windblown sand from the coffees and cokes and beers and ice creams. People still like to stroll along the promenade atop the massive sea wall, as they did in Leopold's day. Or you can hire pedal cars that seat up to six people for BFr80 per person for 30 minutes, or take a horse and carriage ride for BFr400. Belgians are mindful of public hygiene - the horses have nappies and the vending machines on the seafront sell paper bags so that the owners of the town's many dogs can clean up their pets' poop. The town remains cosmopolitan. The harbour, marina and Montgomery Dok attract yachts from all over Europe and beyond - they tie up, cheek by jowl, their sleek hulls gleaming, masts at attention, rigging jangling in the breeze. Jet foils and ferries arrive every couple of hours and disgorge passengers from up and down continental Europe and from across the North Sea. Loud and loutish groups of daytripping Britons are a common sight - reeling from bar to bar, they are tolerated for their spending but despised for their foul language and vomiting. Right next door to the ferry terminal is the station with trains to Antwerp or Brussels, and beyond to Holland and Germany. And adjacent to that is the coastal tram terminus where you can get tickets to go east to Knokke-Heist and west to De Panne. In the seven nights I stayed in Ostend I ate some of the best meals that I have had anywhere in the world. They included Malaysian, Chinese, Italian and Turkish dishes. If it is seafood you are after, then Vissers Kaai is the place to go - it fronts the eastern side of the town and overlooks Montgomery Dok. On the townside are numerous restaurants and on the quayside are stalls selling snacks. For one meal I had what amounted to a bucketful of mussels in a Provencal soup with a huge plate of French fries for BFr500. Another day, for a snack, I tried 'warme wulloks' - a tub of whelks in a spicy and hot soup (BFr100) followed by a piece of smoked eel (BFr100) and rounded off with a piquant, chewy rollmop herring (BFr30). Baedeker's description 'watering hole' remains as true today as it was a century ago. If you like beer, then you'll like Belgium and Ostend has countless watering holes, some of which specialise only in beer, stocking over 100 different varieties. Many of the numerous Belgium breweries have their own distinctive glasses for their own beer. If you order a wonderfully named Kwac beer, it will be served in what looks like an alchemist's vessel  -a glass with a bulbous base, a narrow waist and a wider drinking end and held upright in a wooden holder. If you are in need of 'hair of the dog', then the aptly named Delirium Tremens can be ordered. The pink elephants on the bottle and drinking glass are a nice touch, as was the notice over the bar where I sampled one, purely for research purposes: please respect the privacy and rest of other guests. Other beers, like some brewed by Duvel and Hoegaarden, are re-fermented in the bottle so pour carefully to leave the yeasty sediment behind. With alcoholic strength up to 12 per cent just a couple of bottle beers should get you feeling quite mellow. USEFUL INFORMATION Belgian tourist office, 29 Princes Street, London W1R 7RG.

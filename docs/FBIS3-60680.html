Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korea Institute, told  the Foreign Correspondents Club of Tokyo that a North Korean  military defector has attested to the shipments arranged by the  pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongryun).    Sato said that Lim Song-son, a first lieutenant in the North  Korean People's Army in charge of military construction who  defected, told the institute that ``some 75 percent'' of the  construction equipment, including trucks, cranes and bulldozers,  are from Japan.    Sato quoted Lim as saying, ``whenever something breaks, we  photograph the defective part and fax the photo to the Chongryun  along with the part number. In no time, the part is shipped to  us on the Mangyeongbong ferry.''    The 150,000-member Chongryun functions as Pyongyang's  virtual  embassy in Japan. The Chongryun-operated ferry shuttles between  Niigata and the North Korean port of Wonsan.    Lim, 30, who defected to South Korea in August and testified  to the existence of underground missile launching pads in North  Korea, was interviewed by the institute, which gained permission  from the South Korean Government.    Sato said Japan should ``realize its duty'' to place curbs  on  computer chips and COCOM-regulated products, as his institute's  investigation indicates North Korea is ``now trying to downsize  a missile warhead, so that the Nodong-1 missile could deliver a  nuclear bomb to Japan.''    Sato, 64, charged Chongryun has exported ``key high-tech  components North Korea needs for its war machine.''    Song Yong-bok, an official of Chongryun's Scientist and  Engineer Association of Korean Residents in Japan (SEA), denied  Chongryun violated COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Export  Controls) regulations. SEA is a group of about 170 Korean  researchers working in Japanese universities and business  companies.    ``All the large cargo and luggage we have sent to North  Korea  from Niigata has cleared inspections at customs,'' he said.    But Ikuo Misumi, senior inspector at the security export  control division of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, ``our ministry has not issued  any instructions to Niigata customs to inspect the contents of  each piece of luggage of passengers going to North Korea.''    Sato also urged the government to halt the annual flow of an  estimated 60 billion yen in Chongryun's banking remittances and  cash gifts from Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in  North Korea, saying the money eclipsed the entire 1990 North  Korean budget of 35 billion won.    Tsutomu Nishioka, editor-in-chief of the institute's monthly  news magazine, also said, ``although a ban on cash gifts to  North Korean relatives may raise humanitarian problems, to  prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear missile should  take precedence, as a nuclear attack would snuff out so many  people.''    ``Many people are being forced to take along or send money  as  their relatives are taken hostage, whom Pyongyang has threatened  to put into concentration camps or keep in detention, unless  they handed over money,'' Nishioka said.</p>

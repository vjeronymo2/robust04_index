			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the decision of the DPRK  Government to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam notified on  13 June U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the trustee  of the agency's ratification treaty, of this in accordance with  Clause D of Article 18 of IAEA regulations.    The letter of notification was correctly conveyed to the  U.S.  permanent mission at the United Nations through the permanent  mission of the DPRK at the United Nations on 13 June.    In this connection, the DPRK Government has completed all  legal procedures related to its withdrawal from the IAEA.    The content of the letter of notification about the  withdrawal follows:    I recall to mind: By adopting an unjust resolution of  imposing sanctions on us through the convocation of the Board of  Governors on 10 June 1994, the Secretariat of the IAEA has  endangered the highest interest of our country; has gravely  infringed upon the country's sovereignty and dignity; and has  created a situation in which the normal relations between us and  the IAEA can no longer be maintained.    In a unique status in which we temporarily suspended the  effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, the more inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of  safeguards we have undergone with good will and the more  (?contacts) we have made with the agency's Secretariat, the more  serious the question has become, far from being resolved. This  is a serious lesson and a conclusion that we have reached while  undergoing the agency's inspections up to now.    All the facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat does not  desire  an aboveboard resolution of the nuclear issue, but is pursuing  its impure political purpose of crushing [apsal] us under the  pretext of inspections.    The agency's Secretariat has again adopted an unjust  resolution in spite of our strong opposition and warning. In  this connection, as authorized, I notify the U.S. Government,  the trustee country, through you, of the fact that the DPRK  Government decided to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June 1994,  in accordance with Clause D of Article 18 of the agency's  regulations.</p>

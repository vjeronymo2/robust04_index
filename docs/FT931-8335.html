			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Navistar reduces loss to Dollars 5m on improved sales AN increase in deliveries of medium and heavy trucks and diesel engines helped Chicago-based Navistar International to trim its first-quarter loss to Dollars 5m, or 5 cents per share, from last year's first-quarter deficit of Dollars 32m, or 16 cents. Mr James Cotting, chairman, attributed the improvement to higher sales and reduced operating costs. Sales revenue at the company, which is north America's largest truck manufacturer formerly known as International Harvester, rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 1.03bn in the quarter, up from Dollars 902m a year earlier. Much of Navistar's sales gains reflected a 13 per cent increase in retail deliveries, to 16,800 units in the quarter. Shipments of mid-range diesel engines to other truck manufactures rose 18 per cent, and sales of replacement parts rose 6 per cent over the first quarter of 1992. Navistar said orders for its trucks continued to be strong in the second quarter. As a result, the company revised upwards its projections for north American medium and heavy truck sales. For 1993, it projects industry demand for medium trucks and school buses will reach 129,700 units, about 10 per cent higher than 1992. It is projecting heavy truck demand at 147,800 units this year, an 18 per cent increase. Navistar is in the middle of talks with its unions to restructure healthcare and retirement costs. In January, Navistar employees represented by the United Auto Workers Union ratified a new labour agreement. The company's long-term debt in its manufacturing operations, as a percentage of equity, rose to 33 per cent in the first quarter, up from 21 per cent in the same period of 1992.</p>

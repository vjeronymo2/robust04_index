JPRS-CST-93-006, 6 Apr 93 p 41]]    [Text] Shenzhen -- A Shenzhen-Hong Kong programme for  producing super-large-scale integrated chips -- the largest such  programme in China -- announced last week the establishment of  its Chinese-side investment company.    The Shenzhen Saige High-Tech Investment Co., Ltd. will  co-operate with a large European company in producing  super-large-scale integrated chips in the Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone and in conducting its after-processing work in  Hong Kong.    The total investment is expected to exceed 8.7 billion yuan  or $1 billion, according to Wang Dianpu, chairman of the board  of the Shenzhen Saige Group, the major shareholder in the  investment company.    At the opening ceremony last week, Wang noted that in 1991,  the super-large-scale integrated programme was designated a  State-class high-tech project.    After two years of preparation, the chairman said, the  company was officially established with a total registered  capital of 280 million yuan ($32 million).    The company has five shareholders. Besides the Saige group,  they are the Shenzhen Urban Construction Group, Shenzhen New  Industry Investment Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Zhongcheng Electronics  Engineering Co., and Shenzhen Chang Ho Industry Co., Ltd., a  joint venture by mainland and Hong Kong parties. The Saige group  controls 62.6 per cent of all shares.    Wang said the company will invite more large companies in  Shenzhen to buy shares.    In the near future, Wang said, the company will emphasize  designing, producing, packaging, and testing technology for  super-large-scale integrated circuitry and related industries.    Meanwhile, by making ample use of the State's preferential  policies for the high-tech industry, Wang said, the company will  develop new high-tech industries and diversify its business.    Over the long term, Wang said, the company hopes to develop  into a powerful multinational corporation.    The super-large-scale integrated programme will be built in  phases.    In the first phase, the company will build an  after-processing plant and a design centre at the Futian Bonded  Area in Shenzhen. It will cover more than 37,000 square metres.    According to Wang, the company will use advanced production  equipment and technology to design, package and test various  kinds of integrated circuitry.    The first-phase project, costing nearly $100 million, is  expected to produce 318 million integrated chips each year. Most  will be exported.    The project is expected to go into operation next year.    ``It will be the most advanced in technology and the largest  in scale of the country's competing manufacturers,'' Wang said.    He added that it would play an important role in promoting  the country's electronics industry, narrowing the technological  gap between China and developed countries, and pushing forward  the industrial development in South China.</p>

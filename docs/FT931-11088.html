			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Illogical to fault ICI's new deal on productivity Sir, Your leader ('ICI pays up', January 2) on the new deal at ICI argues that the company was at fault in agreeing a substantial real increase in pay in exchange for greater productivity. This was both unfair and illogical. I hope you would concede that the future of Britain is as a high-skill, high-wage economy, like Japan, and not merely as an EC base for that country's 'screwdriver' operations. If that is the case then what is the problem with workers who produce more being paid more? The GMB is, and will remain, at the forefront of negotiations which make British industry more productive, but we do this for the benefit of our members and the UK economy as a whole, not simply for the benefit of shareholders. If we had a few more companies such as ICI we would have neither a trade deficit nor a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement. But then to achieve that we also need a government with an industrial strategy. Keith Standring, national secretary GMB, process and construction sectn, 22-24 Worple Road, London SW19 4DD</p>

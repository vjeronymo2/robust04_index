			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Vodafone moves into Australia AUSTRALIA has awarded an operator's licence for a mobile telephone network to a group owned by Vodafone of the UK. Called Arena GSM, it becomes the third licence-holder for Australia, one of the world's fastest growing markets. Arena GSM is paying ADollars 140m for the licence and intends to invest another ADollars 400m in the project. It beat off three other shortlisted companies: Singapore Telecom and local operators Matrix Telecommunications and Voxson. The new service is scheduled to start by next October and must be available to 80 per cent of the population by the end of 1996, according to the terms of the licence. The latter also requires Australian interests to control more than half of Arena GSM by 2003. Arena GSM will be competing against existing licence-holders, Optus Communications and the state-owned Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The infrastructure for the new network is likely to be supplied either by Ericsson or Sweden or Finland's Nokia. Vodafone - see Lex</p>

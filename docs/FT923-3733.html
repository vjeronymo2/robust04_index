			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM moved ahead on the London bullion market on concern that ANC mass action might disrupt production at Impala's operations in Bophuthatswana. New York's platinum futures moved sharply ahead in early trading, but then lost most of the gains on reports that South Africa's three largest platinum producers did not expect any production problems because of the recent unrest, analysts said. GOLD closed unchanged in London. Dealers said the market was still stuck in a range between Dollars 338 and Dollars 344 a troy ounce and would continue to look weak technically until it could break above the upper end of the band. December New York arabica COFFEE futures were more than 2.5 cents a lb down in late trading, reflecting concern over long-term oversupply and sentiment that ICO talks on price support will make little progress later this month. 'Certified stocks continue to rise and it doesn't seem like the ICO can do anything to stop it,' said one analyst. The New York fall took the London robusta market down. New York COTTON futures were under pressure from sluggish world demand for US cotton and plentiful supplies. Compiled from Reuters</p>

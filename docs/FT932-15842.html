			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper savaged by new bout of heavy selling SAVAGING OF the copper price continued yesterday on the London Metal Exchange as it crashed through the psychologically-important Dollars 2,000 a tonne level and slumped to its lowest level for five years. Heavy selling, some of it by the Chinese who were previously substantial buyers of copper, caused the rout. Copper for delivery in three months was Dollars 2,026.50 a tonne at the market's official close last night but dealers said the price continued to fall and was trading at Dollars 1,965 a tonne - a drop of Dollars 185 or more than 8.5 per cent since Monday. On the New York Commodity Exchange by mid-afternoon the most-active May copper contract was at 88.10 cents a lb (Dollars 1,942 a tonne), the lowest since high-grade copper futures were first traded in 1988. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, said copper might now breach the Dollars 1,940 reached on the LME in February, 1988. 'But without question it is over-sold and we must expect the price to bounce back.' Traders had expected the copper price to be volatile this week as LME options were to be declared yesterday. In the event, about 5,700 lots of copper 'put' options, equivalent to more than 143,000 tonnes, were exercised, traders said, an unusually large number. Mr Adams suggested, however, this was widely expected and 'was in the price.' Brokers had seen copper's price falling from Dollars 2,400 since the begining of 1993 and taken action to manage the risk. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at the S G Warburg financial services group, said that most copper producers would still be profitable at present price levels. New technology used to produce an increasing tonnage of copper was driving down the industry's average cost of production. 'The price would have to drop a long way, perhaps to 60 cents a lb (Dollars 1,322 a tonne), before there would be any serious copper mine closures.'</p>

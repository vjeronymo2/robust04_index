			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: What they had to say 'I think that as the second most senior figure in the Labour party, like everybody else, I have a right to be a human being with my own views, values, convictions and my own record.' Margaret Beckett deputy leader 'She gets no kudos or publicity for the hard graft that goes on. I see her in committees. I see her working and she gets on with the job. Frankly, I am fully supporting her.' John Prescott, shadow transport secretary on Margaret Beckett 'He's a superb conference performer, he's doing a brilliant job in the transport portfolio.' Margaret Beckett on John Prescott 'The place for these people is out of society until they learn to behave like human beings.' Tony Blair, shadow home secretary on football hooligans 'He doesn't seem to realise how ridiculous he sounds when he tries to talk tough on law and order.' Michael Howard, home secretary, on Tony Blair 'They turn their swords of office not into ploughshares but into water shares and gas shares.' Roger Lyons of the MSF union on Tory ex-ministers 'They are not just split. They are broken in half.' George Robertson, Labour European affairs spokesman, on the Tories 'We . . . are in the situation where, to get our message across, we have to rely on the co-operation of our enemies.' Tony Dubbins Graphical, Paper and Media Union, in a debate on control of the press</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The electricity shares that never arrived Having applied for shares in the 1993 Northern Ireland electricity share offer, I was sent the wrong form. As a result, I was allocated none. I have approached NatWest Registrars, the Belfast Department of Economic Development and, most recently, the Securities and Futures Authority. The SFA told me: 1. The activities of registrars 'are not defined as investment business' under the Financial Services Act and 'regrettably (they) cannot investigate this matter nor give an opinion on it.' 2. 'The conduct of registrars is the responsibility of the firm that employed them.' 3. That my dispute lies with the department that employed NatWest. But I have already contacted it, to no avail. Can you suggest, nearly one year later, how I might realistically obtain satisfaction without protracted expensive independent legal action? NatWest Registrars was employed by Northern Ireland Electricity plc to administer its share offer. We think you should complain to the NIE if you feel its agents have given you what obviously sounds like a raw deal. Its address is: Company Secretary's Department, NIE plc, PO Box 2, Danesfort, 121 Malone Road, Belfast BT9 5HT. Tel: 0232-661 100. (Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

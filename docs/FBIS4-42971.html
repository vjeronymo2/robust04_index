			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis concluded from  his talks in Moscow that Russia believes now is the right time  for a new approach in the efforts to promote a Cyprus solution.  Returning to Cyprus tonight, Mikhailidhis said Russia is  showing an intense interest in the Cyprus issue. He added that  he and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev discussed two of  the alternatives suggested by the UN secretary general in his  report on the confidence-building measures [CBM], that is, the  exchange of views and the convening of an international  conference on the Cyprus issue, as Russia had suggested.    Commenting on the possibility that the UN secretary general  will submit a supplementary report on the talks on the CBM's,  Mikhailidhis said such an action is completely unjustified and  not in line with general procedures.</p>

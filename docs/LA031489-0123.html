			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NAMING OF NASA CHIEF IMMINENT  </P> <P> NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher said Monday that he expects President Bush  to name a new head of the space agency within two weeks.  </P> <P> Fletcher, who said months ago that he wanted to retire, made the announcement  in an impromptu news conference after the launching of the space shuttle  Discovery.  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief blamed the delay in  announcing his successor, in part, on the fight between the White House and the  Senate over the failed appointment of former Sen. John Tower to be defense  secretary.  </P></p>

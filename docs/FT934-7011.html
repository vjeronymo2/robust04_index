			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): High cost base deepens woe - BASF/Bayer Buffeted by price competition and overcapacity, the European chemicals industry is in severe difficulty. In Germany, the problems of the three giants - BASF, Bayer and Hoechst - are exacerbated by high manufacturing costs. The companies are expecting no second-half turnaround, but a clearer picture will emerge when two of the big three release nine-month results: BASF today and Bayer on Thursday. Bayer, insulated from the ferocious downturn in bulk chemicals by healthcare, has predicted that earnings will drop 20 per cent this year to DM2bn (Pounds 700m). It should say whether this is still attainable. BASF will look in bad shape by comparison. Profits halved in the first six months to DM249m and may have disappeared in the third quarter. 'There is no question in my mind that BASF is now making losses,' said Mr Albert Richards, chemicals analyst at CS First Boston in London. 'This might not be obvious under German accounting rules, which give management the freedom to report what they want. If they reported under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles they would probably report a significant loss for the nine months.' BASF is likely to report a token profit, but without a recovery in demand, it can only return to genuine profitability via further cost cuts.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS' DIVORCE VIDEOS HAVE ALL THE SIZZLE OF A TOOTHACHE  </P> <P> First, you see the title: DIVORCE. Then, a patriotic shot of a courthouse, flag  flying. A close-up of an office door plaque serves to introduce your host, MR.  ROISMAN. Finally, there's the shirt-sleeved Gerald Roisman himself, shaking  hands with a "client," preparing to fulfill the promise of this $29.95  videotape's subtitle: "An Attorney Tells What You Should Know."  </P> <P> "Arnold Becker's Video Guide to Divorce" had better production values, frankly.  Arnie of NBC's "L.A. Law" fame worked with a video coach first, shrugged on one  of his nattier Armanis, looked right into the lens and oozed advice: "If  there's someone to blame, blame them. If there's papers to serve, serve them.  If there's bank accounts to freeze, freeze them. Divorce isn't death; you don't  have to mourn. What you have to do, is act."  </P> <P> Not Roisman's style. He's less dramatic, less tailored and less blond. And  since he doesn't have the direct-mail muscle of Dave Meyer behind him, he's  sold a lot fewer videos (50 to 75, at last count) than Arnie did.  </P> <P> The Roisman advantage, however, is that Arnie, portrayed by actor Corbin  Bernsen, lives and peddles videos only on television. Whereas this guy from  Hartford with the receding hairline and the golf ball collection in his office  is a real divorce lawyer with a real video.  </P> <P> And he's not the only one.  </P> <P> Turns out there's another divorce lawyer in Columbia, S.C., Jan L. Warner by  name, who's selling his own $29.95 videotape via an 800 phone number. This one  uses graphics, printed titles that say things like "Channel Your Energy  Positively" and "Have a Life Management Plan."  </P> <P> Warner keeps his jacket on, takes a more nuts-and-bolts approach than Roisman,  and drawls.  </P> <P> Both lawyers say their video inspirations long predate Arnie Becker's  entrepreneurial escapades of last season; supervising producer William  Finkelstein says no one at "L.A. Law" had heard of any actual divorce videos  before Arnie's was invented.  </P> <P> Thus, it's hard to know whether life is imitating art in this trendlet, or vice  versa. All you can say with confidence is that Arnie's got the best writers.  </P> <P> Roisman, who estimates he's handled more than 3,000 divorces over 27 years of  practice, had his brainstorm after seeing wee-hours television commercials for  instructional videos such as Jack Nicklaus' on golf.  </P> <P> Like lots of matrimonial specialists, he often spends his first hour or two (at  $250 per) answering new clients' very basic questions, offering very general  reassurance and urging them to go home and think about things before they  decide to proceed.  </P> <P> "People who first come in are very anxious, very upset, very nervous," he says.  "There is so much misunderstanding."  </P> <P> Maybe, he mused, he could lay out some of the rudiments in his own  "informational vehicle."  </P> <P> Noodling over various formats, Roisman and his son, Peter, decided to reenact a  first session with a client.  </P> <P> Peter Roisman, whose firm, Pro-Rep, represents athletes and entertainers,  recruited an "actress-singer-model" client named Lisa Miller to play the  about-to-be-ex-wife. She doggedly reads a list of questions that gives Gerald  Roisman the chance to expound on such subjects as attorneys, fees, documents,  property and custody.  </P> <P> The 37-minute tape was shot by a couple of video consultants last summer in  Roisman's conference room, enhanced for the occasion with a small sculpture of  Justice holding her scales.  </P> <P> Roisman says he's invested about $20,000 to produce the first thousand tapes,  and needs to unload 650 to break even. Alas, ads in Connecticut newspapers  brought only a ripple of response, and an attempt to generate reviews seems to  have fizzled.  </P> <P> But a Hartford Courant business column about the video venture was picked up by  the Associated Press, which has led to three radio and two TV appearances and  -- to much excitement in the law offices of Roisman &amp; McClure -- an inquiry  from the staff of Maury Povich himself.  </P> <P> "My dream is to see (my father) and Corbin Bernsen on a talk show together,"  Peter Roisman fantasizes. "On the Carson show or the Letterman show."  </P> <P> This pairing might not be altogether to the 52-year-old Gerald Roisman's  advantage, but never mind. He's getting a sufficient kick out of the media  interest and colleagues teasing him about being a movie star; a potential  profit of less than $10,000 on a thousand tapes doesn't mean all that much to a  guy who has a full practice and develops condominiums on the side.  </P> <P> Jan Warner is taking the business aspect a bit more seriously.  </P> <P> He won't say how many copies of "How to Successfully Manage the Crisis of  Divorce" he's got stacked and ready to mail, but he's hired a New York PR firm  to flack the thing. What's more, he's planned a whole series of "life  management videos" on topics like remarriage, prenuptial agreements and  retirement planning. And he takes Visa and MasterCard.  </P> <P> A consumer advisory: Neither of these products will keep your average viewer  riveted.  </P> <P> Roisman's tape is funnier, unintentionally, because once his blow-dried client  starts reading her questions and nodding understandingly nothing can derail  her, not even the lawyer's appalling anecdote about a visitation gone bad.  Seems the husband had the two kids for the weekend, and, while the children  were watching Saturday morning cartoons, he and his new girlfriend commenced  "sexual relations" on the couch right in the same room.  </P> <P> "Hardly appropriate parenting!" Roisman says, growing uncharacteristically  animated. "Hardly appropriate dynamics!"  </P> <P> But the actress-singer-model, instead of wailing or doubling over, just nods  and plows on with the next question.  </P> <P> Warner, whose tape is distributed through his business, SoloSource, dispenses  with dramatizations and simply talks to the camera. He has a more forceful  delivery, gets into details about insurance policies and investments, and says  things like "Don't fight over the stainless steel."  </P> <P> The two videos share a disclaimer: Both lawyers soberly warn that they cannot  dispense legal advice in this fashion and that people contemplating divorce  should see attorneys.  </P> <P> This tactic is meant to spare them Arnie Becker's fate: He and his erstwhile  business partner, Dave Meyer, were sued during this season's "L.A. Law" by a  woman who claimed she followed Arnie's video advice and wound up with a lousy  settlement. Arnie had to pay the woman to settle a breach of warranty claim.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to warranty anything," Roisman notes pointedly, "except that  if the tape doesn't spin around in your machine, we'll replace it."  </P></p>

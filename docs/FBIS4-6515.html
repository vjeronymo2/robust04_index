			<p>BFN     [Text] Korea is threatened with trade retaliations from  the United States over its decision to destroy sausage imported  from there in February.    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries and the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday, the  U.S. Meat Industry Trade Policy Council has recently filed a  formal complaint with the U.S. Trade Representative calling for  trade retaliations for Korea in connection with the sausage  controversy.    EPB officials said the USTR will likely launch a full-scale  probe into what American officials said are Korea's unfair trade  practices.    Trade officials here expressed concern that the sausage  issue  may develop into a fresh trade dispute between Korea and the  United States at a time when their bilateral trade relationship  is liable to turn sour as a result of its growing  dissatisfaction with Korea's closed automobile market.    If the USTR reaches a conclusion that Korea's action was  unfair, it can take retaliatory action against Korea under the  "Super 301" section reinstated last month.    The newest trade issue was prompted by Korea's Ministry of  Health and Social Affairs, which ordered a halt to customs  clearance of American sausage with the illegally-extended term  of validity in early February this year.    The ministry also ordered 24 importers of American sausage,  mostly chicken and turkey franks, to retrieve the  already-marketed products from distribution outlets.    The ministry insisted that the American products had been  heated and refrigerated and therefore they should be allowed  only 30 days to be sold.    Under Korea's food sanitation rules, frozen sausage has an  expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas  heated and refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days.    But American meat processing firms as well as local  importers  reacted strongly to the ministry's decision, saying it is the  Korean government's "arbitrary" application of their rules.    About 4,800 tons of American sausage worth 25 million  dollars  had been shipped in since 1990, having been allowed an  expiration date of 90 days, before the ministry's February  decision, which put on hold some one billion won worth of  sausage at the port of Pusan.    EPB officials said the U.S. looks particularly unhappy with  the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs' sudden change in its  application of rules without prior notice.    They said some USTR working-level officials have already  visited Korea to lodge a formal protest, expressing concern that  the incident may aggravate already-worsened trade relations with  the U.S.</p>

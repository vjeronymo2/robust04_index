			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INVESTCORP BUYING SAKS FOR $1.5 BILLION;  </P> <P> RETAIL: LUXURY STORES' BRITISH OWNERS ACCEPT BID BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT  GROUP.  </P> <P> The prestigious Saks Fifth Avenue department stores will be sold to an  international investment group for about $1.5 billion under a definitive  agreement announced today.  </P> <P> The luxury retail chain, which was put on the auction block in September by its  British owner, BAT Industries PLC, will be bought by Investcorp, a group  described as well financed and experienced in retailing.  </P> <P> Separate announcements from Investcorp and BATUS Inc., BAT's American arm, said  the transaction should be completed within 10 weeks. Investcorp will also  assume certain of Saks' liabilities, the two parties said.  </P> <P> Commenting on the selection of Investcorp's offer, BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy  said it has the resources to support continued expansion of the 45-store chain.  </P> <P> Sheehy said a losing bid submitted by management, in partnership with a  Japanese retailer, was attractive but Investcorp's was superior.  </P> <P> "Saks will gain a new owner with a proven track record in building luxury  businesses, solid financial backing and a commitment to continuing the highly  successful strategy established by BAT for the company," Sheehy said.  </P> <P> Investcorp, which operates from bases in various U.S. and foreign financial  centers, has invested in a wide range of retailers. Investcorp offices are in  New York, London and in cities in Switzerland and Bahrain.  </P> <P> It bought the jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co. from Avon Products Inc. and took  it public in 1987; it owns 50% of the Italian luxury leather goods and fashion  company Gucci and has an interest in Chaumet, France's largest retailer of  prestige jewelry. It also has stakes in Carvel Corp., Color Tile, Sports and  Recreation Inc. and some non-retailing companies.  </P> <P> "Saks Fifth Avenue is one of the premier retailers in the world, and we are  absolutely delighted to be associated with it," said Paul Soldatos and Savio  Tung, the two members of Investcorp's management committee that led the effort  to buy Saks.  </P> <P> The sale of Saks is part of a restructuring plan aimed at allowing BAT to focus  on its core tobacco and financial services operations. The British conglomerate  undertook the changes in battling a hostile $22-billion takeover bid by a group  led by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.  </P> <P> The group said earlier this week that it was quitting its quest for BAT. But  BAT said it will carry out its restructuring as planned to enhance the  company's value to shareholders.  </P> <P> All of BATUS' U.S. retail businesses are being sold. The sale of Marshall Field  &amp; Co., the Chicago-based retailer, to Dayton Hudson Corp. was announced  last Thursday.  </P> <P> The flagship store of the New York-based Saks chain is in Manhattan on Fifth  Avenue. Branch stores are in 20 states.  </P></p>

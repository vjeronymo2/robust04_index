			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> European Community foreign ministers decided in Brussels that member nations  may send their ambassadors back to Iran, but a ban on high-level visits will  continue, Geoffrey Howe of Britain said. The 12 nations recalled their envoys  Feb. 20 in response to the order by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that author  Salman Rushdie, a British citizen born in India, be killed for blaspheming  Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Britain closed its Tehran mission in  protest, and Iran broke relations with London early this month. Declaring that  "there is no change in our position," Howe said Britain's mission will remain  closed. Rushdie remains in hiding.  </P></p>

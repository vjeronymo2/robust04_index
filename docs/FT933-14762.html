			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind fails to ease Rosyth fears SCOTTISH fears about the long term future of the Rosyth dockyard seemed unlikely to be allayed yesterday, after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, admitted that he was unable to guarantee entirely the surface naval work that the government has promised to allocate Rosyth to ensure the dockyard's survival. The promises of the work, which entail the refitting of 18 major warships and 49 minor naval vessels over the next 12 years, were made by Mr Rifkind last week, as the government announced that Rosyth had lost its two-year battle with Devonport dockyard for the lucrative nuclear submarine refitting work, estimated at some Pounds 3bn to Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years. Mr Rifkind told the Commons' defence committee yesterday that although the government had a strong commitment to allocating the surface refitting work to Rosyth, the details of this commitment could not be guaranteed until the future management of the yard had been decided. 'You can't have a contractual agreement without a contractor,' Mr Rifkind said. The Rosyth yard is run by Babcock Thorn, a private consortium. However the government is due to re-assess its contract in two years' time and is considering a range of options, including the possible privatisation of the yard. Faced with accusations that the Ministry of Defence had not matched up to its allocation promises to other dockyards in recent years, Mr Rifkind insisted that the government's promises for surface work should be sufficient to guarantee Rosyth's survival. His arguments did little to placate opposition MPs, who accused Mr Rifkind of under-estimating the job losses, predicted to be 350 for Devonport and 450 at Rosyth.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the Korean Roman Catholic Association in a statement June 16  strongly urged the Japanese Government that the authorities stop  suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) at once and severely punish those involved in  it.    The Japanese authorities' recent fascist outrage against the  Kyoto prefectural organization of Chongnyon following their open  crackdown on its Osaka prefectural organizations is an  unpardonable, heinous act of political suppression, the  statement said.    It warned that if the Japanese authorities persist in their  suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by availing  themselves of the international reactionaries' campaign for  stifling the DPRK, they would be held entirely responsible for  all the irretrievable consequences arising therefrom.</p>

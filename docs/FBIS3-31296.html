			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F> Krejci; place and date not given: "Speculation About Election  Date Is Merely Hypothetical"]    [Text] In his regular column, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  replies to topical questions from reporter Viktor Krejci:    [Krejci] The Slovak Government is planning to introduce  special inspections of Czech goods at the border. This measure  is evidently aimed at averting the Slovak deficit in the trade  balance and the resulting dollar payments to the Czech Republic.  Will the Czech side react to this?    [Klaus] [Slovak Finance] Minister Toth has been looking for  a long time for some centralized restriction of trade flows to  Slovakia, not only from the Czech Republic but also from the  whole world, to prevent a deficit in the balances of trade and  payments. He came up with this or that idea many times in the  past, only to quietly drop it later. We can react only when we  are notified of something through official channels. (Editor's  note: The interview was conducted a few hours before the Central  Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic announced that  products without a certificate about their quality would not be  allowed to enter Slovakia as of Friday [11 February].)    [Krejci] Interior Minister Jan Ruml is working on a bill to  make the StB [communist-era secret police] archives accessible.  Has the government come to an agreement on this, or is that his  private initiative?    [Klaus] This issue has been discussed for a long time, and  the minister of interior is reacting to it correctly, from the  bureaucratic point of view. However, this matter has not been  discussed as yet at the level of the coalition or the government.    [Krejci] Deputy Interior Minister Zeman said that local  elections and elections to the Senate should be held on 19  November. What is your opinion?    [Klaus] These are only hypothetical speculations on the part  of the deputy minister. No talks on this issue have been held  thus far and a decision is yet to be made.    [Krejci] Should the nationalist Zhirinovskiy arrive in the  Czech Republic, or should he be declared undesirable?    [Klaus] Undesirable in the general human sense of the word  is one thing and "persona non grata" as a technical term in  international politics--that is, whether some person will be  formally permitted to enter the country--is another. Mr.  Zhirinovskiy definitely is an undesirable in our country. We do  not need him here, do not have to listen to his views, and I  assume no one is curious to see him. I am not clearly  convinced, however, that we should also resort to the use of the  term "persona non grata" in the diplomatic sense. There is a  discussion on this issue going on between the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. One  consideration is whether, by resorting to some extreme bans, we  would not actually give this man more publicity than he deserves.    [Krejci] The Czech-Moravian Federation of Trade Unions wants  to submit a complaint to the International Labor Organization  because the Czech Government is supposedly violating Convention  87 on the free association in the trade unions.    [Klaus] This is an ill-considered and--the gentlemen trade  unionists are free to feel offended--somewhat childish step. We  should settle matters of this kind among ourselves instead of  hiding behind someone more distant and stronger. The idea of  complaining to some international organization that I failed to  get my way at home rather reminds me of children at play: First  I challenge some classmate to a fight, and, when he beats me, I  go and ask the teacher for help. I find this approach  absolutely unacceptable, disloyal, and wrong.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Indigenous groups fire the first shots of conference THE grounds of a mental asylum were the bizarre setting yesterday for the first official event of the UN Conference on Environment and Development, better known as the Earth Summit. Aborigines, inuit (eskimos), North American Indians, tribal Africans and Amazonian Indians in full paint and feathers gathered together in a mock Indian village in the grounds of Curicica Mental Hospital on the hills outside Rio de Janeiro for the first ever World Conference of Indigenous People, much to the amusement of the inmates. Most had come by aircraft and car, rejecting the grass huts of the Kari-oca village built by Indians with authentic materials from the Xingu National Park, in favour of air-conditioned hotels in the city. Some 500 Indians from five continents will meet all week to discuss topics such as biodiversity, intellectual property and sustainable development, to prepare a document to be presented to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary general of the Earth Summit. According to Mr Marcos Terena, a Brazilian Indian chief co-ordinating the conference, the aim is 'to ensure that indigenous people have a voice' in the official summit which starts next Wednesday, and are not 'just considered in folkloric terms'. Specific concerns include recognition of intellectual property rights for use of medicinal plants from Indian areas, sovereignty rights and deciding on a position for the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of the Americas. Mr Donald Rocas, an Indian from Costa Rica, says: 'This conference is fundamental because it deals with all our lives - not just those of indigenous people but also non-indigenous who need to learn from us how to look after land and resources crucial for the planet's survival.' Ms Helen Corbett, who is leading an Aborigine delegation from Australia, says: 'The main issue for us is sovereignty for aborigines to prevent destruction of our land and death of our people.' However, there is doubt over how representative the conference delegates are. Brazilian Indians spoken to in Para and Amazonas over the last month were completely unaware of the event and expressed interest in visiting Rio. The Earth Summit will be the first big post-cold-war conference, with around 18 new European countries in attendance. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief negotiator, describes it as 'the most important non-confrontational conference since San Francisco in 1945'. Over the weekend the 10m residents of Rio had their first taste of what is to come with the testing of security operations, which brought traffic to a complete standstill and caused some panicked residents to think a military coup had been launched. Some 6,000 army officers patrolled the streets in tanks with heavy arms, practising for the summit, at which about 125 heads of state are expected. One of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation complained after being tailed by three riflemen: 'The military seem to be taking things to extremes - are we really going to open tank fire if any problems emerge ?' For those concerned about pickpockets, Rio's most famous escaped British train robber, Ronald Biggs, is giving security hints on a daily radio programme throughout the conference.</p>

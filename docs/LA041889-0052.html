			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. STARTS A CRIMINAL PROBE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS  </P> <P> In an escalating battle between regulators and American Continental Corp., the  nation's top savings and loan regulator said Monday that his office has  referred criminal allegations involving the management of American's Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to the Justice Department.  </P> <P> At the same time, American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. lashed  out at regulators who seized Lincoln on Friday, charging that "malicious  bureaucrats" were out to destroy his company and threatening to fight the  Federal Home Loan Bank Board in court.  </P> <P> Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall, in a telephone interview from Washington,  said several complaints involving the management of Lincoln have been referred  to the Justice Department for investigation. He said the inquiry also could  involve American Continental.  </P> <P> Wall declined to be specific about the types of potentially criminal activities  the bank board had referred to the Justice Department.  </P> <P> He did say, however, that the bank board's most recent audit of both Lincoln  and American Continental turned up evidence of assets being shifted from the  S&amp;L to the parent company.  </P> <P> Wall also said bank board personnel believe possibly critical documents  pertaining to the S&amp;L's activities were ordered destroyed by the thrift's  management just before American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection  from creditors.  </P> <P> "We have not seen those comments," said Mark M. Connally, spokesman for  American Continental. "Until there's actually something factual presented by  Mr. Wall to back up the allegations, there is no way we can adequately and  properly respond."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $70 Million Withdrawn  </P> <P> American Continental and 11 subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on  Thursday. Regulators seized control of Lincoln the following day. The seizure,  coupled with the bankruptcy, prompted depositors to withdraw nearly $70 million  from the thrift's 29 Southern California branches on Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> By Monday, however, federal regulators who are operating Lincoln under a  conservatorship said that the pattern of heavy withdrawals by panicked or  confused customers had died down.  </P> <P> At a news conference in Phoenix, Keating accused regulators of engaging in a  politically motivated campaign to destroy Lincoln Savings and American  Continental.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Previous Feuds  </P> <P> Keating said Lincoln "may well become the first thrift to defend itself to the  full extent . . . if need be to challenge in court those who would destroy us,  and (to) call for a full federal investigation of the abusive power by one or  more regulatory offices."  </P> <P> Keating bought Lincoln in 1984 and has since been involved in a number of feuds  with S&amp;L regulators. The battles generally have centered on his practice of  involving the S&amp;L in commercial real estate and development rather than  sticking to more traditional single-family home loans.  </P> <P> Keating declined to answer questions at the news conference, choosing instead  to appeal to the citizens of Arizona.  </P> <P> Visibly upset and hands shaking as he stared into the television cameras,  Keating warned that federal savings and loan regulators would destroy the  Arizona economy if they succeeded in pulling down Lincoln.  </P> <P> American Continental claims to directly employ 2,300 people with a payroll of  over $70 million in Arizona and to generate countless other projects around the  state.  </P> <P> In its bankruptcy filing, American Continental and the 11 subsidiaries listed  $3 billion in debt and $3.85 billion in assets in its Chapter 11 petition.  </P></p>

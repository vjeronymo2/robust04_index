			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Small price for quality Sir, In his otherwise thorough analysis of pupil numbers in the independent sector ('Sums don't add up', 13 May), John Authers gives the impression that overspending during the 1980s on 'luxury items such as swimming pools and sports halls' was responsible for rising school fees. What actually happened during the 1980s was that all educational costs, independent and state, went up. Between 1984 and 1991, average fees at ISIS schools increased by 94 per cent in cash terms. Over the same period, unit costs in state schools rose by 86 per cent. Teachers' salaries - which account for up to three-quarters of a school's costs - are the principal reason for this rise, which may have been less obvious to the taxpayer than to the independent school parent. If independent schools are to maintain a competitive advantage, they must employ high quality teachers. They must also invest in their plant. Parents of boarders expect modern accommodation standards. All parents expect schools to be equipped for the rapidly changing demands of the modern curriculum. And although only 42 per cent of independent schools have got one, I am sure that neither Iain Sproat, sports minister, nor John Patten would regard a sports hall as a 'luxury Item'.

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THIS ONE IS GUARANTEED FOR GOOD HORSE LAUGH  </P> <P> The Kentucky Derby is upon us again, bringing to mind the story about the  Brooklyn Dodgers and their desperate search for talent during World War II.  </P> <P> At one spring camp, a horse walked up to Manager Leo Durocher and said,  "Understand you need ballplayers. Can you use a .480 hitter?"  </P> <P> "Are you kidding," Durocher said. "Grab a stick."  </P> <P> The horse stepped into the batting cage, and Durocher threw him five pitches.  All five were hit out of the park.  </P> <P> "You can hit," Durocher conceded, "but how about fielding?"  </P> <P> "I'm a great shortstop," the horse said.  </P> <P> Durocher sent him out to short and hit him some grounders. The horse fielded  them all effortlessly.  </P> <P> "All right," Durocher said, "now let's see you run the bases."  </P> <P> "Run?" said the horse. "If I could run, I wouldn't be here. I'd be in the  Kentucky Derby."  </P> <P> Add Derby: Then there's the one about the couple who stood before the divorce  judge. The wife said: "Your honor, my husband isn't interested in me. All he  talks about from morning to night is horses. He doesn't even remember our  wedding day."  </P> <P> Said the husband: "That's a lie. We got married the day Foolish Pleasure won  the Kentucky Derby."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who is the only man to ride and train winners in the Kentucky  Derby?  </P> <P> Quick fix: After going hitless in three at-bats Saturday in a loss to UCLA, USC  outfielder Mike Robertson went to assistant coach Bill Hughes and said, "I'd  like to take some early batting practice tomorrow."  </P> <P> "Be there at 9:30," said Hughes.  </P> <P> Robertson was. That afternoon, he went four for four with two home runs and  five RBIs as the Trojans beat the Bruins, 7-5.  </P> <P> Homecoming: As the last player taken in the draft, tight end Demetrius Davis of  the Raiders will be treated to a round of festivities by the Balboa Bay Club at  Newport Beach during Irrelevant Week starting June 24. Among the treats will be  a night at a casino in Reno.  </P> <P> Davis is from Nevada Reno.  </P> <P> Add irrelevance: This is the 15th Irrelevant Week. It was the brainchild of  former USC and San Francisco 49er end Paul Salata. The motto is: "Irrelevant  Week Means Doing Something Nice for Someone for No Reason." The award for the  nonorees is the Lowsman Trophy.  </P> <P> Out of the can: From Montreal pitcher Oil Can Boyd: "The most important thing  for me to do is to go out and do what I like to do, and that's harmonate.  Everything else is irrelevant."  </P> <P> He then went out and harmonated the St. Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Johnny Longden rode Count Fleet in 1943 and trained Majestic  Prince in 1969.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Hall of Fame outfielder Duke Snider, on baseball's inflated  salaries: "Man, if I made a million dollars, I would come in at 6 in the  morning, sweep the stands, wash the uniforms, clean out the offices, manage the  team and play the game."

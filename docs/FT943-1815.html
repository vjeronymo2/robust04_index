			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Book Review: A deal too far for king of capitalism HANSON: A BIOGRAPHY By Alex Brummer and Roger Cowe Fourth Estate, Pounds 20, 315 pages The building of a Pounds 12bn empire, without a strategy, a sense of direction or even very much financial information, is a feat to which few people can lay claim. James Hanson can, according to Guardian financial journalists Brummer and Cowe. Knighted by Harold Wilson and given a peerage by Margaret Thatcher, Hanson has been the archetypal conglomerateur: an aggressive predator with an eye for a badly managed target. Disappointingly, in seeking to reveal both Lord Hanson's strengths and those of his Hanson group, Brummer and Cowe have produced a tale that is neither biography nor corporate history. The drama and personalities behind the bid battles are too often drowned out by numbers, while Lord Hanson's character and his relationship with Gordon White, the group's co-founder, remain under-explored. The reader is left in little doubt, however, that one of the most surprising things about Lord Hanson is that he put so much distance between himself and his father's Huddersfield haulage business. The record of his opportunistic ambushes has been hit and miss. He may have swallowed some big fish, in the form of London Brick, SCM and Imperial Group, but he has failed in his efforts to bag easier targets, such as Rolls-Royce Motors and Powell Duffryn. His means of gathering corporate information have been crude - Lord Hanson is even said to have been attracted to companies by the photographic quality of their annual reports. He has shown no continuing interest in his acquisitions, save returns on capital and cash flow. The only value he has placed on a company is its price on disposal. And he has taken to extremes the concept of letting managers manage - asked recently how his 80,000 employees saw him, he replied: 'They don't' But Lord Hanson has been an excellent administrator, with a fearsome grasp of essentials. He has exploited every accountancy and tax advantage, and always known when to buy and when to sell companies to keep earnings per share and dividend income rising. In addition, he has cultivated political friends, oiling relationships with generous party political donations. And in everything, the charismatic boss of the group which bears his name has employed his famous charm and temper. In his 30-year rise from playboy to cut-throat capitalist, Lord Hanson has always been colourful. As an eligible bachelor, he enjoyed romances with Jean Simmons and Audrey Hepburn. In 1965, he teamed up with the flamboyant White to begin their great, transatlantic takeover adventure. The 1970s was a period of meandering disappointment. But with the 1980s and the arrival of Mrs Thatcher, Lord Hanson was delivered of 'a government made for Hanson Trust just as Hanson Trust was made for the government'. The first doubts about Hanson's formula for success set in only after some ugly takeover tussles and the launch of a near-disastrous rights issue. As the group expanded, the financial information needed to assess its real performance dwindled. A row over the pension fund at newly acquired Imperial Group was followed by a warning from the governor of the Bank of England to take its eyes off Midland Bank. Undaunted, Hanson paid more than Pounds 3bn for Consolidated Gold Fields and in 1990 considered buying PowerGen, the electricity generator, by private treaty. Though Lord Hanson could have then departed with his reputation intact, his ambition to win bids and the respect of the establishment was not yet satisfied. With Pounds 7bn in the war chest, the group grabbed a share stake in ICI. But the arch wheeler-dealer, having initially failed to mention the deal to his board, had bitten off more than he could chew. ICI outmanoeuvred him by targeting the company-financed lifestyle of Lord White, who had always declined to sit on the UK main board, and his anomalous position as the chairman of the group's US business. Racehorses and Beverly Hills mansions grabbed the headlines and Hanson looked like a personal fiefdom. Its boss took consolation from a Pounds 42m share dealing profit. Come the 1990s, the Hanson group was slow to appreciate the new disciplines expected of it in an age of good corporate governance. Efforts by Lord Hanson to restrict shareholders' powers at annual meetings ended in defeat, and in 1992 a former Hanson protege, Greg Hutchings, chief executive of industrial conglomerate Tomkins, saw off Hanson's bid for food group RHM. With Lords Hanson and White playing a less prominent role and the next generation of managers, such as David Clarke and Derek Bonham, in place, Hanson has been changing tack, presenting itself as a diverse industrial group dedicated to its core businesses. The authors inevitably challenge the legacy of Hanson, which they paint as the sort of mega-business that is itself ripe for Hanson takeover treatment. They cite Hanson's already well scrutinised tax and accounting skills as the principal keys to its progress and question claims of consistently excellent shareholder returns. Lords Hanson and White, they conclude, must have done some good but this was outweighed by allegiance to the cult of short-termism. The alternative view is that Hanson has shaken up many of the complacent, corpulent companies in which it has shown an interest. They bucked up their ideas or they succumbed to a new management which made them efficient and profitable, either way helping UK plc improve its performance. Whoever is right, few contemporary capitalists have had so much fun. The grammar school boy from Huddersfield, now 72 and due to step down in 1997, reckons no one will realise when he has retired: 'I will be gone and nobody will notice.' About as likely as Lord Hanson voting Labour.</p>

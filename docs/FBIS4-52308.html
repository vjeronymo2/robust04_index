			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Leaders of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake agreed Tuesday [10  May] to bolster parliamentary cooperation between the two  parties, party sources said.    In talks at Sakigake headquarters, SDP chairman Tomiichi  Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura also explored  prospects for a future alliance, the sources said. They said  the two party leaders agreed on holding regular consultations  between their officials in charge of Diet strategy and policy,  as well as the holding of study meetings by parliamentarians.    The SDP wants to eventually form a joint parliamentary group  with Sakigake to confront the minority government of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said.    Sakigake, for its part, is said to be seeking a  reconfiguration of the political community by enticing Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join the prospective alliance.    But some Sakigake members remain opposed to an alliance with  the SDP because of outstanding differences in policy on such  issues as defense and nuclear energy.    Sakigake's 15 House of Representatives legislators are  defectors from the conservative LDP, which has strongly upheld  the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.    On Monday, Sakigake and the three-member legislative group  Seiun, a breakaway from the Japan New Party, launched a unified  18-member parliamentary group in the lower house.    Also on Monday, SDP leader Murayama pledged to cooperate  with  the LDP, the largest opposition party, against what he called  the Hata coalition government's high-handed management of state  affairs.    The SDP quit the ruling coalition after the coalition's  majority forces led by Shinseito moved to create a 130-member  parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. The SDP's walkout left  Hata's coalition with a minority in the lower house.    Speaking at the opening of a two-day council meeting of the  Socialist International in Tokyo, Murayama blasted "a revival of  power politics and fascist political forces." He saw a rise in  popular expectations of social democratic and liberal forces,  saying the day the SDP regains power is fast approaching.</p>

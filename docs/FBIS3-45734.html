Cosea made the remarks to reporters at the Bucharest airport  upon his return from China.    During the visit, he said, his delegation witnessed the  enormous economic achievements in China and toured the  fabulously flourishing special economic zones in its part.    His delegation exchanged opinions on economic reforms with  Chinese Government leaders at central and lower levels, Cosea  said.    Besides mutual cooperation in the domain of economic  reforms,  his delegation agreed with Chinese officials that Romania and  China should further advance their economic and trade relations,  he said.    The Romanian Government took interest in developing economic  relations with China in that China is not only an extremely  important and stable partner of Romania, but also a huge market  to exploit, he said.    Expressing "double satisfaction" at the outcome of his visit  to China, he stressed that the new international environment and  the economic reforms underway in the two countries was in no way  limiting the development of their relations, but only altered  the framework for cooperation.    Romania should make extensive efforts in search of means of  furthering Sino-Romanian relations, he said.    He added that his delegation returned home very well  prepared  on certain questions and that discussions would be held with the  Ministries of Trade, Industries and Finance so that specific  ways could be worked out to foster closer economic and trade  ties with China.</p>

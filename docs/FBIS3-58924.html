			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "No Longer Any Choice"] </F>   [Text] They are going. Vice Prime Minister Guy Coeme  first, publicly and bitterly. Bitter because, in his own words,  he was the victim of a sustained, merciless campaign in both the  media and political circles. The daily bombardment became too  much for him. Now Coeme is free to organize his defense, as it  were.    Shortly after, he was followed by Guy Spitaels, who resigned  as minister-president of the Walloon region. Walloon Interior  Minister Guy Mathot who had been named in a whole list of  scandals, and is heavily suspected of involvement in the  Agusta-Cools affair, was -- very noticeably -- the last to go.  Impudence beyond all measure.    The PS [Walloon Socialist Party] dropped Coeme to save the  government. About time. In the last three weeks, the party had  remained firmly behind the three PS ministers, claiming that  they were innocent; that there was nothing for which to reproach  them; that it was a party political maneuver, a plot on the part  of resentful Flemings who could not bear to look the new,  pragmatic Wallonia in the face. This life raft was deflated  rapidly, in just a few hours. The situation became untenable  particularly when it emerged unmistakably that the main evidence  against the PS ministers came from within the party itself.    The result is a historic blow against the PS leadership,  which is shaking the party to its foundations. Torn by internal  disputes and vendettas, crushed and humiliated by the forced  resignation of three ministers, Party Chairman Philippe Busquin  has been left standing knee-deep in the rubble. What still  remains of the dream of socialism? What still remains of the  most powerful party in Wallonia?    Are the hard times for the PS now over and done with? Does  it mean that the Agusta story is now a closed book? No. Not  only because by no means all the information about this Italian  helicopter order has emerged yet. The role played by the  economic minister at the time, Willy Claes, remains disputed.  And what about the senior army commanders? Why was Commander  in Chief Jose Charlier so enthusiastic in his defense of Guy  Coeme?    However, above all, the murder of Andre Cools remains  unsolved. The theory of a link with the Agusta affair, of some  dreadful vendetta within the PS, is gaining ground. We need to  know who issued the orders, who knew, and who carried out the  act. This inquiry must not be allowed to come to a halt. The  resignations of the PS ministers must be the cracks of the whip  that urge an accelerated denouement of the affair.    The damage caused to the government cannot be estimated for  the time being. However, one thing is certain: A political  earthquake of these proportions has left the Dehaene team  shaking at the knees. The PS is a shadow of its former self, and  many members of the party are thinking of revenge. In such a  situation, and with even more revelations hanging over them, who  would want to commit themselves fully to budgetary measures or  contentious bills? Who will dare -- or can afford -- to pretend  that there is nothing wrong?    The entire political sphere is being turned upside down, and  a murder was required to make this happen. Over the years,  people have gotten away unpunished with far too much. That is  disturbing. Even more disturbing are some reactions, especially  in Wallonia, which give rise to suspicions that people find it  normal for politicians to do their best for the region, party,  and supporters, even if their actions do not really comply with  the rules. These kinds of Italian practices must disappear.  And not just in Wallonia, but here too. The resignation of the  PS ministers, or even a government crisis, must not be allowed  to stand in the way of the process of purification. The  political class no longer has any choice.</p>

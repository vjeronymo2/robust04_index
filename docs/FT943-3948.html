			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Blair faces rail strikes motion The two main rail unions are expected to put forward an emergency resolution at the Labour party conference urging backing for the signal workers, who begin another two-day stoppage from midnight tonight, David Goodhart writes. The conference, at the end of the month, could be overshadowed by the strike by members of the RMT union. Mr Tony Blair, party leader, may find it difficult to remain aloof from the issue as he did last week at the Trades Union Congress. Any political discomfort for Mr Blair will be eagerly exploited by the Conservative conference at the beginning of October. The Labour leadership will do its best to ensure that the wording of the resolution by the RMT and the Aslef train drivers' union does not cause political embarrassment. The party said: 'We hope that everyone will seek to avoid a situation which turns the strike into a con-flict point for Labour and political capital for the Tories. That means that the wording of the emergency resolution will have to be looked at very carefully.' Railtrack, the state-owned company that operates the rail network, said yesterday that trains from Paddington to Plymouth would operate normally during this week's strike for the first time since the signal workers' strikes began. It said: 'This has been achieved in part by the increasing number of RMT signallers who are now working normally.' A total of 97 RMT signal workers in the region had returned to work.</p>

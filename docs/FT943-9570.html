			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Ciba pays Dollars 300m for Iolab drug operations The reorganisation of the world's healthcare companies continued yesterday with the Dollars 300m acquisition by Switzerland's Ciba of part of Iolab, a division of US rival Johnson &amp; Johnson that specialises in eye treatments. Ciba is buying Iolab's drug operations, which include products that reduce allergic reactions and treat dry eyes. The rest of Iolab, mainly the surgical products business, stays with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson &amp; Johnson said that it was selling the business 'to concentrate on other pharmaceutical development areas'. Iolab's drug side will be incorporated into Ciba Vision, the US-based Ciba subsidiary that was established in 1980. Ciba has been conspicuously absent from the spate of acquisitions and disposals in the pharmaceuticals industry in recent months. Roche, its neighbour in Basle, for example, paid Dollars 5.3bn for California's Syntex in April. Mr Rolf Meyer, Ciba finance director, said the acquisition was not as strategic as such deals, but presented 'a good growth opportunity for Ciba Vision'. He said Iolab's prescription and over-the-counter products had generated Dollars 70m in sales last year and should bring in Dollars 100m in 1995. This would put Ciba Vision into fifth place in the Dollars 2bn a year ophthalmic drug market. The top four are Alcon, a US subsidiary of Switzerland's Nestle, Allergan and Merck of the US, and Japan's Santen Pharmaceutical. Ciba Vision's sales in 1993 were worth Dollars 700m, mostly from contact lenses and lens care products, placing it about tenth in the sector. Mr Luzi von Bidder, president of Ciba Vision's Worldwide Ophthalmic Business Unit, said the acquisition would boost sales both in and outside the US. 'We have the international sales force in place to (increase) Iolab products (sales) overseas,' he said. Sixty per cent of Ciba Vision's sales are outside the US. He added that the extra sales would allow Ciba Vision to support a bigger research and development programme. The deal is the second this week in eye medicine. On Monday, the UK's Smith &amp; Nephew sold its Ioptex division to Allergan of Irvine, California.</p>

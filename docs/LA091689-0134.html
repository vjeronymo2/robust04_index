			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON COMES BACK TO EARTH IN 14-3 LOSS TO DIAMOND BAR  </P> <P> The honeymoon is over for the Canyon High School football team.  </P> <P> After snapping a 17-game losing streak with a victory over Corona last week,  the Comanches were beaten by the Diamond Bar Brahmas, 14-3, Friday night.  </P> <P> Mostly, it was a stingy Diamond Bar defense that kept Canyon from winning their  second in a row. Canyon quarterback Chuck Nickerson was sacked seven times for  38 yards in losses, and the Brahmas secondary wasn't any kinder. They  intercepted Nickerson twice and covered his receivers so tightly he completed  just two of eight passes.  </P> <P> "We just made a lot of mistakes . . . self-destruction," Canyon coach Loren  Shumer said. "We couldn't give the quarterback enough time. Then when we did,  he couldn't find his receivers.  </P> <P> "We are just going to have to improve our passing game or we're going to face  9- and 10-man fronts all season. They (Diamond Bar, 2-0) sent a lot of people  and we just couldn't block them."  </P> <P> The Comanches (1-1) were more successful rushing, however. They gained 115  yards, with sophomore running back Jeff Brunswig getting 85 of them in 20  carries.  </P> <P> That wasn't enough to produce any touchdowns, though. And it also wasn't enough  to offset Diamond Bar quarterback Tito Quiles (8 of 15 for 95 yards) -- who  kept the offense moving at just the right times -- and touchdowns by running  backs Mike Jones and Frank Delgadillo.  </P> <P> Canyon's only score was a 24-yard field goal by Chris Snitko with 3:42  remaining in the first quarter. And that was the only score by either team  until Delgadillo scored from two yards out late in the third quarter.  </P></p>

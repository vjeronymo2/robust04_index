			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Feelings stay mixed as Paris, Zurich rebound Sentiment was mixed following last week's fears, and Monday's lack of enthusiasm, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS saw some bottom-fishing as the market rebounded from Monday's new low. The CAC-40 index rose 23.29 or 1.3 per cent to 1,876.12 in turnover of FFr3.1bn; but a number of blue chips advanced 3 or 4 per cent. Analysts remarked upon the gains for Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux, up FFr19.20 to FFr477.20 and FFr20.80 to FFr489 respectively in quite significant volume. The two water companies have been depressed in recent months by allegations of irregularities in political party funding and similar matters; French utilities were down by 10.7 per cent in the third quarter against a 1 per cent decline in the market and it may be, said professionals, that some investors were beginning to look at their earnings potential. Elsewhere, buyers were still risk averse, Credit Lyonnais falling back again, by FFr9 to FFr421, as the bank denied talk of unconditional state backing. LVMH lost a further FFr15 at FFr827 following moves to simplify the luxury product group's structure. FRANKFURT came back from the Unity Day holiday, and caught up with Monday's falls elsewhere, the Dax index shedding 16.80 to 1,994.95 on the session and easing to 1,988.67 in the post bourse. US selling seemed to have eased, and turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6bn; but it was no day to be in some second liners, with traders news sensitive and a lack of buyers to soak up small selling. A DB Research earnings downgrade for Asko, the retailer, took the shares another DM85 lower to DM775, down from DM1,000 on August 30 and a January high of DM1,275. In construction, Holzmann's rights issue at DM650 left the shares DM31 lower at DM885; in the same sector, Hochtief dropped DM40 to DM934; and in engineering, Deutsche Babcock lost DM221.90 - another case of brokers' forecasts being a little too optimistic, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt. ZURICH rebounded after the sharp losses of the previous two sessions and the SMI index picked up 23.0 to 2,522.5. The recovery extended to UBS bearers, up SFr21 to SFr1,191, and the registered, SFr4 ahead at SFr287 - both had been heavily sold since last Friday's news of the bank's capital restructuring. BK Vision, Mr Martin Ebner's investment vehicle which is heading for a showdown over control of UBS, rose SFr35 to SFr1,335. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals returned to favour, with Roche certificates recouping SFr95 to SFr5,725 and Ciba bearers up SFr8 to SFr730. Insurers were under pressure on worries of competition from Germany's Allianz following its purchase of Elvia. Swiss Re was an exception, putting on a further SFr27 at SFr671 in continued response to Friday's news that it planned to sell off its direct insurance holdings and concentrate on its reinsurance business. AMSTERDAM edged lower in quiet, bond-driven trading, the AEX index easing 0.29 to 398.49. ABN Amro fell 60 cents to Fl 56.80 on fears of interest rate rises. KNP BT extended Monday's losses, falling Fl 1.20 to Fl 50 following news of collapsed merger talks with Ivan Allen, of the US. Wolters Kluwer picked up Fl 1.40 to Fl 122.40 on news that it had bought the Swiss training institute Krauthammer International. Multihouse, a software company, rose 40 cents or 16.6 per cent to Fl 2.80 in heavy volume on takeover rumours after a year in which the loss-making company has been hovering just above Fl 2.00 per share. MILAN finished easier but off the lows seen after comments by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, that he had not been given time to study the 1995 budget, suggested a rift between the cabinet and the presidency. The Comit index finished 9.76 or 1.5 per cent lower at 657.98, while the real-time Mibtel index picked up from a day's low of 10,464 to close 34 easier at 10,551. Fiat hit an early high of L6,525 after the Fiat Auto managing director, Mr Paolo Cantarella, said that market conditions were improving, but added that Fiat Auto had made a loss in the first half. Subsequently the shares dropped back to L6,477. The banking sector continued its recent decline, Banco di Napoli losing another L14 to L1,484 on speculation that it might be about to launch a capital increase. Credito Italiano fell L50 to L2,010. Benetton remained under pressure, giving up L350 to L20,400 for a fall of 7.9 per cent since last Friday's disappointing first-half results. VIENNA traders said that buyers were reluctant to go bargain hunting ahead of general elections in both Austria and Germany; sentiment was hit early by weakness in the German bund future, and the early closing ATX index fell 8.42 to 1,051.54. Economos, the seal and washer maker endangered by the possible non-payment of a Sch100m debt from a US sibling, said it could service its own debts even though one bank had called in credit lines. However, the shares weakened Sch77 to Sch693.

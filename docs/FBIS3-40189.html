			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Chen Jianxiang (7115 0494 4382) and </F> Zhao Hong (6392 4767): "DAXUESHENG Questionnaire Survey of 1,500  Students: What Do the `New Collegians' Know About Mao Zedong?"  The first segment in italics is a source-supplied introduction.]    [Text] They were born in the mid-1970's, at a time  when Chairman Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms were passing  away one by one and the republic was going through a most  difficult period.    They grew up in a brand new era. All of the bygone glories,  emotions, absurdities, and pains were but far away fairy tales.    Today, they have grown up; they are going to college.    They no doubt are a generation that straddles two centuries,  destined to be the masters of the republic in the next century.    For the moment, we shall call them the "new collegians."    Mao Zedong's passing and the birth of the "new collegians"  seemed to coincide, like two wheels on the same track, two  consecutive pages on the calendar. There was no overlap, no  repetition.    Thus, the issue of how much the "new collegians" know about  Mao Zedong has become especially meaningful and valuable, and  perhaps interesting. With the forthcoming 100th anniversary of  the Chairman's birth, DAXUESHENG has handed out 1,500 copies of  questionnaires to students in 15 colleges in the capital and in  Hunan. Most of those polled were college students born after  1976; the oldest among them were born in 1974.  <H5>  Once a Household Name, But No Longer Common Knowledge Today </H5>   Thirty-four percent do not know his place of birth, 65  percent do not know the date of his birth or death, and 35  percent have never read Mao Zedong's books.    An earth-tone peasant cottage located south of the Chang  Jiang River, surrounded by green hills, and behind the hills,  the red sun is slowly rising: This was a very familiar picture  for every Chinese in the old days. It once appeared in many  newspapers, magazines, and text books. Everybody could tell by  sight that it was the great leader Chairman Mao's home in  Shaoshan [7300 1472], the holy land of the revolution, the place  of the rising sun. This was a widely-known, ever so simple,  common knowledge, just like everybody knows that our homeland is  China and our capital is Beijing, not to mention that countless  hot-blooded youths had at one time come from all directions just  to look at this place for themselves.    Our survey clearly showed, however, that 34 percent of the  "new collegians" did not know Mao Zedong's place of birth. Some  did not have the faintest idea; Some could barely recall reading  or hearing about it, but their answers could not be more wrong:  For example, they put down "Hunan Shaoguan," "Zhaoshan,"  "Shaoshan [4801 1472]," "Hunan Shaoxing," "Hunan Xiangtan  Maojiaping," and so on. One knows not whether to laugh or cry.    Another equally common knowledge is Mao Zedong's dates of  birth and death--26 December 1893 and 9 September 1976,  respectively. Most older people remember those dates, especially  the latter; it was a day engraved on their bones and hearts.  Those who lived through the period say that those days still  leap up vividly before their eyes. Yet, 65 percent of the "new  collegians" cannot recall those two special dates.    Quotations From Mao Zedong, a product of a  specific historic era, was at one time intimately tied to the  lives of every Chinese. It was not long ago that even the very  old and the very young could recite passages from the  Quotations From Mao Zedong. But among the "new  collegians," 8 percent have never heard of it, 49 percent have  never seen it, and 58 percent cannot write down a passage  attributed to Mao. Some are confused and mistake the following  for Quotations From Mao Zedong: "Sailors of the great  seas are dependent on the helmsman"; "fear not ten thousand, but  guard against the unexpected"; and "one statement can refute ten  thousand."    Another notable phenomenon is that among those who could  quote Mao, 43 percent put down such famous revolutionary sayings  as "seize the revolution; promote production"; "dig in; stock  grain"; "never forget the class struggle"; "resort to verbal  struggle, not armed struggle"; "Chen Yi is a good comrade."  While we admire the power of the era of compressed words, we  cannot help but worry: Mao Zedong thoughts are a spiritual  wealth; they should not be simplified, distorted, and even  forgotten so soon.    Perhaps they do not really prove anything. Ignorance of  general knowledge may not hinder deeper understanding of other  concepts. So in our questionnaire, we asked two questions about  the books people read. Similarly, the result leaves us no room  for optimism: thirty-two percent of the students have never read  books about Mao Zedong. Among the books they have read, most  have been published in recent years, including Mao Zedong  Who Stepped Down From the Shrine; Two Sides of the  Red Wall; The Mystery of Mao Zedong and other  historical anecdote-type popular literature, while literary  works by experts and scholars have much been ignored. When  answering the question "Which Mao Zedong essay or poem have your  read?", most students cited works reprinted in text books, such  as "Qinyuan Spring--Snow," "Oppose Party Stereotyping," and  "Changing the Way We Study." Outside of the textbook essays, few  have read such well-known philosophical writings as "On  Contradictions" and "On Practice." Counting those who have  studied and those who have just skimmed through the book, only  141, less than 10 percent, said they have read Selected  Works of Mao Zedong.    Relatively speaking, college students in Hunan know a little  bit more about Mao Zedong than those in Beijing. This naturally  has to do with Hunan being the Chairman's hometown and people  there have a special relationship with him. It is also because  of the geographical location. Reportedly, Xiangtan University  still organizes student field trips to Shaoshan every year, and  there are quite a few "Mao Zedong fans" among the students.    But there is no denying the fact that, overall, this  generation's college students are slowly forgetting Mao Zedong.    Only three years ago, this journal reported on a fad among  the college students--"looking for Mao Zedong." In the  post-strike campuses back then, the students had just emerged  from their perplexed and exhausted state and were beginning to  re-evaluate and to look for their own spiritual support, and a  phenomenon of studying Mao Zedong's works and biographies began  to appear. But college campuses have always been a mobile,  changeable "camp ground"; every year's students have their own  characteristics. Three years have gone by, when these so called  "new collegians" entered college, things have changed. We cannot  help but worry: What will happen to the questionnaires in  another three years, 10 years, or 30 years?  <H5>  In the Minds of the "New Collegians" There Is No God </H5>   Man is man. Why even ask the question?    He had performed meritorious services, but he should never  have criticized Ma Yinchu.    He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if there were  little worms.    Those who lived through the Mao Zedong era inevitably coat  their criticism of Mao with an emotional overtone. The workers  and the peasants, the intellectuals, the "three old graduating  classes" [laosanjie], the red guards, and the "five black  classes"--landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad  elements, and rightists-- people of different professions, from  different classes, of different ages, with different  experiences, and from different family backgrounds have  different emotions about Mao. Except in strict academic studies  or under very formal circumstances, when people talk about Mao  Zedong, they inevitably mix in their personal feelings. They may  worship him or hate him; they may be very critical or lenient;  they may be obedient or rebellious. In short, it seems nobody  can be truly fair or objective.    On the other hand, during the Cultural Revolution, people  once worshipped Mao zealously and almost religiously and took  part in large-scale movements to turn him into a god. This  movement lasted a decade. Its marks cannot be easily erased. It  deeply affected the psyche of every Chinese man and woman, and  even today, in the hearts of many, Mao Zedong is still a  mysterious figure, a "god" that appeared only once every 500  years. This is clearly shown in the way the older citizens put  up, and worship Mao Zedong's picture. Furthermore, catering to  the masses, some tasteless publications have played up idealist  things like The Mystery of 9 September and The  Mystery of 8341, adding to the people's misconceptions. On  one occasion, people cried out in horror that "social opinion  has returned Mao Zedong to the shrine!"    These do not seem to have an effect on the "new collegians."  They are able to assess Mao Zedong more objectively and calmly.  The survey showed that 94 percent of the students thought of Mao  Zedong as a man; some even said they did not comprehend the  question. They said that a man is a man; pure and simple. Why  ask questions? Some put down in the questionnaire: In our  generation, there is no "god"!    They fully accept the magnificent, indestructible things Mao  Zedong had accomplished as the founder of the republic, but they  are not afraid to recount what they think are Mao Zedong's  mistakes. Although some viewpoints may be naive and biased, they  are not blindly following others nor echoing someone else's  viewpoints; they are not quoting the same old cliches.    "Mao Zedong indeed accomplished a lot, but he should never  have criticized Ma Yanchu, there are a lot of people like that  now."    "His mistake was that he did not cleanly walk away from it  all when he should."    "He liberated China, saving 400 million people. He mobilized  the Cultural Revolution, ruining 800 million citizens."    "He forgot that one can conquer the world but one cannot  rule  the world on horseback."    "He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if it has  little worms."    "Stemming from the romantic and idealistic disposition of a  poet, he treated the construction of China as a great poem. But  this is not a poem after all."    These strange and novel ideas of the "new collegians" will  never appear in any official document or history textbook.  <H5>  This Is a Free-Thinking Bunch; We Have Eyes of Our Own </H5>   I most admire his leadership style that embodied the  characteristics of a politician, strategist, philosopher, and  poet.    I admire his ability to swim across the Changjiang River at  age 76.    I do not admire him.    The "new collegians" have no historical burden, no bondage  of  outmoded conventions and bad customs, and at the same time, they  have fine qualities and a good education, and therefore they  have a vivid mind, sharp eyes, unique thinkings, and  unconventional ideas. We became keenly aware of these in the  course of analyzing the questionnaires and during the informal  discussions.    On the question "For what do you most admire Mao Zedong?",  we  received many different answers which fully reflected the  students' vivid minds and their diverse choices. They cited his  military talents--his ability to devise strategies on the spot  and execute commands with ease, his political talents--his  farsightedness and ability to make important decisions, his  personal charisma--his openheartedness and selflessness, and his  powerful, natural literary style and poetic talents.    Some wrote, "I most admire Mao Zedong's leadership style  that  embodies the characteristics of a statesman, strategist,  philosopher, and poet"; "I most admire his sacrificing eight of  his relatives for the sake of the revolution"; "I most admire  his will in resisting outside pressure"; "I most admire his  ability to swim across the Changjiang River at age 76"; "I most  admire his embodiment of the romanticism of a poet and the  strong and sensible spirit of the sons and daughters of the  peasantry." "I most admire his unusual lifestyle."    We separated the answers into general categories, and data  showed that personal charisma, political talent, military  ability, and literary ability and knowledge each accounted for  about 20 percent; there was no special concentration in any one  category.    Meanwhile, some people frankly said, I do not admire him!    This is not an isolated answer. A decade or so ago, this  would have amounted to treason and heresy. Those who uttered  those words could have been branded "active  counterrevolutionaries." Times have changed. We have said  goodbye to the Don Quixote era of making "class struggle the key  link." Although the question of whether Mao Zedong was admirable  should be explored and debated, we must first be willing to  accept different viewpoints. A society that respects choice is a  civilized and progressive society.    A coed at the Hunan Normal University said with  self-confidence, "I have eyes of my own. I use my own eyes to  judge all things, including Mao Zedong."    This is the "new collegian," a rising new generation.  <H3>  We Are Concerned About the Present; We Are the Generation  Holding the Relay Baton </H3>   Mao Zedong made the Chinese people stand up; Deng  Xiaoping made the Chinese people rich.    "Mao Zedong craze" was a reflection of the people's  spiritual  needs in a changing society.    Are economic development and deteriorating social standards  two extremes without compromise?    A Beijing Aeronautical Engineering Institute student asked  us  in all sincerity, "Why are we always quibbling over the rights  and wrongs of our predecessors? Should we not make better use of  the time to get things accomplished instead?"    True, if history is like a relay race, then regardless of  whether those who ran before us were a success or a failure, the  relay baton has been passed into our hands, and the important  thing now is to run our own leg and hand the baton to those who  come after us with a clear conscience. We discuss and ponder  over the successes and failures of our predecessors just to find  out what we can and to learn what can be learned. Our focus is  still on the present.    When talking about the first generation leader, Mao Zedong,  people cannot help but think of the second generation leader,  Deng Xiaoping. In our questionnaire, we asked, "Do you find  anything in common between the two great men, Mao Zedong and  Deng Xiaoping?" On this, the "new collegians" have their own  opinions on the two leaders' politics, strategies, and  personalities: "They were farsighted and brilliant; they refused  to be confined by old conventions and dared to speak what other  people dared not speak"; "they understood China and the Chinese  people very well"; "they were concerned about the people's  pains"; "they each created an era of their own in China. Mao  Zedong made the Chinese people stand up, and Deng Xiaoping made  the Chinese people rich."    On the "Mao Zedong craze" in recent years, the "new  collegians" have different opinions. A majority viewpoint is  that it is a reflection of the people's spiritual need in a  changing society. People are dissatisfied with the adverse  phenomena that accompany reform and open up: corruption, unfair  distribution, poor social morals, the tendency to put money  above everything else, and the erosion of human relationship.  Some people are at a loss spiritually; they know not what to do.  They miss the clean, honest, and simple life of the Mao Zedong  era. Eighty percent of the "new collegians" expressed  satisfaction with today's living standards, but they also  understand the above-mentioned adverse phenomena. Although they  did not experience the Mao Zedong era first hand, they too yearn  for that kind of rich, uplifted spirit. In the survey and during  the informal discussions, they expressed their own dilemma and  thoughts. In fact, they are the same dilemma and thoughts of all  contemporary Chinese men and women. Of course we cannot return  to the poverty, backwardness, and closed society of the past,  but is there no compromise between the two extremes of economic  development and deteriorating social standards? How do we uphold  the mainstream of reform and open up while effectively  eliminating its undesirable by-products?    Perhaps this is where we must "continue to work hard" in our  leg of the race.    When we first put the concepts of "Mao Zedong" and the "new  collegians" together, we felt a sense of professional  excitement. Yet at this point, the pen in our hands has become  heavy. Our thoughts have transcended "Mao Zedong" and the "new  collegians" to travel back to the last century and the century  before and to race ahead into the next century and the century  after that.    Isn't this how the Chinese nationality goes from history to  the future?

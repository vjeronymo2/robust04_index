			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Trade boost for Paris and Bonn France and Germany achieved sharp increases in their trade surpluses last year as recession in both countries smothered imports and more than compensated for falling exports. The French customs office yesterday reported a record FFr87.3bn (Pounds 10bn), double official forecasts. Germany's surplus nearly doubled to DM59.4bn (Pounds 23bn) as imports fell more sharply than exports in the worst domestic recession since the second world war. The French surplus reflected the impact of recession, which contributed to a 10.4 per cent fall in imports to FFr1,091bn. It also showed the resilience of exports which declined by just over 5 per cent to FFr1,181bn despite depressed demand in Germany and the negative effect of currency depreciation in Italy, Spain and the UK. significan Germany exports fell for the year by 10 per cent to DM603.5bn while imports decreased by 14.7 per cent to DM544.1bn, according to statistical office figures. Both imports and exports recorded their sharpest decline since the war. The current account deficit was reduced to DM36bn from DM39bn the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: SPIELBERG RUMORED TRYING TO SALVAGE 'BONFIRE' FILM  </P> <P> "CONSEQUENCES, shmonse-quences, as long as I'm rich," said Daffy Duck.  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD IS roiling with rumors about Warner's movie "The Bonfire of the  Vanities." It was bought and filmed to great hoopla from the famous Tom Wolfe  book of the same name.  </P> <P> Now, those who've seen first cuts of the Bruce Willis-Tom Hanks starrer say  either that it is "brilliant" or "weird." Purists who appreciated the novel  will be in an uproar of dismay. (Well, hell, we already knew that.) And the  final rumor is that Steven Spielberg has been called in to re-edit it. The film  was directed by Brian De Palma.  </P> <P> STEVE FORBES, now the head of the family clan, is settled into Daddy Malcolm's  mantle. He and his brothers will host a big one this Sunday aboard the Forbes  yacht Highlander to honor former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. The focus of  the occasion is again the building of the Reagan Library.  </P> <P> The last time the Forbes boys tried to give this party, Reagan was having brain  surgery and could not attend. He and Mrs. Reagan will be there in person this  time.  </P> <P> RAN INTO the adorable Blair Brown the other day at NBC where she was getting  ready to brave being on the Letterman show. Blair is both glad and rueful that  her series "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" is winding down. The final 13  episodes will be seen beginning in January on the Lifetime Channel. What Blair  liked best about doing "Molly Dodd" was that the work kept her in New York near  her 8-year-old son.  </P> <P> What I can report about Blair, an uncommonly intelligent and sensitive actress,  is that her romance with publisher-tycoon Mort Zuckerman has come to an end  along with "Molly Dodd." Now they'll just be friends.  </P> <P> LET'S GET serious! William Safire wrote of the budget mess and Congress vs. the  President and vice versa: "The current impasse is no cause for national  embarrassment; on the contrary, it is the overdue surfacing of basic political  difference."  </P> <P> Well, OK, Bill -- though I'm not sure the loss of world confidence in the  dollar and the economic blow to U.S. prestige is "no cause for national  embarrassment." I do, however, want to quote a thoughtful and major financial  brain who prefers to remain nameless. He said to me recently:  </P> <P> "Give George Bush more credit and a little time. The so-called budget mess had  to happen. The U.S. economic picture has to grow this dark, this dim, this  threatening. It's the only way, after all the selfish profligate bingeing and  excesses of the '80s. Think of it all as slamming the brakes on at 80 m.p.h.  Unpleasant, but necessary.  </P> <P> "Only really dramatic events could bring us up short to convince us that the  Ronald Reagan free ride is over. It is indeed darkest before dawn. Now we can  get serious and start recovering; now we can get real about taxing and cutting  spending by the government."  </P> <P> THE ODDEST and most endearing book in your bookstores is William Morrow's  "Shirley and Marty," the story of actress Shirley Jones and her wacky hubby,  Marty Ingels. (He is a onetime actor, comic and now an entrepreneur of  celebrity endorsement.) These two have quite an opposites-attract tale to tell.  I loved it.  </P></p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wet winter holds Motor World back An exceptionally wet winter with minimal frost held back progress by Motor World, the car parts and accessories retailer which came to the market in February last year. Pre-tax profits advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.76m in the six months to May 1, but the figures were flattered by lower interest payments. The underlying increase was 5 per cent. Turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 21.5m, with growth reflecting new additions to the chain, which increased from 203 to 217 outlets during the period. A further 25 branches have been opened since the beginning of May, bringing the total to 242. Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, said motorists were less likely to work on their cars in wet weather, and the virtual absence of frost removed the usual seasonal boost to sales of batteries and anti-freeze. However, demand across the group had been improving since Easter and he expected to see second half results benefit from the recent wave of openings. The Bradford-based group is mainly represented in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands. However, it has recently moved into the south-west and has just opened a branch in Welwyn Garden City, north of London. It has also bought an eight-branch chain in the Irish Republic, where it is expected that an MOT test will shortly be introduced. The manufacturing, packaging and distribution division, which accounts for about 30 per cent of sales, had performed well on the back of an expanding customer base and increased sales to continental Europe. Earnings per share rose to 8.7p against a pre-forma 8.1p. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p (2.3p).</p>

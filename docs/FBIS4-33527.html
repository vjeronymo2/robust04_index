			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan Balboa] </F>   [Text] Belem, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Mexico advocated  that the international community intensify its diplomatic  actions for attaining a peaceful and political solution to the  crisis in Haiti and overcoming the impasse in the Haitian  situation. Jorge Pinto Mazal, Mexican undersecretary of foreign  affairs, rejected the idea that the Haitian problem represents a  threat to world peace and security, and he considered that the  only "acceptable" option is a negotiated solution.    The crisis in Haiti has become the most controversial topic  discussed by the foreign ministers at the 24th OAS General  Assembly that is taking place in Belem, capital of Para State,  some 1,650 km north of Brasilia.    Speaking during the sixth session of the OAS Ad Hoc  Commission, Pinto Mazal, who is also under secretary for Latin  America, Cultural Affairs, and International Cooperation at the  Mexican Foreign Ministry, proposed "encouraging commitments that  will allow for overcoming the deadlock in Haiti." Mexico  supports strengthening the international civilian mission, and  he hopes to find the adequate political means for supporting the  efforts of the democratic sectors of Haitian society in a  determined, specific, and solidaristic manner, Pinto Mazal added.    Earlier in the day, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu  stated that the majority of the OAS country members are opposed  to military intervention in Haiti because they consider this  would break international law and would affect the security of  the hemisphere. "Most OAS members are against an intervention  in Haiti to reinstate deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide  in his post," Abreu said during the 24th General Assembly of the  organization. The Uruguayan minister also pronounced himself in  favor of strengthening the commercial embargo decreed by the  United Nations and the OAS and called on all countries to comply  with the blockade to get the Haitian military coupist personnel  to leave.    For his part, Jamaican Foreign Minister Benjamin Clare  agreed  on the need to find paths for a negotiated solution to the  Haitian crisis and said his government will cooperate with the  United Nations to strengthen the blockade against this Caribbean  nation.    The military government headed by General Raoul Cedras is  being subjected to an international blockade and strong  pressures to bring about a return to constitutional order and  respect for the agreements signed at Governors Island, New York,  last year. The penalties, which began to be implemented on 21  May, ban commercial flights to and from Haiti and ask  governments not to allow the coupists officers, headed by Gen.  Cedras, to enter their territories.    The Haitian crisis, Cuba's return to the OAS, the Dominican  elections, and the call to the Summit of the Americas by the  United States are the topics to be studied by the ministers in  Belem do Para until next Friday.</p>

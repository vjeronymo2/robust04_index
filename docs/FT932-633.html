			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Revenue to sue Nissan UK director THE Inland Revenue is to start civil proceedings to recover as much as possible of the Pounds 92m lost in the largest tax fraud in British history. The move follows the conviction on Saturday of Mr Michael Hunt, the managing director of Nissan UK, the West Sussex-based former car importers. He was found guilty on one count of conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 56m corporation tax. Mr Hunt was convicted with a 10-2 majority by an Old Bailey jury. He was acquitted on a similar charge involving a further Pounds 41m. The Revenue will now start proceedings to recover as much as possible of the money from Mr Hunt. Mr Richard Walters, the Revenue lawyer who brought the case, commented: 'Mr Hunt is facing a large tax bill'. He will be sentenced on Wednesday along with Mr Frank Shannon, the company's former finance director who had previously admitted one count of cheating the Revenue. Mr Justice Gatehouse, the trial judge, refused a Revenue request for an order to confiscate Mr Hunt's assets immediately. Mr Hunt, the prosecution said, had personally benefited by about Pounds 30m from the fraud. However, a Mareva injunction to freeze his assets was granted. The trial had heard that between December 1982 and December 1991, freight charges for importing Nissan cars from Japan were artificially inflated by some 40 per cent. A total of Pounds 149m was siphoned out of Nissan UK through a Norwegian shipping agent before being laundered into a Swiss bank account. Unpaid corporation tax on this money amounted to Pounds 56m. When interest over the period is added, the total lost by the Revenue exceeds Pounds 92m. Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon are the only people to be prosecuted over the fraud which, the Revenue claims, involved several others. Mr Octav Botnar, the company's chairman, was said to be the prime mover, but has remained in Switzerland, safe from extradition. Mr Hunt was allowed to return home on bail until Wednesday.</p>

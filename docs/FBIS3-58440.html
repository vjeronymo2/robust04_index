			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  expressed the government's satisfaction with the results of the  NATO summit in Brussels. Venizelos highlighted that Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou had the opportunity, at the highest  level, to detail the positions of the European Union and those  of the Greek Government on the big national issues of Skopje and  Cyprus.    The spokesman regretted the grumbling and fabricated, as he  put it, criticism by the opposition, which is implementing a  strange policy that is out of place following the NATO summit.    In a statement on the results of the prime minister's  contacts in Brussels, New Democracy discussed a lost  opportunity. Political Spring also issued a statement claiming  that the lack of a specific result on the Skopje issue indicates  the prime minister's failure in his meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton. Replying to the New Democracy and Political  Spring statements, the government spokesman said among other  things that the opposition stance unfortunately doesn't match  the circumstances and shows ignorance regarding developments in  Brussels and the relevant diplomatic procedures.</p>

It is a rule that our diplomacy  does not take it into consideration as a warning signal but  rather as an expression of human absentmindedness, the  left-leaning daily PRAVDA writes today.    The author points to the television station CNN, whose  interview with V-4 representatives omitted Slovakia, to the  general surprise. The U.S. daily TODAY, examining the views of  American citizens on the expansion of NATO, even mentions  Albania while again forgetting Slovakia, the daily adds.    The culmination comes with statements by German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and British Premier John Major who, speaking about  the Visegrad Four countries, again omit Slovakia. The author of  the commentary adds that everything has been explained in the  long run -- the Western politicians have mentioned only  countries who have made biggest progress in economies.    Concluding the article, the daily voices hope that Slovak  politicians will at last sober up after Prague and Brussels as  Slovakia will not achieve recognition by shouting, but through  political culture and economic growth.    The independent NARODNA OBRODA turns its attention to the  Brussels NATO summit assessing it as the continuation of the  West's strategy of "not burning its fingers unnecessarily."    Partnership for Peace theoretically gives each state the  hope  of becoming a member of the North Atlantic Alliance by a date  which has not been precisely defined, which means that it  provides them with equal chances, the daily writes.    Moscow is highly satisfied with such a solution as  theoretically it gives it an opportunity to join NATO and  because Partnership for Peace does not much differ from Moscow's  preferences of creating European security structures together  with abiding with bilateral treaties, the daily writes.    "However, the Brussels summit and the preparation of U.S.  President Bill Clinton's Prague meeting with the Visegrad Four  presidents showed that in reality there exists the possibility  of a "two-gear solution" (the incorporation of individual states  in NATO), the daily stresses.    It notes that "Prague has definitively buried the  possibility  of a coordinated course in political and security questions and  that prospects for economic cooperation are growing ever vaguer.    "Naturally all this was bound to provoke the displeasure --  to a greater or lesser extent expressed aloud -- of other  members of Visegrad Four which is currently merely a  pseudo-group. Czech President Vaclav Havel and Premier Vaclav  Klaus have made it unambiguously clear that self-seeking  preference of Czech interests was their primary goal. They do  not want take into account the fact that the Czech Republic is  part of a certain region whose developments will influence the  development of the whole European area, the paper writes.  [passage omitted]    NARODNA OBRODA writes that the fact that British Premier  John  Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Brussels again  omitted Slovakia in their speeches on Visegrad was an almost  sinister signal as far as Slovak membership of NATO is concerned.    "This only confirmed the wide-spread view that the Slovak  Republic, in the year of its independent existence, did not  prove itself sufficiently as regards the transformation of its  economy and stabilizing the internal political situation,  including solution of ethnic minority problems.... Instead of  this we are witnessing constant political floundering and the  fight for a mere survival on the political scene," the daily  writes. "People who might think that the world around does not  register this are committing the worst injustice against the  citizens of this country," the paper writes, warning against  underestimation of a "very serious signal from Brussels."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the limited self-rule agreement that  was signed between the Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo today,  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said: We do not believe this  agreement fulfills all the ambitions we had for the Palestinian  people. This agreement does not spell out clearly the future of  these negotiations nor is it committed to recognizing a  Palestinian state, political rights, or the human rights of the  refugees. He added: proceeding from this premise, we are not  among those who are enthusiastic about or applaud this  agreement. But since the PLO broke away from Arab solidarity  and coordination, which was in its own interests, and since all  we wanted from this coordination was to stress our moral  obligation to the Palestinian cause, all we can do is to wish  the PLO success, despite this agreement's being shamefaced  [khajulan] in terms of its results.</p>

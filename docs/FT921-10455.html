			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: No advice given on landing slots Sir, Your story, 'Commission opposes move to trade airport landing slots' (January 28), incorrectly stated that we advised the Commission that airlines should be allowed to buy and sell the rights to land at European airports. We were asked to report only on practices at US airports; recommendations for European airports were not part of our brief. It has to be borne in mind that there exists in Europe a well-developed and administratively efficient system of allocating landing slots by scheduling committees. In contrast the equivalent system was not working well when the buy-sell scheme was introduced in the US in the mid-1980s. A formal system of trading slots in Europe would require clarification of the right of airlines to buy and sell slots. Evidence reported recently by the House of Commons transport committee suggests that airlines do not have such rights. Of course, slots as saleable commodities are potentially valuable. A possible way forward might be for the authorities to sanction the trading of some slots, thus establishing their book value to the airlines, in return for the release of others for the re-allocation to those wishing to start new services.

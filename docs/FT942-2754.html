			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM sets up division for information superhighway International Business Machines has formed a division to create services for the information superhighway. These will include applications ranging from interactive television to personal communications messaging systems. Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, has identified network-centric applications as an important growth market for IBM. The formation of the Networked Application Services division, reflects IBM's determination to play a leadership role in this emerging field. Initially, the new division will develop services that will become available on Prodigy, a personal computer dial-up information and communications service jointly owned by IBM and Sears Roebuck, on Advantis, a data communications network jointly owned with Sears, and on IBM Networks worldwide. IBM was making large investments in developing these technologies, it said. The new division, which IBM viewed as a start-up venture with large growth potential, would have several hundred employees and operate worldwide. The market for digital network services for businesses, governments, individuals and the home would grow as the power of digital communication wire, wireless and satellite expanded, IBM said. Networked Application Services would develop software to provide intelligent communications capabilities on digital networks. The division draws together several developments under way in different parts of IBM and partnerships that IBM has formed. IBM, for example, is providing equipment and software for interactive television trials with Videotron and Cox Cable.</p>

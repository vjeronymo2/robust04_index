The latest rebel group to establish contact with the ISI in  the Nepalese capital is the United Liberation Front of Asom  (ULFA), according to the sources. This was corroborated by some  ULFA activists who were arrested by the state police for  allegedly taking part in the attack on a police station in  Nagaon district recently. An arrested militant, Gowswami,  revealed his outfit had a base in Kathmandu which was used for  regrouping after the surrender of more than half of its cadres  in March 1992.    According to the Army officials posted in Nagaland and  Manipur, the other outfits which already have bases in Kathmandu  are the Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), the Boro Security  Force (BSF) of Assam and their umbrella organisation, the United  Liberation Front of Seven Sisters, floated recently, allegedly  with the help of the ISI.    The secessionist groups of the Kashmir Valley have been  using  the Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu as their base since the  beginning of 1992. In fact, the ISI managed to push many top  Kashmiri insurgents into India via Nepal. The sources say this  is routinely done to prevent these "important" militants from  being captured or killed by them while crossing over to the  Valley from Pakistan. The modus operandi is simple. The rebels  are trained in Pakistan and brought to Nepal on Pakistani  passports. From Kathmandu they can enter India as Indians  without arousing suspicion.    The Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu is being used as a base.  This is, perhaps, not in the knowledge of the Nepalese  government, unlike the Bangladesh government, sources claim. The  Kathmandu base is a centre of indoctrination, where the ISI's  job is to motivate the rebels of the north-east and provide  logistical support.    The state police officials suspect that the recent spurt in  violence by the ULFA was the result of its senior cadres  regrouping in Kathmandu. They, however, rule out direct  involvement of the ISI in the killing of four policemen in the  attack on the Nagaon police station by the ULFA.    The defence sources also revealed the presence of an LTTE  base in Moreh, a town located on the Indo-Myanmar border, where  over 4,000 Tamilians from Myanmar settled several decades ago.  But the threat from the Sri Lankan outfit is not great as its  strength is negligible, say the sources. What they fear is a  permanent liaison between the LTTE and the NSCN (I-M faction).  "So far, we have no evidence to that effect," said a senior Army  officer.</p>

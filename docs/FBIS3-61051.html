			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank Yu. Gavrya, candidate of </F> technical sciences; Rear Admiral A. Rudometkin; Captain 1st Rank  Yu. Sinchenko, candidate of military sciences; and Captain 1st  Rank (Retired) V. Khyaninen, candidate of military sciences,  under rubric "Time and the Navy"]    [Text] A navy is a specific "attribute" of a state's  political, economic and military activity. History provides many  examples of its deciding effect on the course and outcome of  wars which Russia fought. And in quite recent times, in 1967,  the Navy's presence in the Mediterranean helped stabilize the  situation in the Near East and deterred the United States from  intervening in the conflict on Israel's side. In addition, the  constant presence of our naval forces in politically tense ocean  areas permitted deterring the aggressive aspirations of  individual states (disruption of the attack on Libya and Angola,  prevention of a coup d'&eacute;tat in Guinea and so on). And the  involvement of ships to ensure security of Persian Gulf shipping  during Iran's war against Iraq permitted us to avoid vessel  losses.    Despite the general trend toward a reduction in the threat  of  initiation of a world war, the danger of the outbreak of  military conflicts and local wars presently is preserved,  especially for territorial, economic, ethnic and similar  motives. Preconditions existing in individual regions for the  outbreak of military conflicts and even local wars may be  realized under certain conditions, which is fraught with their  escalation into a large-scale war and with a large number of  states, including those such as the United States and Russia,  being drawn into its orbit.    Unquestionably, the immediate threat of nuclear war has been  minimized, but there remains the danger of its outbreak because  of the presence of considerable arsenals of these weapons in the  hands of a number of leading states and the trend which has  appeared toward their proliferation in third world countries. It  is impossible not to take this into account. The possibility of  a large-scale conventional war escalating into a nuclear war  also is not precluded as a measure which a country subjected to  attack takes in order to respond to actions of an aggressor who  is disrupting the functioning of its strategic deterrence forces.    Russia has no grounds to regard any country or coalition of  states as probable enemies in the international situation which  has taken shape today. Russia also threatens no one: It is  sharply reducing the makeup and changing the structure and  stationing of its Armed Forces and, in accordance with its  defensive military doctrine, is limiting them to the framework  of necessary defense sufficiency.    As applied to the Navy, we take such sufficiency to mean the  makeup, structure and stationing of fleet forces as well as that  status of all kinds of support, command and control and training  systems which meet the level of possible military threat from  maritime sectors. They should guarantee the country's reliable  defense against aggression on the part of possible groupings of  naval forces and of other states in zones from where their  offensive precision weapons can hit important targets in the  depth of our territory.    The buildup by any state (or coalition of states) of  groupings of its forces on the territory of states contiguous  with Russia or of groupings of its naval forces in the  aforementioned zones, as well as the exceeding of an agreed upon  time period for the presence of aircraft carriers and missile  ships in these zones and certain other reasons may become  grounds for categorizing any state (or coalition of states) as a  potential enemy. In our opinion, it must be reflected in Russian  Federation naval strategy that in such situations Russia retains  for itself the right to retaliatory (including also adequate)  operations.    It should be borne in mind that militarily strong foreign  states, above all the United States, are in no hurry to give up  the term "potential enemy." And no small number of examples from  their practical activity today indicates that the direction of  their policy toward force remains unchanged. Thus, new NATO  military strategy does not preclude the option of war over the  Baltic countries against Russia.    It is also impossible not to take note of the fact that  according to a book well known in naval circles, "...From the  Sea. New Direction for the Navy," written by a group of  prominent U.S. naval figures and published in 1992, U.S.  national security strategy openly, and even with clear pride in  its Navy, emphasizes that "national interests require of the  Navy not only performance of the long-range mission of ensuring  strategic deterrence, a powerful military presence on forward  lines, sea control, and reaction to crises in remote areas, but  also conduct of large-scale offensive operations." Moreover: "To  meet national security requirements with the shift in emphasis  to regional problems, construction of new naval forces is  oriented toward increasing their flexibility and might."    Along with external factors which introduce an element of  uncertainty and unpredictability to the Navy reform process,  considerable difficulties also are caused by internal factors,  above all economic and financial. Their influence is felt not in  the last instance in building the fleet--one of the most mobile,  versatile and consequently costly branches of the Armed Forces.    What kind of Russian Navy do we see and what kind of navy  must it become?    It is difficult to overestimate the importance of doctrinal  aims for orienting the direction of naval reform. What kind of  navy the Russian Navy will become and whether or not Russia will  retain the status of a great naval power depends on them.  Unfortunately, a careful study of the published draft "Osnovy  voyennoy doktriny RF" [Fundamentals of Russian Federation  Military Doctrine]&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;  shows that despite recognition  of the fact that an invasion most probably may begin from the  sea, the role of the Navy in repelling it essentially is not  covered; somewhat more attention is given to the involvement of  naval infantry as part of mobile forces, to whom priority is  given in development of arms. But functions of other components  of naval forces are limited to the defense of sea lines of  communication and support of mobile forces. An underestimation  of experience of the last wars and local conflicts such as in  the Persian Gulf, which demonstrated the helplessness of a  defending country without sufficient naval forces to repel an  attack from the sea, clearly tells here.    Such disparagement of the Navy's role as a tool of Russian  foreign policy can undermine the status of a great naval power.  It is apropos here to take another look at the aforementioned  book in order to see the attitude toward the Navy on the part of  the U.S. Navy leadership. The Navy, "operating on forward lines,  supports America's positive image, creates foundations for  forming coalitions, . . . raises the spirit of allies and  demonstrates American might and resolve." Take note: Not the  might of the Navy, but the might of America. And further:  "Operating on forward lines, naval forces inspire friends and  serve as a warning to potential enemies, . . . they deter  crises. . . . We will take advantage of the Navy's unique  capabilities in coastal operations from sea sectors."    The Russian Federation Navy also is a unique, versatile  branch of the Armed Forces, possessing essentially all means of  warfare and their support systems which other branches of the  Armed Forces possess. This permits it to effectively defend a  broad spectrum of Russia's national interests. The high mobility  and combat readiness of naval forces and assets permit employing  it both in peacetime as well as wartime.    According to rules of international law, naval forces are  not  bound by the need to obtain permission from governments of any  state for making a transit to arrive at a destination. They also  are guaranteed access to coastal waters of any country right up  to the limit of its territorial waters. This gives the Navy an  exceptional opportunity to perform its functions, including  peacekeeping functions, in dangerously explosive zones to keep a  crisis from deepening and to stop armed conflict.    The concept of "showing the flag" entered the political  dictionary from naval practice. Frequently this is the sole  method for the legal presence of states' force (usually with UN  sanction) in regions remote from one's own territory. It is more  difficult to introduce tanks and, as experience has shown, even  more difficult to remove them. Only the Navy can perform the  function of defending Russian citizens abroad. It appears to us  that few people will be found in all the world who condemn  America for decisive actions to defend its citizens abroad, when  an entire squadron of ships is sent for the sake of a few  persons to the shores of a country encroaching on their freedom.  True, for this a state must possess corresponding naval might.    Russia's adoption of international obligations for  involvement together with other countries in humanitarian and  police actions and in local conflicts under UN aegis logically  leads to the need to have as part of the Navy (along with naval  forces intended for deterrence and repulse of possible  aggression from the sea) sufficiently large, oceangoing ships  capable of deploying rapidly even to remote tasking areas and  there performing missions with high intensity, often for a  lengthy time. A need also may arise for the capability of  replacing these forces. Therefore, not only naval infantry  units, but also rather large ship forces with means of their  logistic support must be included in the makeup of mobile forces.    It is also impossible not to take account of the fact that  Russia's maritime border is double that of the land border and  that world naval powers continue to build up capabilities of  their naval forces. One would like to believe that the peace and  cooperation of leading states will continue forever, but in case  the situation is exacerbated we must have guaranteed protection  against strikes from sea directions. And only the Navy is  capable of this mission (with appropriate attention to its  construction).    In addition to the above, it should be noted that developing  the Navy as the most complex system of armament saturated with  the most modern equipment lends powerful impetus to technical  progress. Thus, results from special-purpose developments for  the Navy were introduced to the national economy in the area of  heat engineering, radio engineering, radio communications,  atomic power engineering, and underwater equipment and devices  for developing the ocean, including natural resources of the  continental shelf.    Thus it can be asserted that the sphere of Navy activity in  the scheme of ensuring Russia's national security literally  consists of 13 seas and three oceans washing its shores, and  from the standpoint of protecting its interests it consists of  the entire world ocean. It appears the Navy should perform the  following missions:     -  guaranteed deterrence of potential enemies (as part of  strategic nuclear forces) from initiating combat operations by  maintaining combat readiness of strategic naval nuclear forces  and ensuring reliability and safety of their functioning;    -  guaranteed repulse and disruption of aggression from sea and  ocean directions under any situation conditions;    -  maintaining a  favorable operational regime in contiguous and inland seas;    -  assistance to naval units of border guard troops in  performing  their assigned missions of protecting the state border and the  maritime economic zone;    -  ensuring security of our shipping in  various ocean areas and protecting fisheries (animal industries)  and other industrial activity, above all on our continental  shelf;    -  participation in joint humanitarian and police actions  with other states;    -  participation of specially formed expedition  groupings of naval forces (as part of mobile forces) in local  conflicts under the aegis of the United Nations or other  international organizations to keep conflicts from escalating to  large-scale wars.       Summing up what has been said, the conclusion can be drawn  that the Navy's role in the scheme of ensuring Russia's national  security is determined by its contribution to performance of  missions facing the state's Armed Forces, and it must possess a  potential that in peacetime is capable of ensuring Russian  Federation security and protection of its national interests and  citizens in ocean areas by deterring any state or coalition of  states from using force against Russia and its allies. In case  war is initiated against Russia, the Navy must be ready to repel  aggression from sea and ocean directions and deprive enemy naval  forces of the opportunity to conduct offensive operations  (actions) in seas adjoining our territory and in other vital  ocean areas.

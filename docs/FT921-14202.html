			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / Lima 'targeted by terrorists' PERU'S capital is now the prime target for terrorist attacks, according to a Senate Commission, Sally Bowen reports from Lima. Last year, Lima was the object of 672 separate terrorist actions, most by the Maoist guerrilla group Shining Path. Actions in the high Andes, meanwhile, the area that used to be that most affected by terrorism, totalled 640. Terrorist attacks nationwide (1,656 last year) fell almost 30 per cent from the 1989 high, but deaths by political violence stayed about the same - 1,559 against 1,610 in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GALLEGLY VOTE ON ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> It was no surprise that Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) voted against aid  to indigent victims of rape and incest.  </P> <P> It is not a question of cost because the alternative in tax dollars is far more  expensive. It is not a question of morals because who can defend the immorality  of rape and incest?  </P> <P> Rather, it is the official platform of the Republican Party that stubbornly  opposes freedom of choice for pregnant women, even for innocent victims of  crime and debauchery. The bill finally passed, despite Gallegly's opposition,  thanks to many farsighted Democrats and Republicans who formerly voted against  such assistance. Now, in spite of the will of Congress, our self-proclaimed  "kinder and gentler" President has vetoed the measure.  </P> <P> At a recent pro-choice rally in Ventura, more than 1,000 people cheered a  former Republican candidate who said that 73% of Republicans are pro-choice.  This was good news because the Republican majority someday may prevail over the  pro-life Republican reactionaries who have squirmed and bought their way into  positions of power and influence.  </P> <P> DON STEVENS  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Land fuels quest for Hawaiian sovereignty: George Graham on a struggle for nationhood One hundred and one years after the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani by a US gunboat acting on behalf of white sugar planters, native Hawaiians are striking back. Sovereignty for the indigenous people of Hawaii has become one of the most fiercely debated political issues in the Pacific archipelago, and nationalists see signs that success may be within their grasp. A sovereignty advisory committee appointed by Mr John Waihee, the first Hawaiian to win the governorship, has delivered a report recommending a plebiscite - to take place perhaps in June next year - on whether to 'restore a sovereign Hawaiian nation'. That could lead, in turn, to a constitutional convention for the establishment of such a nation, which might include 20 per cent of Hawaii's roughly 1m population. Demands for sovereignty range from autonomy within the state - such as is enjoyed by a number of other American Indian nations over education and policing, for instance - to full independence outside the US. The resurgence of demands for native Hawaiian rights reflects some of the islands' complex divisions. Dominated by white Americans, or haole, until the second world war, Hawaii's political establishment has changed complexion with the enfranchisement of its inhabitants of Japanese, Chinese and Filipino origin. But class divisions overlay the racial splits: for example, Portuguese, who, like many of the Asian population, came to Hawaii as field labourers, are not always considered haole. Although some of the more radical Hawaiian nationalists, such as Professor Haunani-Kay Trask of the University of Hawaii's Center for Hawaiian studies, have often been accused of reverse racism, the sovereignty movements insist on a more inclusive definition of Hawaiian than the state's, which counts only those with more than 50 per cent Hawaiian blood. Of all the archipelago's ethnic groups, native Hawaiians have, since the US takeover in 1893, fared worst. Their life expectancy is five years less than for all other groups in Hawaii and their high school dropout rate is a third higher. They are also the only major native people in the US not to be recognised as at least partly autonomous by the federal government. But the issue is not just one of social neglect or cultural identity. It has much to do with 1.6m acres of Hawaiian crown land held in trust for native Hawaiians who are supposedly eligible to live on it and farm it. Native Hawaiians have received some recognition of their claims on these lands. The state last year agreed to pay Dollars 136m in overdue rent on ceded Hawaiian crown lands to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency set up in 1978 whose trustees are elected by people claiming Hawaiian ancestry. But the OHA, and this settlement, are greeted with derision by sovereignty groups such as Ka Lahui, which declared itself a new nation in 1987 and boasts 23,000 adult members. The OHA says the Dollars 136m payment from the state in no way extinguishes the Hawaiians' land claims, but some state officials have suggested otherwise, and sovereignty activists consider it unlikely that the state government will willingly abandon the trust lands, which make up virtually its entire land holdings. Internal disagreements may have weakened Hawaiians' drive for sovereignty, but Ms Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa, a Ka Lahui activist and colleague of Professor Trask's at the University of Hawaii, retorts: 'Hawaiians are always being compared to crabs in a bucket, all pulling at each other. What I say to that is crabs don't belong in a bucket; they belong on the beach, and Hawaiians belong on their land.' With native Hawaiians making up three quarters of the state's homeless, other sovereignty groups such as Ohana have begun occupying land to press their claims to the ceded territories. The OHA is itself, to some extent, a sovereignty group with 69,000 registered voters, but it is working for the establishment of a Hawaiian nation within the state of Hawaii along the lines of the other native American peoples. 'There is one sovereignty movement, though it may be moving in different directions,' says Ms Linda Delaney, an OHA official. 'Where we do disagree is in terms of what happens to Hawaiian statehood.' She argues that Hawaiians have more leverage within the state, where they make up 20 per cent of the population, than in the wider US.</p>

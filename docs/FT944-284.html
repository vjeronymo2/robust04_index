			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Politics, money and crime: a world on the take - 1994 has seen corruption making headlines across the globe. Andrew Adonis explains why This has been a year of concern about corruption the world over. Gone are the days when developed countries could smugly believe they had outgrown endemic corruption or the Anglo-Saxons that they were not like the southern Europeans and Latin Americans. Three broad categories of illicit practice are evident. The first could be called 'sleaze' - dubious practice on the margins of impropriety, involving relatively small sums and favours. Congressional scandals in the US and the 'cash for questions' furore in the British parliament belong here. In both cases, offenders took advantage of lax rules or found themselves in the darker grey regions of tolerable practice. In the UK, it was not previously clear that MPs should declare all outside income in the Register of Members' Interests, while there was no clear divide between 'acceptable' consultancy fees and 'unacceptably' pocketing fees for posing parliamentary questions. Sleaze is readily tackled by tighter rules and more effective policing, though if parliamentarians and officials feel themselves underpaid, some are bound to seek dubious earnings. The same applies to the second category - corruption associated with 're-inventing government'. As executive restructuring advances, with contracting-out, privatisation and devolution at its heart, new institutions are thrown up without the cultural or regulatory safeguards of the old. France and the UK are the year's foremost cases, France with scandals involving new regional councils and the contracting-out of municipal services, Britain through dubious practices in new state agencies, particularly in the health sector. The moral is clear: it is rash to assume that safeguards against corruption, however deeply embedded in existing institutions (such as the elite national civil services of Britain and France), will take root elsewhere without strenuous inculcation. The third category of corruption - the endemic, enjoying a wide measure of social tolerance and flourishing despite rules to prevent it  - is the most difficult to address. This is because it is the most deeply rooted, and comes in a wide variety of forms. In some cases, such as Japan, the exchange of favours for cash is a common practice. In others, notably Yeltsin's Russia, extortion and racketeering are widespread and the rule of law weak; with dictatorships, the economy often becomes little more than a private fiefdom. Furthermore, the exposure of such corruption often has more to do with a change in circumstances - such as, in Italy, the rise of assertive judges - than with an increase in corruption per se. The past year has shown that where corruption is endemic it is hard to tackle. France, India, Japan, Italy and Brazil - to take the most notorious cases - have seen governments elected with the eradication of corruption as prime objectives founder helplessly, in some cases with 'reformist' ministers - even prime ministers - charged with complicity in corruption. Endemic corruption has an impact outside the countries immediately concerned because those doing business with them are almost invariably sucked in. Strict controls, such as those imposed by the US on its companies abroad, are not panaceas, although Dr Mark Pieth, chairman of the OECD working group on international business bribery, would like to see them more widely adopted. In Africa and Asia-Pacific, it is an open secret that many western companies use local joint venture partners to engage in the bribery needed to win contracts. So what is being done? Where the reliance of politicians on corporate cash has caused scandals, state funding of political parties is a stock response. According to Dr Karl-Heinz Nassmacher of Oldenburg university, such funding has grown 'dramatically' in the past 10 years. State aid can help substitute for big corporate donations, but it rarely gets to the root of the problem, which is the expense of election campaigns. Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, an expert on party finance at Brunel university, says: 'Anti-corruption policies largely focus on management techniques, rather than on limiting campaign expenditure - and therefore reducing the debts which politicians have to pay.' France, where the launch of generous state aid in 1988 did nothing to avert this year's scandals, is a case in point. Where institutions exist - such as the Milan magistracy in Italy - prepared to tackle endemic corruption, the process may start internally. Where such forces are weak, the task is far tougher. In extreme cases, such as Nigeria, all of whose key institutions are generally regarded as tainted, it means starting practically from scratch. Encouraging multinationals to observe codes of non-corrupt conduct is one course. External publicity can also help; so can aid in establishing new legal and administrative systems, particularly with those governments anxious to make a fresh start after democratisation. To the fore in such efforts is Transparency International, a Berlin-based group founded 18 months ago which calls itself the 'coalition against corruption in international business'. Led by a group experienced in aid, commerce and development, TI has no illusions about quick fixes. It is pioneering an evolutionary approach, relying on a combination of judicious publicity, and the promotion of tougher laws, tighter monitoring, and technical assistance. TI's campaign focused at first on five or six governments in developing countries and central and eastern Europe which were prepared to participate. Ecuador has been in the vanguard, restricting tendering for big state contracts to corporations which have signed an anti-bribery pledge. Yet it is a slow process. For as long as bribery is the path to contracts, companies are bound to engage in it. The US is a telling case in point. After cases such as the Lockheed scandal in the 1970s, US corporations are more circumspect than many of their foreign counterparts. But past trauma, and tougher laws, do not explain everything: with the Clinton administration campaigning worldwide on their behalf as never before, the incentive to bribe is reduced. What of those without the clout of the US behind them? 'It's business as normal,' replies one cynic. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

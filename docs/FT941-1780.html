			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Hungary sets EU entry target Hungary will apply for membership of the European Union on April 1, the Foreign Ministry said yesterday. Hungarian officials have said they hope concrete entry negotiations can start in 1997 and that Hungary can be a full EU member by 1999 or 2000. Hungary, whose association agreement with the EU took effect in February, has made joining western institutions such as the EU and Nato its top foreign policy goal. Its application will make Hungary the first former Warsaw Pact country to seek full EU membership.</p>

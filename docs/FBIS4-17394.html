			<p>BFN     [Text] The Tajik opposition leader Akbar Turajonzod argues  that Tajikistan's leadership cannot last even three days without  military and economic help from Russia. He has stressed in an  interview with INTERFAX that Russia could end the civil war in  Tajikistan within a month, if it wished to.    He did not rule out that the opposition might put pressure  on  the authorities in Dushanbe to speed up negotiations between the  various Tajik factions. In his words, he has made this known to  Albert Tchernyshev, a Russian foreign minister's assistant.    He noted that Moscow, on which the fate of Tajikistan  depended in many ways, belittle the significance and role of the  opposition. "We do not want war and bloodshed, even though we  are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he stressed.    To prevent the talks between the various Tajik factions from  being as protracted as the Georgian-Abkhazi negotiations, he  suggested that they should involve the Kulyab clan, which is  represented in all the power ministries in Tajikistan.    He wished that Tajikistan would be a democracy, where the  church be separated from the state.    In his words, the opposition does not intend to advance  Tajikistan theocratically on the threshold of the 21 century.  He believes that Islamic traditions in the republic could be  restored only "by people's will through referendums."    "Even if we come to power through elections, we will not  change such basic constitutional norms as the freedom of speech  or alter the functioning of any parties", he said.    "We cannot understand why Russians are scared by the revival  of Islamic fundamentalism in Tajikistan. That does not  correspond to reality," Turajonzod declared.</p>

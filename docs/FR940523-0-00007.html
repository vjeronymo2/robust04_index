			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 216A(b) of the Act calls for the termination of the alien's conditional permanent resident status during the two-year period if the Service determines that establishment of the commercial enterprise was intended solely as a means to evade United States immigration laws; that the alien did not establish the new commercial enterprise; that the alien did not invest or was not in the process of investing the prescribed capital; that the alien was not sustaining the new commercial enterprise or the investment of capital; or that the alien was not otherwise conforming to the requirements of his or her status. In addition, in light of Congress' intent to prevent further processing of an alien's visa if it becomes known that the alien obtained the money invested through other than legal means, this regulation adds an additional ground to terminate an alien entrepreneur's conditional permanent resident status. Section 216A(b) of the Act provides that if the Service decides to terminate the alien entrepreneur's conditional permanent resident status, the alien shall be notified of such decision and may request a review of the Service's determination in a deportation proceeding. In a deportation proceeding, the Service has the burden of proof to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the reasons for termination is true. Accordingly, 8 CFR 216.3 will be revised to allow for termination of conditional permanent resident status for alien entrepreneurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Petition for Removal of Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 216A(c)(1) and 216A(d)(2)(A) of the Act require that the alien entrepreneur file a petition for removal of conditions during the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status. The final regulation provides that the alien entrepreneur file Form I&hyph;829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions, with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's commercial enterprise. The petition should include the alien entrepreneur's spouse and children, even if the children marry or reach the age of twenty-one during the period of conditional residence. The final rule also permits the spouse and children of a deceased principal alien entrepreneur to file a petition and have conditions removed, if the spouse and/or children can show that, despite the entrepreneur's death, the requirements for removal of conditions have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the final regulation, the Service Center will review the petition for removal of conditions. If the Service Center director determines in his or her discretion that a decision may be made on the basis of the petition and accompanying evidence without the necessity of an interview, the director will render a decision on the petition. If the director determines that an interview is needed, the Service Center director will schedule the alien entrepreneur for an interview at a local Service district office or sub-office having jurisdiction over the alien's commercial enterprise. The district director will then render a decision on the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the alien entrepreneur fails to file a timely petition for removal of conditions or, without good cause shown, fails to appear for a scheduled personal interview, the alien's status will be terminated and an order to show cause will be issued. The Service's decision may be reviewed in deportation proceedings, but, in all instances, the burden will rest with the alien to show compliance with the filing and interview requirements. The Service may accept and consider a late petition if the alien demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances for failing to file a timely petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Decision on Petition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 216A(d)(1) of the Act provides that each petition shall contain facts and information demonstrating that a commercial enterprise was established by the alien, the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital, and the alien sustained the commercial enterprise and the investment of the required capital during the two years of conditional residence. Under 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii), the alien entrepreneur will be considered to have ``sustained'' the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence. This liberal interpretation of the term ``sustained'' permits the Service maximum flexibility in determining whether the requirements for removal of conditional resident status have been met, as well as following Congress' intent to ensure that ``all aliens receiving visas in this section *&blank;*&blank;* continue their new commercial enterprises so that the creation of U.S. jobs and the infusion of capital into the U.S. economy is sustained.'' See S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1989). The Service recognizes that a bona-fide and good faith investment may not, by the end of the two-year period, meet all the expectations envisioned when the alien entrepreneur obtained conditional resident status. The determination of whether the alien entrepreneur has invested a substantial portion of the requisite capital in good faith will be made on a case-by-case basis. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, in determining whether the alien entrepreneur has demonstrated that he or she invested the requisite capital in good faith, the Service will examine his or her intent based on both objective and subjective standards. See 59 FR 1317&hyph;18. The alien entrepreneur has the burden of proof that he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment during the two-year conditional resident period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

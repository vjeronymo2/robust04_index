			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS IN SOUTH GATE END SICKOUT  </P> <P> A two-day bout of "blue flu" among South Gate police officers involved in a  contract dispute with the city ended Wednesday with officers reporting for work  as scheduled.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate there were no emergencies" during the 48-hour sickout, said  Police Chief Ron George, who canceled his vacation and donned a uniform to  patrol the streets.  </P> <P> Neither city officials nor police union spokesmen offered an explanation for  the end of the walkout. However, City Council members were scheduled to reopen  talks with police officers.  </P> <P> The officers, members of the South Gate Police Officers Assn., are asking for  upward of 11% in salary and benefit increases while the city is offering 8%  increases, City Hall sources said.  </P> <P> Detective William Rickert, president of the police union, said the salary issue  has aggravated a long-standing dispute between the officers and the City  Council.  </P> <P> Rickert said the city has failed to keep the salaries of South Gate officers  competitive with surrounding cities.  </P> <P> "We are not asking to be the highest paid. We are just asking for equal pay,"  Rickert said.  </P> <P> Rickert also denied that there had been a formal walkout by the officers.  </P> <P> "I understand some officers called in sick, but there was no formal job  action," Rickert said. "Officers did call in sick but there were off-duty  officers that the city could have called but failed to do so."  </P> <P> While a majority of the 81 officers participated in the sickout to protest the  city's wage offer, crime-fighting was handled by top-ranking police  administrators, a few inexperienced officers and unarmed community service  employees.  </P></p>

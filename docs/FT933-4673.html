			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Quango sets course for teacher training reform A QUANGO is to be created to supervise the training of schoolteachers in England, Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced yesterday. The Teacher Training Agency will distribute funds to universities, colleges and schools that provide approved initial teacher training. The agency will shift the emphasis in teacher training to school-based training and away from college-based courses which many government advisers hold responsible for falling educational standards. At present, universities and colleges receive their funds for teacher training from the Higher Education Funding Council while schools are directly funded by the Department for Education. Mr Patten said that establishing a single funding body would 'ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to the provision of places and an appropriate balance between the different types of training'. The agency will take over the duties of the Teaching as a Career Unit, a quango that provides information about careers in teaching. The unit will be wound up and the agency will become a 'one-stop shop' for information and advice on teaching. Mr Patten also announced abolition of the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, the quango responsible for approving teacher-training courses. Approval of initial teaching qualifications will be given by the department of education to 'reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and clarify lines of responsibility'.</p>

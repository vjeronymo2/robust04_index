			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM to speed up search for EC deal MR JOHN MAJOR will accelerate his tour of European capitals this weekend in an effort to improve the chances of deals' being reached by EC leaders at next month's Edinburgh summit. The prime minister expects to visit six capitals in three days, starting tomorrow, in an attempt to forge a consensus on the future financing of the community and possible Europe-wide economic growth initiatives. He will also want to discuss how Danish objections to the Maastricht treaty can be accommodated. Downing Street officials conceded that it was 'partially coincidental' that visits to the most crucial countries - France, Germany and Denmark - have been left until nearer the Edinburgh summit. They said Mr Major's meeting in Madrid on Tuesday with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, might also prove critical. Spain has put an emphasis on securing 'cohesion funds' for poorer EC countries and is suspicious of attempts to define 'subsidiarity' - the principle of decisions' being made at the lowest possible level of government - which Mr Major needs to sell the Maastricht treaty to Tory Euro-sceptic MPs. Downing Street also believes that the French government, although concerned about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will be supportive in resisting large increases in the EC budget. Mr Major will visit Rome and Athens tomorrow, returning to London early on Saturday. On Monday he travels to Luxembourg and probably The Hague and then leave for Madrid in the evening. He will visit Lisbon on Tuesday. Mr Major went to Brussels on Monday. Trips to Paris, Dublin, Copenhagen and Bonn have yet to be arranged. The prime minister has already phoned Chancellor Kohl in Germany. Mr Major is not expected to visit any capital more than once before the Edinburgh summit. Mr Major is also keen for the summit to discuss the completion of the single market, enlargement of the EC and Gatt. The Commons will begin the committee stage of the Maastricht bill next week.</p>

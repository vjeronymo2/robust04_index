			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors favour UK equity income funds - At a glance Investment in unit trusts last month rose to a net Pounds 773m from Pounds 646m in July but it was below August 1993's net investment of Pounds 981m. Private investors accounted for 55 per cent of the total with UK equity income funds as their favourite. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which released the figures, said that the number of unitholder accounts crossed the 6m threshold for the first time, to 6.04m. The figure has risen by one-third since January 1992 against a background of low interest rates, as private investors have turned to equity-related products in the search for better returns than in the building society.</p>

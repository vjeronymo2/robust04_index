			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Micel Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 15 SAPA -- A potentially explosive  situation was defused in Tokoza on the East Rand on Sunday night  when three abducted taxi commuters were released by hostel  inmates. The hostages were released unharmed after South African  National Defence Force [SANDF] intervention.    Witwatersrand army command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said  the three people were dragged into Hostels One, Two and Three  after their minibus was hijacked at about 3.30PM on Sunday.    Angry African National Congress supporters then marched on  the hostels, demanding to accompany a search of the complexes,  but this was rejected by hostel residents.    Cordons were drawn around the hostels and SANDF  reinforcements were deployed to stabilise the situation, which  was described as "tense but under control".    By 8PM on Sunday crowds that had gathered outside the  hostels  had dispersed and relative calm had returned to the area. The  cordons were removed but SANDF patrols in the area were stepped  up and the situation was being monitored closely, Maj Visser  said.    Early on Sunday morning a SANDF rifleman was shot dead near  the hostel complex. A statement issued by Capt Sonja Nel from  Group 41 said two SANDF members were on their way to the Tokoza  railway station when they were confronted by four unknown men  who demanded to know where they were going and why they were  wearing ANC tracksuits.    The SANDF members replied that they were on their way to the  station and were wearing tracksuits belonging to the force. The  two riflemen produced their SANDF drivers licences to prove  their identities. The four men grabbed one of the rifleman,  while the other soldier ran away to seek help.    A patrol sent to search for the rifleman found him dead in  front of the Tokoza Hostel. His name would be released once his  next-of- kin had been informed.    Meanwhile, the names of eight of the 12 people killed  execution-style by unknown gunmen on Friday night were released  by police spokeswoman Capt Janine Smith. They are Paulus  Nhlapo, 13, Zakele Mvumu, 20, Raymond Kubeka, 20, Freddie  Lehoko, 19, Siphiwe Ngema, 18, Tulani Mthumalo, over 18 years of  age, Colin Nthumalo, 19 and Lucky Poole, 19. The names of the  other four victims will be released once their next-of-kin have  been informed.    Friday night's massacre and Sunday's killing and abduction  raised fears that violence -- which claimed 2,000 lives on the  East Rand last year -- would increase. Until Friday, violence  had abated in the East Rand townships of Tokoza, Katlehong and  Vosloorus since South Africa's first all-race election at the  end of April.    Leaders in the newly-appointed government of national unity  have vowed to end the violence, which has claimed about 15,000  lives since political reform began in 1990.</p>

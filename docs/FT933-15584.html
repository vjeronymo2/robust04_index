			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Graphic terrorists advertisements launched A BRUTAL set of television advertisements graphically depicting terrorist murder was launched yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes. The three advertisements - a scene from one of which is pictured - cost Pounds 373,000. They are to be shown in Ulster to encourage the use of a confidential police telephone line. 'Government must tackle the evil of terrorism by every practical means,' said Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'These films are part of that effort.' Two of the films are so violent they will only be shown after the 9pm watershed. One depicts two weddings. Later one groom murders the other and the killer is jailed. The two wives pass in the street without knowing each other. The second portrays how violence is handed down through the generations. A father is involved in random killings in a bar. Later his son is murdered as his young son looks on. The third shows a tragedy avoided because of the use of the telephone line. Sir Patrick said: 'It is not the government's wish to re-open grievous and painful wounds. But terrorist crime continues to extinguish lives and blight many more.' He added that the campaign was aimed at those involved in or on the verge of committing terrorist acts.</p>

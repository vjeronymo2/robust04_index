			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Aviation talks resume despite US opposition Talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about a new multilateral trade accord, governing civil aircraft, were resumed yesterday despite opposition from the US and Canada. Deep divisions remain between the US, which wants to limit the scope of any new aircraft agreement, and the European Union, which is pressing for a wide-ranging accord to discipline state supports. The talks, originally designed to extend the 1992 bilateral deal between the US and EU on state subsidies to the European Airbus, broke down last December. Just before the end of the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations, the US rejected a chairman's draft accepted by the other 20 or so governments taking part in the aircraft talks. The draft agreement, a revision of Gatt's existing civil aircraft code, would have tightened controls on subsidies for all types of civil aircraft and components, including subsidies via space and military contracts of the type used by Washington. This has met vigorous opposition from the US industry, especially engine manufacturers. It was agreed in December that talks would resume, with a view to conclude an accord by the end of this year. However, the US now argues that changes should be confined to uncontentious amendments needed to bring the Gatt code into line with other Uruguay Round agreements, such as that on dispute settlement. US officials said yesterday that the subsidies accord agreed to in the Uruguay Round, and due to take effect next year, should be allowed to operate before any decision to make specific subsidy provisions in the civil aircraft code. The EU argues that the subsidies agreement is inadequate and wants specific provisions in the aircraft code, partly to put stricter controls on US support for aircraft development, and partly to discipline aid by other governments to their aircraft industries.</p>

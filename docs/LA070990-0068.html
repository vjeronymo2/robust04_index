			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> AXEL BECOMES TUMBLE FOR HARDING ON ICE;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: AMBITIOUS PROGRAM ENDS IN DISASTER, AS DOES HER BID TO UNSEAT TRENARY  AS NO. 1.  </P> <P> As she skated off the ice Sunday at the end of her Olympic Festival routine,  Tonya Harding paused to pick up a flower that a fan had tossed in her  direction.  </P> <P> In a symbolic twist, it had fallen out of its wrapper. The routine had  unraveled much the same way.  </P> <P> Harding's free-skating program, which started out to the theme from the movie,  "Batman," had several "Bash! Boom! Ka-pows!" But not by design.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old skater from Portland turned in a triple all right, just not the  kind she was hoping for.  </P> <P> On an afternoon when she attempted to become the first American woman to  complete a triple Axel in competition, Harding ended up doing a triple tumble  on the Met Center ice.  </P> <P> It was not the kind of hat trick the sellout crowd of 13,973 was used to  witnessing.  </P> <P> Harding recovered from the spills well enough to finish second behind Nancy  Kerrigan. But what about that challenge to Jill Trenary's reign as the top U.S.  women's skater?  </P> <P> Never mind.  </P> <P> Just nine months ago, Trenary's perch at the top appeared to be tenuous. At  last October's Skate America competition in Indianapolis, Harding defeated  Trenary, who was then a two-time national champion and a fourth-place finisher  in the 1988 Olympics in Calgary.  </P> <P> There were many who thought Harding would make it official in February by  taking away Trenary's U.S. crown when the two met again in the National  Championships.  </P> <P> But a week before the competition, Harding contracted an illness that  eventually developed into pneumonia.  </P> <P> Doctors urged her to pull out of the event, but Harding refused.  </P> <P> "I would never have known where I would have come out," she said.  </P> <P> As it was, Trenary won her third title easily, and Harding was a distant  seventh. And in March, Trenary won in the World championships at Halifax,  Canada.  </P> <P> Both women skated at the festival, but only Harding competed.  </P> <P> Trenary, whose next competition will be in four weeks at the Goodwill Games in  Seattle, put on an exhibition Sunday night.  </P> <P> Harding watched. And plotted.  </P> <P> She has quit school and quit her job -- "in the hardware department at Sears"  -- to concentrate on a return engagement in the nationals next February on the  same ice where she left skid marks Sunday.  </P> <P> "Right now I feel that skating is my life and it's all I have," Harding said.  </P> <P> By the time she next meets Trenary in competition, Harding expects to have  accomplished her first triple Axel, an exercise she routinely completes during  practice.  </P> <P> Midori Ito is the only woman to complete the move in competition.  </P> <P> A November event on Ito's own turf, in Japan, just might be the place for  Harding to attempt it again. And when that triple is tried, it may be preceded  by a quadruple toe loop, a move never accomplished by a woman in competition.  </P> <P> For now, Harding says she will work to perfect the routine she has -- one she  has practiced in its entirety for less than two weeks.  </P> <P> "Right now it's hard because I still have to concentrate on what I'm supposed  to do instead of just having it come naturally," Harding said. "But I know it's  a good program for me. I picked the music out myself, and when I'm on, I skate  great to it."  </P> <P> Harding's first fall Sunday, on the attempted triple Axel, came near the  completion of the first of her routine's three parts.  </P> <P> The second portion was to the song, "Send in the Clowns". Smokey Robinson's  "Tears of a Clown" would have been more appropriate. She fell again while  trying a triple flip.  </P> <P> And the last song?  </P> <P> Fittingly, it was "Wild Thing" by Tone Loc, in which she stumbled again during  a triple salchow.  </P> <P> Kerrigan, the gold-medal winner from Stoneham, Mass., turned in precisely the  kind of performance she needed to keep safe the lead she had earned during  Saturday's short program.  </P> <P> It was graceful but conservative. She wobbled after two of her four triple  jumps but saved a fall both times by pushing herself up with a hand.  </P> <P> Kerrigan was fourth in the nationals, narrowly missing an invitation to the  World Championships. Sunday marked her first victory in a seniors' event.  </P> <P> This event was also the seniors' debut of Nicole Bobeck, a 12-year-old from  Chicago who, like Trenary, is coached by Carlo and Christa Fassi.  </P> <P> Bobeck finished seventh, but she was the only skater to bring the crowd to its  feet.  </P> <P> It was a reaction that could have been caused solely by an aggressive  succession and spins.  </P> <P> But the fact that she is 4-feet-10 and weighs 70 pounds also was certainly a  factor.  </P> <P> "I was a little nervous being here with Nancy Kerrigan and everybody big," said  Bobeck, stretching her neck to reach the microphone during an interview session  afterward.  </P> <P> "Then I could hear the crowd and I was really happy. It made me stronger at the  end."  </P></p>

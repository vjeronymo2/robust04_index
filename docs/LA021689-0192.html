			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-AA;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH RUNS PAST SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Huntington Beach High School played four quarters of frenetic, fast-break  basketball and stunned Santa Ana, 89-62, in a first-round Southern Section 5-AA  boys' basketball game Wednesday at Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The Oilers (13-11) will play fourth-seeded Lakewood (21-6), a 70-41 winner over  Alhambra, on Friday. The site will be decided by a coin flip today.  </P> <P> With point guard Andy Thompson leading the charge, Huntington Beach got its  transition game on track.  </P> <P> The Oilers jumped ahead, 10-2, after 3 minutes of play. They hit six of their  first eight shots while the Saints made only one of five shots.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach hit 11 of 21 shots in a furious first half.  </P> <P> "They shot the lights out," Saint Coach Greg Coombs said. "It was very direct.  Get the rebound, take it out, bang, bang, bang."  </P> <P> Scott Drake of Huntington Beach hit 12 of 13 shots to lead all scorers with 24  points. "He was nails tonight," Oiler Coach Roy Miller said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach scored points three ways: quick, fast and in a hurry.  Thompson, who had 14 points and eight assists, continually streaked up court to  lead the Oiler offensive onslaught.  </P> <P> "I love it," Thompson said. "I love to go like that. It's my game. If somebody  pressures me at half court, I've got to take it to the bucket."  </P> <P> Thompson did not slow even after a nasty second-quarter collision with Santa  Ana's Oscar Wilson that had him icing his back and hand to stop the pain.  Thompson said he planned to have X-rays on his right hand after the game.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach never trailed and led by as many as 16 points in the first  half. But the Saints, unable to work the ball inside, went outside and hit  three three-point baskets to come within 42-36 at the half.  </P> <P> Wilson's departure with his third foul 5 minutes into the second quarter  further crippled the Saints inside, and they were ineffective the rest of the  way. Wilson ended the night with five points.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, the Oilers broke open the game, outscoring Santa Ana,  24-7.  </P> <P> "I expected them to have a little more of an inside punch, but I think their  foul trouble hurt them." Miller said.  </P> <P> Chauncey Woolridge led Santa Ana (19-8) with 21 points.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 82, Montebello 76 -- The Barons survived a fierce  fourth-quarter rally at Montebello. Derick Corcoran's three-pointer with 42  seconds left in the third quarter put Fountain Valley ahead, 67-47.  </P> <P> Behind senior center John Brown, who had 32 points, Montebello (18-6) battled  back in the final quarter. After the Barons (19-6) missed their fifth  consecutive one-and-one free-throw attempt, Montebello had a chance to tie the  score but Fountain Valley forward Mike Merli stole a pass that was intended for  Brown. Tom Weaver, who was forced to return to the game after sitting out most  of the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle, hit two free throws with 16  seconds remaining to make the score 80-76 and clinch the victory.  </P></p>

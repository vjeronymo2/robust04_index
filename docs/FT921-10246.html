			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Chairman beset by doubts and dividends: The decisions facing BP's Robert Horton Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, is not the sort of man to bow easily to City pressure. But a combination of a weak oil market, a falling share price and a deterioration in the company's financial situation is forcing him into a corner. He will have to take stringent cost-cutting measures and defer strategic investment if he is to convince investors the company can make a profit at current oil prices. He is not being helped by persistent City rumours of disagreements in the BP boardroom - a rumour strongly denied this week by two of the company's non-executive directors. 'I am not aware of any dissension on the board whatsoever,' said one. BP's share price has suffered in recent weeks from speculation over its poor financial performance, which is likely to be reinforced next Thursday when the company reports 1991 earnings well down on the previous year. The share price closed yesterday down 2 1/2 p to 276p. Mr Horton must also cope with personal unpopularity - among institutional investors who dislike his abrasive manner, and among BP employees fearful for their jobs. The disaffection has even spread to BP's exploration department, traditionally the core of the organisation. Mr Horton's internal unpopularity stems in part from the way he is seen as personally associated with recent redundancies. He instituted the Project 90 reorganisation, aimed at changing BP's corporate culture - and like all reorganisations, it has left some people very unhappy. Another factor is outside his control: his two years at the top of the company have been ones of extremely unstable oil prices. Mr Horton's tenure from March 1990 has seen oil prices as high as Dollars 40 a barrel during the Gulf crisis and as low as Dollars 18 a barrel today. Some at the company blame the current mood on the reorganisation, which was designed to remove layers of bureaucracy from the decision-making process. This makes the company more responsive to market conditions and quicker to react with job cuts and cost-cutting than its competitors. On the other hand, it is felt in BP's operating divisions that they have had to bear the brunt of the cost cuts, while fat remains at the centre. Critics say that the new structure has isolated top management from other employees and that the company lacks firm direction. The company's decision earlier this week to classify its nutrition division as a non-core asset underlines the lack of direction, they say. Mr Horton had declared his commitment to the agricultural interests when he took over two years' ago. In the short term, the City's fears are concentrated on BP's policy of raising its dividend in line with the rate of inflation. When it announces its results next week, BP would have to announce a 0.2p increase in the fourth quarter dividend to keep to the policy, say institutional investors. Anything short of that would be seen in the City as backtracking, they say. And because the fourth quarter's dividend sets the pattern for the coming year at BP, a decision simply to maintain the current rate - though enough, on some calculations of inflation, to allow BP to say it had met its policy  -would be badly received. In fact, as Mr Nick Antill at Hoare Govett, the London-based broker, points out, it would not cost much for BP to raise the dividend. To increase it to 4.3p would cost Pounds 5.5m, a small cost for a company with total cashflow of Pounds 3bn. Cash is not the only point at issue, however: profits are expected barely to cover the 1991 dividend, at best, and may well not cover the 1992 payout. It is this point that lies behind the rumours of disagreements on the board. The company said yesterday, however: 'There is absolutely no substance whatsoever in all these rumours we've heard about rifts on the board over policy or dividends. 'The dividend policy remains to keep up with inflation. That policy has not changed and cutting the dividend is not part of the policy,' the company said. Beyond the dividend, shareholders are questioning the company's longer term strategy. 'They've never been able to demonstrate that they can do anything but find oil,' said one. BP's emphasis on exploration and drilling, he said, made it too vulnerable to swings in commodities prices and unable to withstand downturns in oil prices. Mr Antill said: 'Everyone is looking at the earnings cover of the dividend, but they ought to be looking at the investment policy of the last few years which has been based on an over-optimistic estimate of the oil price and those investments are not making a profit.' Faced with an expected decline in its oil production in the mid-1980s, BP began to buy assets to boost output as well as financing an ambitious exploration programme. But several City analysts argue that these schemes were based on an oil price closer to Dollars 21 a barrel than where it is now - at Dollars 18 a barrel. BP is more broadly exposed to swings in the oil price than many of its competitors and it has based its strategy around a much higher oil price later this decade. This week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Horton urged countries from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to cut production by at least 1m barrels a day at their meeting next week. He said this could boost oil prices closer to the Opec target price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Such a price rise is unlikely, however; that Mr Horton should advocate it in such a public way underlines the pressure the company is feeling from low oil prices. For all the rumours, Mr Horton's position within the company seems secure. There are no signs that shareholders want a management change. Institutional investors say Mr Horton is an effective manager who deserves the credit for reorganising decision-making to create a more effective company, at the risk of undermining his own authority in the process. And, as one senior employee said yesterday: 'Horton has to make some harsh decisions. Whoever applies the pain is not going to be popular.'</p>

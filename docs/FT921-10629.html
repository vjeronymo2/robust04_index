			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares struggle in a nervous market ANOTHER nervous session in the UK equity market yesterday saw share prices struggling to hold on to their current levels as investors focused increasingly on the investment climate on the other side of the Atlantic. Once again, the London market bounced successfully after testing the FT-SE 2,550 area, but shares were drifting lower again at the close. Trading volume remained disappointingly low and there were fewer special situations to provide highlights. London's nervousness regarding Wall Street increased when the Dow Average reacted cautiously in early trading yesterday to Congressional testimony on the economy from Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The Dow remained five points higher when London closed for the day but the Standard &amp; Poor's futures came under pressure. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull pointed out that the US market is facing a serious testing point, as both the Dow itself and its near term moving average challenge the longer term (21 day) moving average. The testing time could come on Friday when the latest US labour statistics are due. It was against this general background that the London market refused to respond to the 10.73 gain in the Dow Average overnight. After moving ahead only very briefly, the UK stock market turned off as the stock index futures market again provided little support. The FT-SE Index was soon down by 11.6 at 2,548.6 and traders waited nervously to see if the 2,500 mark could be regained. The big institutions continued to play a wary game, picking up some stock where it suited them but not showing their hands across the range of the market. However, selected demand for a handful of Footsie stocks enabled the market to rally and to move into positive territory again, but only for a short time. Investors backed away in London as the time for Wall Street's opening drew near. With the early 12 point gain on the Dow cut back sharply by the time London closed, UK stocks turned down in later trading, brushing off an upward squeeze in the stock index futures. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,556.8 for a net loss on the day of 3.4 points. Among the international blue chips, which are traditionally vulnerable to Wall Street's influence, activity in the pharmaceutical stocks died down. BAT Industries remained firm, with London traders reporting that potential buyers were still attracted by the prospect of increased tobacco sales in eastern Europe. Trading volume, as traded through the Seaq system, totalled 468.8m shares, compared with 414.8m in the previous session. But statistics from the Stock Exchange showed that retail, or customer, equity business on Monday fell to only Pounds 744.6m, more than 20 per cent down on some recent trading sessions. Traders were convinced that retail business had remained relatively thin in yesterday's session. Currency uncertainty also acted as a brake on UK equities, with UK analysts unsure how to react to the wage agreement struck by some German steelworkers. While a further cut in UK base rates is still widely expected before the general election now expected this spring, over-optimism was discouraged yesterday by a dip in the sterling/DM rates.</p>

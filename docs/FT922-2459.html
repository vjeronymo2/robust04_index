			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK buy-outs Anglian and Taunton Cider can obviously be accused of returning to market with indecent haste, respectively within 18 and 13 months of being purchased by their managers. But the speed with which these two companies have been readied for flotation surely says something for the success of the management buy-out phenomenon. A more interesting question for investors - given that these two, MFI and Kenwood Appliances currently make up a highly unusual MBO quartet - is whether such companies can retain sufficient motivation to provide attractive stock market returns. The large quantity of debt taken on by many MBOs is often seen as hampering access to capital - but as the MFI team will testify the balance sheet structure provides a powerful incentive for operating efficiency. Taunton's interest costs jumped from just Pounds 190,000 in the year before its buy-out to almost Pounds 10m last year - a burden which no doubt helped spur a full 2.8 percentage point improvement in margins. Relieved of some of the pressure by new capital from investors  - and personally enriched in the process - is there not a temptation for management to sit back and relax? A glance at the unweighted performance of the 27 MBOs floated since 1988 - and still retain their listings - suggests otherwise. On average, they have outpaced the market by 17 per cent, with the five biggest collectively outperforming the All-Share by 57 per cent. Perhaps this should be no surprise. MBO teams that survive the ordeal are likely to be sharper than many run-of-the-mill public company boards, while the advisers generally make sure they and their employees have a continuing stake in the business. The buy-out process, it seems, creates a momentum of its own.</p>

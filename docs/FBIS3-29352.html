The letter, addressed to Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign  minister, also called for a third round of high-level talks  between the United States and North Korea, informed sources  said. They said the letter was handed to Ho Chong, North Korean  deputy ambassador to the United Nations, when the two countries  had a working-level contact in New York Tuesday, shortly after  North Korea said it would accept inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    No further details on the letter were immediately available,  but other sources said it was written by Robert Gallucci,  assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs.  He asked Kang to prepare for the third round of U.S.-North  Korean talks at an early date, they said.    Meanwhile, South Korea and the United States plan to  announce  suspension of the joint military exercise "Team Spirit," after a  team of IAEA inspectors arrives in Pyongyang and North Korea  resumes dialogue with South Korea.    At the same time, Washington will announce an exact  timetable  for the third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang, the  sources said.    Diplomatic sources in Washington and New York said an IAEA  inspection team will arrive in North Korea early next week at  the latest to check all seven reported nuclear facilities while  an inter-Korean contact will also be made. Therefore, chances  are high that South Korea will announce suspension of the Team  Spirit exercise next week, they said.    As for the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean  talks,  they may be held in mid-march after the IAEA team completes its  inspection and South and North Korea exchange special envoys.  But the date for the U.S.-North Korean talks may be announced  as soon as the IAEA inspection gets under way, they said.    The sources said everything will go smoothly once North  Korea  expresses its intention to resume dialogue with South Korea,  indicating that problems related to inter-Korean talks are the  crucial factor in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

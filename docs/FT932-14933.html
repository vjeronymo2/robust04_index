			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Venture-backed companies upbeat COMPANIES which have received financial backing from the venture capital industry have performed well over the past six months and are very optimistic about future prospects, a survey has found. The British Venture Capital Association found that 79 per cent of venture-backed companies expect sales to increase over the next six months while 49 per cent expect profit margins to improve and 33 per cent expect their average selling prices to rise. Forty-eight per cent expect to increase the size of their workforce. The survey of just over 200 companies carried out last month was the first of what is intended to be a six-monthly review of business trends among companies backed by venture capital. In the preceding six months 61 per cent of companies surveyed reported higher sales, 49 per cent increased profit margins and 30 per cent higher average selling prices. A total of 42 per cent increased the size of their workforce. Asked which change in the business environment which would benefit their company most, 59 per cent of respondents said a recovery in economic confidence, while 14 per cent mentioned lower interest rates. A lack of demand for their products or services was given as the principal obstacle to taking on more employees by 46 per cent of businesses, followed by 16 per cent which mentioned wages and other costs. Forty-one per cent of respondents said they expected to need additional finance in the next six months. Of these, venture capitalists and the banks were joint favourite sources of funding and each was mentioned by 59 per cent of respondents. The Sensor, BVCA, 3 Catherine Place, London SW1E 6DX.

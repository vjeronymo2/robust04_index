			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Northern League's position remains crucial.  Yesterday evening [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi set out  his conditions [for joining a government coalition] on the spur  of the moment. Mariano Squillante reports from Northern League  headquarters where a news conference is underway. Mariano, what  has Bossi said?    [Squillante] The news conference ended a few minutes ago.  Bossi said that over the next 24 hours he would contact people  and start negotiations with the two other components of the  Freedom Alliance, which won the elections. Let us hear what he  says in this short excerpt:    [Begin Bossi recording] The alliance must now say and  forcefully spell out that it is more than just the sole  political force which can govern this country. This is valid not  only for Forza Italia but also for other political forces. I  mean, the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has lost no time in  becoming the National Alliance, and we would like to know -- we  will try to understand -- if the party itself has actually  changed. [end recording]    [Squillante] [passage omitted] He said that only the League  has the moral right and the political unity needed to conduct  negotiations to form a government, while Forza Italia and the  National Alliance cannot be trusted in that they are unknown  quantities. He has once again given the thumbs down to Silvio  Berlusconi as prime minister, saying that he would prefer the  Northern League's Roberto Maroni.    Meanwhile, Francesco Speroni has put himself forward as a  candidate for the post of speaker in the Senate. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST START IN YEARS PROPELS UCLA TO FIFTH IN NATIONAL BASKETBALL POLL  </P> <P> Jim Harrick promised stability when he became the sixth man to follow John  Wooden as UCLA basketball coach. He is delivering success.  </P> <P> The Bruins (7-0) are off to their best start since Wooden quit winning national  championships in 1975, and they are ranked fifth in this week's Associated  Press poll.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, I think we were 45th," Harrick said Monday. "That's probably  the best part of it -- where we were and where we've come to."  </P> <P> The Bruins haven't been ranked this high since the next-to-last poll of the  1982-83 season.  </P> <P> The top four teams -- Nevada Las Vegas, Arkansas, Syracuse and Arizona -- are  unchanged from last week. Georgetown fell from No. 5 to No. 12 after losing to  Texas El Paso, 71-60, on Saturday.  </P> <P> Las Vegas (3-0), a 95-75 winner over Michigan State, got 61 of 63 first-place  votes and 1,573 points. Syracuse, which beat Cal State Long Beach, 94-79, and  UCLA, which beat DePaul, 92-90, got the other two first-place votes.  </P> <P> Rounding out the top 10 after UCLA are Indiana, Ohio State, North Carolina,  Duke and LSU.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Skokov, chairman of the Federation of </F> Russian Manufacturers, by Aleksandr Gagua, under the rubric  "Position"; place and date not given: "Manufacturing--the Last  Line of Defense of the State: Yuriy Skokov Believes That Less  and Less Time Remains To Rescue the Economy"]    [Text] Yuriy Skokov, the former first deputy prime  minister and subsequently secretary of the Security Council of  the Russian Federation, is currently chairman of the FTR  [Federation of Russian Manufacturers]. The FTR consists of the  League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Agrarian Union, the  Union of Labor Collectives, the Russian Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, the Union of Oilmen, and more than 50 regional  associations. The Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the  Association of Russian Banks take part in the operations of the  FTR on a permanent basis.    [Skokov] Let us recall that reform, on whose account many a  lance is now being broken, began after everyone came to the  conclusion that the conditions of our lives had to be changed,  and a new economic foundation had to be laid which would make it  possible to guarantee some kind of social opportunity to all  strata in a socially more equitable manner. The idea of economic  reform appeared at that time. It has now been more than two  years since the beginning of the reform was announced. What  results have we achieved? Having discussed this problem at a  recently held congress of the Federation of Manufacturers, we  came to the conclusion that in reality there have been no  reforms as such. A process of a kind of rearrangement in  economic operations and economic management procedures has  occurred in an absolutely spontaneous manner. As a result of  this, we have not arrived at anything intelligible anyway.    Indeed, we had one system of manufacturing which kept demand  and supply, incomes and expenditures, in balance by command and  administrative methods, and we wanted to live under a different  economic system which would maintain the equilibrium of demand  and supply by qualitatively different methods. Interaction  should be different under this new system, enterprises should be  managed differently. The role of the federal authorities becomes  completely different, and the regional authorities get another  role. The roles of the collective itself and the enterprise are  new; mutual relations between individual participants in the  entirety of the production process are different; the nature and  principles of investment are different, as are the methods of  assessing effectiveness--everything is different. All of these  should have emerged in the process of reform. However, different  in what sense? To date we do not have an answer to any of these  questions. When discussing this topic, we also discussed another  one: At present, no government is in a position to correct the  situation by acting in isolation, as a separate entity.  Processes have gone too far; old possibilities and methods for  influencing the behavior of both enterprises and regions have  been destroyed. If a reactionary government of some kind  suddenly wished to go back, it would be fraught with serious  dislocations, just as serious as the current ones.    At the same time, if we fail to see clear-cut methods for  reform we will be continuously wandering around in the dark,  eating away at the national heritage we got from our fathers and  grandfathers. At the congress we came to the conclusion that we  should not wait for the government to resolve anything. We  believe that at present the government is, in principle, not in  a position to say how each element in the system should operate.  We should do this ourselves. For this reason it was resolved  that we should create a self-organizing, self-reforming system,  but in cooperation with the government and other federal power  structures. We resolved that we would support Chernomyrdin, that  at present the head of the government should not be changed. We  should help the prime minister and support the government at  this difficult stage. Look at the programs of all the parties  and movements. There is little difference between them. These  are mostly declarations. This is why, no matter what new  government comes along, it would hardly be able to put forth a  clear-cut program of real actions. We agreed that in supporting  the prime minister we will cooperate with the government in  searching for solutions to our common problems. I was instructed  to meet with Chernomyrdin and bring to his attention everything  that we discussed at the congress. We agreed there that  manufacturing remains the last line of defense of the state.    If manufacturing is ultimately destroyed it will make no  sense to talk about reforms because the form which is to be  changed will no longer be there, nor will there be any economic  foundation for advancement, for ensuring social guarantees, and,  most importantly, for preserving statehood and society as such.  There will be nothing to talk about as far as the defense of  human rights in its broadest interpretation is concerned--that  is, the very point in the name of which all reforms began.  Therefore, the defense of manufacturers at present is, in  essence, the defense of human rights, of society and the state.  I brought all this to the attention of Viktor Stepanovich. We  discussed possible forms of cooperation and methods of  interaction. Our long discussion proceeded in an atmosphere of  mutual understanding. We agreed to meet with him after the  completion of the procedure of forming the government in  conjunction with the appearance of a new parliament and to  discuss the details of this endeavor. I would like to note at  the same time that the New Regional Policy faction of deputies  has been created in the State Duma (I think that about 70 people  will belong to it). It is headed by Vladimir Sergeyevich  Medvedev, president of the Union of Oilmen--one of the founders  of the FTR; Medvedev personally is a member of the presidium of  the federation. We want to cooperate with this group in  developing and implementing the necessary regulatory acts to  ensure the defense of domestic manufacturers.    Incidentally, while opening the State Duma, Viktor  Stepanovich put forward a thesis concerning support for domestic  manufacturing.    [Gagua] Many people attribute the recent leap in the  exchange  rate of the dollar to inflationary expectations associated with  the promise of such support.    [Skokov] We have gotten used to juggling words to such a  degree that we have stopped pondering the essence of what we are  saying. Many financial and economic programs have become a topic  for politicking individuals attempting to solve their own  problems by supposedly discussing financial and economic issues,  rather than a subject for a search for professional solutions.  As far as I understand it, Minister of Finance Fedorov, who is  to a great degree to blame for the country ending up at such an  impasse but who is quite ambitious and categorical in his  judgments, is engaged in an active struggle with Chernomyrdin  because he very much wants to become chairman of the Central  Bank (as one of the newspapers justly said recently, he is one  of the few ministers who ignore the edicts and decisions of the  president, which is impermissible in a normal society). I think  that this would bring about a catastrophe. I know Fedorov well;  I worked with him in the Silayev government, and I can say  confidently that he does not quite understand what the state  budget is and does not know how to draw it up expertly.    In talking about the exchange rate of the dollar, I would  note that the exchange rate emerges in the following manner  (this is a somewhat simplified pattern, but in view of the fact  that we are talking for a newspaper, let us spend some time on  it). My country trades with another country. In order to be able  to trade I must have the currency of that country in order to  buy its goods. The other country should have my currency to buy  my goods. The essence of the exchange rate is found in the  relationship of the foreign trade balance of your country to the  10 or 20 countries with which you trade. Indeed, currency  markets exist in all countries; however, they appear on the  basis of the need to service foreign trade, foreign economic  activities, and the exchange rate on these markets evolves  depending on the balance.    In our last interview I told you that, for example, the  gross  product of 15 trillion [rubles] in 1992, if converted at the  1:650 exchange rate of the dollar at the time, made it possible  to say that we produced a gross product of $23 billion. If we  divide this by 150 million inhabitants, it will fall short of  $200. This is less than Ethiopia. In terms of volume, it is less  than all of our exports--$38 billion--and less than the volume  of the natural production of coal, oil, and gas converted to  world prices (more than $200 billion). This is what the exchange  rate in our country is all about.    Until recently, a game was on--systematic currency  interventions were carried out (this was done by the Central  Bank and the Ministry of Finance through their institutions) in  order to artificially support the exchange rate and thus  demonstrate the supposedly favorable state of affairs in our  economy. Commercial structures engage in speculation on the  currency market because playing on the exchange rates of  currencies is the most profitable endeavor at present. All this  is a very complicated process, but it has got nothing to do with  civilized economics. We do not have regular foreign economic  operations, and we absolutely lack a clear notion of the value  of our currency against other currencies. This is why I would  like to stress yet again that in our country the exchange rate  of the dollar has become an instrument of politicos and a  subject of very major, large-scale operations. This is a channel  and an opportunity to launder dirty money both within our  country and in the West, a bridge which may allow the economic  expansion of any group from the other side here (time and  technique are all it takes).    Our rich have become rich not because they have created  material production within the country. They purchased in the  West, very cheaply, goods which for various reasons were not in  demand there and sold them here at sky-high prices. The market  is filled with these goods. Meanwhile, there are no domestic  goods. In this situation the exchange rate of the dollar indeed  becomes a weighty inflationary factor. However, this is an  artificial situation, and I would not venture a judgment as to  whether it was created out of confusion or purposefully.    [Gagua] What do you propose?    [Skokov] The FTR has developed quite a number of  comprehensive proposals for overcoming the crisis in our economy  and rescuing production. For the time being, before our second  conversation with Viktor Chernomyrdin, I would prefer not to  discuss it. However, after the meeting I will be prepared to  share with the readers our plans--if it works out, joint plans  with the government.    [Gagua] However, support for manufacturers means new credit  and, consequently, a new cycle of inflation, does it not?    [Skokov] The proposals developed by our federation do not  discuss massive injections of state credit. The government and  the Central Bank simply do not have that kind of money. The  discussion is about a system for interaction between enterprises  in the regions and between regions, changes in the tax and,  generally, economic environment which would make it possible not  to drive up the price of domestic goods and, therefore, to  contain the growth of prices for imported products which scares  our consumers so much on a daily basis.    After all, inflation expressed in the growth of prices is  caused by a disequilibrium between supply and demand in the  domestic market. The people do not even give a thought to how  such inflation is evaluated. A basket of consumer goods is  taken, and a price index is established on its basis. For  comparison, in the United States a basket of 300 products is  used. However, at present 30 percent of the population cannot  afford to buy even our basket with 19 products in its entirety.  Another 50 percent merely fit within the framework of this  basket. At present, we do not have effective demand at all. The  entire problem lies in the fact that domestic manufacturing has  come to a halt; the market is barren--there are no domestic  goods; our manufacturers cannot produce either cheap popular  goods or goods competitive on the world market. After all, our  economy was so designed that, in the environment of the  decontrol of energy and raw material prices, no producer of ours  is in a position to manufacture cheap goods. The resource market  and the merchandise market have been severed. Meanwhile, in a  market economy, this is the foundation for building the model of  circulation of products, goods, and profits.    [Gagua] In both our country and the West the departure of  Gaydar and Fedorov is now being interpreted as a rejection of  the reform course, which they symbolized for many people. What  do you think about this?    [Skokov] I very much regret that in my time I did not  succeed  in talking President Yeltsin into distancing himself from the  government. When he assumed leadership of the government in  1991, he may have been right: It was necessary to "shield" a  sharp change in the course with his authority. However, later,  in November and December 1991, we had repeated discussions to  the effect that the president should not head the government.  The government may be changed many times, whereas the president  is the head of state and leader of the country. However, it was  very advantageous for the people in the government to hide  behind the president. They did all they wanted while bearing no  responsibility for it. Please recall this: If there is no  Gaydar, there will be no $24 billion. So, they retained Gaydar  at the Sixth Congress. Did the $24 billion come along? No, it  did not. The next slogan was: The presence of these people is a  guarantee of reform. However, everyone now understands that  there is no way back. There is virtually no one who could say: I  want to go back, to the old conditions. Even if they say this,  it is just out of desire to regain the lost feeling of  confidence, stability, and tranquility. Nobody wants to be  ordered about, hurried along, or commanded.    [Gagua] What do you mean by economic management?    [Skokov] This question cannot be answered briefly or  succinctly. Let us recall that previously the entire national  economy amounted to something like a huge plant. The government  operated on a certain pattern, saying who should produce what  and how much, where to ship it, and who would get how much for  it. In essence, the director of a plant had the same management  structure. The government had the same functional and sectoral  subdivisions and reception methods: which shop was to produce  and what, and where it was to be built so that it would be able  to fit into the general pattern of operation of the huge plant  called the national economy. We did not have a regional policy  as such because the entire structure of the national economy was  patterned on the sectoral principle. Each region had up to 90  percent of purely sectoral enterprises reporting to the Union.  When these industrial enterprises received something from on  high for their development, the regions also got a cut for  social programs. Previously, we had an industrial policy, and  regional policy was its appendage. Under current circumstances,  now that social responsibility in its entirety has devolved on  the regions, regional policy is becoming the centerpiece, and  industrial policy must be worked out in a very rigid correlation  with regional policy. The sectoral principle for the formation  of the economy has almost disappeared. At any rate, the  possibility of handing down commands from the top has virtually  disappeared. What does manageability of the economy mean? As  defined by the originators of the theory of management,  management is a command transmitted to the recipient with a view  to effectively influencing him.    Previously, I could give someone a command because I said in  the process: There are so many goods in the oblast; to this end,  you will receive this quantity of resources, an opportunity to  draw wages and centralized capital investment for the  construction, expansion, or upgrading of your plant, and this  amount of funds for social facilities. Your region will receive  this much. I cannot give commands like this anymore. How can I  give an order to some plant? It will respond: Since you are  giving me an assignment to manufacture this quantity of  products, give me material resources. The government will say: I  do not distribute resources at present. We have a market system  now. Well, fine, give me credit resources based on 20 percent of  the discount rate. The government will say: Of course, but only  at 220 percent. But I can buy them at a commercial bank for 230  percent! It makes no difference whether it is 210 or 250. This  is short money, which does not make it possible to do anything,  to even exist--for a small business or any other. Just  yesterday, licenses and quotas were sought. However, at present  domestic costs denominated in rubles are so high that, according  to the calculations of an institute of the Academy of Sciences,  the cost of one tonne of oil in Tyumen comes to $95-96, and this  is commensurate with the producer cost of extraction. In  addition, there is transportation, taxes, and duties! Therefore,  even selling raw materials is becoming unprofitable now. It  turns out that only one thing is profitable now--stealing  something and selling it.    Therefore, the issue of manageability cannot now be restored  in its old form. On top of this, regionalization ushered in a  different situation whereby the federal government is running  into a great many problems in each region. These problems were  created by the Gorbachev-Pavlov government in its time when it  proclaimed that all social programs should be solved at the  regional level. However, the regions should have money and  resources for that. Where are the regions to get this?  Maneuvering begins, along with attempts to evade taxes, retain a  considerable proportion of funds, and thus get an opportunity to  influence the behavior of enterprises. After all, nobody knows  now what to do about the social infrastructure "burdening"  former state enterprises or the still surviving state  enterprises. The problem of a transition from centralized  management to complete decentralization is becoming fundamental.  The war between the federal and regional authorities over  whether the budget is to be relinquished or not is a nonsensical  war. A fundamentally different pattern for the formation of  manufacturing, merchandise-distribution, and financial-support  structures should be sought.    [Gagua] In other words, you believe that having destroyed  the  old system, we cannot obtain a new one by betting on it arising  out of processes of self-organization?    [Skokov] I can repeat my opinion: We cannot leap from one  condition to another; it is impossible. We need to build a new  system gradually. When I proposed the creation of state  intersectoral industrial associations with their withdrawal from  ministries in 1987-1988, it was, in essence, a timid attempt to  create financial-industrial groups or financial-industrial  corporations. At the time, the idea of the first commercial bank  appeared; it was devised to be a hub, a center for external  investment policy. However, this concept did not gain support.  What was the idea of that period? At the time, we had  approximately 200 different ministries and departments which  turned to the government for particular types of resources. We  calculated, proceeding from the number of enterprises and a  certain model of such financial-industrial groups, that  approximately 300-400 banking structures had to be created which  could become the nuclei of financial-industrial groups. A few  tens of thousands of industrial enterprises could be assigned to  the banking structures for servicing, 10-15 enterprises to each.  In this manner it would be possible to evade the direct  administrative impact of ministries and to connect to the  government directly, while not increasing the number of clients  served by the government.    They are now trying to revisit this procedure. There is  discussion of creating financial-industrial groups or  corporations. However, at present financial and industrial  capital are isolated. For example, I have money and want to  protect it. For this reason, when someone in possession of  industrial capital says: Give me your financial capital, and we  will unite, I say: Give me no less than 20 percent every month  so that I will be able to protect myself against the 240 percent  (the discount rate). I cannot do this in principle because, if I  begin to manufacture and subsequently sell products, I need at a  minimum three to four months, as dictated by technology. That is  to say, I will generate profits in three to four months.  Besides, taxes are so high that I will be left with nothing.  Therefore, it is quite difficult to establish a management  structure at present, but there still is a chance, if the  government grasps that it should sit down with the manufacturers  and agree on how to act rather than apply pressure, give orders,  and smash heads.    [Gagua] What does the federation you head mean by  "protecting  the rights of manufacturers?"    [Skokov] Let us talk about rights. Yesterday, the right to  work was laid down in our Constitution. At present, it is laid  down that labor is free. You work if you want to, and you do not  if you do not want to. The state guarantees nothing. It merely  says that labor is free. How was the right to labor exercised  yesterday? The state had the right to assign a plan to its state  enterprise, and this plan was balanced. The enterprise received  resources in keeping with this plan; however, at the same time  it was obligated, having brought in the people, to provide work  for them and guarantee the level of wages established by the  state. Therefore, the right to labor was exercised through this  complex chain. This is not the case today. At present, any  director may, in principle, fire even the entire work force. If  directors go for it, there will indeed be a social explosion. At  present, there is a discussion about our people being patient.  However, there has been no explosion also because the old corps  of directors, which retains old notions of their ethical  obligations and civic duty, is now dodging, hustling, and trying  to pay so-called wages while enterprises are virtually not  operating. These are not wages but rather unemployment benefits.  This is hidden unemployment.    The question is: Is the state currently in a position to  absorb unemployment, which Fedorov advocates so much, reporting  with pride that next year we will have 10 million unemployed? At  present, the state does not have a system of unemployment  benefits and social protection. After all, in the West this is a  complex, well-conceived, and proven system. This is why  protection of the rights of manufacturers is a quite difficult  issue. What is "the rights of manufacturers" supposed to mean?  All Western governments must protect their manufacturers,  primarily by either allowing or not allowing outside goods onto  the domestic market. The government assists its entrepreneurs in  placing their goods on the foreign market through certain  procedures, customs duties, taxes, and the like. Meanwhile, in  our country the doors are wide open, and domestic manufacturers  and the internal market have no protection at all.    To be sure, some of our politicians are fond of saying that  our people, supposedly, do not work properly, do not do the  right thing, and so on. If so, let us ask the people in the  government: Do they always do the right thing? What is the  measure of their civic and legal accountability--accountability  to society and the state for having brought the situation to its  present-day condition through unprofessional management? Under  the circumstances, why do they consider themselves entitled to  tell a manager: You are working poorly? Indeed, he cannot work  because these people have created such conditions for him. The  environment in which domestic manufacturers find themselves has  become hostile. It has become profitable not to work at all.  What do powerful enterprises do at present? They lease their  premises to real estate brokers in order to sustain their  people, paying them hidden unemployment benefits. The people who  lease out these premises, in essence selling and redistributing  the national wealth, are paid a portion of wages out of the  funds taken away from these same people. This is the highest  measure of social injustice.    Our economy currently reminds me of a cart sitting in the  woods. The mare is no longer there, it has run away; the shafts  are on the ground, and the cart itself has fallen apart. To be  sure, the wheels are still in place. We are discussing the  following issue: How are the ruts by which the cart will travel  to be deepened? And who will get the cart moving? If it is  moved, will this not end up with it falling apart completely?  Who will pull it, who will ride in it, who will repair it as it  moves, and, generally, where is the cart to be pulled? After  all, we believed that we were moving along the path of reform  toward a highway on which luxury cars were traveling, and as  soon as we reached this highway, we would switch to such a car  right away. So, are we to pull the cart toward the highway,  modifying it en route, or are we to wait until someone builds a  car for us? Nobody will build it for us.    We should modify this cart ourselves en route, without  stopping, because there is no opportunity to stop. When  politicians begin to look for enemies of reform and blame "the  working people of this country" for doing something wrong, let  them ponder this question: Do they themselves do all of this  correctly? Second, the working people are the nag who must pull  this cart. One should not spit upon them, but rather help these  people to figure things out, because everybody is already  confused to the point of not understanding anything. Instead  they steer the conversation from the area of economic reform and  the search for ways and methods for such reform to the area of  convenient political twaddle. It is much too convenient to say  that he is an enemy of reforms, we must fight him. However, in  ethical terms, lies about us living well as soon as tomorrow and  everything stabilizing here are not far removed from thievery.  After all, such lies rob the people of that which is most  important, hope--the hope that there indeed might be some  justice, that we will indeed live better.    All our reformers should be grateful to our old system for  conditioning a generation of people who trust, endure, and  wait--and are sustained by the cherished hope that there are  authorities that will take care of them, do the thinking, and  make decisions. This feeling makes people patient. This vestige  of the other, old system still prevents people from being openly  indignant over the outrages and the conditions they find  themselves in.    For now, there is time to change something for the better,  but there is less and less of it.</p>

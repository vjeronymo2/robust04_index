			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Raluca Dana Cotruta in Bucharest on 22 April -- recorded, in  English with superimposed translation into Romanian; translated  from the Romanian]    [Text] [Cotruta] Mr. Minister, you have made lots of  political statements these last few days. Now that the end of  your visit is drawing closer, we can also discuss other more  humane issues of interest to all of us. Could you just define  tolerance? What is tolerance, in your opinion?    [Peres] I defined it in my speech to the forum when I said  that, although democracy means the right to be equal, tolerance  means the equal right to be different. Tolerance is a  relationship with a different person, opinion, and religion.  You do not necessarily have to agree with them, but you should  always observe them. That is the meaning of tolerance.    [Cotruta] What do you think makes people intolerant? What  are the roots of this kind of attitude?    [Peres] Fear, prejudice, jealousy. Usually, the source of  intolerance is fear and uncertainty. People apparently have an  element of aggressiveness in themselves. For many good years,  aggressiveness manifested itself through wars. In a way, it is  now being expressed to a certain extent in sports, on the soccer  fields, where confrontations slightly resemble wars.  Aggressiveness is also manifest in road traffic; many people  will not allow other cars to overtake them. Intolerance is an  accumulation of fears and uncertainties.    [Cotruta] Do you think that intolerance, this kind of  disease -- since it is a disease, although you may not see it  burst out on your skin or accompanied by high fever -- do you  think this kind of sickness is more present in some regions of  the world as compared to others?    [Peres] Yes. I think there is a direct relationship between  poverty and intolerance. When you are becoming richer, you are  also getting richer in tolerance. When you are turning poor,  you are becoming more intolerant. Then, it depends very much on  cultural development, which has many effects in its own turn.  For example, the number of children. We all have smaller  families because we want to invest in our children. However, if  we are talking about the society of a backward nation, then you  note that it relies on many children; you have a high death rate  of children, too, with many of them not enjoying the benefits of  education. The same applies to the issue of tolerance. The  freer, richer, and more secure one is, the more one can afford  to be tolerant. The reverse of the coin is intolerance.    Then you must realize that there are several forces that  give  legitimacy to intolerance -- I am basically referring to  religions, since once something becomes holy, it ceases to be  reasonable. Holiness is above all reason. This also applies to  the problem of sacredness, as in the case of Khomeinism or the  Inquisition. Then come the various strategies, the fact that  people have had to fight wars in order to earn a living. This  is also on the point of disappearing. The strategies are  outdated, as well as the wars. I do not think the like of this  will still happen in the future. But strategies and secret  services have always been with us, the same as suspicion,  disquietude, and intolerance. Then comes the economic and  personal confrontation. The people want to excel each other  and, in their endeavors to this end, they sometimes try to  minimize or ridicule the others. The causes of all this are as  diverse as the human beings themselves.    [Cotruta] I would like to return to the Middle East, not  politically but spiritually, so to speak. What do you think is  the meaning of the Middle East for the rest of the world and for  the people living there? What is your viewpoint in this respect?    [Peres] We represent a very strange mixture -- the cradle of  three religions and the wells of oil. You have the great  memories and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,  which are represented by huge communities throughout the world.  There are 1 billion Catholics in the world, 1 billion Muslims,  I do not know exactly how many Protestants, and there is also a  small Jewish people. All of them are linked to the area in one  way or another. Maybe half of humanity is linked to the Middle  East emotionally or religiously. On the other hand, 60 percent  of the world's oil resources are in the Middle East. Therefore,  if you are religious, you come to the Middle East. If you are a  layman, you still must come to the Middle East.    The Middle East has filled the pages of history. The  Middle East has experienced 30 changes of empires throughout its  history. Some 30 different empires have passed through the  region and left their impact on the pace and remembered history  of mankind. I do not know whether the nature of the Middle East  has made that religions should be so exclusivist or that the  exclusivism of religion has made the Middle East to be so  strained. Nevertheless, it has surely had its effect. There is  a very interesting theory belonging to French historian  (?Maspereau). He said that there are two kinds of countries --  the mountainous and the flat ones. He said that in a flat  country, there are never prophets or revolutionaries, since they  do not know where to hide themselves. The people there live  together, can see each other, and take their water from the same  springs. In mountainous countries, where you can hide well,  there are prophets and rebels, revolts and revolutions, as well  as ideas. So, from Mount Sinai to the mountains of Judea, the  stories were written that gave birth to the wars, revolts,  religions, and the prophets.    [Cotruta] Your words sound so serene. Nevertheless, I  imagine that you have gone through quite a few difficult moments  in your career as diplomat. Can you name one?    [Peres] I have had so many difficult moments that a single  example would not suffice. You know, one experiences crises and  disappointments in almost everything. Even in these  negotiations, there were at least three moments when I thought  we would not pull it off. Then again, we had to overcome those  moments and resume the negotiations from the start.    [Cotruta] Which was the toughest moment?    [Peres] I think the night before we signed the accord in  Oslo. My friends told me: You are finished. Everything is over,  there is no chance. I talked all night with the people in  Tunis. I have been to Sweden with the late Minister Holst, and  we were sharing the same room. He was shouting to 'Arafat [on  the phone]. During the night, between Sweden and Norway, many  people thought that the peace process had failed.    [Cotruta] Yesterday you sounded quite optimistic and Mr.  'Arafat, on leaving Bucharest, made a pretty optimistic  statement. Can one talk about a moderate optimism?    [Peres] For me, it is a permanent optimism. Personally, I  do not know how one can go through life with pessimism. Does it  help any to be pessimistic? Even here, in Bucharest, when we  met the first night, Mr. 'Arafat was not in very good form. We  sat until 0230 in the morning trying to examine all matters and  find solutions to them. I am glad to say that Chairman 'Arafat  left Bucharest with an optimistic feeling about what has been  achieved.    [Cotruta] You know that in his inaugural speech to the  forum, Mr. Carteron [president of the Crans Montana Forum  Foundation] said that this meeting in Bucharest is not a  haphazard product -- he said that in French. Therefore, it is  not accidental that the meeting took place in Bucharest. I  mean, many speculations have been made in this respect.    [Peres] Obviously, I cannot guess what the organization's  president meant by that.    [Cotruta] He said the meeting was not accidental.    [Peres] I know you are talking about Mr. Carteron, but I do  not know what he was alluding to. I know that the organization  has made this huge effort to bring me and Mr. 'Arafat together  here. It was a difficult task. Romanian diplomacy also had a  part in it. I think we wanted to pay our respects to Bucharest  and the Romanian diplomacy -- this being another inducement for  our coming here.    [Cotruta] Are there any other bridges being built between  Israel and Romania?    [Peres] There are quite a few bridges. The connection  between us is natural, so why should we look for new bridges?    [Cotruta] Well, that is what I was referring to -- namely  the Israelis originating from Romania.    [Peres] Yes.    [Cotruta] So, they are a bridge.    [Peres] Yes, 10 percent of Israel's population originated  from Romania and they nurture very warm feelings for Romania --  something that makes Israeli-Romanian relations so special.    [Cotruta] Is there anything you dislike in the present stage  of Romanian-Israeli relations.    [Peres] No, I do not think so. Occasionally, there are some  sporadic anti-Semitic outbursts, which is strange because there  is practically no important Jewish community left in Romania.  What remains of the large Jewish community of Romania is only  approximately 16,000 people, the great majority of whom are old  people. However, I do not think we have any real problems.    [Cotruta] Do you think this problem of anti-Semitism is real  nowadays or is it artificially sponsored and maintained?    [Peres] Well, it is like a devil and an evil spirit, but it  exists in the people's minds and memory. I was never confronted  with it personally, but I have met many people who are afraid of  this evil spirit. This evil spirit does not exist in reality,  but in the composition of human psychology. As far as I am  concerned, anti-Semitism is not a Jewish malady but a Gentile  one. That is why we find it spread among the non-Jews. I think  it is an ugly spot on their own societies. I do not believe  that if a strong anti-Semitic trend existed in Romania, it would  jeopardize the life of the Jews, because the whole thing is  pointless. However, I believe that for a Romania that wants to  be free, liberal, respected, and clear, it should prevent the  emergence of these ugly phenomena, which are so much linked to  the past and have so little to do with the future.    [Cotruta] Is this phenomenon more acute in other countries?    [Peres] Well, it has different expressions. In Germany, for  instance, there is a certain xenophobia. Actually, the German  potential of anti-Semitism is directed against the Turks and  other foreign workers. It is something crude, ugly, and brutal.  We know the Germans are trying to fight this phenomenon. There  are certain anti-Semitic manifestations in Russia and many other  places. But as I have said, this is not a Jewish malady.    [Cotruta] Let us leave the devils aside and turn back to  what we might expect and what I believe we should do. What do  you think would be the main danger -- or better said, what might  jeopardize the peace, which has now become a reality?    [Peres] Usually it is the crazy people you should watch.  You know, there are crazy people in three countries: Iran,  Iraq, and Libya. They are endangering peace and their own  nations. However, I believe that less and less people are going  to support them, even among the crazies. What can you achieve  by war? What is important, you cannot achieve through war, and  whatever war can achieve is no longer important. Then comes the  cost of war, which is prohibiting, as well as the cost of arms  and the damage caused by the war. No one can really engage in a  war today. I see war as a cholera, a disappearing disease. It  no longer really functions in the modern world. It is no longer  a real problem. There are countries that still maintain huge  armies but have no enemies. It is so strange to see a country  whose army should be poised to fight against an enemy, but the  enemy that might justify the size of that army simply does not  exist.    [Cotruta] I have two more questions. The first one is  concerning what we usually call the great powers. You said that  many weapons were sold to the Middle East, something that costs  a lot of money. All this traffic in arms and money -- does it  have anything to do with the great powers or with some people up  there wanting to preserve a climate of tension?    [Peres] Well, when there was a conflict between the two  superpowers, they searched for clients in the Middle East. Many  countries in the Middle East thrived on this world conflict.  Anyhow, I think this is a good question. Why should a country  like Russia or the Soviet Union spend an estimated $180 billion  to finance and support various parties in the Middle East in the  way of arms, credits, and so forth?    The answer is that this confrontation between the two  superpowers was not only a strategic and economic one but an  ideological one, too. Each ideology -- the democratic one, on  the one hand, and the communist ideology, on the other -- wanted  to prove that they were able to obtain more support from as many  people as possible. It was more an attempt by these great  ideologies to conquer the people's hearts rather than their  territories.    I once read a very interesting article about an American  foreign policy expert who made a speech before a group of U.S.  businessmen and explained the need for the U.S. program of aid  for abroad. He had a very good idea. He told them: Let us  assume that I do not work for the State Department but for the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let us also assume that  you are not U.S. businessmen but Russian ones. If you are to  ask me how we spent the Russian assistance for foreign  countries, I would say that we spend it in Egypt. If you asked  me how much are we spending there, I would say $6-7 seven  billion. In which way? Well, we are supplying arms. What did  Egypt do with the weapons? It entered a war. Did it win the  war? No. Is there a communist party in Egypt? No, it is in  prison.    Well, then I would say that we further spent some foreign  aid  in Indonesia. If they asked me how much, I would say about $2  billion. If they asked me on what, I would say on a stadium.  If they asked me why, I would say because [former Indonesian  President] Sukarno liked stadiums. If they asked me whether  this has made Russia more popular in Indonesia, I would have to  give a negative answer. Is there a communist party in  Indonesia? No, it is in prison. Then the American dignitary  closed his speech by saying the following: Do you know the  difference between the United States and Russia? In Russia they  do not ask questions.    [Cotruta] The last question. You travel a lot. Are you  ever homesick?    [Peres] The minute I leave my home I am homesick.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The chairman of the  Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Thursday [19  May] urged telecommunications, taxi and other public service  operators to make stepped-up cost-cutting efforts to prevent a  hike in their charges.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of Japan's top business lobby, told  reporters the government's decision to freeze hikes in public  service charges until the end of the year is laudable but added  further cost-cutting efforts are needed to forestall future  hikes.    The government said Wednesday it will suspend until the end  of this year a plan to raise public service charges, including  public transportation fees, highway tolls and telephone rates.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Vasilyeva: "How Much Charity Costs; the </F> Social Assistance Service Was Financed in the Best of Times  According to the Residual Principle"]    [Text] What is it really that speaks of this day?    The state publishes edicts and decrees, looking for  resources  as much as possible. And social protection seems to correct the  rules of the game that are imposed on us by the market.    In Novosibirsk, social protection departments have been  established in all rayons of the city. In the first quarter,  R110 million have been allocated from the city budget for  providing material assistance (already more than R250 million in  the second quarter).    Seven people work in this department in Tsentralnyy Rayon.  Employees of the department looked after 465 families at the  beginning of the year. Material assistance was received by 1,392  people. Among them were pensioners and invalids, large families  and single mothers, and people who were victims of the Chernobyl  catastrophe.    The provision of daily bread always remains the overriding  task. The distribution of acquired resources cannot be resolved  with a simple measure. Therefore, officials of the social  protection administration turn directly to the producers of food  products and conclude contracts for deliveries. Simultaneously,  contracts are concluded with stores, and money is transferred  there for the purchase of commodities (interest-free loan) so  that the poorly provided for residents of the rayon would make  purchases of food products in the Energy and Echo municipal  enterprises at prices that are 15 percent lower than retail  prices. But in the Hermes and Dawn stores, 490 people received  food products free of charge. For these purposes, R2.5 million  were allocated. According to a contract on cooperation with the  Clothing trade-production firm, people acquired goods at a 20  percent discount (40 critically needy families received knitted  underwear here free of charge): The Shveybyt joint-stock company  helped mend and make clothing as good as new for half price. The  rayon administration allocated credit of R10 million for these  purposes.    All told in the first quarter, more than R9 million was  expended on material assistance, R2.7 million was received from  the city budget, and the rest of the resources drawn in by the  rayon administration were received from sponsors.    Daily bread is a problem that is common to everyone--daily,  constant, but far from the only one. All of the data on the  people, and on their needs, are entered into a computer.  Everything about life, and what it is like: Swimming lessons  were covered for 36 children; 13 families had refrigerators  repaired; 140 families received seeds and books on vegetable  gardening; fares for the transport of invalids, for students of  large families, and for families where there are two and more  invalids, were paid for.    As usual, everyday life is brightened by celebrations and  holidays. One hundred and forty participants in the Battle of  Leningrad and blockade-runners came to a meeting where there was  a concert, the presentation of commemorative souvenirs, and a  festive dinner. In celebration of 8 March, gifts totalling R3  million were presented to women from large families and  incomplete families, invalids, and single pensioners. The  holiday Spring was organized at the end of March for pensioners  and invalids. Using the occasion, workers of the housing  administration of the rayon and the Central Savings Bank  clarified the situation on allowances for the payment of  housing. Fifty-seven pensioners and invalids rested in holiday  hotels and sanatoriums. Two single elderly people formed school  boarding houses. It turned out that making living arrangements  for elderly single people is the most difficult problem to  resolve today.    Two hundred and nine of them, who have ended up facing life  alone, are provided services at home. Three social assistance  sections, in which women work, were established for this in the  rayon. Each of the women has up to 10 wards.    What is behind this? Most of all, helplessness and old age.  Sometimes the physical load is easier to bear than communication  with people who are out of favor with fate. Of course, not  everyone survives. Many work out of hopelessness--they were laid  off from service.    Elderly people spoke with gratitude about the work of Marina  Aleksandrovna Sheina, Svetlana Stepanovna Manuylova, and Olga  Veniaminovna Rozovska. Others were also mentioned, but these  women requested that they not be named: The children are  embarrassed by the work of their mothers. Some day they will  understand that the most onerous but also the most noble burden  fell to the lot of their mothers--to take into their hands the  concerns of their fellow citizens. We often hear the phrase:  "The level of a civilized state is determined by the attitude in  it toward old people and children." But the state--this, after  all, is us?</p>

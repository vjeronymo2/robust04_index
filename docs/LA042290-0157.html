			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADELANTO'S DILEMMA;  </P> <P> U.S. SUES DESERT TOWN FOR REJECTING A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL IN  RESIDENTIAL AREA  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department is charging that this little Mojave Desert town has  finally found something it doesn't want: a shelter for the homeless mentally  ill.  </P> <P> Adelanto likes gambling. It welcomes prisons. It is willing to take garbage  from other cities. It wants an international airport.  </P> <P> But Adelanto does not want mentally ill people living in its residential  neighborhoods, according to a housing discrimination suit filed in federal  court in Los Angeles by the Justice Department.  </P> <P> Adelanto city officials deny the discrimination allegation, contending that the  decision they made that prompted the suit was based on legitimate zoning  concerns.  </P> <P> At issue in the suit, which could have nationwide significance, are the  circumstances under which local governments may legally bar facilities for the  handicapped from residential areas. The suit is the first of its kind on behalf  of the mentally ill, according to Justice Department officials. It is based on  the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act that, as of March 12, 1989, outlawed  housing discrimination based on handicaps.  </P> <P> Federal attorneys charge that the Adelanto City Council acted illegally last  August when it denied a permit that a boarding house for homeless mentally ill  people needed to continue operating in a residential neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The City Council denied the application . . . because of the handicap of the  residents of the home," the suit charges.  </P> <P> It asks the court to prevent the city from closing Lillie Ruff's Homeless  Shelter, which houses eight mentally ill residents who were referred there by  San Bernardino County officials. The suit, filed March 18, also seeks punitive  damages "because of the intentional and willful nature of the defendant's  conduct."  </P> <P> Ruff, a 42-year-old widow and licensed vocational nurse, opened the home in  1987 and was subsequently told by Adelanto officials that she needed a  "conditional-use permit" to continue operating the boarding home in her  neighborhood of mostly single-family houses. Adelanto zoning laws allow city  officials to grant permission for boarding homes to operate in such  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> But when Ruff applied for the permit before the Adelanto Planning Commission  last July, neighbors of the home presented city officials with a petition with  38 signatures stating: "We do not want the mentally disturbed right in the  middle of a family housing area with many children."  </P> <P> Ruff, who lives at the shelter with her three small nephews, dismisses that  concern. "They said they feared for the children, and I have more children than  anyone on the block," she said.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission turned down the request for a permit to operate the  home and last August the City Council rejected Ruff's appeal.  </P> <P> Adelanto officials deny that their rejection of the permit was discriminatory  and insist they had merely enforced zoning laws prohibiting commercial  activities in residential areas.  </P> <P> "We have no problem with mentally handicapped people . . . if they're put in an  area that is zoned for that," said Mayor Edward Dondelinger in an interview.  </P> <P> The issue of protecting handicapped people from discrimination in housing is  complicated. Currently, under California law, facilities licensed by the state  to give care and supervision to six or fewer mentally handicapped clients  generally cannot be barred by local authorities from operating in residential  neighborhoods. But facilities with more than six clients are not afforded such  protection under state law, nor are boarding homes, such as Ruff's Homeless  Shelter, that provide food and housing but do not have state licenses for care  and supervision.  </P> <P> Moreover, the state's fair housing regulations -- which cover the physically  handicapped -- do not cover the mentally ill or retarded, according to John  Castello, chief counsel for the state Department for Fair Employment and  Housing.  </P> <P> The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act is an attempt to extend protection  against discrimination in housing to all handicapped people, no matter the  nature of their disabilities.  </P> <P> Leonard Rubenstein, legal director of the Mental Health Law Project, a public  interest legal firm in Washington, said of the Adelanto suit: "It is important  across the country because . . . many local governments either don't understand  what their obligations are or fail to abide by their obligations (under the  federal Fair Housing Amendments Act)."  </P> <P> The remote town of Adelanto, 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles and with a  population that state officials put at 5,000 (town fathers claim 10,000) would  seem an unlikely focal point for such a dispute. In its quest for financial  growth over the last 15 years, Adelanto has been less than choosy about  enterprises it was willing to welcome. For example:  </P> <P> * In the mid-1970s, the city tried unsuccessfully to legalize Las Vegas-style  casino gambling within its boundaries through a state initiative. That dream is  still alive, but Adelanto makes do with only a legal card room, called the  Hi-Desert Casino.  </P> <P> * In the mid-1980s, Adelanto tried to acquire a maximum-security 1,500-inmate  state prison to create jobs. State correctional officials called the project  off after they were advised that jet fighters shrieking out of George Air Force  Base -- adjacent to the city -- would be an invitation to an inmate lawsuit  over intolerable noise. Since then, Adelanto has managed to attract a  380-inmate facility for parole violators, which is under construction.  </P> <P> * City officials say they currently are negotiating with several companies to  haul in garbage from other municipalities for conversion to energy and other  byproducts.  </P> <P> * The city hopes to create a "Hi Desert International Airport" on the site of  George Air Force Base when that facility closes in 1992. Community leaders have  invited aeronautic industry officials to town to discuss the plan.  </P> <P> Former City Councilman Gus Ronnebeck, a retired Air Force sergeant, is a  booster of such projects, but an opponent of Ruff's Homeless Shelter. He and  his wife, Margaret, were among those who signed the petition against it.  </P> <P> The Ronnebecks become angry at the mere mention of Ruff's pink one-story  triplex, which is directly across the street from their ranch-style home.  </P> <P> Gus Ronnebeck said of the boarding home: "I think you should have that in a  commercial area. It should be operated as a commercial business."  </P> <P> The Ronnebecks admit that none of the residents of Ruff's shelter has ever  bothered them.  </P> <P> "We personally have not had them come to our house," said Margaret Ronnebeck.  "We have loaded guns here and if they come here they're going to be carried  away."  </P> <P> Such fear of the mentally ill is based on myth, maintains Edward Garner,  coordinator of the San Bernardino County Mental Health Department program that  refers clients to Ruff's shelter.  </P> <P> "They don't have any more potential for violence than the ordinary citizen,  probably less," said Garner, a clinical psychologist.  </P> <P> Opponents of the shelter who spoke before the City Council last August  complained of behavior by the boarding home residents that they found annoying  rather than violent.  </P> <P> "(They) walk right into your yard," complained Elsie Allen. "They open up the  gate and walk right in and if they get hurt, then they can sue us."  </P> <P> Irl Peterson, whose elderly mother lives across the street from the home, said,  "I see these patients numerous times in the open fields staring out in a manner  which is (not) befitting of a normal person."  </P> <P> When the City Council heard Ruff's appeal of the Planning Commission decision  last August, it was warned by City Atty. Ivan L. Hopkins that, under federal  law, it could not legally consider the mental handicaps of the boarding house  residents in deciding whether to grant a permit for the home. To avoid unlawful  discrimination, he advised, the council must approve or deny the request for a  permit as though it were considering a boarding house for ordinary residents.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, during the deliberations, Mayor Dondelinger expressed concern  over the behavior of residents in such shelters that had operated in the city  previously.  </P> <P> "(The) people have been unsupervised," he complained, "(and) have gone around  to the stores and caused all kinds of problems and we have very little control  over what happens in any of these places . . . ."  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 to deny the permit. Councilman Frank Harris cast the  dissenting vote because he disagreed with the decision of the majority to allow  Ruff to continue to operate even during a 90-day period for appeal.  </P> <P> Ruff subsequently complained to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development and federal attorneys brought suit. The shelter has remained open.  </P> <P> Dondelinger vowed to fight the suit. "We can't let them take businesses and put  them beside houses. We can't let the zoning go askew."  </P></p>

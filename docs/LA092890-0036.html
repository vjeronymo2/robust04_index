			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> RAITT'S TRANSITION TO A BALLADEER FOR THE '90S  </P> <P> "It's a long way from Trancas, right here," said Bonnie Raitt, opening a  three-night stand on Wednesday at the Universal Amphitheatre, referring not  just to the geographical distance from the tiny Malibu nightclub where she was  resigned to squeezing 'em in with a shoehorn not all that long ago, on the  downside of her career.  </P> <P> That was pre-comeback, pre-Grammys, pre-"Nick of Time," of course. A veteran  singer/guitarist with a good character, a smart mouth, a sexy walk, nimble  fingers and a dignified, self-respecting attitude, Raitt is too little the  Cinderella-complex type to allow for any fairy-tale analogies. ("I can find my  own diamond ring!" she playfully barked at a wayward suitor in "Real Man.")  </P> <P> Still, this triumphant homecoming at the end of a long tour had the flavor of,  at least, the epilogue to a feel-good TV movie, if not the happily-ever-after  denouement for a bedtime success story.  </P> <P> The transition from outdated '70s blues-rock mama to essential '90s balladeer  seemed complete, not least of all because Raitt has held firmly onto her blues  roots, but without staying in that place of arrested development that is  sometimes part and parcel with maintaining a blues attitude.  </P> <P> She still growls out a fine "Sugar Mama" and "Give It Up or Let Me Go" -- and  you can trace an obvious line between the cocky defiance of those blues numbers  and the quiet assurance of her ballads.  </P> <P> But those older songs, fun as they are, seem distinctly like performances. The  songs Raitt really inhabits now are newer, softer, more mature statements of  purpose like Bonnie Hayes' "Have a Heart," her own "Nick of Time" and David  Lasley's "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again," the last of which, she  said, "I waited a long time to be grown-up enough to sing."  </P> <P> The musical and thematic arc of her well-constructed show was cleverly  reflected in the set design, a vista of desert buttes with a skyline backdrop.  The early portion of the set focused on good-time, up-tempo numbers from the  span of her career, the ruddy sky behind Raitt gradually darkening.  </P> <P> The nighttime segment, with starry sky and rising moon, encompassed tender  ballads like "Louise" as well as blues numbers with a rootsier, scaled-down  version of her group that she introduced as "the back porch band." And the  sunrise, aided and abetted by a morning thunderstorm, commenced with a couple  of light but rousing rockers from her latest and most popular album.  </P> <P> It's hard to say whether Raitt's stage presence is enabled more by her fine  slide guitar playing or her good humor and strong rapport. In any case, she  went out of her way to credit almost all the songwriters responsible for the  evening's material, from mentor Mississippi Fred McDowell to herself ("Here's  one of my tunes, since I qualify as an old blueswoman now," she quipped during  the "back porch" segment).  </P> <P> And perhaps most admirable and endearing was the moment in which she marveled  at how far she'd come career-wise, and then went on to emphatically reinforce  that, however happy she was about her comeback, it was not the factor behind  her personal recovery and happiness, which predated the chart/award success. In  other words, when it comes to the fickle pop audience, she's co-dependent no  more.  </P> <P> Even if Raitt's set hadn't been half so spirited, she'd have been worthy of a  standing ovation just for her inspired choice of opening acts on the tour --  smooth "Sequoia of soul" Charles Brown and the utterly unpeggable, certifiably  commitable NRBQ.  </P> <P> Brown may be the only singer alive who can refer to himself in the third person  more than Jerry Lee Lewis yet still come off as humble. Accompanying himself on  piano and joined gradually by members of Raitt's band, Brown crooned his way  through a slew of forgotten classics.  </P> <P> Veteran quartet NRBQ plays a kind of barroom rock that sounds messy but is, in  fact, quite jazzy and sporadically brilliant, with sweet, boy-like lyrics and  somewhat maniacal on-stage attitude. They're either the Beach Boys of the '90s  or the Replacements of the '70s.  </P> <P> So don't be late if you plan to see Raitt, Brown and NRBQ finish up their  Universal stint with a sold-out show tonight, or their tour-capper on Sunday  night at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P></p>

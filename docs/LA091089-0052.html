			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREQUENT FLAP  </P> <P> This is in response to Peter Greenberg's article on frequent flier rewards.  </P> <P> Check the classified ads daily and you will find rewards for sale even though  the rules state they cannot be sold, transferred or bartered. The government  should investigate this. It should also tax rewards just like a domestic  ticket, at 8%. And tickets should be examined at check-in just like a passport  and the passenger denied boarding if he isn't the person listed on the ticket.  Maybe it will take a little longer to check in, but the next time Greenberg  wants to use his 90,000 for a European vacation, the seats will be available.  </P> <P> SANDY PARKER  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Turn Our Eyes Inward, Deepen Reform, </F> and Restore the Prestige of Heilongjiang"]    [Text] Not long ago, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji guided  responsible persons of state departments concerned to conduct  investigations and study in our province and to help resolve the  temporary difficulties cropping up in the course of advance.  Like spring wind blowing over the land of Heilongjiang, this  thing made all people of the province filled with exultation.  We should take this opportunity, turn our eyes inward, deepen  reform, expand the scale of opening up, and restore the prestige  of Heilongjiang.    With rich natural resources, a solid agricultural  foundation,  and a strong lineup of state-owned enterprises, Heilongjiang is  the country's key base for production of coal, timber,  petroleum, machinery, and commodity grain and has made major  contributions to the country. However, with various  contradictions and problems accumulated for a long period of  time under the traditional systems, in the past 10 years, the  province relatively lagged behind in the economic development,  and the industrial development speed was noticeably lower than  the national average level. The problems of Heilongjiang being  an old industrial base prominently exist among the petroleum,  coal, forest, and war industries; grain trades; and large and  medium-sized enterprises. The central leading comrades have  extremely been concerned with the temporary difficulties ahead  of Heilongjiang. For a period of time, six standing committee  members of the political bureau of the party Central Committee,  namely Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji,  and Hu Jingtao, successively inspected our province and helped  resolve difficulties and problems. The central authorities made  such a great determination to help our province solve problems.  This was the most favorable condition for restoring the  prestige of Heilongjiang. The central authorities fully  understand Heilongjiang's difficulties, affirm the contributions  made by the people of Heilongjiang the work ideas of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government, and  place great expectations on restoring the prestige of  Heilongjiang. Therefore, changing the cordial concern of the  central leading comrades into the real deeds of relying on  self-efforts to tide over difficulties is a major task ahead of  all people of the province. We should base ourselves on turning  our eyes inward; rely on our own efforts to solve problems; and  concentrate our work on emancipating the mind, deepening reform,  expanding the scale of opening up, and promoting development.    To restore the prestige of Heilongjiang, we should proceed  from the actual conditions of the province and make efforts to  build new industries and economic advantages. To this end, the  provincial party committee has worked out a strategic idea for  extending five aspects and speeding up two aspects as well as a  work idea for following five roads. To realize the strategic  idea and the work idea, we must pioneer ways for deepening  reform and expanding the scale of opening up. To suit the  general target of setting up the socialist market economic  system, we should further deepen the reform of the economic  system, focus on reforming the property rights of state-owned  enterprises, boldly explore ways for setting up a modern  enterprise system, enliven state-owned large and medium- sized  enterprises, coordinate reform with transformation, vigorously  promote technological transformation among old enterprises,  grasp the construction of key projects, strive to expand pillar  industries, and form new economic growth points. We should  bring into play the advantages of opening the border areas to  the outside world, extensively invite businessmen and introduce  foreign capital to conduct grafting transformation, positively  pioneer domestic and foreign markets, and comprehensively  promote the development of Heilongjiang. To restore the  prestige of Heilongjiang, we should turn our eyes inward, rely  on our efforts to make the province strong, work arduously, and  quietly immerse ourselves in hard work. The central leaders  support Heilongjiang to tide over difficulties. This is an  external factor. Only when we concentrate our own efforts will  we be able to bring into play the functions of the external  factor and to promote a change in Heilongjiang.    We should fully use the support of the state, rely on our  own  efforts, work arduously, and do better the things of  Heilongjiang. Practice showed that although the units have the  same economic strains, their situations are greatly different  because they make different efforts to conduct reform and  enhance their internal strength. For example, by pioneering  ways for marketing, some of the collieries under Jixi Mining  Administrative Bureau have basically not owed the staff and  workers' wages. Therefore, we stress the necessity not to wait  for or rely on others' assistance but to make efforts to resolve  the economic difficulties of various trades in the province. We  should vigorously advocate the spirits of doing solid work,  immersing ourselves in hard work, and doing pioneering work; set  up a work mechanism of doing solid work and stressing real  efficiency; and have the daring to do pioneering work, to have a  try, to run a risk, and to bravely blaze new trails in doing our  practical work. Only when the people from higher levels  downward across the province form a good practice of seeking  truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work, and doing  solid work will we certainly be able to promote the economic  development and restore the prestige of Heilongjiang.</p>

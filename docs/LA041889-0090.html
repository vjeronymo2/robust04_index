			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> After almost 11 years and 7,000 performances, the musical extravaganza "Hello  Hollywood, Hello" will clear off the stage at Bally's hotel and casino in Reno  tonight to make way for star headliners. The long-running show (it opened June  2, 1978) has become a Reno landmark, featuring a passenger jet landing on the  one-acre stage, attacks by spaceships that descend from the showroom ceiling, a  re-creation of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and a three-story waterfall  that dumps 4,000 gallons of water onto the stage. Richard Sturm, Bally's vice  president of entertainment, said that "the last couple of years the audience  has been down. Our surveys showed that people wanted to see name stars." And  that they'll get when Dean Martin opens April 27 as the first headliner. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

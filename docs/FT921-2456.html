			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (4):  Importance of central control - Case study: Arthur Andersen/Credit Lyonnais: Avoiding errors - How businesses in the financial sector keep a balance between unrestricted use of spreadsheets and a measure of benevolent control.  Packages risks the danger of amateur programmers producing incorrect business models on which important decisions might be based. That is a view shared by the UK heads of computer support services at accounting and management consultancy firm Arthur Andersen and the French bank Credit Lyonnais. Both have large numbers of users of the Microsoft Excel product across the UK and try to strike a balance between unrestricted use of spreadsheets and a measure of benevolent central control. 'I am concerned that spreadsheets can be dangerous in the hands of the uninitiated,' says Mr David Freeman, director of audit computer services at Arthur Andersen. 'You're giving what amounts to a programming tool to someone with no programming training. 'Whenever we see spreadsheets from outside, our checks invariably reveal that under certain circumstances they will give erroneous results.' Mr Freeman says tax calculations are a prime example of a basic business factor which is too often set up incorrectly in a spreadsheet: 'People tend to build in tax calculations in a simplistic way and you find, for example, that losses are not handled properly.' He adds: 'I'm sure there are many companies making incorrect decisions because their spreadsheets have errors in them.' Even so, Mr Freeman says there are no restrictions on the use of spreadsheets at Arthur Andersen - however, major spreadsheet development work tends to be done by a specialist central team 'who know the traps and tricks of preparing such models,' as Mr Freeman puts it. Credit Lyonnais actually encourages users to develop their own so-called macro-programs to extend their spreadsheets, using program instructions supplied with the packages - 'we can't develop every program that everyone wants centrally, so we encourage users to do as much as they can themselves,' says Mr Danny Dawes, head of personal computer services. 'However, users have to realise that they shouldn't start relying on a macro written by someone in their department and not supported by computing staff, because if that person leaves, no one will understand the spreadsheet program. 'We encourage users to tell us what they want and what they are trying to do themselves and we like to work with them as much as possible, especially if they are developing quite an involved spreadsheet program.' Each department has someone who is the main liaison person for the central computing unit. These people meet quarterly for a whole day to exchange ideas and experiences. If a department has developed a useful spreadsheet application which generates wide interest at the meeting, the computing unit examines it with a view to providing central support for all departments. 'We don't want people re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr Dawes. Both Arthur Andersen and Credit Lyonnais limit the potential duplication of spreadsheet development effort, while exerting some central control, by providing standard spreadsheet templates for often-repeated tasks. At Credit Lyonnais, for example, in the head office on the edge of the City of London and in branches across the UK, there are standard templates for working on account histories and company analyses and for sending exchange rates each day from the dealing room to the branches. At Arthur Andersen there are around 400 professional staff using Excel, mainly for auditing and documenting financial results of clients. Many take portable computers - the company's preferred model at present is the Compaq LTE - to clients' offices and can load data directly from a client's spreadsheet into Excel, eliminating the need to key in the information. 'We previously used paper for documenting results but it's a lot easier with an automated spreadsheet,' says David Freeman. 'An auditor can store the data and roll it forward from year to year, so he doesn't have to start with a blank sheet every time. 'If we can directly load in data from a client's spreadsheet we can annotate that information. In addition, the spreadsheet can produce information in graphical form, which is far easier to absorb quickly.' Arthur Andersen and Credit Lyonnais have both switched to Microsoft's Excel from Lotus 1-2-3 as their standard spreadsheet package because of Windows. This is Microsoft's so-called graphical user interface, which offers users a means of communicating with software in a simple way through graphics displayed on the screen rather than instructions typed through a keyboard. It also enables users to switch easily from one application program to another: for example from word processing to running a spreadsheet. Suppliers of personal computer software - including Lotus  - are adapting their products to run with Windows following its early success: 5m copies of the landmark 3.0 version were sold in the 12 months following the launch in 1990 and that figure has risen to 9m in the last eight months. 'We were fairly heavy users of Lotus 1-2-3 since its launch but we recognised the effect of having lots of software packages - word processing, spreadsheets and so on - which were not consistent: for example the F1 key in one package would be F10 in another,' says David Freeman at Arthur Andersen. 'So we moved to Windows, mainly for cost-savings on training. 'Once you're familiar with one package under Windows, the learning curve for the next package is much lower than for a software product which uses the traditional instruction style.' The firm is using Excel, Word for Windows for word processing and Powerpoint for presentation graphics. 'We previously standardised on Lotus 1-2-3 across the world and we have now made a world-wide strategic move to Excel,' Mr Freeman says. 'This is a very big issue: time is money for professional people, so we want to get the most effective use of information technology in the shortest possible time. 'In addition, standardising on particular products makes support a lot easier and also enables us to use purchasing power. We have central control of purchasing to ensure people can't buy whatever they want: this might sound a bit harsh but the benefits demand it.' Danny Dawes at Credit Lyonnais agrees: 'Windows is certainly more fun, pretty and easy to use, which is important when you've got 200 users who only use a personal computer now and then. 'All the packages have the same look and structure, so if you've been on the Excel course, the Word package for word processing makes sense quite quickly. Users find packages running with Windows are more intuitive: they can find their way round the products fairly easily. This in turn makes support through our personal computer help-desk much easier.' One of these support people also organises training. This person came in on a government training scheme last autumn after joining a programming course from a career in marketing in the computing industry. She started her period of work experience at Credit Lyonnais by going on an intensive Windows course, then set up a Windows awareness course for the bank's own staff and started training users. She was so successful that the bank offered her a full-time job. Users at Credit Lyonnais get much of the raw data for their spreadsheets from the central IBM 4381 computer. The bank has a data and electronic mail network covering the UK, linking local area networks of personal computers in branches and offices to the centre. Like Arthur Andersen, the bank standardises on Compaq personal computers. It has around 220 Windows users: 180 use Excel - this has cost the bank around Pounds 35,000 for copies of the networked version - and a similar number use Word. Mr Dawes says there was some resistance to change among Lotus 1-2-3 users. But he adds: 'The users quickly saw that operating under Windows was much better. In addition, there's a 1-2-3 help facility in Excel to help Lotus users get familiar with the Microsoft product.' Lotus spreadsheets can be converted to Excel and initially some users took up this opportunity, but that soon changed. 'Translating existing spreadsheets from another product would not allow us to take full advantage of the power of Excel,' says Danny Dawes. 'In addition, many of the Lotus spreadsheets were written some time ago, possibly without the same level of quality assurance or documentation, so we've taken this opportunity to re-analyse and redesign them from scratch, using Excel.'</p>

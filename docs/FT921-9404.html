			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Bank damps hopes for lower interest rates UK AUTHORITIES showed no sign of seeking an early cut in interest rates yesterday despite a sharp fall in inflationary pressures last month and an admission from the Bank of England that the economy is still in recession. The Bank's admission in its latest quarterly bulletin contrasts with its view in November that the economy was recovering. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, seized on this, saying it showed the government's talk of recovery was 'competely bogus'. In the Bank's bleak assessment of the economy, inflation was singled out as one of the few positive developments. Official figures showed that core inflation, as measured by the price of manufactured goods at the factory gate, fell from 4.9 per cent in the 12 months to December to 4.5 per cent in January, the lowest level for 3 1/2 years. The Bank provided the money market with only a small part of its liquidity needs yesterday, signalling its belief that recent market enthusiasm for a rate cut from 10.5 per cent has been exaggerated. In its bulletin, the Bank also drew attention to the difficulties of easing monetary policy while tensions exist in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, in which sterling remains the weakest currency. While factory gate prices rose quite sharply between December and January, the latest figures from the Central Statistical Office confirmed the downward trend which began in the middle of last year. Last month the price index of all manufactured products rose by 0.7 per cent compared with a 0.1 per cent monthly increase in December. The CSO said price increases in January tended to be relatively high as manufacturers introduced new product price lists. Stripping out the volatile prices of food, drink and tobacco, core inflation fell to 3.1 per cent in the 12 months to January - the lowest since August 1969 - and less than half its high of 6.4 per cent in February 1991. Bank of England calculations, which take the monthly variations in the index to produce a three-month moving average, show that output price inflation was running at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent in the latest three months. Last month the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.2 per cent against the previous month, after a 0.9 per cent drop in December. This left the price index of these materials down 1.1 per cent on the year. The fall in producer prices was welcomed by the Treasury, which described the figures as 'excellent news'. The government believes the fall should feed into lower underlying retail price inflation and provide the platform for higher business investment and a recovery later this year.

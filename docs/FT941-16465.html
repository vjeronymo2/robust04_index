			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): David S Smith - Other companies The paper, packaging and office supplies group is expected on Wednesday to announce a fall in interim profits from Pounds 15.2m to about Pounds 12m. The reason for the reduction is a further fall in paper prices, the result of low demand and competition from cheap imports from Germany, as well as weakness in the corrugated box market. Production has been affected by the rebuilding of a machine at Smith's Kemsley mill.</p>

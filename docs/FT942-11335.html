			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / NY art auctions end hopes of upturn This week's New York auctions of leading works of contemporary art have shattered some of the growing optimism that the international art and antiques market was making a strong recovery. At Sotheby's on Wednesday night the most important work on sale this week, 'Highway' by Jasper Johns, expected to make around Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.4m), was unsold, while at Christie's on Tuesday almost half the lots on offer failed to find buyers. This was a disappointment after the success of last winter's contemporary auctions in New York. Sotheby's had the better experience. Apart from the failure of the Johns the auction did quite well, totalling almost Dollars 20.5m, and with over 70 per cent of works on offer selling. 'Cubi V', a sculpture by David Smith, went to a private American collector for a record Dollars 4m. It is one of a series of 28 such sculptures, most of which are already in museums. 'Dark Green Painting' by Arshile Gorky, his last important work before his death in 1948, made Dollars 3.5m. Both works were sold from the collection of Mr and Mrs H. Gates Lloyd: he was the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In contrast Christie's sold its main offering, a drip painting by Jackson Pollock, for Dollars 1.76m. This was well below its Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m estimate. It seems the good results last time round encouraged some leading works into the saleroom, but with reserves higher than the market could stand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mayra Chirino Ochoa] </F>   [Text] An official source has reported that Finance  Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez presented the 1995 budget, worth  1.7 trillion bolivares, to the Council of Ministers on 23 March.  The source added that there are plans to drastically reduce the  debt by an estimated 70 percent next year. This plan implies the  exclusion of treasury bonds as a financing mechanism and the  refinancing of the debt owed to multilateral organizations. It  was reported that World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank  financing will be limited to projects liable to be carried out.  This is part of the new administration's policy of reducing the  debt to its barest minimum.    The estimated price of a barrel of oil, production figures,  and rate of exchange were not reported. Several options are  being studied, but the Council of Ministers will make the final  decision. The new public administration employees' salary  classifications, which were approved by the government of Ramon  J. Velasquez and which will go into effect this year, were  incorporated into the next year's budget.    Although not yet signed into legislation, the revenue from  the Value-Added Tax [VAT] applied on wholesalers, luxury taxes,  and higher income taxes were included in the 1995 budget after  the reforms were introduced at the Congress. In this regard, it  has been reported that negotiations will be held with the  Legislative Branch because these are proposals not yet passed  into law.    It is worthwhile mentioning that VAT was included in the  1993  budget when the tax had not yet been approved and that, for this  reason, the budget was turned down by the Congress. At the  time, the Congress decided to substitute the anticipated revenue  from VAT for treasury bonds, thus balancing the budget.    According to the Budget Law, the 1995 budget should be  presented to the Congress in the second half of April.  Therefore, it is expected to be presented between 15 and 20  April. The finance minister had previously considered the  possibility of asking Congress for an extension to present the  budget in June. The idea, however, was dismissed for political  reasons and it was decided to stick to the deadline stipulated  by law.</p>

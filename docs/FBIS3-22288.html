Experts say that the increasing forests greatly helped  improve the local ecological and living environment as the  coverage rate grew from 12.9 percent to 28.7 percent during the  past four decades.    A leading industrial province in China, Liaoning has one of  the highest proportions of urban population among China's  provinces. However, great efforts have been made to grow and  protect the forests, whose acreage has risen from 1.87 million  ha to 4 million ha.    Officials from Liaoning Afforestation Bureau said that a  total of two million ha of forests has been growing in the  mountain areas in the eastern part, which protects about 80  percent the sources of water supply in the central industrial  part of the province.    Major reservoirs like the Dahuofang, which supplies water  for  Shenyang and other leading industrial centers in the area,  contain the lowest level of sand among China's large reservoirs  because of the protection of forests.    In the western part of the province, which used to be  plagued  by soil erosion and sandstorms, large numbers of trees and  shelterbelts have been planted since 1978. As a result,  rainfall increased by 30 percent and the amount of sand borne in  water decreased drastically.    In addition, the groundwater table rose in some areas by  three to four meters. Areas around such major cities as  Chaoyang, Jinzhou and Fuxin, which used to import a large amount  of grain, have been turned into rich land and grain has begun to  be exported.    Forests-protecting farmland in the plains also increased to  67,000 ha. Experts say they are protecting a total of 1.33  million ha of farmland. Experiments have proved that  shelterbelts can reduce wind speed by 27 percent and improve the  earth temperature by 1.7 degrees centigrade.    Another one million ha of forests in the coastal areas have  also greatly reduced the damage from the sea winds, experts say.</p>

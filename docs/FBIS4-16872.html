			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, April 18, TURAN--Since the beginning of the  Moscow summit of the CIS leaders on 15 April, Armenian armed  forces have launched a large-scale attack in the direction of  the northern and north-eastern sections of Azerbaijan with the  intent of occupying the main sections of the Geranboyskiy  [Shaumyanovskiy] and Terterskiy regions of Azerbaijan. This  attack was directed towards Ganja, Azerbaijan's second largest  city as well as towards the southern section of the front with  the seizure of the city of Beylagan. TURAN was informed by a  government official who requested anonymity.    The Azeri leadership thinks that this military plan is aimed  at destabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan, thereby compelling  Baku to agree to the Russian proposal concerning the  Armenian-Azeri conflict. It is widely known that the main terms  of the proposal is the stationing of the Russian army in the  conflict zone.    During the Moscow Summit government officials of Armenia  told  Azeri President Aliev that "the Russian army's deployment in the  region of conflict will guarantee a ceasefire."    This statement made by the Armenian officials coincides with  the statement made by Kazimirov, the representative of the  Russian president for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which is  pushing for a Russian peacemaking force role in the region.    It is widely known that Baku insists that the separation  forces should consist of international units and act on the  basis of United Nations and the CSCE mandate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Latvian Government must still adopt a resolution  on participation in the Cocom [Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls] organization, the multilateral  strategic export control coordination committee (?to) monitor  the export of weapons, strategic resources and technology to  former countries of the Warsaw Pact and other communist lands.  It would be in Latvia's interests to accept this system,  because it would stimulate foreign trade and access to  investment, chiefly in such fields as electronics, computer  systems, and high technology, says a press statement from the  Latvian Foreign Ministry. The member states of the Cocom have  changed their strategy of activity, to promote the recovery of  the market of the former communist countries, at the same time  maintaining control over the investigation... [pauses] the  spread of weapons, strategic materials, and technology. The  situation since the end of the Cold War has changed; that is why  the creation of a new organization is planned.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate hopes drive share prices BAD NEWS on the real economy proved no hindrance to stock market optimists yesterday, who quickly switched direction towards confidence that the UK government will be forced to cut domestic interest rates much sooner than expected. Share prices brushed off early uncertainty to advance by 24 points on the FT-SE 100 scale, ignoring late weakness in sterling which was seen as a move before a possible cut in UK rates. The turning point in a sluggish market came after disclosure of a significantly greater jump in UK December unemployment than expected and a similarly disappointing fall in manufacturing output in November. The absence of any move in German rates following yesterday's meeting at the Bundesbank was soon forgotten in London. All the investment hopes based on belief that the UK was recovering from recession, a view already disturbed by this week's news of poor Christmas retail sales, were hurriedly replaced by arguments that the economy was now so bad that the government would be forced to deliver another rate reduction immediately. 'Instead of one large cut in base rates at Budget time, the market now expects two half-point cuts soon - the first, perhaps, in early February,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. The Footsie advanced strongly in the second half of the session, and trading volume also increased. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index was 24.6 ahead at 2,773.3, effectively the best level of the day. Seaq-reported volume jumped to 701.3m shares from Wednesday's 599.4m; retail business remained high on Wednesday, with a worth of Pounds 1.33bn comparing favourably with the daily averages of the past three months. London largely ignored international factors yesterday, including the latest allied raid against Iraq and Wall Street's sluggish performance on the first full day of the Clinton presidency; the Dow Industrial Average was barely changed from overnight in London trading hours. The sudden reversal to more wide-ranging domestic factors in the London stock market was reflected in a sharper rise in the FT-SE Index stocks than in the second-liners; the FT-SE Mid 250 Index added only 9.3 points yesterday. Some analysts suggested that yesterday's relatively firm trend in the stock market against a generally weak economic background underlined optimism for a recovery in the UK economy later in the year. Strategists believe that any rate move might come in the middle of next week, when a suitable opening in the bond funding timetable will appear. Technical factors were also helpful, if perhaps only in the short term. Fears of a large rights issue, specifically from the pharmaceuticals sector, continued to recede, although many analysts warned that pressures from both equity and bond funding were likely to persist this year. At least one very large trading programme moved through the stock market at mid-session and investment confidence was also encouraged by a handful of corporate deals. Shares in ICI, still unsettled as the market awaits news on the planned demerger of the bio-science divisions, advanced on a two-way deal with BASF, the German chemicals group.</p>

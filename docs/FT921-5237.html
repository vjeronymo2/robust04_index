			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Measures to prevent abuse of pensions Sir, I was interested to read that MPs are expected to recommend radical changes in pensions law ('MPs hit at City over pensions regulation', March 3). The Pensions Management Institute takes seriously the abuses occurring within the pensions industry, even though the vast majority of schemes are well managed. The council of the institute believes that measures must be taken to ensure that these shortcomings do not and cannot occur again. We have outlined our views in written evidence to the Commons' social security committee. We are aware that some pension scheme trustees only pay lip service to many aspects of the regulations and no action is taken by the authorities when breaches occur. The Council of the institute believes that associates and fellows of the institute (qualified by professional examinations) should be given a statutory role in supervision. This will improve members' security and safeguard pensions. One cannot legislate against fraud - however, with proper supervision it can be made more difficult. I M Aitken, vice-president, Pensions Management Institute, 124 Middlesex Street, London E1 7HY</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 111 YEARS A 'LIFELONG RESIDENT'  </P> <P> The words "lifelong resident of Vicksburg" mean a lot to Bessie W. Putman --  she reckons 111 years.  </P> <P> Putman celebrated her birthday Wednesday at the Vicksburg Convalescent Home. An  inscription in her family Bible shows that she was born in 1879 in a small  house on the edge of Vicksburg.  </P> <P> The daughter of slaves, Putman said her mother and father died while she was a  baby, and an aunt raised her and her brother. Born Bessie Wilson, she married  Sam Putman in 1900 and had 12 children, most of whom have died.  </P></p>

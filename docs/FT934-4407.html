			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: GE Capital to run Exxon credit card business GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, is to take on the running of Exxon's credit card business, adding an estimated 12m cardholders to the 70m holders of 'private label' credit cards whose accounts it already administers for other retailers. GE Capital, which is also buying Exxon's existing credit card receivables, will administer all aspects of the business, though the cards will continue to bear the Exxon name. Unlike Shell Oil, which last month sought to expand its card business by launching a MasterCard in association with Chemical Bank, Exxon's move suggests that it intends to keep a private label card, available for use only in its own service stations. Like other oil companies, Exxon has been in the credit card business a long time, issuing its first cards in 1929. However, with the exception of Shell Oil, the companies have been slow to move to co-branding, despite the success of co-branded cards issued by AT&amp;T and others. According to MasterCard, there are around 117m private-label oil company cards in issue, generating Dollars 27bn of payments each year.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Two Wiggins companies put into receivership Wiggins Group, the property developer and housebuilder which ran into difficulties as a result of its develop-ments in London's Docklands, yesterday put two companies into administrative receivership. They are Allison Homes and its subsidiary Allison (Contractors), part of the group's housebuilding operations, which had a combined net asset value of Pounds 500,000. They incurred a loss of Pounds 172,000 in the year to March 31. There were 12 redundancies. Mr Stephen Hayklan, Wiggins chairman, said his board was not prepared to put any more money into the companies, given the absence of any upturn in the housing market. Wiggins has no guarantees outstanding in respect of either of these companies and continues housebuilding through Wiggins Homes in the south-west of England. Mr Hayklan said the decision would not affect the rest of the group's business, which now mainly comprises two industrial parks in Kent and Oxfordshire. Wiggins continued to trade within the constraints set by its banks following a financial restructuring in 1990. Wiggins shares closed 1p down at 8p. In May, South Quay, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft office block on the Isle of Dogs, was put into administrative receivership. South Quay was established in 1990 as a separate company as part of the Wiggins restructuring.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLOSING OF ICE SKATING RINK OPPOSED  </P> <P> There are only three full-size ice rinks in the Los Angeles area and only two  with seating for events.  </P> <P> One is going to lose its lease shortly, one is likely to be sold to settle  family differences, and the third is Pickwick in Burbank.  </P> <P> That a rink that has served the public by providing wholesome activities for 30  years suddenly is hopeless is unbelievable.  </P> <P> Please join the Save the Ice Committee in helping to keep sports available by  doing whatever you can to keep Pickwick open.  </P> <P> MARY GRACE CONTRERAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

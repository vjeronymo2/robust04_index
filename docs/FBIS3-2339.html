The gross value of industrial output made by the township  enterprises in 1993 topped 400 billion yuan, a hefty 58 percent  rise from 1992, accounting for 60 percent of the province's  total.    At the same time, about 80 percent of the province's workers  and staff, about 7.3 million people, are in township enterprises.    Half of the counties and cities in south Jiangsu gained 20  billion yuan each from township industrial output value, thus  forming a key industrial area in the country.    In addition, the township sector has also played an  important  part in the province's foreign economic trade.    There are over 10,000 township enterprises which have  economic ties with foreign counterparts. The total foreign  investment in these local companies in 1993 hit 7 billion U.S.  dollars.    The gross exports of the township sector last year reached  more than 56 billion yuan, about 30 percent of the country's  total.    To boost the booming township industrial sector, the  province  has earmarked billions to purchase new advanced equipment and  technology and to renovate old equipment for township  enterprises.    In Wuxi, in southern Jiangsu, each of the companies with an  annual production output of more than 50 million yuan has  established its own research institute.    In 1993, a shareholding system was introduced in township  enterprises to further improve company management and economic  returns.    Farmers for the first time became company shareholders.    So far, over one billion yuan has been raised through the  joint stock mode by some 10,000 such township companies in the  province.    And more than 110 township group companies, each with fixed  assets of over 50 million yuan, have been organized in the  province.    A fast growth of the township sector also has brought about  a  social change in rural areas.    Also in Wuxi city, the average per capita GDP [gross  domestic  product] in 1993 surpassed 10,000 yuan, and the average income  of the farmers also reached 2,240 yuan.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Unions oppose relocation A CIVIL SERVICE union yesterday accused the government of spending public money to bail out private-sector property developers. The First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, said it opposed plans to relocate 2,000 civil servants from the environment and transport departments to London's Docklands. The transfer is due to be completed by the end of next year, and is expected to be to Canary Wharf, the property development owned by Olympia &amp; York.</p>

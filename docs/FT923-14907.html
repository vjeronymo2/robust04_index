			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Private View: The past is a dangerous place A DISSIDENT is a damaged human being, says Jan Urban. That is why the former Civic Forum leader did not stay around to pick up a plum job in the new regime but resigned on the day Czechoslovakia reverted to democracy. Dissidence was a kind of profession. 'It was extremely demanding and one-dimensional,' he said. 'You couldn't trust anybody. You had to live on strict rules and instincts. And I felt this was very unhealthy and I wanted to become normal again.' Countries, like individuals, need to convalesce after the trauma of revolution or war. Strange things happen: the streets are suddenly full of resistance fighters whom nobody remembers seeing before; the real dissidents find themselves accused of collaboration. It had been the same in 1945. Urban talked to his Polish friends. 'They laughed at me and said we had the same experience too. When I started to dig deeper I found out that all nations face this problem.' So Urban has been spending part of his convalescence at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, researching a book on how countries come to terms - or not - with their past. I asked him why dissidents were unpopular, even after a evolution. 'Because we were different, because we were trouble-makers, because - as I found out - to be once a dissident you're dissident for the rest of your life. 'It's an addiction. You become irresponsible, you become so used to being independent that you give loyalty only when you want, on your terms. And I think this is well illustrated by failures of the dissident politicians in eastern Europe these days.' So former dissidents are not fit for government? 'Most of them take politics as a substitute for the old fight; their vision of the world is as a fight. I don't think they are suitable for normal politics. Let's put it this way: they are extremely good, or some are, in destroying things. But as a bricklayer I know well it's not the best qualification for building.' Jan Urban is a graduate of Prague University who qualified as a bricklayer at the age of 35 (he is now 41). He had been sacked from his teaching job nine years before for refusing to condemn the Charter 77 dissidents. He became a race-trace attendant, forklift truck driver, crane driver and building labourer and then wrote for the clandestine newspaper Lidove Noviny. He does not exempt his dissident colleague Vaclav Havel, now seeking re-election as president of a dissolving country, from the charge of post-revolutionary failure; but he recognises Havel's 'immense moral authority'. Anyone who spends time in jail, he said, probably needs the same length of time in which to recuperate. Havel, who served five years, could not face a camera for six months after becoming president. The prisoners' rule is never meet your interrogator's eye. Urban's recuperation means mending things with his wife Elena and daughters Theresa and Kamila. Is your wife part of your rehabilitation? 'Oh, definitely, the most important part.' He laughed. 'Because, just to give you an example, she never knew where I was going because it was safer for both of us. I had to make clear to the other side (the state security police) that I could not be blackmailed through my family and that was tough. We had to learn to live together again as a family and not as a kind of supporting base for a one-man show.' The dissident becomes cut off from his fellow citizens and the outside world. 'The first thing we have to do is just sit down and study, study to bridge this gap. And not to imagine, which I feel is a legacy of the Communist thinking, that politics can change everything by backstage manipulation and putting good people in right places. We have to work on society as a whole.' What makes a man an active dissident? Jan Urban was much influenced by the career of his father, Zdenek, a Communist who resisted the Nazis and rose to be a member of the party's Central Committee. A reformist, he was purged in 1968 after the Soviet tanks invaded, and was finally reduced to menial jobs. He died of a heart attack four years ago after a series of interrogations by the secret police. 'He always told me: 'In 1945 I exchanged my own conscience for the belief that some party knows better. And this is a moral fault. You have a good chance not to fall into the trap. And if you are ready to pay the price, just go on.'' Now the son is following his own peacetime prescription, to study. His book deals with Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain and Czechoslovakia after World War II, with Portugal, Spain and Greece in the 1970s, with Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Brazil in the 1980s, and with eastern Europe since 1989. What he has found is that in nearly every case the past becomes a weapon in the hands of the new regime. History is distorted to legitimise the new leaders and to discredit their political opponents. The reality of life under dictatorship is obscured; so too are the reasons why the mass of the people are so ready - indeed willing - to co-operate. It can take decades for a country to face the truth about itself. Urban thinks such behaviour is only human. 'I didn't have too many ideals about this: I didn't understand how easily most of my compatriots were subdued. 'But I understood that to be openly against an immoral regime in a situation which doesn't give hope for change is absurd, is ridiculous, for men or women who think about the good of their family, of their career, of those normal things. 'And I don't have a problem recognising human fear. I went through lots of it and I just was given the opportunity to learn to live with it - to manage and not to collapse. 'What I dislike are people who were afraid to do anything but now pretend that they were brave and ask for revenge. I don't mind people who recognise yes, they were afraid. I don't even ask them to feel ashamed. What I ask is that they don't tell lies.' Unlike, say, Lech Walesa in Poland, Jan Urban has never been accused of collaboration with the Communists. But it would not be difficult to dig something out of his file. In the summer of 1989 he told his chief interrogator, privately, that he had been tipped off about an underground supply-line of small arms from France. Having first alerted the French and British embassies, he reported it not only because he suspected he was being framed, but also because the dissidents had pledged to have nothing to do with arms or drugs. 'In this very criminal field I would co-operate with any police in the world.' The meeting took place in the street. 'I told him the information. I said 'I won't sign any protocol, I won't mention it again. I don't know whether it is your provocation or not. In a sense I don't care'. And I went home. 'When I was given the chance to meet them in the pub instead of being taken away from my working place, of course I would go to pub.' So it was a life which had its own rules, like a game? 'Oh, definitely.' And did the other side enjoy it as a game? 'Oh, very much.' After the revolution, the records of all this activity lie about like unexploded mines. I asked Urban how they were to be detonated, how the past was to be disinfected. His answer is for an independent commission to be set up by the incoming regime, composed of reputable lawyers, historians, journalists, people from international human rights agencies and former apparatchiks and policemen too. Why do you include them? 'Because they were the people who wrote these documents, who know the techniques, the meaning it had at the time. They are in a sense the only people who can tell the meaning. Those files have to be understood as ordinary historical documents.' The commission should be given a fixed time to report. Then the files should be sealed for 30 years. The report should name those guilty of torture and murder and describe how the regime suppressed dissent. The worst criminals should be prosecuted. For the others, publicity was often punishment enough. 'When you talk to someone, as I did, who is nearly 80 and who has been tortured in 1949 or 1951, of course he needs to finish that story. When you ask what would you like done with that man who tortured you, he replies 'Well, he must be 80 too. What can you do to a senile old man. But I want to see his name public.'' Czechoslovakia's 'lustration' law, enacted last November, bans Communist sympathisers from public office for five years. The law was arbitrary - and a disaster, Urban said. 'I think that we repeated all the mistakes ever done before us and we added some of our own. Our performance in dealing with the past is very, very bad.' Slovak nationalists had seen the law as a way of tarring some of their leaders. An attempt just before last month's elections to incriminate without real proof Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's prime minister, had backfired. 'So I think,' said Jan Urban, 'that poor handling of our past has helped to split up the country.' For the country and for the dissident it is the same: if the future is to work, the past must be given a decent burial.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rebels call for Clark to be put up for sale THE BOARDROOM split at C&amp;J Clark took a further twist yesterday when the rebel directors called on the board to put Britain's largest shoe manufacturer up for sale. A circular is being prepared by the rebels urging shareholders to call for the drawing up of a sale prospectus which would put Clark into play. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, has agreed to act for the four board members. The move comes just four days before the extraordinary general meeting aimed at deposing the chairman, Mr Walter Dickson, and non-executive director, Mr James Power. The rebels are seeking changes to the corporate strategy pursued by Mr Dickson. The requisitionists, as the rebels are named for calling the egm, have proposed two new board candidates, Mr Hugh Pym, ITN journalist, and Mr Michael Markham, a businessman. They claim to represent some 40 per cent of the Clark family holding. The Clarks control 80 per cent of the company through direct stakes and family trusts. Mr Markham said yesterday that the decision to call for a sale came as a result of the approach received from management consultant, Mr Colin Fisher, backed by venture capital group, Electra Investment Trust. 'The requisitionists accept that the company has been put on bid alert,' said Mr Markham. However, he questioned whether an offer backed by Electra - which would depend on the failure of the requisitionists proposals - was in the best interests of all shareholders. 'The company has to get the best offer,' he said. The discussions with Electra 'do not give a flat playing field to anyone else.' The board said yesterday it was aware of the rebel's latest move but it too was considering soliciting other bids through Schroders, its financial adviser. The rebel's efforts to attract bidders is, to some extent, a gesture to the large number of Clark family members who might be interested in selling their holdings. Mr Markham said the requisitionists wanted to dispel any suspicions that they had a 'bunker mentality', an image which could reduce shareholder support on Friday. The company nearly embarked on a partial flotation in 1987. It came close to rounding up support from the necessary 75 per cent of shareholders but it dropped the proposal shortly before an egm.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields spur late buying surge Wall Street A BURST of late buying lifted US share prices across the board yesterday. Earlier, the markets had struggled to make headway after news of a decline in manufacturing activity raised fresh doubts over the strength of the economic recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.91 at 3,446.46. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.27 at 442.46, while the American SE composite finished 1.25 firmer at 422.21 and the Nasdaq composite 5.29 stronger at 666.71. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 225m shares. The markets opened the week in a cautious mood. The first-quarter reporting season proved that corporate profitability is improving, but a slew of recent evidence suggesting that economic growth is slowing down has clouded the outlook for future earnings. Yesterday's economic data was especially disturbing. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of business activity fell to 49.7 per cent in April, from the 53.4 per cent of the previous month. A measure below 50 per cent is indicative of a contracting manufacturing sector, and it is the first time the index has been below 50 per cent since September 1992. Coupled with news of a small decline in March construction spending, the NAPM added to investors' concern about the state of the economy. A rise in bond prices triggered by the NAPM, however, helped stocks to stay in positive territory for most of the day, and a subsequent fall in bond yields spurred a surge of buying in the final hours of trading. Among individual stocks, Eastman Kodak, which has suffered recently because of the turmoil among the company's top management, rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 in busy trading after Kodak's independent board of directors called for a significant improvement in the company's performance, a call that was seen as backing for Kodak's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 113 1/2 after the company unveiled first-quarter net income of Dollars 1.51 a share, up from Dollars 1.38 a share a year earlier. Among the main beneficiaries of the late buying were motor and drug shares. General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 , Ford added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 55 7/8 and Chrysler firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 . In the drugs sector, Merck advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 , Pfizer Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 . Bethlehem Steel put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 19 7/8 in busy trading after the company said it would increase its steel and alloy plate products prices on July 4 to recover manufacturing costs. On the Nasdaq market, Chiron jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 58 on news that in recent tests a herpes vaccine produced by the company in a joint venture with Ciba-Geigy was shown to significantly reduce the frequency of outbreaks. Canada TORONTO closed lower in heavy trading as gold stocks gave back a big chunk of last week's gains. The TSE 300 index fell 15.9 to 3,773.5 and declining issues outnumbered advances by 371 to 327 after volume of 55.7m shares valued at CDollars 550.3m. Nine of the 14 stock groups lost ground, led by the golds sector, off 3.5 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIFTS AND TRIPS FOR SEN. BERGESON  </P> <P> Regarding Sen. Marian Bergeson's candidacy for lieutenant governor: Is this not  the Bergeson who cannot say "no" when gifts and trips are offered, as related  in The Times on March 27? The gifts totaled $21,148, including two trips, one  to New Zealand and another to Egypt.  </P> <P> There is no "free lunch!" If Bergeson does not know this, I don't want her  representing me as a lieutenant governor. Under these circumstances, I do not  like her actions as my state senator. Is this not the bone of contention going  on now in Washington?  </P> <P> MARIE D. HOOVER  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Motoring: Ford passes the bed test SIX YEARS after Ford inexplicably dropped a big load carrier from its range, a Granada/Scorpio estate car has made a welcome appearance. It is a handsome car, spacious enough to pass the acid test of a really big estate; you can put a single bed inside it. It will look just as much at home at a Range Rover and Shogun infested three-day event or point-to-point as in the managing director's reserved parking bay. There are versions with 2-litre, 4-cylinder, 120 horsepower or 2.9-litre, V6 145 horsepower engines, both with catalytic converters. They are priced only marginally higher than their 4-door saloon or 5-door hatchback equivalents. The spread is from Pounds 18,413 for a 2.0-litre Granada LX manual estate to Pounds 21,760 for a V6 2.9-litre Scorpio. This flagship of Ford's estate cars is trimmed in leather and has automatic transmission, air conditioning and self-levelling rear suspension as standard. All Granada/Scorpio models come with ABS brakes. The V6 Scorpio I drove in Scotland earlier this month is far cheaper than any rival equipped to the same standard. But, price apart, Ford's new bulk carrier is an exceptionally attractive car. It rides with shock absorbent suppleness on its redesigned suspension whether running light or well laden. The steering wheel is small and power assistance is now speed sensitive. On winding roads the Scorpio has a much smaller car's nimbleness; on motorways it loafs along in that state of relaxed near silence peculiar to big, long-legged cars. The overall gearing gives close to 30 mph (48kph) at only 1,000 rpm and the Scorpio feels as if it would cruise all day long on the autobahn at 100 mph (161 kph) and a shade over 3,000 rpm. The sensibly proportioned 65 series tyres create little road noise on coarse surfaces. A Granada/Scorpio's interior space should be enough for most users; there is ample room for up to five people and a lot of luggage. But compulsive furniture shifters might like to know that loads of up to 100 kg (220 lbs) can be carried on the integral roof rack or even on the roof panel itself, which has rubber strips to protect the paint. To frustrate car thieves and 'joy riders' - there must be a better name for these criminals - Ford has installed elaborate security systems in the new Granadas and Scorpios. Electrical and mechanical deadlocks prevent window smashers from opening the doors; interior sensing scanners detect an intruder and will not allow the engine to be started. Of course, nothing in this world is entirely thief proof. But the new cars are said to have defeated a former professional car thief who, like a poacher turned gamekeeper, is retained by Ford as a security consultant. All Granada and Scorpio models now have the same improved running gear as the estate cars.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DIRTY WORD;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: PRESERVATION IS GOOD. BUT COMBINED WITH HUMAN MANAGEMENT, IT WOULD  BE EVEN BETTER.  </P> <P> Expanding populations and increasing use of our resources will continue to  cause ever-worsening conflicts between developers (for people) and  preservationists (for wildlife) until we acknowledge that the interests of  people and wildlife are ultimately the same: clean air, clean water, healthful  food and a pleasing environment.  </P> <P> This reconciliation is long overdue. The impetus for this change has come from  the growing awareness among ecologists that human management has helped create  and maintain many eco-systems that were once considered natural and wild. For  example, researchers have learned that the Kayapo Indians of the Amazon gather  trees and plants from an area as large as Western Europe to create the forest  gardens they inhabit that produce food, medicine and building materials, among  other things.  </P> <P> It has also become clear that preservation can protect only a very small part  of the Earth's surface. We need to manage resources more wisely to meet human  needs, maintain habitat for wildlife and species diversity and restore areas  that have been ruined by abuse and neglect.  </P> <P> Although development has become a dirty word, it doesn't have to be.  Development can provide benefits for both people and wildlife if it is done  well. Recent studies of ecologically sophisticated traditional agriculture and  agro-forestry systems from around the world have provided insight on the  methods that can be used to combine development with conservation. The species  diversity within some of these developed environments is remarkably high, with  up to 250 species of trees and plants in some of the villages we have studied  in Mexico. These man-made changes improve the environment for humans and  wildlife, and more bird species are found in developed oases than in wild  oases. The diversity of plant species and a more reliable food supply from  managed landscaping can improve wildlife habitat and provide a better living  for people.  </P> <P> Developers have been crippled by a lack of information and understanding of  resource-conserving approaches to development. While environmental issues are  often viewed by developers as a nuisance (at best), our studies for the City of  Davis showed that strategies for improving energy efficiency and comfort often  reduced costs to developers.  </P> <P> Development in California is destructive largely because planners, developers  and politicians are the product of an educational system that artificially  separates development from food production, wildlife and quality of life.  Engineers, planners and decision-makers learn little about ecosystems  management and resource-conserving design. Farming, which can play a positive  role in improving the cityscape and the quality of life, has been completely  divorced from urban development. This doesn't have to be the case. Shanghai,  for example, still grows 80% of its food within the city, and all Chinese  cities have forestry departments that plant and manage city trees intensively  to provide a wide range of products for people and animals.  </P> <P> Development that is good for people and the environment can be undertaken in  the cities and suburbs of rich as well as poor countries. To meet the goal of  long-term sustainability, development must clearly account for the short- and  long-term cost of services and resources and make a firm commitment to both  environmental quality and quality of life.  </P></p>

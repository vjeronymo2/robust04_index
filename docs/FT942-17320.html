			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Airbus insurers await crash inquiry The British Aviation Insurance Group, which led the underwriting for the Russian-leased Airbus which crashed last month, said yesterday it was 'too early to make a judgement' about reports that the pilot's son was at the controls before the crash. Mr Graham Lilley, senior underwriter, said they would wait for the results of the investigation before even considering whether insurance premiums for Russian International Airlines, the operator, would go up. The claim for the hull of the aircraft alone is likely to cost insurers Dollars 78m (Pounds 53m). There will be an additional but probably smaller amount for liability insurance, which covers the 75 passengers, and baggage and freight. The crashed Airbus was one of five insured last July for around Dollars 400m for the hulls. The risk was placed by Russian insurance company Lex Garant through London insurance broker Willis Corroon. Other US and European aviation specialists shared the risk.</p>

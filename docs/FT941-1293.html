			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Monument rises 65% in spite of weakening oil prices Monument Oil and Gas, the independent exploration and production company, raised pre-tax profits by 65 per cent last year despite the steady weakening of the oil price. The company earned Pounds 7.86m in the year ending December 31, up from Pounds 4.79m the year before. The profit attributable to shareholders nearly doubled from Pounds 4.12m (equivalent to earnings of 0.62p per share) to Pounds 8.11m (1.22p). As in previous years, the directors are proposing to reinvest profits rather than pay a dividend. Monument said the result showed the benefit of its policy of realising the value of mature properties, mainly in the North Sea, and replacing these reserves with new, lower cost developments. A major factor in the improved result was a reduction of the depletion charge from Pounds 16m to Pounds 10.1m as a result of the transition to lower cost fields. The main challenge during the year was securing the Pounds 300m financing for its major Liverpool Bay gas development, which received the go-ahead after some concern that it might be stopped by the government to avoid damaging the coal market. Overall production in 1993 averaged 7,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from the previous year. But output should rise to 30,000 barrels by mid-1996 when the Liverpool Bay, Johnston and Sierra Chata fields come fully on stream. Monument said its policy of active asset management, exploration and cost cutting placed it well for continued growth.</p>

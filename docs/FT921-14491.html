			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow soars to record high as bullish mood returns Wall Street THE STOCK market rally returned with a bang yesterday, as share prices rose sharply across the board to take indices to record closing highs, in spite of disappointing news on December US retail sales, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 60.60 to 3,246.20, its best level in history, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 6.10 to an all-time peak of 420.44. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks eclipsed its previous run of record highs by ending 8.12 stronger at 625.75. Turnover on the New York SE was a heavy 266m shares. Yesterday's gains reversed two days of losses, which were more the result of profit-taking than of a significant change in investor attitudes. Low interest rates, which have made equities look more attractive than other forms of assets, and expectations of an economic recovery by mid-year, are still the dominant forces in the market. The fact that the current reporting season - covering the final quarter of 1991 - has so far included no nasty surprises has also helped to keep sentiment buoyant. Denials from Corning that the best-selling silicone breast implants made by its subsidiary Dow Corning are unsafe, and that full testing has been carried out on the product, initially failed to stem the decline in its share price. At one stage the stock was another Dollars 4 lower, but the feeling that the selling had been overdone spurred late buying and Corning ended unchanged on the day at Dollars 68 3/8 . Dow Corning announced yesterday that it was taking a Dollars 25m charge in the fourth quarter, temporarily laying off some workers and closing two breast implant production lines. Dow Chemical, the other partner in the Dow Corning joint venture and which has escaped most of the recent selling, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/8 . American Express firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 1/8 on reports that the company is considering selling half of its ownership of Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street securities house. The sale, which could be partly to Lehman's management and partly to the public, could raise as much as Dollars 1bn. Citicorp was again the most actively traded stock of the day, rising Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in turnover of 11.27m shares. Investors have been keen on the stock since Monday, when the bank predicted a return to profitability this year. Chase Manhattan, which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 20 1/2 after confirming that it would like to buy Crossland Savings, the troubled New York savings and loan institution, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Chase is believed to want only Crossland's core deposits, and not its loans or branches outside the New York area. Oil issues remained well-bid in the wake of higher petroleum prices. Texaco climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 1/8 , British Petroleum Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 1/2 and Exxon Dollars 1 to Dollars 60 1/4 . Canada TORONTO finished broadly higher in heavy trading in line with the strong gains on the New York Stock Exchange. The composite index forged ahead 40.6 to close at 3,635.0, a 52-week high. Rises led declines by 382 to 237 after volume of 35.2m shares. Fleet Aerospace gained 39 cents to CDollars 1.45. A newspaper report said Belgian firm Promavia International is in talks concerning an equity investment in Fleet, including a possible takeover. However, Fleet said it had received no such proposals.</p>

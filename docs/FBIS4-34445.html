			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro returned to the  fatherland at 0424 GMT on 17 June from Cartagena de Indias,  where he participated in the fourth Ibero-American summit of  heads of state and government.    Fidel met Colombian businessmen from the financial and  investment sectors hours before returning to Havana. Fidel also  held a comprehensive meeting with those expressing Colombia's  solidarity with Cuban organizations. During the 16 June meeting  with those expressing solidarity with Cuban organizations,  Castro stressed that Latin America still lacks a true sense of  integration, although the summits help this.    He added that the main obstacle to Latin American  integration  is the United States, which wants to divide the continent and  limit its independence. Fidel pointed out that this is why  Washington advocates bilateral accords, just as it did regarding  the foreign debt which it negotiated one on one because it does  not want to face a united Latin America. Fidel also stated that  the Ibero-American summits are so important that the enemy to  the north was envious and called another summit in Miami, a city  which it hopes to turn into the Latin American capital. As in  his Cartagena address, Fidel reiterated that Cuba is not opposed  to that summit even though Cuba believes it was cowardly to  exclude Cuba since U.S. leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and  the truth. He added that this shows political weakness. Fidel  pointed out that he would attend if he were invited, even to  Miami. The organizers, however, have already said that this  will not happen. He explained that he is not opposed to the  summit because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly  defend the region's interests in that forum.</p>

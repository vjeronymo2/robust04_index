			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] KANU's [Kenya African National Union] Apili  Wawire was today declared the winner of the Lugari by-election  after trouncing his closest rival, Burudi Nabwera. [passage  omitted] The hotly contested race, seen as a battle between KANU  and FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya, saw  repeat results of the 1992 general elections when Wawire, on a  FORD-Asili ticket, beat Nabwera then seeking reelection on a  KANU ticket. Today's counting was temporarily stopped for 50  minutes, from 0730, after protests from FORD-Kenya officials.  The counting, however, resumed at 0820.    With the results from Lugari, KANU now controls 103 seats in  Parliament, FORD-Kenya 30, FORD-Asili 28, Democratic Party of  Kenya 22, and the smaller parties -- Kenya Social Congress,  Kenya National Congress and PICK [Party for Independent  Candidates of Kenya] -- each with one seat. Two seats remain  vacant following the death of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga in Bondo,  FORD-Kenya, and Josephat Karanja, the late FORD-Asili MP for  Githunguri who will be buried today.</p>

This new airplane will utilize new avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of lightning and high-intensity radiated fields. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before October 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this proposal may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket (ANM&hyph;7), Docket No. NM&hyph;93, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel at the above address.

These special conditions are proposed requirements to protect the airplane systems from the effects of lightning and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Cessna, commenting to the docket by letter, noted that there were differences in the preamble language from the language used in issue papers that discussed the proposed method of compliance with these special conditions. The FAA agrees. Although the special conditions proposed herein have not changed from the original notice, the methods of compliance discussed in the issue papers that preceded the original notice were in fact different in certain respects than the methods of compliance discussed in the original notice. The FAA inadvertently left out Cessna's proposed alternate methods of complying with the proposed special conditions. As the methods of compliance proposed by Cessna deviate in certain respects from previous methods of compliance with the proposed special conditions, the FAA agrees these methods should also be made available for the public record and comment as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 15, 1991, Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna), 6030 Cessna Blvd., P.O. Box 7704, Wichita, KS 67277&hyph;7704, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 750 (Citation X) airplane. The Cessna Model 750 is a T-tail, low swept wing, medium-sized business jet powered by two GMA&hyph;3007C turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 6,000 pounds thrust. The flight controls will be powered and capable of manual reversion. The airplane has a seating capacity of up to twelve passengers, and a maximum takeoff weight of 31,000 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Type Certification Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of &sect;21.17 of the FAR, Cessna must show, except as provided in &sect;25.2, that the Model 750 (Citation X) meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;74. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 750 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendment 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. No exemptions are anticipated. The special conditions that may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these proposed special conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

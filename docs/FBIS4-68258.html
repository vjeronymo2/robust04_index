			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Colonel-General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov </F> by Aleksandr Ivanov, place and date not given: "Air Defense  Troops Will Be the Basis for Creation of an Aerospace Defense"]    [Text] On the eve of a military professional holiday  we traditionally talk about the problems, concerns, and affairs  of the "birthday boys." That is why our correspondent met with  the CINC of the Air Defense Troops Col-Gen of Aviation Viktor  Prudnikov.    [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, what has changed in the PVO  [Air Defense] Troops in the last year?    [Prudnikov] A lot has changed. These changes are associated  primarily with military reform.    The Order of the President of the Russian Federation and the  corresponding order of the Ministry of Defense practically gave  a new face to the PVO Troops. In the future they will be the  basis for creation of Russia's aerospace defense. That is a  natural future, because the air and space spheres are so  interrelated that they have long been viewed as an inseparable  whole.    The principle of formation of the PVO system will also be  changed. It will acquire a quite different content and will  become territorial. Within the time periods designated by the  defense minister, zones and regions of air defense will be  created. It remains only to establish them legally, through the  appropriate documents. I assume that this will require special  study.    If we consider the specific results of combat readiness and  activity of the troops, then it must be stressed that we have  been able to preserve the quality and reliability of the PVO  while reducing them quantitatively.    My second point is that all outmoded arms and equipment have  been eliminated. Units and subunits are equipped now with the  most modern and powerful systems and complexes which will make  it possible to retain efficiency of use while shrinking the  combat formations.    But perhaps one of the most urgent problems is the fate of  those who work at radar consoles, in the cockpits of the fighter  interceptors, in the missile systems. Last year was quite hard  for them. As a result of the cut, thousands of officers and  warrant officers were released. And although we tried, to the  extent possible, to allow for the interests and desires of each,  I cannot say that the process is a painless one. Even those who  do not fall under the cuts begin to lose confidence in tomorrow.    This situation requires that the military council, the troop  command and the cadre organs conduct purposeful work to  strengthen social protection, and requires an individual  approach in deciding the fate of each who is subject to the  organizational personnel measures. We strive to do everything so  as not to offend those who faithfully served the Fatherland for  many years. We will not discharge service members without  apartments.    The current material and financial support of the troops is  a  matter of concern. Last year we were not able to achieve  regularity in payments even of pay and allowances. Even now in a  number of units service members have not received their pay for  March. It is hard for the families of officers and warrant  officers to live under these conditions, for most of them have  no other sources of income.    We are striving to distribute the money we do get as  uniformly as possible. I have ordered that we first satisfy the  remote garrisons, and that officer personnel receive their pay  last.    [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, how then is the main mission  of  the PVO Troops, maintenance of high combat readiness, being  accomplished?    [Prudnikov] In the near future, if we do not thoroughly  correct the system for supplying the units with resources to  conduct combat training in a planned fashion, then I must say  bluntly that the status of combat readiness will begin to drop.  By this I mean that the fliers must fly, and the missilemen and  the radar operations must turn on their systems and perform  their training drills and fires. Daily training must be  conducted. And this is not happening today to the full extent  because we don't have the resources.    Nonetheless, combat training is proceeding. For now we have  tried to conduct everything that was planned for this training  year, the exercises, fires, operational assemblies, and  conferences in their full extent and on time.    [Ivanov] Just a year ago, monitoring of the use of Russian  air space was a very serious problem. What is the state of  affairs now?    [Prudnikov] Unfortunately this question has not been  resolved. In order to have everything necessary to monitor the  air border and the flights of aircraft through it, we must  perform a great volume of work, very expensive by today's  standards. The normative documents are also necessary, to  regulate the use of Russian air space. Their lack makes it  harder for the PVO Troops to perform their missions.    I won't say that this state of affairs has led to any  flagrant violations. Virtually everything depends on the  discipline of those who pilot the aircraft. But we have already  encountered incidents of violations. Not long ago we were  compelled to use the on-duty air forces to force an intruder  aircraft to land at Mineralnyye Vody for a customs inspection.    [Ivanov] The PVO Troops have already experienced several  cuts. Now there is a new stage. But is there some sort of limit  in numerical strength and the complement of the groupings beyond  which the combat readiness of the troops will drop?    [Prudnikov] The minimal acceptable numerical strength of  personnel and PVO groupings have been calculated. The figure was  reported to the leadership of the Armed Forces. I will say that  there is understanding of the problem. Now the Main Staff of the  service is working on proposals to reduce the troops in such a  way as not to do harm to their combat strength.    [Ivanov] In 1991, ex-president Gorbachev ordered the  creation  of the Strategic Deterrence Forces, to which troops of the  Missile-Space Defense were assigned from the PVO Troops. As far  as I know, even now there is talk of variants of a transfer of  the Missile-Space Defense Troops to another Armed Service. The  motivation is simple, they say these troops are not precisely  working in air defense.    [Prudnikov] My opinion is not based on that fact that there  is no need to transfer anything to anyone. If it helps matters,  then there's nothing more to say.    But let us see how and why the Missile-Space Defense was  included in the PVO system. They proceeded first of all from the  fact that to ensure safe protection of the state from air and  space, a strong command and control system was needed. It was  created, and it works successfully. And it would not be  advisable to touch anything in it today, let alone tear  something out.    [Ivanov] One last question, Viktor Alekseyevich. Recently  various high state and military authorities have been receiving  letters in which veterans and service members have expressed  their concern about the future of the PVO Troops. You have  partly answered this. Still, how well-founded is their alarm?    [Prudnikov] At present a very serious and intense study is  in  progress to determine the structure of Russia's air defense. As  far as I know, the proposals have been reasonable,  well-considered, and not directed toward weakening the combat  might of the PVO. But I must say the following in this regard.  There is no need to sound a false alarm, at times without  knowing the actual situation, or pelting the country's and the  Armed Forces' leadership with collective letters. I don't think  anyone will allow the collapse of the air defense.    I want to congratulate all of those who serve in the PVO  Troops, and the industrialists and contractors on their holiday,  and to thank them for their selfless labor and devotion.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Downturn at upholstery arm behind Airsprung's decline Profits at Airsprung Furniture Group have again been checked by a poor result in its upholstery division. Its pre-tax profits in the half-year to end-September slipped from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.33m. The Wiltshire-based group's three other divisions all achieved significant advances, with total sales rising by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 33.1m). Mr Michael Coppel, joint chairman, described it as 'a good result, bearing in mind the current trading environment'. The interim dividend is being maintained at 1.7p, covered 3.5 times by earnings per share of 5.89p (6.41p). Airsprung is the second biggest UK manufacturer of beds, and this division saw a profits rise of 6.4 per cent on sales up 7.7 per cent. Profits and sales of the show-wood division increased by more than a third. The fillings division improved profits by 6.2 per cent on sales up nearly 10 per cent. In upholstery, there was static turnover and an adverse swing of Pounds 420,000 took the division into a small loss. Mr John Pierce, chief executive, said one problem had been a new range which had not been thoroughly costed and had effectively sold at a loss.

The group would have no option but to pass on the costs in higher prices early in the new year. 'I think all companies in the furniture industry face this pressure and can't absorb the cost increases further.'</p>

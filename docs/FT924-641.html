			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Letter: Privatisation - gas provides a lesson Sir, Proposals put forward by Sir James McKinnon, the gas regulator, that British Gas should be divided and his remarks on the permanency of conditions in the prospectus, which undoubtedly proved attractive to investors at the time, highlight the uncertainty facing users of postal services. In announcing its plans to privatise ParcelForce and the wider review of the Post Office, which could result in further privatisation, the government has committed itself to the continued provision of nation-wide parcels and letters services at uniform and affordable prices and a nationwide network of post offices. It has been stated unequivocally that these requirements are not negotiable. Last month the council which I chair submitted its views on the government's two initiatives. In the case of ParcelForce we have stressed that if the universal service obligation is accepted by a purchaser it is important that the means are put in place to enforce the honouring of that obligation. Users expect appropriate machinery to be established to ensure the required standard of service, price and adherence by the provider. They also need to know how government proposes to guarantee continuation of the universal service should the purchaser of ParcelForce fail or, as is now occurring in the case of British Gas, a significant change of direction be mooted some years on. Similar guarantees and the means to enforce them will be required in the event of a decision to privatise Royal Mail or Post Office Counters. Our understanding is that these issues are still under consideration by government. I believe it is vital that careful account is taken of the implications and the outcome of what Sir James McKinnon has now proposed for British Gas.

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: A masterly 'Wozzeck' revived - Max Loppert enjoys the ENO production of Berg's opera DAVID Pountney's English National Opera production of Wozzeck, new two years ago, is revived this season under the supervision of Nancy Duguid. It proves once again an altogether masterly piece of opera-staging, full of ripe singing-acting performances and sharply defined theatrical images, and everywhere stamped by a confident clarity in stating and fusing both music and drama which is even now a rarity in accounts of Berg's opera. Down to the control of body-language - natural (but horribly down-cast) movements for Wozzeck, Marie and the child, for everyone else a set of precisely planned physical variations on themes of urban dehumanisation and horror-comic dementia - the production team manifests a concern for theatrical distinctness of vision that tells in every detail. The flat planes, corrugated-iron surfaces, boxed-in apertures and split-level division of Stefanos Lazaridis's single set, brilliantly imagined and achieved, function simultaneously as space and symbol; the influence of Grosz and Dix (socially critical cartoon-images of scathing grotesquerie) and also of the early surrealists is apt, and fully absorbed. One watches and listens enthralled but (as it were) at a remove: on the simplest level, should not this of all operas harrow the spectator's emotions more fiercely than it did mine at the Coliseum on Thursday? Sometimes the actual events of the opera seem distanced - the brutality of the Doctor, enacting his examination on the upper level, fails to land its solar-plexus punch - while at other times the very sophistication of the stage technique (as evidenced in the beautifully coloured water-visions of the murder scene) seems to place an extra layer of 'art' between Berg's already elaborately wrought structure and his audience. No production of this miraculous, unrepeatable masterpiece offers everything; and Pountney's deserves the highest praise for his determination to 'translate' Berg's theatrical language, in all its forcefulness and economical fluidity, onto this (for Wozzeck) inhospitably large stage. Most of the original principals have returned for the revival: fine in 1990, they show themselves still finer now, deeper, sharper-edged, more emotionally robust. Donald Maxwell in the title role, singing with extraordinary musicality and an encyclopaedic (but never self-consciously applied) range of tone-colours, dominates the performance in a way only the best Wozzecks can. In doing so, indeed, he provides the strongest argument for Pountney's production style: he acts as its pivotal point. Kristine Ciesinski, physically so much in the skin of Marie's desperate lusts and also her searing, hopeless guilty outbursts, has refined her singing still further - the voice spreads less and displays its natural warmth even more. Alan Woodrow (a superbly powerful Captain) and Richard Angas (an insidiously fascinating Doctor, albeit with unclear words) are also welcome revenants; among the newcomers Ian Caley makes a great deal more than one expected him to of Pountney's operetta-cliche Drum Major (the single weakest element in the staging), and Alasdair Elliott's Andres is lyrical and unforced. The conductor, Richard Armstrong, is apparently less careful about letting through the words of the Blackall-Harford translation than his predecessor, Mark Elder, and less preoccupied with supply-shaped orchestral playing, but even more gripped by the dramatic intensity of the music. The D-minor Interlude burst over the theatre as it must, with shocking ferocity. Wozzeck is never going to be anyone's idea of an operatic Good Night Out; to those whose ambitions for the medium are more elevated, this ENO revival merits a vigorous recommendation. Revival sponsored by Peter Moores Foundation; in repertory until November 26</p>

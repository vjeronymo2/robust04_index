			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Dealing with the withholding tax - Italy is reforming its rules on the bond levy OFFICIALS at the Italian Ministry of Finance say reimbursements of withholding tax due to foreign holders of domestic government bonds will be made within 60 days of applications being received. The commitment to repay promptly follows the introduction of new procedures last month. As a result, the officials say they hope to clear the backlog of withholding tax payments, some of which have been outstanding for almost five years, in time for Italy's annual September mini-budget. According to the officials, the Finance Ministry is also considering the wholesale abolition of withholding tax for foreign bondholders. 'We haven't excluded the hypothesis of abolition,' one said. The news on withholding tax is bound to intensify the growing competition between the Italian and Spanish government bond markets, both of which have been attracting greater numbers of foreign investors this year. The relatively high-coupon Italian and Spanish government bond markets have been the best performing in Europe this year. The Italian decision to introduce an accelerated procedure for repaying withholding tax follows closely on last week's announcement that the Spanish Treasury is preparing new rules to facilitate the quick repayment of a 25 per cent withholding tax on government paper bought by non-residents. According to the Italian officials, application forms for the repayment of withholding tax, which has been levied at 12.5 per cent since 1987, were sent to foreign embassies earlier this month. The forms, which come in separate versions for normal investors and supranational organisations respectively, have now been circulated among the banking community in Italy and abroad. Finance Ministry officials do not know when the first returns, which will be collated by depository banks, acting as intermediaries between investors and the Italian authorities, will be returned. However, one depository bank in Milan said that it expected to send its first repayment claims to Rome 'within a matter of days'. The Finance Ministry officials estimate that withholding tax repayments will cost L350bn (Dollars 268.4m) in the first year. That will rise to L600bn if the accelerated procedure, which will remove a serious thorn in the flesh of the Italian market as far as foreign investors are concerned, stimulates trading as expected. Full-scale abolition of withholding tax for eligible foreigners has not been ruled out for a later stage. 'Abolition is one of the solutions which is being studied,' says a senior aide to Mr Rino Formicam, the finance minister. 'The minister is actively interested in the solution of this problem.' Abolition would remove the need to process repayment applications - a procedure which could become more onerous if the market continues to develop at its present pace. It would also act as a further stimulus to trading, which is now running at around L5,000bn, with daily peaks of up to L6,500bn, on the screen-based primary dealers' market alone. 'In the end, it's in our interest to attract capital,' said the official. The Finance Ministry recognises that by removing withholding tax it runs the risk of allowing abuses, should local investors buy bonds through foreign vehicles in order to escape taxation. 'The danger is of private Italian investors taking their money to a fiduciary outside Italy,' noted one dealer. 'But we have argued that the effect, if only minimal, could be ignored. And if there are big flows, the effect would be beneficial in bringing interest rates down.' Ironically, the chances of eliminating the tax for eligible foreigners will probably depend on how well the new repayment procedure performs. If it comes up to scratch, the Italian authorities will feel under much less pressure to move further. To accelerate processing, the Finance Ministry is centralising repayments in Rome, in order to allow maximum flexibility in staff allocation, and to enable senior officials to keep direct tabs on the speed with which claims are being treated. However, officials recognise that they could face difficulties meeting their planned timetable as they are still uncertain about the level of demand for repayment and the type of claims likely to be made. 'Obviously, it's much easier to process a relatively small number of big claims than hundreds or thousands of smaller ones,' says the official. After having waited almost five years in some cases to get their money back, foreign investors will be pleased that the need for repayment has finally been recognised as an issue. However, they will also need to be convinced that the system will work.</p>

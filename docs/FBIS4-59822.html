			<p>BFN     [Text] The installation of the Transitional National  Council is expected to take place on 18 May. The news was  carried by the Algerian news agency [APS], which quoted a  well-informed source. The same source added that the  Transitional National Council will be made up of 178 members, 22  of whom will be leaders of political parties and 21 others  leaders of associations.    Over to Aicha Degha for more details:    The Transitional National Council is a legislative body that  will reinforce the constitutional apparatus stipulated in the  document of consensus, which in turn constitutes a point of  reference for the transitional period. This transitional period  will last three years before a return to the electoral process.    According to the APS dispatch, the seats of some political  parties that did not take in the national dialogue conference  will remain vacant. The distribution of seats according to age  shows that 52 members are 40 years old at the most and that the  youngest member of the transitional national council was born in  1969, while the oldest was born in 1918.    These figures indicate that the council takes into account  all age groups. Moreover, many members of this body are highly  educated university graduates.</p>

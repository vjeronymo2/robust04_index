In less than 48  hours he will visit Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. In  Brasilia, where he will stay for six hours tomorrow evening, he  will meet with President Itamar Franco, attend a meeting with  Brazilian society representatives, and have dinner with Minister  Celso Amorim.    That is very little time to make any decision of great  impact. In any case, in order to avoid making his presence in  the country a mere matter of protocol, Brazilian diplomats are  earnestly working to give it some meaning, and it is almost  certain that one of the results of his visit will be the  reactivation of a science and technology agreement between the  two countries that has been paralyzed for years.    The agreement never went beyond a piece of paper because of  several bilateral litigations in the past few years in this  field (informatics and intellectual property rights). Given  that the patents rights issue was solved last month and the  U.S.-Brazilian agenda cleared in that subject, it is very  probable that after the meeting between Gore and Franco the  decision to activate the agreement will be announced.    Another sure subject of conversation between Gore and Franco  is the Americas Summit scheduled for December in Miami. This is  a very bad date for Brazil, which will be represented by a  president (Itamar Franco) who has hardly a few weeks of  government ahead of him. It will be the first meeting of  continental chiefs of state since the Punta del Este meeting in  1967, and the first summit in history with the presence of  presidents only elected in free elections (the only two American  countries that do not fit this definition -- Cuba and Haiti  --were not invited).</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: America West flies out of Chapter 11 America West Airlines yesterday became the last of three big US airlines to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the reorganisation of Continental Airlines and TWA last year. The new America West will be effectively controlled by Air Partners, the same investment group that brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy last year and which now owns 28 per cent of Continental. One of Air Partners' principals is Mr David Bonderman, the Texas financier who is Continental's non-executive chairman. Air Partners is the leader of a consortium called AmWest Partners, which has invested Dollars 214.9m in America West in return for 33.5 per cent of its shares and 71.2 per cent of the voting interest. Other members of the consortium are Continental Airlines itself; Mesa Airlines, a regional carrier based in New Mexico; and Fidelity Investments, the largest US mutual funds group. Of the remainder of the shares, 59.5 per cent is now held by unsecured creditors, 5 per cent by previous shareholders, and 2 per cent by GPA, the aircraft leasing group which was the biggest secured creditor. America West said the investment agreement provided for alliance agreements with Continental and Mesa that included code-sharing, frequent flyer ground handling and marketing agreements that would produce annual benefits of at least Dollars 40m to America West.</p>

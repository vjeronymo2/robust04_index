			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Rise of 15.7% in beer production BEER production for June was 3.4m barrels, up 15.7 per cent on June last year. Adjusted production (production plus imports and minus exports) was 3.63m barrels, up 16.7 per cent. The Brewers' Society said the rise 'must be seen in the context of two additional brewing days this year, and the comparison with a particularly bad June last year'. Adjusted production for the year to June was 37.16m barrels, down 1.5 per cent on the 12 months to June last year. The society said this figure 'more accurately reflects the state of retail sales, which are still depressed'.</p>

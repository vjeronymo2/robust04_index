			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Caterpillar strikers defiant: Company's deadline passes for return to work THE United Auto Workers' five-month-old strike at Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, appears to have held firm yesterday morning, despite a deadline set by the company for workers to return. The company, based in Peoria, Illinois, has demanded that all striking workers return under the terms of their last contract offer or risk losing their jobs. It said if striking union members failed to come back to work, it would begin recalling laid-off employees and hiring permanent replacements. Only a modest number of the 12,600 striking workers were reported to have crossed picket lines by the deadline yesterday morning. By Caterpillar's estimate, more than 300 workers had crossed the lines. The company said it was encouraged by the number that returned. No violent incidents were reported despite widespread anger among union members. The UAW's main branch in Peoria said that non-stop meetings were held through the weekend to calm irate workers. Mr Jerry Baker, chief of the UAW's local bargaining committee, said that emotions were running high and that the union was trying to avert any violence at company gates. 'It's a very volatile situation and I'm afraid that just a spark could set things off,' said Mr Baker. The company said the deadline was only the beginning of a process and that it expected that more strikers would return to work in the days ahead. It also acknowledged the union's frequently repeated claim that it will be difficult to find replacements for Caterpillar's highly skilled workforce and that training would have to be fairly extensive.</p>

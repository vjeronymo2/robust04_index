			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Labour steps up attack on SNP THE LABOUR party yesterday stepped up its attempt to head off any surge in support for the Scottish National Party. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, subjected the SNP's spending plans to the kind of critical analysis the Tories have applied to those of Labour. Mr Smith accused the nationalists of trying to 'con the Scottish people'. Speaking in Edinburgh he said it was widely accepted that identified government expenditure in Scotland exceeded tax raised by Pounds 3.7bn. As to unidentifiable government spending on Scotland, it was unlikely that the cost of an independent Scotland's defence and diplomatic service would be less than its share of the current UK expenditure under those headings. The SNP, he said, expected to fill the Pounds 3.7bn gap with revenues from North Sea oil but the UK government's total oil revenues this year would be only Pounds 1.4bn and an independent Scotland would not be able to claim all of that. Mr Smith said that the SNP had committed itself to additional spending of Pounds 4.67bn, according to specific commitments in the 'Queen's speech to a Scottish parliament' presented by Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, last October. This included Pounds 3.7bn to write off all local-authority housing debt. Mr Salmond said that Mr Smith 'does not understand the public-sector borrowing requirement'. The Pounds 3.7bn write-offs on local authority council debt would be spread over four years and would be a transfer of debt from one part of the public sector to another, which would have no impact on the PSBR.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Reminder to Cambodia"] </F>   [Text] It is a pity that there is a resurgence of the old  attitude Thailand once had toward Cambodia in history. This  should not be allowed to happen; it is the duty of both the Thai  and Cambodian people to prevent a repeat of history. A feeling  of rift is re-emerging between Thailand and Cambodia because  Cambodian Government leaders have kept on, unfairly and without  substantiation, accusing Thailand of giving help to the Khmer  Rouge and its leaders.    The Thai Government, through its Foreign Ministry, has done  the right thing in denying the charges and rejecting the  condemnations by the Cambodian Government. It has thus given an  assurance to the Thai people that neither the government nor the  military has in any way committed an improper act, as alleged by  the Cambodian Government. Without any clarification from the  government, the Thai people could become perplexed by the  negative information from the Cambodian Government and doubt the  integrity of their own government and military authorities.    Before announcing the statement denying the accusations by  the Cambodian leaders, concerned cabinet ministers and security  officers -- the foreign, defense, and interior ministers, and  high-ranking security officers -- held a joint meeting at the  Foreign Ministry. Although such a joint meeting should have  taken place a long time ago, it was a prompt and commendable  action taken by the administration, which had an effective  psychological impact on the people. The government should  display more of this kind of coordination in its work.    The government's statement made clear that Thailand had not  helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to escape into Thailand, or had  given support in any form to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks  against the Cambodian Government troops. It stated that the  accusation made by the Cambodian Government was unfounded. The  Thai foreign minister called upon the Cambodian Government to  show the evidence to Thailand since the Cambodian prime minister  claimed that he had pictures to substantiate his accusations.    It is now the responsibility of the Cambodian Government --  either First Prime Minister Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh  or Second Prime Minister Hun Sen -- to produce the evidence of  Thailand giving help to the Khmer Rouge. If there is no proof  for the accusation, the Cambodian Government will be  discredited. Through his condemnations of Thailand, Prince  Ranariddh has stirred up in the Thai people a negative feeling  toward the Cambodian leaders. Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh  should not forget that Thailand once served as a refuge for him  when his own country was ravaged by war.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Exporters upset by harmonisation Fierce opposition by Europe's exporters to European Commission plans to harmonise medium- and long-term export credit insurance regimes will be voiced in Brussels today when a delegation representing Germany, Holland, Spain, France and the UK meets senior Commission officials, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports from London. Proposals to limit bank credit cover will top a nine-point list of complaints about proposed changes. The Commission is planning to trim cover to 95 per cent of the proportion of an export contract's value covered by export credit agencies. This contrasts with the UK practice of covering the full value of a buyer credit.</p>

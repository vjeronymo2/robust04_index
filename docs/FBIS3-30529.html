It is also  disturbed at the changes being carried out in the Ministry of  Defense, weakening civilian control over the military. This was  reported by Tomasz Nalecz, deputy chairman of the National  Defense Commission, after the Thursday meeting of its Presidium.    On 16 December last year, in a recommendation to the prime  minister, the commission queried the linking of posts in the  Ministry of Defense, the National Security Bureau, and the  Presidential Chancellery. In the view of deputies, this  "strikes at the constitutional principle of the division of the  supreme state authorities and also creates confusion as to  prerogatives." The deputies are still waiting for the prime  minister's reply.    According to the Defense Ministry, the linking of posts by  Milewski is in accordance with the law.    In the view of the commission, the announced reorganization  in the Defense Ministry is leading to the weakening of civilian  control over the army. "Deputies [in the commission] found out  about these changes from the press, despite the fact that  Minister Milewski promised the commission that he would not have  any secrets from them," Nalecz said. He added that he is "also  surprised by the tone of hostility toward parliament in certain  statements by representatives of the Ministry of Defense."    The changes in the Defense Ministry are based on the  reorganization of the ministry's management structures and also  of the departments answerable to the secretary of state in the  Ministry of Defense, Milewski. The plans envision that two  deputy ministers posts will remain and the linking of two  civil-military hierarchies, those for welfare matters and for  defense policy.</p>

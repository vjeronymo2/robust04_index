			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO STATES OK MILK HORMONE MORATORIUMS  </P> <P> Opponents of a genetically engineered drug for cows were handed what they  called a "major political victory" on Friday when Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G.  Thompson imposed a moratorium on use of bovine somatotropin (BST) by the  state's dairy farmers until June 1, 1991.  </P> <P> That action triggered a similar moratorium in Minnesota signed late Thursday by  Gov. Rudy Perpich.  </P> <P> Minnesota's moratorium was a "trigger" law, designed to take effect if  Wisconsin, its primary competitor in cheese and other milk products,  implemented a temporary ban.  </P> <P> Together, the two states produce about 20% of the nation's milk, and the action  is a significant blow to the four companies -- Monsanto, Eli Lilly, American  Cyanamid and Upjohn -- making the synthetic protein. The companies contend that  the drug, a copy of the protein hormone that controls milk production in cows,  is safe. Approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration is not expected  until the spring of 1991.  </P> <P> Thompson actually vetoed the more stringent of two bills on BST, and through  his line-item veto powers shortened the moratorium. Additionally, the bill he  signed provides funding for biotechnology education and further studies of the  potential effects of BST on human and animal health and on family dairy farms.  </P> <P> Opponents said the potential 10% to 25% increase in milk production and  resultant lower milk prices would be a fatal blow to family dairy farms.  Similar legislation is pending in Vermont, New York and Pennsylvania. Jeremy  Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said that with the two  moratoriums, BST opponents "have a bit of a steamroller going now."  </P> <P> "We're disappointed but don't regard it as a significant setback," said Larry  O'Neill of Monsanto. "In the long run, we believe the product's merits will  prevail."  </P></p>

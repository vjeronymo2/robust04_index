			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / US and China to extend economic links China and the US have agreed to extend economic co-operation following a visit to Beijing by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary. Mr Bentsen and China's finance minister, Mr Liu Zhongli, reinstated annual sessions of the Joint Economic Committee to assist closer contact. Yesterday's was the first session of the JEC since before the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. But Mr Bentsen also repeated his warning that Beijing could not take continued improvement in Sino-US relations for granted. He told senior Chinese officials that further economic co-operation depended on progress on human rights. 'There's been progress (on human rights) but more has to be done,' he said. Mr Bentsen was referring to conditions outlined last year by President Bill Clinton for renewal this year of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status, which facilitates access to the vast US market through lower tariffs. Mr Clinton has called for 'overall, significant progress,' including improved conditions in Chinese prisons, the release of political prisoners, an end to the practice of exporting prison-made items and more sensitive treatment of Tibet. Among issues agreed at yesterday's JEC meeting between Mr Bentsen and Mr Liu were: The establishment of three joint working groups to meet twice yearly to examine monetary and banking issues, exchange system reform and investment and economic co-operation. A visit to China this year by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, to advise on monetary reform and other issues. A Chinese undertaking to improve access to the Chinese market for foreign 'financial institutions'. Banks will be allowed 'on an experimental basis' to engage in local currency-denominated business. The two sides also pledged to join in efforts to strengthen regional economic co-operation 'aimed at promoting sustained growth'. China has agreed to attend a meeting of finance ministers from the member countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Mr Bentsen's arrival in Beijing followed a review of policy which concluded it was in the US interest to 're-engage' the Chinese leadership, especially on economic issues.</p>

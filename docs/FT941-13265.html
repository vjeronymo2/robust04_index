			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: US drugs groups hit by pressure from buyers Merck and Warner Lambert, two of the US's biggest drugs groups, reported a slow-down in sales of pharmaceuticals in the final quarter of last year, reflecting the growing pressure from large buyers in the US and governments to hold down drug costs. Merck reported a 6 per cent rise in sales in the final quarter, to Dollars 2.7bn, before the effects of the takeover of the Medco drug distribution business in November and the sale of the group's Calgon division. The strength of the US dollar also held back the growth in sales, which would otherwise have been 8 per cent in the period, said Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive. Merck said that sales for the year, up 6 per cent at Dollars 10.2bn excluding Medco, were held back by 'government cost control actions, primarily in Germany, strong competition in the US and the slowing growth in the cholesterol-lowering market, particularly in the US'. However, it added that it had seen 'strong unit sales gains' in several new products. For the quarter, net income rose to Dollars 674m, or 56 cents a share, from Dollars 609m, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Without the earnings dilution due to the Medco acquisition, earnings per share in the latest quarter would have been 62 cents. Post-tax profits for the full year, before accounting changes, were Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 1.87, down 11 per cent from the year, although before restructuring charges and the effects of Medco they were 11 per cent ahead, at Dollars 2.7bn. Warner Lambert saw a 7 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales last year, to Dollars 2.1bn, 3 per cent of which was accounted for by the strength of the dollar. The results were also hit by a ruling from US regulators that forced the company to close temporarily its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, leading to lost sales of Dollars 135m. Sales in Warner Lambert's consumer products group, on the other hand, rose 11 per cent during the year, with an 18 per cent growth rate outside the US, 22 per cent after adjusting for exchange rates. Warner Lambert reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of Dollars 197m, or Dollars 1.46, after a previously announced Dollars 315m after-tax restructuring charge, compared with a profit Dollars 138m profit, or Dollars 1.02, the year before. For the year as a whole, net income before accounting changes was Dollars 285m, or Dollars 2.45, after total one-off charges for the year of Dollars 360m, against Dollars 644m, or Dollars 4.78, in 1992.</p>

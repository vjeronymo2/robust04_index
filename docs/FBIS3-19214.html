			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Detroit (DPA) -- In the view of Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany, new programs to stimulate the economy are not offering  a way out of the crisis on the German labor market. All efforts  to solve high unemployment must focus on structural changes,  "since, even after the solution of the economic problems,  unemployment will remain," albeit at a lower level. This was  stated by Rexrodt on Monday [14 March] before the beginning of  the first employment conference of the seven major  industrialized nations (G-7) in Detroit, Michigan.    Only "a steady economic policy," which is aimed at improving  the conditions for competition, easing the cost burden on the  enterprises, more flexibility on the labor market, and further  privatization, can create "larger room for creating new jobs,"  Finance Minister Theo Waigel, of the Christian Social Union,  said. The two-day G-7 conference, which will be attended by  Germany, the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy,  and Canada, was to be opened at noon (local time) by U.S.  President Clinton. [passage omitted]    During a breakfast with President Clinton and the labor,  economic, and finance ministers of the G-7, Waigel emphasized  that the world could not expect any "patent prescriptions" from  the conference. "The alarming situation on the labor market" is  a worldwide, and especially a European problem and it is "the  result of technological developments, structural inflexibility,  and the revolutionary changes in connection with the lifting of  the Iron Curtain." Solutions can, therefore, not be achieved in  the short term, Waigel concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chairman of the Cuban People's Assembly </F> Ricardo Alarcon by Andrea Bonanni in Brussels; date not given:  "`This Is How Clinton Disappoints Cuba'"--first paragraph is  CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] The visit by  Alarcon -- who also went to Germany and France -- does not seem  to have led to the results for which Castro had hoped. The  extremely tentative hints of economic liberalization and the  rigidity of the regime in the political arena are not actually  enough to justify opening up a dialogue with Europe, or the  broadening of economic relations. The substance of the message  from the Europeans is that Cuba must do more, at least as far as  economic reforms are concerned, if it wants to emerge from its  isolation. Nevertheless, in this interview with CORRIERE DELLA  SERA, Alarcon does not appear to be dramatizing the situation.    [Bonanni] Mr. Chairman, why Europe?    [Alarcon] Because after the collapse of the USSR, Europe  became even more important for our economic interests.  Traditionally, i.e., before the revolution, the United States  was virtually our exclusive market. Afterwards, our partners  were the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. Now,  with the disappearance of the USSR, there is no doubt that our  interest is centered on Europe and Latin America.    [Bonanni] Does that mean that, notwithstanding any informal  contacts, you are not expecting the United States to lift its  embargo in the short term?    [Alarcon] I would like to point out that we do not have  secret contacts with Washington. Moreover, I do not believe  that the situation can be unblocked quickly: at least within  Clinton's term. Logically speaking, now that the Cold War is  over, and now that the East-West antagonism is over, relations  between the United States and Cuba would improve. Yet, the  opposite has happened. The American blockade has been  reinforced. In Washington there are those who believed that,  following the disappearance of the USSR, the economic problems  would lead to the collapse of the Cuban revolution. Yet, we  have successfully resisted for four years. Obviously the  situation is difficult and the problems are serious. However, as  long as we hold out, the American strategy will prove to be  unsustainable. There are already American companies which are  looking worriedly at our new economic contacts with Europe and  Latin America.    [Bonanni] Even your relations with Cuban refugees seem to  have improved.    [Alarcon] Yes. Even though we are not expecting an  improvement in relations with the United States, it must be  acknowledged that something is changing. After 12 years of very  tough conservative politics, there is an administration in  Washington today that has contacts with more moderate sectors of  the Cuban immigrants. The Cuban far right, which dictated  Reagan's and Bush's policy, was linked too much to the  Republicans and it is now starting to lose influence.    [Bonanni] America is changing. What about Cuba? To what  extent are you interested in the Chinese model?    [Alarcon] We are studying it with great interest, as well as  the Vietnamese model. They too are developing countries that  are following the socialist path. However, there are major  economic and cultural differences. The Chinese rationalization  efforts cannot be applied to us: They have a large market,  great natural resources, an enormous population, and an ancient  tradition of entrepreneurship. In any case, the time of models  is over. Everyone must find their own road.    [Bonanni] How do you respond to the European pressure for  political and economic reform?    [Alarcon] I would not talk in terms of pressure. Generally  speaking, the Europeans understand that Cuba is in a tough  situation. It must adapt to a changing world. However, I  believe that our pragmatic approach is convincing. We are the  ones who suffered the most from the collapse of the Soviet  Union, but today we are also the most stable country of the  former socialist world. The euphoria of the capitalist world  following the events in Eastern Europe is now calming down and  making room for worries about the dangers arising from political  instability. The economic operators have understood this. They  know that in Cuba we have an educated and prepared population,  and that there is no risk of political instability. Thus,  despite the American pressure, they are beginning to invest.  After resisting for four years, I hope that our situation can  change for the better.</p>

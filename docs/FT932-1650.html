			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / LDP tries to restore calm as Hata rebels quit JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party split yesterday when Mr Tsutomu Hata, the leader of a rebel faction, and 43 other MPs handed in their resignations in preparation for the launch of a new political party today. The heads of the LDP's remaining five factions held a crisis meeting in an attempt to stabilise the party, which is in danger of losing further members ahead of a general election called for July 18. LDP officials conceded that the party could lose power, which it has held since 1955, while the Social Democratic party, formerly known as the Japan Socialist Party, believes it could rule the country in a coalition with the Hata rebels. Japanese foreign policy would be reviewed if the LDP lost the election, but Mr Sadao Yamahana, the SDP chairman, yesterday told the departing US ambassador to Japan, Mr Michael Armacost, that a socialist-led government would still put special emphasis on the relationship with Washington. 'Whatever happens, I want to assure you that there will be no change regarding the high importance we accord to Japan's relationship with the US,' Mr Yamahana told Mr Armacost, who is soon to be replaced by Mr Walter Mondale, the former US vice-president. The SDP has traditionally opposed a US-Japan Security Treaty signed in 1951, and the party also objected to the participation of Japanese military personnel participating in the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, essentially because it wants the military to be disbanded. While the LDP may be in danger of defeat, no clear pattern has emerged from an early rush of opinion polls. A poll by the Mainichi Shimbun, a national newspaper, of 1,000 eligible voters found that 79 per cent supported Mr Hata's defection from the LDP, but only 9 per cent would vote for his party. After handing in his resignation yesterday, Mr Hata said his group could not turn back after having voted in favour of a no-confidence motion against Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, on Friday night. 'Japanese politics has already entered a new phase,' he said. The meeting of faction heads from the LDP, which controls 232 members of the present 476-strong lower house, resolved to put aside factional differences for this election in an attempt to secure a parliamentary majority. Mr Michio Watanabe, head of one faction, said the party should be able to work in a new parliament with some of the pro-reform rebels who resigned yesterday: 'These people are not socialists or communists - basically they believe in the same things we do.'</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 6 May Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian  on page 4 reported that a group of intellectuals from 17 private  universities have agreed to establish the Indonesian Association  of Nationalist Intellectuals (ICKI). President of  Krisnadwipayana University Moehono, who was appointed to draw up  ICKI's mandate, said that ICKI will bring together all existing  intellectual organizations in terms of spirit and beliefs. He  added that nationalist intellectuals are needed to counter the  "adverse effects" of globalization facing the country in the  second phase of its long-term development plan (1994-2019). The  association will not be involved in politics and will neither  affiliate with any formal political groups nor seek any position  of power in the state's infrastructure, according to Moehono.  The idea to establish ICKI was born following one of President  Suharto's recent speeches, in which he said that divisions based  on religion, social status, or ethnicity run counter to the  spirit of the 1945 Constitution and the five principles of the  state's Pancasila ideology. The association plans to hold its  first national conference on 28 October to coincide with this  year's Youth Pledge Day.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Siemens close to French deal SIEMENS NIXDORF, the German computer group, is in the final phase of negotiating a technical and industrial agreement with SMT-Goupil, France's last remaining independent maker of microcomputers. The talks come as SMT-Goupil, the subject of a management buy-out four years ago, is suffering heavy losses due to the fall in demand and prices that has crippled the computer industry generally. Trading in SMT-Goupil's shares was suspended last month, just before it issued an estimate that it lost 'several hundred million francs' last year on turnover of around FFr830m (Dollars 139m). SMT-Goupil was barely profitable in the previous year, with a FFr30m net surplus on sales of FFr1.8bn. Neither side will confirm nor deny French press reports that Siemens Nixdorf is poised to take a 20 per cent stake in SMT-Goupil, though a spokesman for Siemens Nixdorf yesterday stressed that the German company 'is not contemplating any involvement in putting SMT-Goupil back on its feet'. The pair were discussing 'technical and industrial agreements within the normal scope of business between European industrial companies,' he said. Whatever the final outcome, this looks set to mark a new foreign advance in a French computer industry which used to be seen as a strategic national preserve. Loss-making Bull, France's state-owned computer group, is now negotiating for NEC, the Japanese electronics group, to take up to 5 per cent of the group's capital in exchange for NEC's existing 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, its main overseas subsidiary. Bull last year boosted the size of its microcomputer business by taking over Zenith Data Systems of the US, part of Bull's diversification away from its traditional mainframes business, but which also had the side-effect of increasing the pressure on smaller microcomputer makers like SMT-Goupil. Siemens itself bought a controlling stake only two years ago in IN2, a French producer of IBM-compatible personal computers, from the Intertechnique electronics group.</p>

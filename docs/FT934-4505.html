			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: George Michael - Pop Pop stars, naive sweeties that they are, still believe that the 1990s is the caring decade. Many of them seem to have abandoned their careers in favour of charity fund raising and Aids is the cause closest to their hearts. So goodwill, sentiment, love and peace, and an overwhelming atmosphere of self-righteousness, temporarily converted Wembley Arena into the ark of the new covenant on Wednesday night. George Michael had organised a Concert of Hope, and the Princess of Wales was there. She received the sort of reception usually reserved for U2, but did not join Michael in the Wham Rap. She deservedly let him pick up the laurels. Michael is in an odd sort of limbo at the moment. He is in a well publicised legal dispute with Sony, his record company, which he accuses of inhibiting his creative development. He wants artistic respect; they want a mega pop star. So occasions like the Concert of Hope are his best, if not only, opportunity to touch his fans. They loved him. There were few signs of the higher seriousness. He still manages a three-day growth of beard; he still wiggles his hips like Cliff Richard in 1960. He hardly needed to give a twitch to get the audience to stand and stomp and clap him through his newly adopted theme tune, one which he might share with the Princess, 'Freedom'. But the emphasis is on the voice. Michael sings now with the fullest throttle and he has a weakness for the big ballad, like 'Love's in need of love today'. On the oval stage, set in the heart of the arena, he showed no signs of rustiness; it was a dominating, assured performance, culminating in an extended 'Everything she wants'. Michael was very much the ring master of his three star circus. His two supporting stars were Mick Hucknall, of Simply Red, and kd lang. I'm worried about Ms lang. I loved her when she was a Canadian cowgirl, with a feel for the sentimental ballads of the 1940s, a kind of spunky Garrison Keillor. I was even charmed by the modesty of a lower-cased name. Now success has turned her into an unstoppable torch singer, swathed in layers of white sheeting and stomping around the stage fighting an unsubtle sound system. She is just plain old Karen Lang, the cabaret circuit queen. But Hucknall delivered in spades. He really is honey-voiced and he gave the audience what it craved, a string of hits, including the modern classic 'Stars'. He caught the easy-going, celebratory, uncritical mood of the occasion. The MC was a restrained David Bowie, acting as the voice of conscience on an escapist evening.</p>

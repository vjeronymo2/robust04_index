			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 3 Jun (AFP) -- Representatives of France,  Belgium, and the United States in Kinshasa delivered a common  message today from their governments to Etienne Tshisekedi, the  main opposition leader of the radical opposition in Zaire, it  was learned from a reliable source today. The contents of the  message was not revealed. The governments which make up this  "troika" are from three countries that are said to be close to  Zairian affairs.    The political situation is still confused in Zaire while  people are awaiting the appointment of the new prime minister  who will be in charge of managing the transition period to the  Third Republic.    A special commission, set up by the High Council of the  Republic- Transition Parliament [HCR-PT] to examine the various  candidates submitted, was to submit its report today to the  HCR-PT bureau.    The Zairian opposition, assembled within the Sacred Union of  the Radical Opposition [USOR], is divided on this procedure and  the conditions set up to designate the future prime minister.    USOR radicals believe that only Mr. Tshisekedi should be  appointed prime minister because he was elected by the National  Sovereign Conference in August 1992 and then dismissed by  Marshal Mobutu.    An important USOR faction, led by the Union for the Republic  and Democracy, said on its part that the post of prime minister  has become "vacant" and presented three candidates for the post.</p>

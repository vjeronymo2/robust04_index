			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIRTH CONTROL  </P> <P> I found it a bit ironic that, after reading Kevin Williams' letter ("One Fact  Tips Scales: The Unborn Have No Choice," May 20) where he states: "A pregnant  woman has the choice to seek financial, material or emotional assistance . . .  (it is available)," on the front page of the same issue is an article titled  "Budget Deficit Deepens Crisis for Medi-Cal." The story explains that Medi-Cal  lacks funding to pay for hospitals, doctors and others tending to the needs of  the poor.  </P> <P> I would then ask Mr. Williams where a poor pregnant woman would go when she  needs Medi-Cal to pay for prenatal care and the delivery of her child?  Operation Rescue? And what about afterwards? Who will pay for pediatric care,  for food, for the day-care expenses? The National Right to Life League?  </P> <P> I would respectfully suggest that Mr. Williams and all of those who share his  concern join us in supporting increased birth control research to give all  women (and men) more contraception options to prevent unplanned pregnancies  from occurring in the first place. Believe me, Mr. Williams, no one who  considers themselves pro-choice is pro-abortion.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER CRINER  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

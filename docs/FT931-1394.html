			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual equity moves dominate senior bourses INDIVIDUAL equities made most of the headlines on senior bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT focused on carmakers. A rise of more than 4 per cent in Volkswagen brought the sector up with it, Daimler putting on DM11 to DM605.50 during the official session as the DAX index rose 10.01 to 1,659.45; but in the afternoon, Daimler gained impetus of its own as plans for a new listing indicated an extraordinary profit of over DM4bn for 1992, applying Anglo-Saxon accounting treatment to its hidden reserves. Turnover rose from DM6bn to DM7bn. Mr Christopher Will, European automotive analyst at Lehman Brothers, added his weight to the arguments for VW with a buy recommendation. He acknowledged that the industry's situation was precarious, with German vehicle production in February showing a 30 per cent decline compared with a year earlier. However, he said, people were beginning to believe that the combination of Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new chief executive, with Mr Ignacio Lopez, just recruited as production and component purchasing head from General Motors (he is apparently importing a team with him from Detroit) offered a prospect of high returns from a company with huge scope for cost cutting. German sources, late in the day, were inclined to think that the market could be overestimating the influence of Mr Lopez and that equities in general could suffer if rumours of an inflation rate of 5 per cent in the state of Hesse turned out to be accurate. PARIS saw strong trade in Eurotunnel, with some 3m shares traded early in the session, mainly by foreign institutions, while LVMH also made gains on reports of a positive brokers report. The shares made respective gains of 50 centimes to FFr39.50 and FFr102 to FFr3,547. The CAC-40 index picked up 2.39 to 1,954.57 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Carnaud Metalbox, up FFr2 to FFr236, was again heavily traded. A report by the Paris brokers, Ferri, earlier this week noted that MB-Caradon and CGIP, which together hold the controlling interest, will sell their stakes jointly to an unnamed industrial buyer. Ferri suggested a possible price in the region of up to FFr300 per share, which could rule out Pechiney International, rumoured to be interested, which is already burdened by large debt. Other possible buyers include groups in the US and Germany, the broker added. MILAN was unsettled by signs that the budget deficit was once again running off target and shares turned in a mixed performance with the Comit index ending 1.92 lower at 485.59. Privatisation stocks were, however, beneficiaries of the deteriorating PSBR figures on suggestions that the government might accelerate the programme to raise cash. Separately, Credito Italiano, the state bank put up for sale last year, gained L90 to fix at L2,600 but then surged to L2,720 after hours - 8.4 per cent up on the day - on rumours that a buyer had been found. Deutsche Bank, at the centre of speculation that it might take a stake, denied that it had plans to buy. Montedison fell L68 or 5.5 per cent to L1,163 at its official fixing but picked up after hours to L1,195 as it denied market rumours that it was planning a capital increase. ZURICH marked time ahead of results from Nestle but subsequent profit-taking left the SMI index 19.5 lower at 2,146.8. Nestle fell in line with the market, its 9.2 per cent rise in 1992 net profit proving in line with expectations but a 1-for-25 rights issue, and plans to swap bearers into registered shares put pressure on the stock. The bearers fell SFr15 to SFr1,165. Bearers in Ascom, the telecommunications equipment maker, which said on Tuesday that 1992 profits would be halved, fell SFr50 to SFr1,390. MADRID got the better headline inflation rate which the equity market discounted on Tuesday, but the underlying rate of 5.9 per cent was more or less in line with expectations and the general index chose to focus on this as it closed 0.13 lower at 234.48. Sevillana, the utility, fared likewise. Although the company said that it would pay an unchanged dividend of Pta43 after a Pta11 cut at the interim stage, the shares closed Pta5 lower at Pta437 for a yield of very nearly 10 per cent. BRUSSELS regained some ground late in the session on technical trading, but the Bel-20 index still closed down 9.41 at 1,246.91 as the market reacted to the prime minister's resignation and the increase in the emergency lending rate. Turnover was some BFr1.27bn. STOCKHOLM saw foreign interest in Ericsson, up SKr5 at SKr247, but the Affarsvarlden general index slipped 0.7 to 982.3. Turnover was some SKr722m. OSLO recovered, the all-share index rising 6.18 to 439.38 in NKr375.45m. The industry index, which includes oil stocks, rose 9.41 to 776.06, Norsk Hydro adding NKr2.50 to NKr172. COPENHAGEN was again dominated by activity in Baltica Holding which moved in a range between DKr103 and DKr60 before closing DKr18.21 lower at DKr76.79. The KFX index lost 0.15 to 79.05 in turnover of DKr424m. Den Danske Bank, which has a 32 per cent stake in Baltica, rallied DKr3 to DKr310.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 24                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes          Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1126.21    1127.80    1128.54    1129.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1196.09    1199.10    1199.45    1200.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1130.95    1131.34    1130.92    1130.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1201.03    1201.75    1201.61    1202.55  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 23    Mar 22    Mar 19    Mar 18    Mar 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1131.55   1129.55   1145.37   1148.55   1146.10 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1203.95   1204.64   1223.70   1222.53   1214.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1132.13 ; 200 -  1203.04 Low/day: 100 -  1125.46  200 -  1194.14 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

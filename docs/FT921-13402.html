			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / PLO sets conditions for Moscow talks The Palestine Liberation Organisation has demanded representation of the Palestinian diaspora and guarantees that no Arab countries will sign separate treaties with Israel as prerequisites for Palestinian involvement in the multilateral talks scheduled to open in Moscow next week, Lamis Andoni writes from Amman. Syria and Lebanon have already declared that they will not attend the multilateral talks, citing lack of progress in two rounds of bilateral Israeli Arab talks held in Washington in December and January. Jordan insists on attending the talks which it argues will build up international pressure on Israel to make concession over its bilateral disputes with Arab countries. Foreign ministers of Arab countries are expected to meet in Morocco on Friday to decide whether the Arabs will take part in the talks that will tackle such issues as water, disarmament and the environment. The US, according to a senior PLO official, has insisted that representation should be confined to Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

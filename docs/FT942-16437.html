			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Bossi spells out conditions to right-wing allies Italy's Northern League will help form a new Italian government, but only if its federal, free-market and anti-fascist values are respected, Mr Umberto Bossi, the party leader, told followers yesterday. Mr Bossi addressed an estimated 30,000 to 45,000 banner-waving leghisti at an open-air rally in Pontida, the supposed birthplace of the 12th century Lombard League, in the hills near Milan. His speech opens the final week of unsettling political limbo in Italy, following last month's elections in which a right-wing alliance of the League, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia, and the neo-fascist National Alliance, won a clear victory over the left. On Friday, new members of parliament take their seats. Following consultation with the newly elected speakers for the two chambers of parliament, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will choose a prime minister and the real negotiations for the formation of a government can begin. Yesterday's message from Mr Bossi to his allies in the electoral pact was raw and uncompromising. For example, he said the National Alliance should 'take note' that the League would not tolerate regurgitated (fascist) ideology'. But he avoided direct attacks on Mr Berlusconi, whom he last week dubbed 'Berluskaiser' in a reference to the media magnate's autocratic style, and the National Alliance, which he has referred to as 'the gallows party'. His uncharacteristic moderation in an otherwise rabble-rousing speech reflects the delicate stage of government talks. At the end of last week, the League and National Alliance began to lay the groundwork for reconciliation of their apparently contradictory ambitions. The League now appears ready to accept the principle that the Italian prime minister should be directly elected, in return for National Alliance concessions in favour of federalist constitutional reform. But any progress could easily be undermined. For example, the League managed to upset its allies almost immediately after Friday's positive meeting with the National Alliance, by proposing that Italy should change its name to the Italian Union. Yesterday, Mr Berlusconi - who is widely expected to be asked to form the new government - tried to paper over the differences between the allies by describing the victorious electoral pact as centrist rather than right-wing. 'I give my word that I will be the bearer of common sense and firmness, and will keep the tiller always in the centre,' he told a political meeting in Rome. The difficulty for any Italian premier of steering a steady course was underlined by Mr Bossi's speech at Pontida. He won a resounding Yes from the crowd for his proposal that the League act as a guarantor for anti-fascist and liberal values in any new government. But the biggest cheer of the afternoon was reserved for the old separatist threat that, if the latest democratic changes do not achieve the League's goals in a short time, 'the North will simply break off' from the rest of Italy.</p>

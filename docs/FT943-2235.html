			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Sweden's road After victory comes the battle. The Swedish Social Democrats' return to power in Sunday's election leaves their leader, Ingvar Carlsson, with three campaigns still to fight. On past experience, he is well-equipped to wage the two, more immediate, battles. But he has yet to show that he can take on the country's deepest challenge: reform of the Swedish welfare state. Mr Carlsson's first task will be convincing the world's financial markets that he will reverse the country's spiral into debt. There are plenty of reasons for scepticism. His party's electoral campaign was noticeably short on talk of fiscal austerity. Clearly, there must be a larger package of deficit cuts from the new government than the meagre SKr61bn (Pounds 5.1bn) one announced in August. A more credible fiscal plan would involve public spending cuts, not the tax rises which the party finds it easier to suggest. But the Social Democrats' close ties with the public sector might help them to persuade affected groups that the cuts are inescapable. The outgoing centre-right government could not play this difficult role, as the results of the campaign suggest. Mr Carlsson may owe his victory to Mr Carl Bildt's willingness to push through several unpopular, but necessary, reforms as prime minister. Mr Bildt, however, frequently tried to sell these policies as the medicine required by membership of the European Union. This may prove damaging to the new government in battle number two: November's referendum to confirm Sweden's membership of the EU. Although the Social Democrats' have committed themselves to Europe, many of their supporters have not. Thanks, in part, to Mr Bildt's sales tactics, the latter view Europe only in a negative light. The new prime minister must continue his efforts to show that Sweden has a better chance of tackling problems like its 14 per cent unemployment rate within Europe than without it. Sweden must recognise its kinship with the other countries of Western Europe, but its third and largest challenge is also to see the parallels between its own predicament and those of countries further east. As Poland and others have learnt, it is painful to reform a system which guarantees security but fails to provide long-term economic growth. Sweden's pain is bound to increase further, if its government and people continue to hope that short-term expedients will be enough.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Wreckage of old socialism: Europe Opinions differ on the reasons for the wreckage of the Socialist party in the French general elections last week. Some say they failed to hold down unemployment; some say they betrayed socialism, both in their conservative economic policies, and in their luxuriant corruption; and some blame the party's founder, President Francois Mitterrand, for all of the above, for over-playing his hand, and for out-staying his welcome. Yet whatever the reasons, the result of the election is so extreme, that it will have the effect of a political earthquake. The Socialists' colossal defeat may yet mark a paradigm shift in the dialectic of French politics, which in turn could have lessons for other democratic countries in Europe. One thing the Socialists know for certain: they must start again from the bottom and from the beginning. The party cannot pretend to carry on as before, as if this were a little local difficulty; if it is to recover a significant role in French politics, it will need a new leader, a new message, and quite probably a new name as well. Choosing a new leader has suddenly become urgent. President Mitterrand is totally identified with the party's rise and fall, and at the age of 76 he is in a poor position to help it recover; in any case, he may not want to try. Recovery can only come from a new leader, and that probably means a choice between Mr Michel Rocard, the party's 'virtual' candidate for the presidency, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. A new leader will need a new message. In 1983 the Socialists tacitly abandoned most of the paraphernalia of unreconstructed socialism; after the election of 1988 they progressively abandoned the rest; but they have yet to come up with a new programme. Mr Rocard has moved to grapple with the problem, by his sensational call for the creation of a centre-left movement, reaching from reformed Communists to moderate centrists; but he has yet to define the platform it would have. There are essentially two reasons why the Socialists had to abandon the crude version of their creed. Old-fashioned class-based politics, the proletariat against the bosses, has long ceased to hold an adequate mirror to today's reality. What with mortgages and foreign travel, the decline of smoke-stack industries and the rise of the service sector, modern society has become more complex and less oppressive. Second, no one believes in crude socialism any more. It was a disaster in the Soviet empire; it has failed whenever it has been tried in the west. Moreover, in 1983 the French Socialists had to choose between crude socialism and Europe: they discovered to their dismay that they had no choice but Europe. Socialists would claim that there is more to their message than the ideological excesses of nationalisation and the command economy. They remain committed to a distinctive set of social-moral concerns: protection of the under-privileged; social welfare, health, housing, and education; the rejection of money and individual self-interest as dominant values. In short, some verson of liberte, egalite, fraternite. The problem is that these concerns may now be on the wrong side of the historic and geo-strategic wave. The traditional socialist canon focused on the fight against the unfair distribution of wealth; today's urgent need is wealth creation, and today's scourge is again structural unemployment. The socialist canon calls for social protection for the weak, the ill, the retired, the unemployed; today's problem is knowing how to pay for these things. The first reason for the radical shift in today's priorities, is that the socialists have won the moral argument, at least in most of western Europe: Christian Democrats and Social Democrats both accept the general case for social solidarity; France's conservative parties would not dare suggest dismantling the welfare state. The unsolved problem is that demand for welfare is by its nature unlimited. The second reason is the development of global markets. In a national economy, the exploited may be able to force a more favourable deal out of the exploiters; that option is not available if the 'exploitation' comes from other, more competitive, economies. Last year, the Dutch Central Planning Bureau* produced a range of forecasts for the next 25 years; one of the scenarios was for a trade crisis, with the world breaking up into three main protectionist blocs. It may not happen; but there is no denying that talk of protectionism is increasingly widespread. If western Europe remains committed to liberal global trade, it will have to improve its competitiveness much faster than in the past. This means channelling much larger resources into education and training; the alternative strategy of driving down workers' wages might produce a Third World work-force, but it would still not enable them to compete with an advanced Asian economy. Education and training will be slow to deliver. Meanwhile, competition will force the European Community to review either the budgetary costs of its welfare programmes, or the costly rigidities of its labour laws, or both. Moreover, welfare costs will rise steeply with the ageing of the population: in 1990 the over-64s represented 21 per cent of the population; by 2020 they will be 31 per cent. This is not a cheerful prospect. It is especially uncheerful for a political leader who is trying to work out a new political message for the 1990s, and who still wants to think of himself as a Socialist. * Scanning The Future, Central Planning Bureau, SDU publishers, The Hague, 1992</p>

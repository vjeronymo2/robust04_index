			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5 SOUTHLAND PLANTS LISTED BY EPA AS EMITTING CANCER-CAUSING POLLUTANTS;  </P> <P> TOXINS: REVISED REPORT LOWERS ESTIMATED RISK TO NEIGHBORS OF SANTA ANA'S  CAL-COMPACK FOODS INC. FROM ESTIMATED 1 IN 1,000 PEOPLE TO 1 IN 10,000.  </P> <P> About 180 industrial plants in 34 states, including one in Orange County, are  spewing toxic pollutants that increase nearby residents' chances of developing  cancer far in excess of levels considered acceptable by the government, new  Environmental Protection Agency figures show.  </P> <P> But the findings generally are more reassuring than those contained in a  similar report seven months ago. The reasons include fresher data, refined  calculations and actual reductions in emissions at some plants, said EPA  Director William K. Reilly.  </P> <P> In June, 205 plants across the country were on the EPA list. But the EPA has  revised downward the cancer risks for residents near 139 of the plants, while  assigning higher estimates to 42 plants. (One plant rating was unchanged; the  others have closed or merged.)  </P> <P> According to the EPA report, residents near Cal-Compack Foods Inc. in Santa Ana  face a 1-in-10,000 chance of developing cancer because the plant uses ethylene  oxide, a chemical for sterilizing equipment used to process food ingredients.  Cal-Compack, located in the 4900 block of West 1st Street, makes chili powder.  </P> <P> EPA data released last summer that said residents near the plant faced a  1-in-1,000 chance of developing cancer.  </P> <P> "We haven't had a chance to see the (new) report, so we really can't comment on  it," said Kay Carpenter, manager of corporate communications for  Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson, which owns Cal-Compack. "I do know that the statistics in  the last report were old statistics. We installed an incinerator that now  filters out virtually 99% of the emittants that go into the air."  </P> <P> Among the most dramatic downward revisions of cancer risks involved Unocal  Corp.'s chemical plant in La Mirada.  </P> <P> In June, the EPA estimated that the lifetime cancer risk to a resident near  Unocal's plant could be greater than 1 in 100. The new figures put the risk at  1 in 10,000.  </P> <P> As a comparison, one in three Americans on average will develop cancer in his  or her lifetime.  </P> <P> "We are pleased that the EPA has downgraded its estimate of a cancer risk at  and around our plant," Arthur Bentley, a Unocal spokesman, said Friday. "We  have always operated the plant in accordance with all laws and regulations and  with the highest regard for the safety of employees and neighbors."  </P> <P> David Carroll, director of environmental programs at the Chemical Manufacturers  Assn. in Washington, added: "The calculations really confirm what we've been  saying since June -- there is a continuing downward trend in releases (of  pollutants)."  </P> <P> Reilly said in a letter this week to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who  released the EPA data, that the estimates are intended only to help officials  compare and rank sources of pollutants across the country -- not to serve as  guides on health risks.  </P> <P> "The potential for misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the data is  significant," Reilly warned. "At no time did EPA ever intend this data to be  used to estimate an individual's cancer risk."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Waxman said, the overall data suggest that industries throughout  the country are able to release significant amounts of cancer-causing chemicals  without violating any environmental laws.  </P> <P> "There has been some reduction in risk," he said. "But the basic message  remains the same -- far too many plants are posing serious health risks to the  public."  </P> <P> The EPA estimates that about 2.7 billion pounds of more than 275 different  toxic chemicals are emitted annually. While federal agencies recognize more  than 100 chemicals released as potentially hazardous, current EPA regulations  impose emission ceilings on less than 10% of them.  </P> <P> Among the unregulated carcinogenic emissions are butadiene, produced by rubber  manufacturers; chloroform, a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry; ethylene  oxide, a sterilizing agent, and carbon tetrachloride and methylene chloride,  industrial solvents.  </P> <P> In evaluating harmful chemicals, EPA generally considers a cancer risk higher  than 1 in 1 million as unacceptable.  </P> <P> The cancer-risk estimates are based on an assumption that a person lives his  entire life at the edge of a plant and within 200 meters from the point of  emission, according to James Weigold, deputy director of the emissions  standards division of EPA's office of air programs.  </P> <P> "There's nothing for anybody to become alarmed about, but it's something to be  concerned about," he said in a telephone interview from his Durham, N.C.,  office. "Remember, this is long-term exposure we're talking about. Not Bhopal  (India)."  </P> <P> Now, as before, residents near the Texaco plant in Fort Neches, Tex., were  assigned a 1-in-10 chance of developing cancer as a result of exposure to  emissions of butadiene. No other plant was in this category. "That's 100,000  times higher than EPA's goal," Waxman said.  </P> <P> Six plants were in the 1-in-100 risk category, mostly in Texas as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ON EPA's LIST  </P> <P> These are California industrial plants identified by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency as among those releasing toxic chemicals that increase the  lifetime risk of developing cancer by people who live nearby:  </P> <P> RISK AT LEAST ONE IN 10,000  </P> <P> Unocal, La Mirada.  </P> <P> Dow Chemical, Pittsburg.  </P> <P> Louisiana Pacific, Antioch.  </P> <P> Simpson Paper, Anderson.  </P> <P> American Pharmaceutical, Irwindale.  </P> <P> Cal-Compack Foods, Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Micro-Biotrol, Vernon.  </P> <P> Santa Maria Chili, Santa Maria.  </P> <P> RISK LESS THAN ONE IN 10,000  </P> <P> Dow Chemical, Pittsburg.  </P> <P> Louisiana Pacific, Samoa.  </P> <P> Simpson Paper, Fairhaven.  </P></p>

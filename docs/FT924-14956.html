			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo seven-day losing streak ends JAPANESE share prices broke a seven-day losing streak to end firmer, buoyed by index buying by investment trusts late in the afternoon. Earlier in the day, the turmoil on overseas equity markets had pushed the Nikkei average below the psychologically important 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed 166.60 higher at 17,268.10. It fell to the day's low of 16.901.60 in the early afternoon on arbitrage unwinding, but later rose to the day's high of 17,318.66. Volume rose to 220m shares from 182m. However, investor interest remained low and fluctuations in overseas financial markets were used as excuses to remain on the sidelines. In spite of the rise in the index, declines led advances by 461 to 434 with 175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 6.42 to 1,299.13 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.30 to 1036.58. Analysts said that uncertainty about earnings growth prospects made share prices look overvalued. The Tokyo market is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 46. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said that after the announcement of the government's economic emergency package, investors had pushed up share prices without firm evidence of a fundamental improvement. 'The euphoria has been dissipated by doubts about the effects of the package on the economy, and the bank bailout scheme,' he said. Most market participants believe that fears ahead of the forthcoming interim earnings announcements could drag the average lower. However, public funds and bargain-hunting by investors who missed the September rally are expected to support the index at lower levels. Activity centred around short-term theme stocks. Aids-related issues were higher, with Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, up Y90 to Y1,630. Mazda Motor, which is planning to announce its new rotary engine today, rose Y10 to Y450. Denki Kogyo, a telecommunications antenna maker, rose Y29 to Y759 on active buying. The company is reported to be involved in Aisin Seiki's nuclear fusion research programme. But Aisin Seiki, which had risen on its reported success of nuclear fusion at room temperature, lost Y30 to Y1,010 on profit-taking. Export-oriented, high-technology issues, which had weakened on the yen's strength, were mixed. Hitachi declined Y1 to Y739 and NEC fell Y4 to Y695, while Toshiba gained Y1 to Y566. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 41.34 to 18,758.72 in volume of 8.7m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly lower as sharp falls in Europe depressed sentiment. TAIWAN fell as September inflation data registered an 11-year high of 7.36 per cent. The weighted index lost 157.58 or 4.2 per cent to 3,562.87 in turnover of TDollars 17.3bn. News that a director of Formosan Rubber had been arrested over allegations of insider trading also affected sentiment. Formosan Rubber closed down TDollars 7 at TDollars 96. HONG KONG remained nervous following Monday's holiday, but came off the day's lows on late bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index lost 42.32 to 5,553.12, having plunged 154 points soon after the opening. Turnover was HKDollars 1.7bn. HSBC Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55 and Hongkong Land rose 10 cents to HKDollars 13.1. AUSTRALIA ended at a new 18-month closing low. The All Ordinaries index fell to 1,447.9 in early trading but closed 14.7 down at 1,452.4, the lowest close since April 10, 1991. A note of optimism crept in late in the day with a ADollars 50m buy portfolio handled by First State Securities. A total of 77.7m shares worth ADollars 179.7m were traded before the portfolio was put through the system. BANGKOK lost 1.4 per cent in active trading. The SET index shed 12.08 to 865.52 in turnover of Bt12.4bn. Declines led advances by 182 to 60 with 42 shares unchanged. Bangkok Land fell Bt3 to Bt140, Bangkok Bank Bt1.50 to Bt85.00 and Thai Airways International Bt1.00 to Bt55.50. SEOUL was lifted by intervention by the Stabilisation Fund which helped to keep the market above the 500-level. The composite index rose 5.54 to 507.76 in turnover of Won106.7bn. Advancing issues led declines by 423 to 256 with 167 unchanged. NEW ZEALAND closed below 1,400 for the first time since mid-April and ended only 25 points off the low for 1992 set on April 9. The NZSE-40 index closed 15.83 lower at 1,396.16 in turnover of NZDollars 19m. Brierley Investments was the weakest of the leaders, ending 3 cents lower at its year's low of 82 cents. KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as a rebound in Tokyo prompted some bargain-hunting in the afternoon. The composite index closed down 3.63 at 590.70. But trading was thin as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of Malaysia's 1993 budget on October 30. BOMBAY fell on what one broker described as 'the tremendous pressure of rights issues', the BSE index closing 67.96 lower at 3,247.76. Merchant bankers and stockbrokers estimate that Indian companies are planning to raise up to Rs100bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in the next six months.</p>

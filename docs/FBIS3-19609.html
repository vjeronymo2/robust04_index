			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.P.": "Presidential Election: Balkany </F> Chooses Balladur and Causes Political Upheaval"]    [Excerpts] Following Simone Veil and Francois Leotard, RPR  [Rally for the Republic] Deputy Patrick Balkany yesterday openly  declared his support for Edouard Balladur's candidacy in the  presidential election, and he invited the majority and its  [party] chiefs to unite and "close ranks" behind the prime  minister.    Mr. Balkany, the mayor of Levallois-Perret [Hauts-de-Seine],  who also has close links with [Interior Minister] Charles  Pasqua, has deliberately stirred the rivalry between Mr.  Balladur and Mr. Chirac. He made his declaration at a time when  the head of government's rating is dropping in the opinion  polls, while Chirac's backers, who have been very dejected over  the past few months, seem to be regaining hope.    "All together behind Edouard Balladur!" Balkany wrote in an  article published in LE MONDE. According to the Hauts-de-Seine  deputy, "it is time for Edouard Balladur to announce his  intentions for the presidential election" to quench the  "cacophony" which currently reigns within the majority. Without  actually calling them by name, Balkany severely lashed out at  Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he said that  "the French are tired of and fed up with the eternal disputes  between the leaders of the two main majority parties." "It is  time that a playwright finally writes the last chapter of the  adventures of Plic and Ploc (nickname sometimes used for the  leaders of the RPR and UDF [French Democratic Union])."  <H5>  `Cacophony' </H5>   Last December, defying Mr. Balladur's "instructions" [not to  raise the issue of the presidential election], Social Affairs  Minister Simone Veil and Defense Minister Francois Leotard  pleaded in favor of the prime minister's candidacy. These  declarations provoked some commotion within the majority and  further deteriorated the relationship between the head of  government and the RPR president. Mr. Balladur is sticking to  the policy he adopted on entering the Hotel Matignon [prime  minister's office]: not to talk about the presidential election  this year and to ask his ministers and the majority to make the  least possible mention of it.    Mr. Balkany's declaration is not likely to put an end to the  "cacophony" which he denounced in his article. In an interview  with today's LE FIGARO, Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary  general of the RPR and a well-known supporter of Chirac,  responded by recalling that Mr. Balladur's appointment to the  Matignon originated in "a sort of pact" between the prime  minister and Jacques Chirac, whose "completion" would be  Chirac's election as president. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Pasqua's Voice? </H5>   The fact that a deputy from the majority is urging that  "ranks be closed" behind the prime minister is nothing abnormal;  that he expresses his support for Edouard Balladur's candidacy  in the presidential election is, after all, his right. But the  fact that it is Patrick Balkany, whose links with Charles Pasqua  are well known, makes the issue particularly important. Could  it be the views of the interior minister which were expressed in  the LE MONDE column by the deputy and Levallois-Peret mayor?  The question is worth asking. Nobody has given an answer so  far. But the reaction within Jacques Chirac's entourage clearly  indicates that Patrick Balkany's declaration is not being  considered as simply an inconsiderate statement by a  rank-and-file deputy.    It should be admitted that the Levallois mayor did not act  with great subtlety. Thus far, it has only been within the UDF  camp, through the declarations of Simone Veil and Francois  Leotard, that voices were heard openly calling for the head of  government's candidacy for the presidency. That such a call is  now being made from within the RPR is all the more annoying to  the Rue de Lille [RPR Headquarters]. It has immediately led to  an open letter being sent to Patrick Balkany by three Chirac  supporters, accusing him of divisive action within the majority  and "cordially" inviting him "not to become the Gaston Lagaffe  of the RPR." All this will not contribute to a better  atmosphere within the majority, and leads one to ask what the  atmosphere will be within the majority in the months to come.</p>

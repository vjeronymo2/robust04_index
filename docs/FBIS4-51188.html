			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] China would like the economy to expand by just  seven to eight percent this year, although the forecast growth  is eight to 9.5 percent, a vice-minister says. Zheng Silin, of  the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation  (MOFTEC), said China's infrastructure and financial resources  simply could not sustain the rapid economic growth of the past  two years. The economy grew 13.4 percent last year and 13.2  percent in 1992.    In a meeting with the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, Mr  Zheng said the double-digit growth had resulted in a severe  shortage of raw materials and funds in the country and had  spawned high inflation. But he said the macro-economic  adjustment package implemented in the second half of last year  had proved effective in reining in growth, adding that there  were signs that the economy and booming property prices had been  slowing down since March.    Figures released by the State Planning Commission last week  showed that the economy grew 12.7 percent in the first four  months down from 13.9 percent a year ago. Based on these  figures, the commission predicted economic growth in the first  half of the year would be 12 percent. Extrapolating on this,  the economy should grow by no more than eight per cent for the  rest of the year if China wanted to keep annual economic growth  to less than 10 percent this year.    Mr Zheng also said yesterday the next stage of China's  economic expansion would be hampered if it failed to speed up  growth in the inner regions, where energy and raw materials were  concentrated. As a result, the central authorities were working  out a stratgy to attract foreign capital to help develop the  poorer region. As part of the strategy, China for the first  time singled out the inner provinces to take part in the  four-day trade and investment fair organised by MOFTEC, which  ends in Hong Kong today.</p>

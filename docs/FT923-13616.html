			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System Sterling begins the week firmly at the bottom of the grid after dropping 2 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark last week. The pound's weakness is underlined by the 1.51 percentage point differential that separates it from the Italian lira, the next weakest currency. The Portuguese escudo remains the strongest currency, despite indications by the Bank of Portugal last week that it intends to soften interest rates. Currencies, Page 23 EMS grid The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. Sterling and the Spanish peseta operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

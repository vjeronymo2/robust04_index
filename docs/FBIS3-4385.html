In the course of shifting to civilian production, U.S. arms  industry changed in two ways. First, it made a policy change;  second, it made technical changes. In February 1993, shortly  after President Clinton took office, he announced a new  technology program in California. The program included the  adoption of some major actions to shift federal institutions  which originally concentrated on weaponry and energy research to  the development of civilian commercial technologies, such as  information, biological, superconductor, and environmental  protection technologies. Public opinion in the United States  held that industrial policy might "give rise to a major change  in the balanced relationship between civilian research and  development and military research and development." In March  1993, the Clinton administration announced a five-year plan for  shifting the arms industry to civilian production between 1993  and 1997. The key points of this plan are as follows:  Investing $20 billion in five years to support the cooperation  of various research organs of the government and industrial  circles (including the arms industry) in developing technologies  serving both military and civilian purposes; promoting  commercialization of military technology to promote economic  growth and also protect the foundation of the national defense  industry; giving vocational retraining to people who lose their  jobs in the arms industry, and helping communities which suffer  losses due to the closedown of industrial arms enterprises. For  this purpose, the government planned to allocate $5.2 billion  for job placement for personnel, and $4.7 billion to develop  projects serving both military and civilian purposes. In  addition, last year, the United States scrapped the extremely  costly "Star Wars" program which had been carried out for 10  years, suspended construction of the super-class super collider,  and reduced the scale of the "Liberty" space station. This  indicated that the Clinton administration laid greater stress on  the civilian arena when arranging the key points of scientific  research and technological development and the movement of  budgetary funds. The gigantic arms industry in the United  States was the outcome of the arms race in the period of the  Cold War. Most advanced technologies in the United States were  first developed and applied in the military field before they  were applied to civilian projects. However, in the new  circumstances, although military strength remains of great  importance for the United States, the existence of a gigantic  industrial arms system was obviously no longer suited to the new  situation. In order to increase its strength as the dominant  power in international affairs, the United States needed the  backing of great economic strength. Thus, it was quite natural  that its national defense industry was shifted to serve civilian  purposes.    As far as the change in production was concerned, in the  words of people in the circles of the U.S. arms industry, they  were going to set up "more flexible production lines." They  held that the change in production did not merely mean the  production of new products; instead "the inflexible production  lines and hard tools should be replaced with soft tools,  flexible machines, and fast-reacting work teams." Thus, more  than one product could be manufactured with the same equipment.  That is to say, the main orientation in the shift of production  in the arms industry was to develop technologies that served  both military and civilian purposes. Contractors who previously  only received orders from the Pentagon were encouraged to  develop technologies that could be applied to civilian  production and would also be able to serve national defense  purposes. The "double-purpose" orientation was fully stressed  in the Clinton administration's five-year plan. The technology  reinvestment part of the five-year plan included eight specific  projects, and six of them were directly related to the  "double-purpose" pattern. For example, the "key technological  cooperation plan for national defense and civilian purposes,"  the "commercial-military integrated cooperation plan," and the  "plan for promoting the dual-purpose technologies," all served  the purpose of developing technologies which had commercial  value and also had the prospect of being applied to the military  field.    In the course of shifting military industry and technology  to  civilian production, American scientists and technologists were  aware that special attention had to be paid to structural change  in basic research; otherwise, the momentum of development would  not last long. In addition, in the course of structural change,  a large number of structural layoffs may happen. This is a  major problem concerning jobs for 1 million civilian staffers  and 1 million military personnel, and must be properly solved.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banorte sale brings in 1,776bn pesos THE MEXICAN government has sold 66 per cent of Banco Mercantil del Norte (Banorte) for 1,776bn pesos (Dollars 567m), bringing the total proceeds from the 16 banks privatised so far to 35,100bn pesos. Banorte was sold to investors headed by shareholders in Grupo Maseca, a company best known in Mexico for tortilla flour. The group bid 951 pesos per share, valuing the bank at 4.25 times book value, and 12.62 historic earnings. This is roughly in line with bids for the three previous banks privatised, which were sold at a multiple of earnings of 17.85, 16.45 and 11.13 respectively. The next highest bid for Banorte was 1.1 per cent less than Grupo Maseca's, an indication of the competition between bidders to acquire a bank before it is too late. Just two more banks remain on the block, with the last, Banco del Centro, due to be sold on July 3. Banorte is the largest of Mexico's five regional banks, with 125 branches in northern Mexico. It has 16 per cent of loans in the states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas and Coahuila. The new owners intend to increase service along the US-Mexican border and, in due course, buy or set up a brokerage and create an integrated financial group.</p>

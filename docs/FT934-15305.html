			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rates emphasised as bourses begin to flag INTEREST rates have further to fall, said Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, yesterday, and bourses could rise between 7 and 15 per cent over the next 12 months after a 37 per cent gain since the beginning of the currency crisis in late August, 1992, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT scored its fifth consecutive high, but getting there seemed an effort and, after peaking at an intraday 2,021.20, the DAX index closed just 6.01 higher at 2,011.02. Turnover fell from DM9.4bn to DM8.5bn. Sector rotation continued with banks, construction stocks and retailers mostly higher, and the automotive sector and a number of other recent winners down. In insurance, for example, Allianz fell DM16 to DM2,730 after Mr Peter Constable, of Robert Fleming Securities, recommended a sell on profit-taking grounds, saying that recent outperformance in the stock conflicted with poor fundamentals. 'Rises in premium rate in Germany,' said Mr Constable, 'are inadequate and too late to improve underwriting results significantly there in 1993.' The pharmaceuticals group, Schering, fell DM17 to DM1,041. Here again, the reason was profit taking after a rise of DM75 last week. ZURICH moved ahead to a record close, the SMI index rising 14.9 to 2,548.5. Financials led the way, supported by a firm domestic bond market. Winterthur registered were active, rising SFr8 to SFr720 while CS Holding put on SFr55 to SFr3,150. Swissair rose SFr10 to SFr735 on the prospects for a special dividend after a Financial Times report that the Alcazar alliance partners had agreed on how to value their stakes and that the negotiations would come to a head at a meeting in Zurich today. PARIS saw a late drop inter- preted as a correction following an extended bull period. The CAC 40 index closed 17.66 lower at 2,138.72. Eurotunnel and Euro Disney were among the hardest hit stocks during the session. Eurotunnel's downward revision of its revenue estimates left it FFr1.05 lower at FFr42.10. Euro Disney fell FFr3.90, or 7 per cent to FFr51.90 on unfavourable analysts' reports. MILAN was unnerved by the resignation of Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, as a result of serious disagreements over the government's privatisation programme and the Mibtel index fell 118 to 10,307 in thin trading. Among early privatisation candidates, BCI shed L132 or 2.8 per cent to L4,596 and Credito Italiano fell L69 or 2.7 per cent to L2,465 amid concern that the programme could face delays. Savings shares in both banks were suspended before board meetings that are expected to propose changes to their statutes ahead of privatisation. Montedison was L51 or 6.4 per cent ahead at L850 and Ferruzzi added L2 to L400 after the progress at the weekend by the main Italian creditor banks. AMSTERDAM saw ING, the financial services group, another Fl 1.90 higher at Fl 79.80 on Thursday's news that the Dutch state had sold its 7 per cent stake to a Dutch pension fund. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.5 at 128.5. ABN-Amro gained Fl 1 to Fl 66.60 with strong foreign demand noted. After the bourse closed, the Dutch state said it had selected the bank to lead the privatisation of the Dutch PTT. MADRID heard Spain's state-owned power company, Endesa, deny reports in a Spanish economic newspaper that it was to distribute Pta50bn to its competitors. However, Endesa fell Pta70 to Pta5,460 as the rest of the sector rose. The general index closed 1.65 higher at 294.23. VIENNA pursued Frankfurt with the ATX index up 19.82, or nearly 2 per cent to 1,027.13, its highest since March, 1992. ISTANBUL dropped 5.3 per cent, the composite index closing 821.5 lower at a provisional 14,617.6. However, turnover dropped from TL1,350bn to TL786bn and brokers said the decline in trading volume showed that there was no strong selling sentiment. ATHENS greeted the Socialist general election victory with the general share index down 14.34, or 1.7 per cent at 831.05 in thin trading. This followed a gain of nearly 3 per cent last Friday. WARSAW's general optimism prevailed over political fears linked to a left-wing victory in elections last month, the WIG index rising 333.5, or 4.9 per cent to 7,164.8, in turnover of just over 1,000bn zloty (Dollars 50m).

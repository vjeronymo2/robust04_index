			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Observer: Not so happy birthday Things have looked pretty bleak for Franz Steinkuhler, Germany's cigar-smoking top trade unionist, in the past few days, after all the publicity about his dealings in Daimler-Benz shares. So nice to note that, just in time for his 56th birthday yesterday, he has been getting a few loyal messages among the flood of predictable calls for his resignation. The engineering union loyalists quoted an old proverb from the Ruhr, to the effect that: 'It's the chap who does the work who makes the mistakes. An idle bloke never blunders.' While the Mercedes works councils say Steinkuhler is an embarrassment (he sits on Daimler's supervisory board), the boys at Volkswagen (where he's also on the supervisory board) say magnanimously they think a bit of solidarity is in order even if their leaders are prone to err. Wonder who'll be sending greetings for his 57th.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Third group enters bid talks with Lac Minerals Two mid-sized Canadian gold producers have expressed an interest in jointly acquiring and then splitting up Lac Minerals, the gold and base-metals group which is the target of two competing takeover bids worth more than CDollars 2bn (Dollars 1.40bn). TVX Gold and Kinross Gold, both based in Toronto, have yet to make a formal offer for Lac. Their overtures have so far been rejected by Lac's management. TVX and Kinross said their talks with Lac involved an offer of about CDollars 15 per Lac share, or a total of CDollars 2.2bn. This is slightly higher than bids on the table from American Barrick and Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver. Under the proposal, Kinross would take over Lac's Canadian mines while TVX would get its US and Chilean properties. TVX, which was until recently controlled by Inco, the nickel producer, operates a number of gold mines in Latin America. Kinross is a relatively new company which has grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions involving mines in North America and Zimbabwe. Lac has so far said that its first choice is to remain independent. But with its shares widely dispersed, this outcome becomes less likely as the list of bidders grows. For the time being, American Barrick, the gold producer controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk remains the investment community's front runner. More bidders could emerge over the next few weeks. Royal Oak, headed by Ms Peggy Witte, president, is about one-third the size of Lac in terms of annual gold output.</p>

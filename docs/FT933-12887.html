			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Business parks' vacancies hit 20% THE AFTERMATH of recession and a surge in development activity in the late 1980s has left a fifth of office space in business parks empty, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers, have found, Vanessa Houlder writes. The vacancy rate, higher than any other sector in the property industry, reflects the immaturity of the market. Business parks emerged in the late 1980s as a result of a relaxation of planning controls and tenants' desire to escape from town centres. Development reached a peak in 1990 when 17m sq ft of space in business parks was built. Wales and the east Midlands has the greatest proportion of empty space in business parks, with 40 per cent on offer. The lowest rate is in Yorkshire and Humberside with 10 per cent vacant. Demand fell last year because of recessionary pressures, including the fall in town-centre rents, which removed business parks' cost advantages. The take-up of space last year fell to 3m sq ft, a 75 per cent drop on the peak levels in 1989. The most important users of business parks are the public sector and industrial companies, which accounted for 45 per cent of all space occupied on business parks between 1990 and last year.

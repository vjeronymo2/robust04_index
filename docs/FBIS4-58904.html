			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad 'Ali </F> Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 6 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [passage omitted] In this sermon I have seven or  eight issues to which I wish to refer. Time is short, and I will  try to refer to them briefly in view of their importance.    First, I wish to thank the honorable deputies of the Majles,  especially the members of the Judicial Committee of the Majles,  for approving the bill concerning the general and revolutionary  courts, as well as approving the bill which allows ladies to be  employed within the judicial system in advisory positions if  they possess the necessary qualifications.    As regards the first issue and the bill dealing with general  and revolutionary courts, it was the realization of a 10 or  15-year wish. We spent years working on it. Thanks be to God,  it was recently approved by the Majles. The Guardian Council has  also announced its final approval. The bill has been returned  to the Majles and the Majles will, naturally, implement those  amendments proposed by the Guardian Council within the next few  sessions and will submit it to us for implementation.    The new system will make the procedure for court cases much  shorter, it will eliminate many shortcomings, will involve  direct submission to the judge, and will eliminate many  conspiracies and plots which were hatched by the accused during  the interval when the case was submitted by the prosecutor's  office to the court and all the difficulties it gave rise to.  It will also make many savings in time, in human resources and  in procedure. This bill has many positive points and a great  deal of expert work has been expended on it. [passage omitted]    The second issue is a form of praise and gratitude as well  as  being informative. Our country's honorable tribes have a  particular and well known worth and value indicated in their  life history, particularly in their defense of the country and  its borders. Their pure and sincere beliefs, particularly in  some parts of the country, regarding the family of the prophet  is sometimes more intense than those of urban dwellers.  [passage omitted] Unfortunately, there were, and are,  traditions among them which clearly contradict religious and  civil law. In our visit to Khuzestan we discussed the issue  with senior officials and, thank God, significant steps were  taken. I can now announce that there is cooperation among  judicial, political, security and religious officials, as well  as many people of influence and respect in the Khuzestan  Province in the struggle against things contradicting religious  and civil law, including the practices of Nahveh [meaning  unknown], Fasl [meaning unknown], marriage of exchange [nekah-e  sheghar], sharing of blood money [diyeh], and murders committed  in the name of honor. It would not be wrong for me to say here  that a father or a brother would kill his daughter, would then  give himself up and say: I am the owner of blood and satisfied.  And that would be the end of that. But we said this was not  right. Although the Lord of the Universe has given the right to  the owner of blood, it has also given a right to the government.  Such practices violate the security of the system and the system  can fight such fathers and brothers or cousins, who are  mentioned in the prohibition debate. Extensive discussions and  many meetings were held locally and in Tehran. Standing here  today I can announce the good news that the good Khuzestan  tribal leaders, in cooperation with senior officials, have  signed pledges which were prepared. The simplest things do not  significantly contradict religious law but might violate law and  order -- things such as shooting during some of their  celebrations. But from our point of view the sensitive issues  are regarding obvious acts violating religious law, in  particular, murders. There are things contradicting religious  law in the division of blood money, judgment, prohibition,  marriage of minors and other things. After the awareness of  religious leaders influential among the tribes and the tribal  leaders, and cooperation among all officials, we reached the  point of a obtaining pledge to abandon such things. Should  there be any violations, the security, intelligence, political  and religious leaders are responsible for the transfer of the  matter to the judicial body, and the judiciary is responsible  for dealing severely with the matter. There were a couple of  minor issues recently which were dealt with severely and which,  thank God, have had positive result. I hope the good, pious and  brave Khuzestan tribes defending our country are good examples  for other tribes in other provinces of the country, and that we  will not hear any violations of law among them. But I repeat  that should there be any such things, the judiciary will not  show the slightest mercy to any authority whatsoever. [audience  chants approval] [passage omitted]    The atrocities that the Serbs perpetrated in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the methods that international  authorities, the United Nations, the Security Council,  adopted... [pauses] every day they witnessed new atrocities,  but instead of embarking on actions which might stem them, they  sometimes gave the green light; they sometimes even gave  support. They imagine they can convince public opinion. In  reality, it must be pointed out that their recent behavior has  dealt the biggest blow to the reputation of the United Nations  and the Security Council. That reputation will not be restored  so soon.    We call on the Islamic Conference Organization to make even  more effort than it has already done -- which is praiseworthy,  especially the contact group -- and at least get to a point  where the sanctions against the Muslim people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina are lifted and the right of defense -- which  is a natural right -- is given to them.    The people of our country have given much service and  assistance. As the exalted leadership -- may God almighty assist  and safeguard him -- has said, that is our duty. He even  referred to all its aspects. In fairness, the people of Iran  have given assistance and they will continue to give their  assistance. We are sure that Islam will be victorious.  [passage omitted]    The compromising accord between 'Arafat and the Zionists is  best interpreted in the following way: Two individuals placing  their signatures on a piece of paper, accompanied by false  ceremonies, in a country which itself is beset by its own  internal opponents and severe problems. Inviting several  personalities and placing two signatures on a piece of paper in  their presence cannot trample on the rights of a nation.    Mr 'Arafat is not the Palestinian nation. He cannot do  whatever he wishes in the name of the Palestinian nation. We  saw that when the accord was signed, a black day was declared;  public mourning was declared; there was a call for a strike and  the actions of opponents became more severe. We are certain  that the combatant, brave, alive and awake people of our  Palestine, especially the intifadah, will never be silent in the  face of such policies of aliens, and they will continue their  struggle until they regain their usurped lands and until rights  have been restored to their rightful owners. [audience chants:  "God is great," "Death to Israel," "Death to America"]    Please allow me; time is short and I have a couple of other  topics to talk about and I do not want to keep you too long.  South African combatants fought for almost 30 years against an  inhumane regime that was senseless, unjust and even  antireligious -- apartheid and racism. The combatants overcame  a government which ruled that land, aided and abetted by the  West, and headed by America. We all heard about Mr. Mandela's  victory. [passage omitted] We formally congratulate the people  of South Africa and Mr. Mandela and his colleagues on their  liberation and independence. We tell them: You are aware that  such victories are achieved at a high cost, and naturally they  should be well protected. The protection of such victories  needs a great deal more work than what was needed for their  achievement. We can take advantage of this issue and tell the  brave Muslim Palestinian combatants that today is the day of  nations; today is the day of the people; today is the day of  rallies and the expressing of the peoples' agreement and  disagreements. Governments can no longer consolidate their  authority through pressure, oppression and agreements and, as I  said, signatures on a piece of paper. You see that when our  country's struggles become victorious, when various struggles  achieve victory in various parts of the world, and recently, the  struggles in South Africa achieved victory, then such accords  which may be signed should not make you despondent. You should  be confident that those who struggle for their rights will  sooner or later become victorious.    Fortunately, as you are aware, our country has formally  announced the re-establishment of relations, relations which  were established a few months ago through the African National  Congress, and we intend to expand relations between the two  countries.    Recently a certain European country, which claims to have  mature policies -- Britain -- has claimed, as it were, that  Iranian security officials had contacts with Irish combatants,  that this and that has happened. I am not concerned with what  they said. As the official responsible for the country's  judiciary I say to Britain's statesmen: If you are telling the  truth, or have anything to say, give us your evidence. We will  investigate it, and if it is true we will deal with it.    Such political moves to poison the political atmosphere  between the two countries, and in the region and the world, by  relating a couple of false reports, are not worthy of a country  which claims to have mature policies. Such actions are not  proper. We are waiting to see if you have any proof to show us.    I had a few more things to say about the right of veto and  other things relating to the judicial system, but since it is  late and I have written a few lines in Arabic, with your  permission, I will leave them for another time.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / A Real test of commitment: Will political imperatives overcome economic reality in Brazil's fight against inflation Brazil's football stars get the glory, but the nation's housewives are the real heroes. As well as coping with an inflation rate of almost 50 per cent a month, on Friday they face the introduction of Brazil's fifth new currency since 1986, the Real. Supermarket shelves are covered in a confusing array of old and new prices beside signs announcing that certain products have been withdrawn by the stores because suppliers have tried to force up prices ahead of the currency switch. The Real is the final step in a programme the government launched last December in an attempt to catch up with other Latin American countries which have successfully tackled high inflation. The programme was originally welcomed by economists since it addressed the perceived causes of Brazil's inflation - most importantly, it set balancing the government's budget as a high priority. The plan's weakness is political. In October, Brazil holds presidential and congressional elections, encouraging politicians to push for more spending rather than a balanced budget. Moreover, its main helmsman, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, resigned as finance minister in March to run for president. That has left the initiatives open to criticism that they are designed to engineer a steep, but temporary, fall in inflation before the elections. Mr Cardoso's advisers admit he has little chance of catching the front runner, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, unless inflation falls sharply. Although most observers think inflation will drop, there are doubts about how long it will stay low - and also about Mr Cardoso's chances of closing the gap with his rival. 'There may not be enough time left for people to realise the Real's advantages and that their increased purchasing power (caused by lower inflation) will last,' according to Mr Alexandre Barros, a political consultant. Mr Cardoso and the government hope two features of the new currency will help curb inflation. First, it will be set at parity to the US dollar for an 'undetermined' time, probably until the elections. The Real's value will be defended using Brazil's accumulated reserves of nearly Dollars 40bn. Second, the central bank will set tough limits on money supply until the end of March 1995. In the past, the government has resorted to printing money to pay its debts, thereby fuelling inflation. 'The exchange rate anchor brings inflation down fast, and then the monetary anchor starts operating through strict rules on expanding the monetary base,' according to Mr Winston Fritsch, Brazil's economic policy secretary. The government has also recalculated public sector wages and most contracts into the new currency before its introduction, so any inflationary impact should be absorbed before the Real comes into circulation. This should further reduce price pressures, and most economists expect inflation to drop to 3-4 per cent a month by August. Brazil's anti-inflation programmes have led to sharp falls in inflation before. But each time, prices have started to accelerate because of flaws in the plans or through political pressures. This time the main worry is that the government, lacking support in Congress ahead of the elections, has had to compromise parts of the programme to make its implementation more feasible. It has adopted a temporary link with the dollar, instead of a permanent tie as used in Argentina's successful price stabilisation initiative in 1991. Nor has the government removed exchange controls to allow full convertibility of the Real. 'Convertibility is not an attribute you can impose on a weak economy. We would like to move more carefully,' says Mr Pedro Malan, president of the central bank. One reason why the government may have decided to retain exchange controls is that it fears the continuing popularity of Mr da Silva may persuade many Brazilians, who are worried about his radical policies in areas such as land reform, to switch their Reals into dollars, thus undermining the new currency. Another area in which the government risks compromising its anti-inflation programme is in its control of the money supply. There is growing pressure for increases in the minimum wage and military pay, which would threaten this year's forecast balanced budget. Further ahead, observers believe inflation will not be beaten without constitutional changes to reduce the government's spending obligations, particularly on welfare. An attempt to make the necessary constitutional amendments failed in Congress earlier this year. The chief political worry is that the plan's fortunes are too closely linked to those of Mr Cardoso. Mr Fritsch talks of a 'virtuous circle': if the Real works, it lifts Mr Cardoso's chances of becoming president and maintaining the anti-inflation fight next year, along with other economic reforms such as privatisation. 'But if the programme is not seen as a success, that affects inflation and the opinion polls. In that scenario, we hope we can muddle through,' he says. Opinion polls suggest Mr Cardoso has the support of about 20 per cent of voters compared with 40 per cent for Mr da Silva. This big difference is slightly misleading. Under Brazilian election rules, unless one candidate wins more votes than all the others combined, the presidential contest will go into a second round in November, between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. At this stage, Mr da Silva looks unlikely to win outright in the first round. In a second contest, Mr Cardoso could provide a strong challenge, especially since voters will have had longer to benefit from the Real. If inflation stays low, those Brazilians who are not protected against inflation - mainly the poor - could see a considerable improvement in their living standards. Salaries, currently undermined by a daily inflation rate of 1.9 per cent, would retain their purchasing power through the month. Possibly Mr Cardoso's greatest difficulty in his presidential campaign is cynicism among voters, who have seen many previous anti-inflation attempts fail. 'It's very hard to deal with this legacy of failed attempts. It's like the eighth marriage of Liz Taylor - if the others have foundered, why should this one succeed?' asks Mr Malan. An opinion poll earlier this month found that more than half those questioned would not change their voting intentions if inflation fell sharply following the Real's introduction. The findings worried Mr Cardoso's advisers, who suspect that some poorly educated voters will not realise the part he has played in introducing the new currency. But it is more likely that Brazil's electorate, with memories of the downfall of the now disgraced former president Mr Fernando Collor amid corruption charges, is no longer as easily fooled by campaign promises. Opinion polls suggest Mr da Silva, who narrowly lost to Mr Collor in 1989, is gaining support because he is a prominent national figure. In contrast, Mr Cardoso, a former academic, is not well known outside political circles and may appear as yet another newcomer making breakable promises. Mr da Silva's position on the Real is ambiguous. When the programme was announced, he and his Workers Party (PT) were critical, pointing out that inflation had nearly doubled during Mr Cardoso's 11 months in office to almost 35 per cent a month. Recently, the PT has stopped its attacks and is waiting to see how well the new currency works. But as the elections approach, Mr da Silva will have to decide whether to support the anti-inflation fight and the new currency, even though it is the main plank of his opponent's platform. If he decides against backing the programme, Mr da Silva could perhaps announce that his incoming government will scrap parity with the US dollar or pledge to raise the minimum wage. Assuming Mr da Silva retains his opinion poll lead, such an announcement would put pressure on exchange and interest rates, as markets reacted to the prospect of higher government borrowing. Mr Eduardo Gianetti da Fonseca, a Sao Paulo-based economist, suspects Mr da Silva will remain on a moderate path. 'If he continues to show a commitment to compromise there won't be panicking on a grand scale. But if he radicalises, then anything is possible,' he says. Given the political uncertainty few believe an end to inflation is yet in sight in Brazil. The Real's achievements may lie in keeping the economy free of hyper-inflation until the elections - possibly allowing for a fresh price control offensive by the next government. Brazil's housewives might be learning to use another currency by the time the next World Cup comes around.</p>

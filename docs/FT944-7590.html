			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Carsberg refers property centre Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has referred the solicitors' property centre which advertises 80 per cent of houses for sale in Edinburgh, to Scotland's restrictive practices court, seeking a declaration that it operates a rule that works against the public interest, James Buxton writes. He says a rule which forbids solicitors who are members of the centre from advertising homes through the centre if an estate agent is also advertising them restricts competition and consumer choice. Last year Sir Bryan referred the Aberdeen solicitors property centre to the court. The case has not yet been heard. In Scotland, many houses are sold through solicitors rather than estate agents. In some places solicitors have set up centres where properties for sale through them are advertised.</p>

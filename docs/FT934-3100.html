			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / People: Lasmo's board now two short Lord Rees, a former chief secretary to the Treasury who celebrated his 67th birthday yesterday, is to step down as chairman of Lasmo, the struggling UK oil company, after the next agm in May 1994. Lord Rees, who was brought on to the board for his political contacts, has been chairman since 1988, during which time the company has more than trebled in size. However, its rapid growth, culminating in the Pounds 1bn acquisition of Ultramar in 1991, has coincided with falling oil prices. The departure of Lord Rees is the latest of several changes in Lasmo's boardroom over the past year. Last January Chris Greentree, who had run the group for more than a decade, was replaced as chief executive by Joe Darby who joined in 1989. In October Lasmo announced that it was replacing its finance director, Michael Pavia, but has yet to do so. Over the past year Lasmo's shares have underperformed the stock market by more than a third, and during the past two the company's stock market capitalisation has halved to Pounds 860m. There is a growing concern in the City that the company might not be able to maintain its reduced dividend and a feeling that Lasmo's board needs strengthening if it is to regain the confidence of institutional investors. Pavia leaves the company at the end of the year and Darby says he hopes to have a new finance director in place by the end of the first quarter. 'We need a fresh face, who is known in the City,' Darby said yesterday. He hoped that Lord Rees' replacement would be named before the end of March.</p>

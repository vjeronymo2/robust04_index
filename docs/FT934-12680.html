			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / US may support small oil groups THE US Energy Department is to launch a study into whether the smaller independent companies in the American oil and gas industry should receive greater government support. Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, said in London yesterday that US-based, large multinational oil companies had the international experience and financial resources to diversify away from the US, where oil production is steadily falling. The same could not be said of many of the independents, whose future would remain in the US. 'We owe them some obligation to find some answers for them,' she said. Mrs O'Leary said the study would determine whether there was a need to offer strategic support to the independent oil sector, in the same way that the Clinton administration was proposing to help the US car industry to develop a non-petrol burning, zero-emission passenger vehicle in the next century. She offered little short-term relief to the industry, however.</p>

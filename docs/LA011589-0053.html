			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUALIFIED WOMEN  </P> <P> Your criticism of George Bush for selecting only one woman to serve in his  15-member Cabinet ("Cabinet: Familiar Faces," Dec. 30), was well-taken. I  couldn't help but notice, however, that of the 15 members of The Times' senior  management listed on the same page, it appears that only one, Associate Editor  Jean Sharley Taylor, is a woman, and she is at the bottom of the list.  </P> <P> Surely it is no more difficult to recruit qualified female newspaper executives  than it is to find qualified women to serve in the President's Cabinet. Perhaps  "where women are concerned, (The Times also) needs to fish in a deeper pond."  </P> <P> STEVEN G. MADISON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

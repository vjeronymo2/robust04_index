			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the importance of ensuring the secondary market liquidity of municipal issues, comment also is requested on whether market participants believe that the proposed amendments would have a substantial or long-lasting effect on market liquidity. Questions have been raised about whether municipal securities dealers will be willing to effect secondary market transactions in a broad range of municipal securities in light of the specificity with which the requirement of paragraph (c) is articulated. The Commission is of the view that once the proposed amendments are in effect, and dissemination systems are operating, liquidity will not be affected, and that municipal securities dealers will be willing and able to purchase and sell as broad a range of securities as before. Commenters should consider this analysis and suggest any factors that may have effects on liquidity, and what operational changes or repository arrangements, or changes to the proposed amendment to the rule, would reduce these effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Final Official Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 15c2&hyph;12(e)(3) presently defines the term ``final official statement'' as a document or set of documents prepared by the issuer or its representatives setting forth information concerning the issuer and the securities to be issued that is complete as of the date the document is delivered to the Participating Underwriter. The definition does not prescribe the specific information required to be included in the documents. In order to ensure that the purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12 are met, and in light of the proposed amendment obligating Participating Underwriters to assure that issuers have undertaken to provide to a repository issuer-identified minimum annual financial information, as well as notices of material events, the Commission is proposing to amend the definition of final official statement to include an information requirement. The definition of final official statement also governs the items of information to be included in the near final official statement, subject to availability considerations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Having a standard with which to compare the contents of near final official statements should assist Participating Underwriters in satisfying their obligation to have a reasonable basis on which to recommend securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Public Securities Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Aug. 24, 1992) (interpretation regarding the information to be contained in near final official statement obtained and reviewed by underwriters pursuant to Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a discussion of the delivery requirement of a near final official statement pursuant to Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(1),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Companion Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5, at Section III.E.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would define the final official statement to include information concerning the terms of the proposed issue of securities, and financial and operating information concerning the issuer that is adequate to provide a fair presentation of the issuer's current financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, including audited financial statements. Financial and operating information also would be required for any ``significant obligor'' with respect to the municipal security. The term ``significant obligor'' is defined in the proposed amendment, and is discussed below. As discussed in the Companion Release, reliable financial information, prepared on a consistent basis, that fairly presents the issuer's and any significant obligor's financial position, is an important component of a disclosure scheme designed to prevent fraud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment is requested on whether an amendment to the definition of final official statement is necessary. If commenters consider amendment necessary, comment is requested on whether audited financial statements should be required, whether audited financial statements should be required to be audited using GAAS, the number of years of audited financial statements that should be included, if any, and if audited financial statements are included, whether unaudited financial statements covering interim periods also should be included. Comment also is requested on whether the definition should be amended to require that the financial statements conform to GAAP, or should include discussions of material deviations from GAAP if prepared on some other basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

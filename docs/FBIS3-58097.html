			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ulrich Irmer, foreign policy spokesman of </F> the FDP Bundestag group, by Holger Wuchold in Bonn; date not  given: "Dangerous Troublemaker"]    [Text] [Wuchold] Is the entry ban for Zhirinovskiy an  appropriate means of combatting the fascist danger in Russia?    [Irmer] Of course, the rightist danger in Russia cannot be  combated with an entry ban for Germany. This problem must be  tackled in Russia itself.    But the decision made by Foreign Minister Kinkel is correct,  because Zhirinovskiy obviously intends to make trouble in our  country, too.    [Wuchold] Is Zhirinovskiy a danger to Germany's internal  security?    [Irmer] He could be a danger. He says, for instance, that  Poland must be divided and that Germany and Russia must have a  common border.    This is contrary to our constitution and completely in  violation of international law. Such a dangerous braggart must  not agitate in our country.    [Wuchold] What can the West do to combat nationalism in  Russia?    [Irmer] We must give the Russians the feeling that our  involvement in East Europe is certainly not aimed against them,  by means of security pacts, for instance. We must also  considerably strengthen economic cooperation.    [Wuchold] The Russian Government says that the planned  expansion of NATO and the European Union to the East would  benefit the nationalists in that country.    [Irmer] The Russian nationalists are trying to exploit the  expansion of NATO and the European Union for propaganda means.  However, for Russia's stability itself it is indispensable that  the states between Russia and Germany become stable democracies.  Russia is not to be isolated but to be integrated in a system  of collective security.</p>

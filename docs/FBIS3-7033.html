Citing concrete facts proving that Kim Yong-sam the traitor  fully laid bare his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor in the  relations with Japan, the article says:    Last year, he often met Japanese reactionaries and made a  clean sheet of the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression  on Korea and crossed off the thrice-cursed crimes committed by  them against the Korean people in the past including the  drafting of "comfort women for the army" and flung the door open  for their reinvasion, saying that the relations between South  Korea and Japan must developed into "new ones".    Worse still, he entreated the Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa to suspend the DPRK-Japan talks for  normalising diplomatic relations till the "nuclear and missile  issues" of the North were completely settled and to take a joint  action with South Korea and cried that "the axis of South Korean  diplomacy is predominant relations with Japan and the United  States."    Kim Yong-sam is throwing himself deeper into the military  and  economic spheres of Japan in an attempt to keep his power with  the backing of Japan. He further broadened economic opening to  the Japanese reactionaries than his predecessors and is moving  toward legalising the infiltration of the reactionary culture of  Japan.    It is only too natural that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who  pays  no heed to the dignity and interests of the nation and commits  treacheries to gratify his greed for power has become a target  of overthrow by the people.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam will face a stern judgement by  history for his treacherous crimes.</p>

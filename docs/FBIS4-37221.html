			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>   [Excerpt] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] have called for electing a new political  leadership for the Palestinian people, rebuilding the Unified  National Leadership of the Intifadah on new foundations, as well  as holding an Islamic-Christian conference to defend the Arabism  of Jerusalem.    This is part of a draft plan for national salvation which is  being debated by the cadres of the two fronts as a prelude to  endorsing it within the framework of their unionist plan. This  constitutes a step along the road of unity between the  Palestinian left and its democratic and revolutionary forces.  The program asserts that the two fronts are willing to set up  an alliance under this program with all forces in the  Palestinian arena. [passage omitted]</p>

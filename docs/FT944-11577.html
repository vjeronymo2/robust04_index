			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Man in the News: Guardian angel slips on halo - Peter Preston A week ago Mr Peter Preston looked set further to enhance his reputation as the longest serving editor of a British broadsheet. The Guardian was making much of the running in stories of the alleged shortcomings of British (especially Tory) MPs. Two junior ministers, Mr Tim Smith and Mr Neil Hamilton, had been obliged to resign, though Mr Hamilton is protesting his innocence by suing the paper. The Guardian's sights were thus trained on a much bigger target: Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury and a member of the cabinet. Then the campaign went wrong. The Sunday Telegraph revealed that The Guardian itself had engaged in a devious practice by making illicit use of House of Commons writing paper in pursuit of its inquiries. For a newspaper that sometimes gives the impression of being holier than thou, this was a serious charge. There was more than a touch of Schadenfreude, even among The Guardian's admirers. Mr Preston has admitted in public that he made a mistake: in retrospect, the digging out of information - and proof - might have been pursued by better means than purloining somebody else's address. But he is not immensely apologetic. He thinks that the use of what he euphemistically calls a 'cod fax' was the best way of taking forward a story that might otherwise have been abandoned. In any case, the Aitken affair - which, for want of a better term, is what it might as well be called - is by no means the deepest hole that Mr Preston has been in. If you want to touch a raw Preston nerve, ask him about the Sarah Tisdall affair of 1983. That, in his view, was 'absolutely the worst thing that ever happened to him as editor'. It undermined his credentials as a liberal and as a protector of sources. Official documents from an unknown source had arrived at The Guardian office giving the date of the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common. At the time, that was electric news. The ministry of defence and the police wanted the papers back in order to discover the source. Not knowing the source himself, Mr Preston capitulated. He walked down to the police station at Holborn Viaduct with the documents in his pocket, still wondering whether to tear them up. The result was that Ms Tisdall, a junior officer at the Foreign Office, was exposed and sent to prison for six months. Mr Preston says now that he should have had the documents shredded immediately, while retaining the information. Had he known how tender the source was, he would have gone to the stake for her. There is no doubt that the episode coloured his future approach to journalism. He became a tougher, more determined editor with something to prove and possibly a conscience to assuage. Shortly afterwards, he emerged as an active member of the International Press Institute, which attempts to foster an independent press around the world. Well before that, journalism was his way of life. Preston was born in Leicester in 1938. He suffered from polio at the age of 10 - hence the still difficult movement of his arms - and his father died from the same disease. He went to Loughborough Grammar School, then to St John's College, Oxford, where he read English and edited the university newspaper, Cherwell, though his name in those days was Pete not Peter. Entry to the bigger time came with the Liverpool Daily Post where he wrote half the editorials and helped put the paper to bed. Since then it has been The Guardian all the way. Mr Preston joined the staff as a political reporter in 1963. He was education correspondent (a role now occupied by his son, Ben, at The Times), he wrote a scintillating diary column under the heading 'Miscellany', he was features editor, then production editor until 1975 when - at the age of 36 - he became editor. The Guardian was then in a mess: financially weak and seeking to establish itself in London (foreign news was still handled from its Manchester birthplace). Mr Preston gradually pulled it together. He was helped by strikes at The Times. Yet the mid-1980s brought another decline: first the Tisdall affair, then the birth of The Independent. The editor reckons that he had to set out to recreate the paper again. By and large, he succeeded. The Guardian introduced design changes ahead of other British broadsheets; also a tabloid section to go with the main newspaper. In terms of innovation it has been an evolutionary leader in the British industry. Editorially, pace the parodies of Guardian readers, it is not especially left-wing, though many of the letters to the editor are. Mr Preston dabbled in Liberal politics at Oxford; probably his preference now is for social democracy, or whichever party most reflects it. Shortly before the 1979 general election the then Sir Geoffrey Howe came up with the figure that 40 per cent of Guardian readers vote Tory. It was the sort of remark that perhaps pleased Mr Preston more than some of his staff. With nearly 20 years of editing behind him, there is no sign of his going, despite recent events. He cites British editors he has admired. They come from the tabloid rather than the broadsheet press: Stewart Steven especially ('absolutely ace'), now at the Evening Standard, and Sir David English of the Daily Mail. But even they, he says, have made spectacular mistakes because they had so much to do: they lived them down. Possibly Mr Preston feels lonely. As an editor, he claims, 'you can't have friends in a normal sense'. For family reasons which go back many years, he is quite close to Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary whom he asked to investigate the Aitken affair, 'but we've never been in each other's house'. The Guardian's inquiries will go on. Mr Preston says he has no idea where they will lead, but 'you have to throw a stone into the water to see the ripples . . . you have to keep pushing at the frontiers'. Under sustained pressure from his wife, Jean, he stopped smoking his ubiquitous pipe at the end of August. That may explain any shortness of temper.</p>

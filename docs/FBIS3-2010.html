At a meeting here today, officials from the municipal  government said that Beijing's green coverage rate has reached  33.58 percent due to the efforts of all residents, specially the  many outstanding afforestation workers, who were commended at  the meeting.    Beijing aims to uplift its green coverage rate by one  percent  annually to reach 40 percent by 2000, a goal announced by Mayor  Li Qiyan last year.    Last year, Beijing enlarged its urban grassland by 541 ha  [hectares] and planted trees on some 17,000 ha of mountainous  areas. And more trees were planted along roads and around  villages.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers join environmentalists in reform call A group of prominent UK farmers and environmentalists yesterday launched a campaign to reform the common agricultural policy, describing it as 'an astonishing abuse of public money'. 'At the moment, the more intensively you farm, the more handouts you get,' said Mr Patrick Holden of the Soil Association, Britain's leading organic farming organisation, at the Royal Show in Warwickshire, England's biggest annual agricultural event. 'We want to change that so it becomes commercially possible for farmers to farm in a more environmentally friendly way.' The Gay Hussar Group, named after the London restaurant where its members thrashed out their platform, includes Mr Jonathon Porritt, former director of Friends of the Earth, Sir Simon Gourlay, a past president of the National Farmers' Union, and Ms Marie Skinner, a member of the NFU's policy-making council. Mr Oliver Walston, a large-scale arable farmer in Cambridgeshire and a leading critic of the Pounds 3bn paid annually in subsidies to UK farmers, admitted he had undergone a conversion to the environmentalist cause. 'Two years ago I was out of touch with their sort of farming,' he said. 'But the situation in the countryside is economically and politically unsustainable.' The group is calling for CAP subsidies to be redirected from production support to maintaining the landscape and wildlife, cutting pollution and rebuilding rural economies. 'As a result, food surpluses will be reduced and farmers will be brought closer to the market place,' it argues. It also wants to end 'the insanity' of set-aside, under which farmers are compensated for leaving the land uncultivated. Most of the group's ire was directed at what Mr Porritt described as 'the misdirection of public monies and policy' by the British ministry of agriculture. But Sir Simon Gourlay accepted that CAP policy was determined by the EU and that other European governments and farmers 'would need a lot of persuading'. Some farmers in the UK, too, have yet to be persuaded of the need for CAP reform. Sir David Naish, NFU president, said yesterday that the union's recent policy document on options for reform 'has initiated a discussion which some would probably prefer not to have'. However Sir David, who has been meeting EU counterparts to discuss reform, said there was a feeling in Europe 'that no longer have the treasuries in any member state the willingness to throw money at agriculture to get rid of the problem'. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, yesterday announced a 33 per cent increase in funding to nearly Pounds 1.3m a year for research into new industrial and energy crops that could be grown on set-aside land. 'About a sixth of our arable land is now in set-aside and there is justifiable concern that more positive use should be made of it,' she said.</p>

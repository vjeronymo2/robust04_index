			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Partners meet today on accountancy merger Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth biggest accountancy firm, is to merge with Binder Hamlyn, the eighth biggest, in one of the biggest consolidations in the profession for several years. Heads of Binder's 11 regional partnerships around the country still need to approve the merger and they are due to meet today to discuss the proposals, which Andersen formally made two weeks ago and laid out at a meeting last week. Precise details are still to be worked out, but the merger would involve no goodwill payment or other money handed over by Andersen to Binder. Instead, Binder partners would be offered 'units' or equity in the Andersen partnership according to their position and influence. A handful would be offered full partnerships in the Andersen worldwide firm, and the rest would become members of the Andersen regional partnership for the UK. Any agreement is conditional on approval in some form by Binders, which is composed of a series of semi-autonomous regional firms. Some may have concerns about the arrangement, which was negotiated between Andersen and Binder's senior partners for the single firm that covers London and Leeds. Andersen is believed to be willing, however, to proceed even if the merger involves only the London and Leeds practice, which represents more than half of total fee income and large corporate clients. Mr Jim Wadia, Andersen's managing partner, said yesterday: 'We have got beyond talks about talks, to talks (about merger).' He said there was no question of Andersen changing its name, but he had no objection to using the Binder Hamlyn name in some form if it made commercial sense. Such arrangements with other firms already exist in France, Japan, south-east Asia and Sweden. The merger would boost Andersen's client base by giving it access to about 100 quoted companies that are audited by Binder. It would also give it access to the areas in which Binder specialises, including a personal financial advisory service for wealthy individuals. Another advantage would be to give Andersen access to government work, from which it has been banned since it was sued by the government for its audit of the fraudulent De Lorean car company in northern Ireland. Binder has yet to respond with a formal offer, which would be shaped by how many of the regional partnerships were willing to merge, and might involve discussions over how the name would be used. Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's managing partner, said: 'Talks are taking place. We see there could be significant benefits.' He ruled out large numbers of redundancies. The merger could raise Andersen's presence in Germany because Binder is part of the BDO international network which has a strong firm there.</p>

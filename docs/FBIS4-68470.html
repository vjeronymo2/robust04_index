			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Stepanenko report on interview with Belarusian Prime </F> Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich: "The Way Out of the Crisis Lies in  Union With Russia"]    [Text] Minsk -- "I will be put on trial," Vyacheslav  Frantsavich said with bitter irony when we met.    I already knew this to be the case: National-Radical  deputies have approached the Prosecutor's Office, demanding that  he be charged with treason against the state. Specifically for  signing a treaty on a unified monetary system with Russia, one  paragraph of which -- concerning the status of the national bank  -- contradicts the relevant article of the Constitution.    It seems that his life since he was elected chairman of the  Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic  nearly four years ago has been composed entirely of dramatic  events. His attempts to salvage the economy -- the decline in  production, inflation, the decline in living standards, the  constant attacks from the right wing and the national reformers,  and the criticism from the left.... "You adapt to living as if  under fire in a trench," he confessed to journalists.    But whereas these years which have washed like a destructive  wave over all the former republics of the Union, have seen  several heads of government in Belarus' neighbors, starting with  Russia, come and go, Kebich has survived. Because he has  occupied a key post for all this time, he has naturally had more  of a chance than many others to make sense of the processes that  have brought society to the brink of disaster.    From the vantage point of his accumulated experience, how  does he currently view the ways and means for getting Belarusia  out of the crisis and providing its people with a decent life?  This was the question, a question of interest to all of us,  that I put to Kebich first of all.  <H5>  There Is Only One Way </H5>   [Kebich] Basically, the only way I can see is close union  with Russia, the establishment of an effective model for the  economy and a just society. This is the main thing.    [Stepanenko] You would put union with Russia first?    [Kebich] Yes. Without it Belarusia has no future. Blood  kinship, shared roots, and age-old unity with the Russian people  are not the only issue here. We are united economically.  Almost all our energy resources, raw materials, and the bulk of  our components come from Russia, and two-thirds of our products  are sent to Russia. The destruction of the Union and the  disruption of economic ties is a tragedy whose disastrous  consequences are being felt in all the republics; it is a  tragedy that has become an economic Chernobyl for Belarusia.  Our only salvation lies in integration. The unification of  monetary systems, for which, as you know, I had to fight all the  way, is just the first step in the direction of full economic  union with Russia. If you like, this is the only realistic way  not only of surviving, but also of retaining our sovereignty.  [Kebich ends]    Just the day before, during a meeting with industrialists  and  entrepreneurs who nominated him as a candidate for the  presidency, Kebich issued a sharp rebuke to those who have  kicked up a fuss about the "crimes" of a government which, by  signing a treaty on the monetary system, has supposedly deprived  the republic of its sovereignty. And he voiced his profound  conviction that Belarusia actually lost its sovereignty  following the breakup of the Union, when it became  "independent," because disorder and poverty are a road to  servitude and total dependence on others. Opponents of economic  union with Russia, he noted in a subsequent talk with  journalists, are prisoners of medieval illusions.       [Stepanenko] But why unite with Russia alone? After  all, there was a time when you advocated economic union within  the framework of the Commonwealth.    [Kebich] I have not given up on this idea. But you will  recall how the politicians conducted themselves: They all  destroyed even what was enshrined in the agreement on the CIS --  a single economic area, a single ruble, and joint Armed Forces.  With every summit meeting I became more and more convinced that  national ambitions and selfishness were being put first.  Everyone was in it only for what they could get out of it. I  realized that we needed to come up with another, more realistic  option. Without destroying the Commonwealth, within its  framework, those who are more prepared to integrate, for  example, and whose economy basically compels them to do so as a  result of objective ties, should draw closer together. And I  put forward the idea of an economic union of Russia, Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, and Belarusia.... [Kebich ends]    This was Kebich's idee fixe. He plugged it whenever he  could: He secured the approval of the Supreme Soviet and  discussed the concept on several occasions with Chernomyrdin,  Kuchma, and Tereshchenko. The planned union of four, and  subsequently, owing to the deterioration of the situation in  Ukraine, three, was open to other CIS member states, and was to  have been the basis for a subsequent economic union of all  Commonwealth countries. But it proved impossible to set it up.  Whereupon Kebich concentrated his efforts in just one direction  -- union with Russia.    [Kebich] Of course, we will go further -- we will completely  restore the single economic area and single economic organism.  I am sure this will accelerate the unification process on a  Commonwealth-wide scale. Here in Belarusia, this system will  enable us to keep alive the largest enterprises and whole  sectors such as those involved in radioelectronics,  machine-building, and oil refining. Russia too will benefit:  It will not have to establish industries paralleling the ones  operating here, nor will it have to shut down enterprises  working in collaboration with Belarusia.    The second condition for getting ourselves out of the  crisis,  as I have already mentioned, is the establishment of an  effective model for the economy. And here, I think, we need to  rid ourselves of one or two illusions.  <H5>  You Cannot Be Wiser Than Life </H5>   [Kebich] First and foremost we need to openly acknowledge  that the economic model proposed by the radical reformers is  bankrupt. Let me be more specific: A policy geared to  indiscriminate destruction of the past and all the forms and  principles of the previous economic system is not only  wrongheaded, it is actually ruinous. This is borne out by  everything, by the way the production situation is developing  and by experience -- our own experience, I mean not just  Belarusia's, but the experience of all former Union republics  and world experience as a whole.    Let me begin with an extremely obvious fact. This model has  not achieved success anywhere on the territory of the former  USSR. On the contrary, the more the model has been applied, the  more the economy has fallen apart. We, for example, immediately  refused to adopt the ideas put forward by the radical marketeers  -- wholesale liberalization and total privatization. And we  thereby prevented the kind of collapse we are seeing among our  neighbors.    [Stepanenko] But your opponents claim that until recently  Belarusia was being helped along by cheap Russian oil.    [Kebich] Excuse me, this is just political speculation and  deception. For Russia and its enterprises, oil and gas were  even cheaper, but production there has declined at a far quicker  rate than in Belarusia.    [Stepanenko] Specialists say the fact that the republic  survived and did not go under with just 4 percent of its own raw  materials and components is nothing short of an economic miracle.    [Kebich] To a certain extent it really was a miracle. It is  important to understand why. We kept to the safety margin that  we had in the previous economic system. Let me remind you that  back in 1989 the national income grew by almost 8 percent and  was probably the highest in the world. Despite all the  distortions and deformations which for dozens of years were  imposed on this economic system, its healthy foundation, and  particularly its planning system, demonstrated its advantages.  In order to extricate ourselves from the crisis, we intend to  bolster rather than weaken this foundation. How did Franklin  Roosevelt extricate the U.S. economy from the crisis caused by  the elemental forces of the free market? By planned programs,  and control and regulation of prices and interest rates.       Even today in West Europe, EEC countries' agricultural  production prices are planned and handed down from Brussels.  And what about the Southeast Asian market and the Japanese  economic miracle? Once again, it was achieved with the help of  extremely vigorous and soundly based scientific planned  regulation. Quite frankly, I was amazed by a fact I learned not  so long ago. Almost 30 years ago in Canada our workers  witnessed an operation where, in the space of just four hours,  information was collated on the quantity, range, and quality of  footwear all over the country, as well as the demand for these  products -- and this information was then used to make forecasts  and adjust plans.    [Stepanenko] So apparently in Canada they threw all their  intellectual resources and all the structures of state and  science into combating the elemental forces of the market? And  in our country these things have become disconnected?    [Kebich] Precisely. And now, in order to extricate  ourselves from the crisis, we need to make the connection again.  It is time for us to say good-bye to the euphoria over private  property, which is alleged to be the only way of creating real  owners and ensuring the best results. World experience has  dispelled this illusion long ago. In many developed countries  almost half the enterprises are owned by the state and operate  no less efficiently than private ones. And what about  agriculture? Nowadays it should be clear to anyone that the  best results are achieved on state-owned land in Holland and the  state-run cooperatives of Israel. China has fed 1.5 billion  people without private ownership. And the production indicators  of people leasing land (in West Europe this accounts for almost  50 percent) -- and I stress leasing, not owning -- are no worse  than the indicators of those who own it.    What about our Belarusian experience? Despite all our  shortcomings and making do with far less equipment than Western  farmers, the republic's kolkhozes and sovkhozes have produced  150 percent more milk per head of population than all the farms  in the United States. And we have caught up with them in terms  of the amount of meat produced per head of population, you know.  <H5>  Mistakes Must Be Corrected </H5>   [Stepanenko] Nevertheless, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, Belarusia  has also given ground. Laws have been adopted opening the way  for private ownership and a privatization program....    [Kebich] You know, if all forces -- our own "democratic  reformers," the Russians, and the world community -- are  pressuring us, one single country taken separately, and moreover  a country without raw materials and energy resources, it is  practically impossible to resist all alone. The government, of  course, is to blame, but primarily because it was the government  during this difficult period.    It is even said that I am against the market. No, I am not  against it. The market exists in all modern countries. There  was even a market in the USSR. I am opposed to the kind of  market which has been foisted on us by the radical democrats. I  am convinced that privatization should not be imposed by force.  At the meeting I had with industrialists, for example, they  expressed their opposition to the privatization of a number of  major enterprises. I said: Let the labor collectives decide.  A program is a program, and life is life. But we have not  permitted private land ownership in agricultural commodity  production. Only on personal plots and gardens, but these are  basically privately owned anyway. We have taken account not  only of the greater efficiency of collective forms of ownership,  but also the unificatory commune principles inherent in the soul  of the people and the Slav mentality.    [Stepanenko] This ties in directly with the theme of a just  society, the need for which you spoke at the beginning of our  talk.    [Kebich] Yes, I am convinced that unless we pursue a policy  of building a just society, we will never climb out of the pit.  It sometimes seems to me that we are standing on the edge of a  moral abyss and spiritual catastrophe. Today immorality has  become the rule, trickery and deception are commonplace, and  cynicism is a virtue; an amazing change has taken place in  people of all social groups. Ugly economic relations primarily  engender legal and moral thuggery. We need to struggle against  this. We must not place a nuclear bomb under the economy which  will blow society to smithereens. We must not divide society  even more into rich and poor -- it has already been divided  enough. We need to correct our mistakes, honestly acknowledging  that they were made chiefly in important matters rather than  trifles.       [Stepanenko] So then, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, do we need  to make adjustments or completely change course?    [Kebich] What, is it better to persist in wandering off on  the wrong track? Right now a reappraisal of what has been done  is already under way. People in Russia are beginning to  overcome the consequences of the narrowly monetarist approach of  the shock-therapy reforms which destroyed the economy. I am  sure that the bitter experience of the recent perestroyka and  reformist eras will help us to find the right way to extricate  ourselves from the crisis. And I hope we will come out of it  alongside Russia rather than separately.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: May beats forecast with Dollars 711m May Department Stores, the leading US department store group, ended its year to January 29 with net earnings of Dollars 711m, an increase of 18 per cent over the previous year's Dollars 603m. The figure was comfortably ahead of the 11-13 per cent target for annual earnings growth that Mr David Farrell, the chairman and chief executive, set for the group over the next five years at an analysts' meeting last October. Fourth-quarter sales rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 3.57bn while net earnings rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 365m and fully diluted earnings per share advanced by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.37. Full-year sales also rose by 8 per cent, to Dollars 11bn, and fully-diluted earnings per share rose by 17 per cent to Dollars 2.65. May said that during the year it opened 13 new department stores and 216 Payless ShoeSource stores as part of its five-year plan to add 100 department stores and 1,200 Payless ShoeSource stores. These represented an extra 2.7m sq ft of retail space. The group had also benefited from the consolidation of its department store operations into four divisions, which had lowered costs, and from the related closure of some low-productivity stores.</p>

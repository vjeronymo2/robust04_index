			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin by Sayyid </F> Ahmad Khalifah in Jeddah; date not given]    [Text] [Khalifah] What are the aims and results of your  current visit to Saudi Arabia and how do you view the  development of relations between the two countries?    [Seyoum] Our relations with the Saudi Kingdom are old,  advanced, and based on goodneighborliness and mutual respect.  We seek to strengthen and develop them further through exchange  of visits and contacts.    On this visit we have focused on political, trade, and  economic ties and on the various Saudi sectors benefiting from  the trade and investment atmosphere in Ethiopia, which now has a  free economy in the full sense of the word.    [Khalifah] Has your country achieved the necessary stability  that would encourage investment? What were the circumstances  relating to the question of the opposition conference and the  arrests which followed?    [Seyoum] Ethiopia is a democratic country in the full sense  of the word. We have about 100 political parties and  organizations. They all exercise their rights freely in  accordance with the national charter which recognizes the full  rights of the Ethiopian people and nationalities. There are  dozens of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals which are free  to publish what they like.    That democratic thrust does not worry anyone. Quite the  contrary, there have been positive developments throughout the  country, especially in the economic and security fields.    What happened recently, however, was that some groups called  for armed action against the state and the public on the pretext  of making political gains which can be achieved through open  democratic activity for all. Some opposition parties have held  a conference attended by some expatriates. Although thousands  attended that conference and opposed the government and its  programs, the government's view was that that was their right,  but some of those who came from abroad to attend the conference  openly called for and expressed their belief in armed action to  fulfill their political convictions. It is the government's  duty to prevent such action, which would be a threat to peace  and security in a country that has historically suffered the  calamities of futile and unjustified internal and external wars.    In discharging our duties as a government we arrested seven  of these warmongers. Two of them have since been released. The  other five will stand trial.    [Khalifah] You have postponed the parliamentary and  presidential elections several times. Has a final date been set  for that?    [Seyoum] The elections were postponed because of known  compelling reasons related to the strengthening of democracy in  a country that is experiencing democracy for the first time  ever. It has been decided to hold the elections next June.  Then the permanent constitution will be drawn up. It will be  the first in the history of Ethiopia's pluralistic rule.    [Khalifah] Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki has spoken of  difficulties in his country's relations with Sudan. How would  you describe your country's relations with Sudan? Are there  difficulties there too?    [Seyour] We have, over the past two and a half years, been  trying hard to normalize relations with Sudan and we will  continue to do so despite some problems with these relations.  Unless these problems are solved, we expect more difficulties  and they would become public as in the case of Eritrean-Sudanese  relations.    [Khalifah] What is the nature of your problems with Sudan?    [Seyoum] The same kind of problems Afewerki spoke about when  addressing his relations with Sudan, which supports religious  groups to undermine security and stability in the neighboring  countries, and we are one of these countries. We would, of  course, like Sudan to think hard before extending these  practices to the neighboring countries. We can live with Sudan  and others in peace only when each side keeps its convictions,  views, and ideologies within its own borders.    [Khalifah] Has the Eritrean Government given you the details  of its problems with Sudan before or after recent developments?    [Seyoum] Exporting trouble to Eritrea or any state bordering  on Sudan would certainly affect us and we should of necessity  have knowledge of its details and developments. In our  relations with Sudan we are also suffering, the same as Eritrea.  So long as Sudan pursues these policies in Eritrea it would  naturally pursue them in our country. Despite all that, we do  not believe that this situation has asssumed major proportions  but we want it to end in the interests of both countries. We  are discussing these matters with Sudan with complete frankness  and clarity in order to iron out these problems.    [Khalifah] Have your ties with the Western states suffered  as a result of your relations with Sudan when they were good?    [Seyoumr] We have always discussed with the West our  relations with Sudan, and we have always sought to contribute to  the normalization of relations between Sudan and others. Sudan  has no other option.    As regards the West's contribution to our country's economy,  we are fully satisfied with Western and U.S. aid and are trying  to use that aid in rebuilding our country, which was devastated  by internal and external problems and wars that are now things  of the past and will not be repeated.    [Khalifah] Have all the Ethiopian refugees returned to their  country?    [Seyoum] We are working with the United Nations for the  voluntary return of all the Ethiopian refugees. About 13,000 of  them returned from Sudan last year and large numbers returned  from Kenya and Djibouti. We seek to support the returnees and  encourage the return of the others.    [Khalifah] Is your country continuing its efforts to solve  the Somali problem, having failed in its latest efforts to  achieve that objective?    [Seyoum] Although we cannot do for Somalia more than we have  done and are doing, we are definitely interested in Somalia's  security and stability because there are about 1 million  Ethiopian Somalis and about half a million Somali refugees in  our country. That is why an effective solution for the Somali  problem would very much interest us, not least because of its  importance for the security and stability of our country and the  region and for the preservation of its resources.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report in the U.S. paper THE WALL  STREET JOURNAL, cited by the South Korean KBS-1 radio, the Kim  Yong-sam traitorous nation-selling clique agreed with the U.S.  authorities to purchase Apache offensive helicopters, anti-tank  missiles, and other ultramodern weapons from the United States.    The puppet authorities will soon start purchasing weapons  and  when these weapons are brought into South Korea, the puppet  Army's arms buildup plan, pushed for by the Kim Yong-sam group  under instigation of the U.S. imperialists, will be completed  ahead of schedule.    Reporting this, the paper revealed that the issue of  purchasing U.S. military equipment was stressed during the talks  between U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who made a junket to Seoul  a few days ago, and puppet high-ranking officials.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Sweeney Todd - Musical theatre Perhaps Stephen Sondheim really is a minority taste: attempts to find a tape or record of his original Sweeney Todd in London last weekend failed even at shops that claim to have practically everything. Assassins flopped in New York and the brilliant production at the Donmar Warehouse early last year turned out to have only minority appeal. Sweeney Todd was a limited success when it first played in London 13 years ago, but suffered from the vast size of the Drury Lane Theatre. The Royal National Theatre's revival goes to the other extreme and confines it to the very small space of the Cottesloe, which will anger a lot of people because there aren't many seats and most were sold in advance. But apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the show? The answer is that it is 90 per cent terrific. No company in Britain is likely to match the RNT when it pulls out all the stops, which in this case include an organ. As a programme note admits, not even the RNT could have deployed so many resources without 'a lavish and inspired donation from the Mackintosh Foundation'. The cast includes a chorus which is there not mainly to sing. Most of the time it simply moves, observes and registers reactions. This is wonderful ensemble playing. Aficionados will most admire the music in all its considerable variety. Some of the scores and lyrics could not come from anyone but Sondheim. He has a way of writing an eight-syllable line followed by one seemingly shorter; sometimes he does it with a five then a four. Often he complements it with an off-rhyme. Listen to the marvellous 'Do they think that walls can hide you? Even now I'm at your window'. Sondheim is a complete master of this form. Then, just when he may be becoming predictable, he switches to another style. You will pick up a lot of references to other musicals in Sweeney Todd. The Johanna song, beautifully sung as the barber slits the throats, reminds you of Maria in West Side Story. Mrs Lovett's jolly and romantic 'By the Sea' stirs memories of 'The Surrey with the Fringe on Top' in Oklahoma. And Sondheim feeds on himself. The 'Nothing's going to harm you' song in Sweeney is close to his 'You are not alone' in his later Into the Woods. At the Cottesloe, the musical star in a production where no one falls below par is Adrian Lester as Anthony, the good friend to Sweeney. He has a voice to which you could listen all night, but you can never overlook the support, sometimes the virtuosity, of the nine-strong orchestra. There is acting to go with it, comedy as well as melodrama. Here the star is Julia McKenzie's Mrs Lovett, who has most of the best lines - 'the worst pies in London' and 'just a couple of rats gone home to Jesus'. Alun Armstrong's Sweeney is the hardest part of all because, for all his butchering, he is simply a straight male lead. I don't think he quite manages the shifts from the thirst for vengeance to becoming almost respectable and back again. But perhaps the fault is in the writing. It is not quite clear whether Sweeney is a hero or a villain. True, he can be a bit of both, yet it is a question which Declan Donnellan's otherwise admirable direction has not fully resolved. The other slight failing is overdoing the macabre. The cannibalistic song at the beginning of the second act where everyone munches the pies should be omitted for reasons of taste as well as length. Others may object to the mounting tide of blood. A whole bucket of it is poured down a drain at the front of the stage, and when Judge Turpin is killed it spurts sideways like a burst hose at full blast. There is a distinction between a desire to shock and simply showing off. Cottesloe, London</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Chile's Supreme Court named a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of  torture of children and other human rights abuses at a secretive colony of  German immigrants in the Andean foothills 250 miles south of Santiago. West  Germany, which says it has evidence that settlers are mistreated and virtually  imprisoned by colony leaders, has been pressing for more than a year for an  investigation of the settlement, founded in 1961 by Paul Schaeffer, a former  German army nurse. Schaeffer was forced to flee his homeland after being  accused of child abuse at a home he ran there.  </P></p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Gengold ahead 18% on tight cost control IMPROVED cost control and a rising gold price helped Gengold, the gold arm of South Africa's Gencor group, lift after-tax profits by 18 per cent to R76.6m for the three months to the end of March from R65.1m (Dollars 20.4m) in the quarter to the end of December. The group also announced three medium-sized capital projects at the Beatrix, Buffelsfontein and Kinross mines, which are in total worth about R200m, reflecting increased confidence in the industry's prospects. The trend in the group towards mining less, but higher grade, ore continued. Compared with the March 1992 quarter, the group milled 18 per cent less ore, but an increase in the average grade to 6 grams per tonne from 5.2 grams meant total gold produced was only 5 per cent lower at 17,156kg, compared with 18,037kg. Total working costs for the group were 8 per cent lower than a year ago, with unit costs nearly 4 per cent lower at R26,699 per kg gold produced against R27,626 per kg. The effect of hedging transactions and a firmer gold price was a 2 per cent increase in the average price received to R32,942 per kg from R32,304 per kg the previous quarter. Buffelsfontein plans to spend R74.6m on its Multigold project which allows for a more sophisticated dump treatment operation, raising gold recoveries to 80 per cent from 40 per cent. The project offers an 18 per cent real rate of return. Production costs at the operation will be R17,000 per kg. Meanwhile, Beatrix plans to spend R77m to sink a minor shaft which will give it a five-year breathing space before having to decide whether to proceed with a larger R450m three-shaft project which is necessary to maintain tonnage. Kinross is spending R44m building two decline shafts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] As we know, the 17th round of Russo-Estonian talks,  which was held recently, produced no specific results  whatsoever. The talks merely complicated relations between the  two states still further. The negotiations are bogged down over  the question of 11,000 military pensioners who wish to go on  living in Estonia. Since over half of these retired personnel  are younger than 60, Tallinn considers that they pose a threat  to Estonia's national security. It says the question of the  pensioners cannot be linked to the withdrawal of the last  contingent of Russian troops, 2,500 men in all.    However, the Russian delegation has refused to sign the  withdrawal agreement unless the question of the pensioners who  want to stay on in their apartments is first resolved.    After the failure of the last round, Tallinn initially  intended to suspend the negotiating process in order to draw  world attention to the problem. However, a meeting of the  cabinet made a different decision. It adopted a statement,  accusing Russia of trying to destabilize the situation in the  Baltic region, but calling on Moscow to start consultations --  at a high political level, as it was put.</p>

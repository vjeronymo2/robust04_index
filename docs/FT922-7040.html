			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Frost frozen Whatever one thinks about the relative merits of British and US TV, when it comes to serious current affairs programmes on Sunday morning, the US wins hands down. Whether it's CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press, or ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, most of the political issues of the week generally get a good airing before Sunday lunchtime. In Britain, the early Sunday morning current affairs field has been left very much to David Frost, television interviewer of the rich and powerful. However, his eight-year-old Frost on Sunday programme ends in December. GMTV, which has won the breakfast TV franchise, doesn't think that his 1.4m audience is big enough. Instead, Liz Howell, the GMTV director of programmes who has pulled the plug on Frost, says she wants 'a leisure show about the family'. Frost is not the only casualty. Business news is going to be scaled back drastically, and entertainer Jeremy Beadle will be running a quiz. As for Frost, his best chance of staging a comeback lies with TV-am's planned bid for the Channel 5 franchise. But that is unlikely to be on the air before the end of 1994.</p>

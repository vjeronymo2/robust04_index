			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akihiko Tanaka, staff writer] </F>   [Text] Technology for recycling auto parts -- leading  environmental polluters -- has been nudged forward with the  development of a new method for completely removing paint from  used car bumpers.    Superficial as it sounds, paint removal is not something  ``green'' technology can afford to gloss over.    Any impurities left on polypropylene bumpers -- the primary  kind used in Japan -- weakens the strength of the recycled  product. At best, tinted bumpers can expect to come back to life  as foot rests or spare-tire buckets.    Hence the importance of the new method developed jointly by  Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd.    While all the major automakers have been working to develop  recycling technology, Nissan claims it is the first to achieve  100 percent paint removal. Nissan's method combines the use of  an alkaline solvent with hulling technology derived from rice  polishing.    First, used bumpers retrieved by Nissan-affiliated  dealerships are sent to Mitsui Petrochemical to be crushed. The  resulting mass is then immersed in a hot alkaline solution where  polyester contained in the molecular structure of the paint is  dissolved. To remove the final traces of primer, force is  applied to the surface using the hulling technology. Other  materials are carefully removed by filtration.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-14A>      FIGURE </FIG>    As well as completely removing paint, this technique has the  advantage over existing methods of being able to process bumpers  made by other automakers and is lower in cost.    There are three other bumper-paint removal techniques: a  hydrolysis method that uses pressure and high temperature, a  compressed vibration method and the ``cyclone'' method.    The hydrolysis method was developed jointly by Toyota Motor  Corp. and Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Laboratories  Inc. In this procedure, the paint is chemically decomposed to  form a gel, which is then fused and mixed. Hydrolysis has proved  effective for engineering plastics with heat plasticity, but is  difficult to use on products made by other manufacturers. What's  more, the physical properties of the resulting products are  reportedly inferior to those made using the Nissan technology.    The compressed vibration method is used by the Gifu research  center of Ein Co. BMW Japan Corp. began recycling used cars in  January, and is entrusting all of its bumper recycling to Ein.  Ein's method removes 99.4 percent of the paint, but it is rather  expensive and Japanese automakers have shied away from it.    The cyclone method is currently being developed by Sumitomo  Chemical Co. This technology involves pulverizing the paint into  units several hundred microns in size. The drawback is that it  wastes a lot of energy and is also very expensive.    Even with its advantages, Nissan's technology is not  problem-free. Profitability remains the biggest obstacle to be  cleared.    At present, Nissan is using the technology to recycle only  about 2 tons of bumpers every month, most of which are used as  replacement bumpers for the firm's Bluebird models. The company  reportedly needs to process about 500 tons per month to make the  exercise profitable. For that reason, Nissan is seeking the  cooperation of other automakers.    Despite the technological successes, there is still much  ground to be made in recycling auto parts. Reprocessed bumpers  still amount to only a drop in the bucket compared with the  total number discarded. And while it is possible to recover used  bumpers from dealers, there are no established channels for  recovering heavier parts.</p>

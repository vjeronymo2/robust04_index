			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL CORPORATION CHIEF RESIGNS AFTER 3 YEARS  </P> <P> Citing "personal and career reasons," Stephen Ummel has resigned as president  and chief executive officer of Memorial Health Services, the corporation that  owns Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and other facilities, after three years  at that post. "I've thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from my association with  Memorial," Ummel said in an interview, "but it appeared an opportune time for  both parties to reach this agreement."  </P> <P> Among major accomplishments during his tenure, Ummel said, were the improvement  of computer technology, the development of basic "core" values for operation of  the hospital and important strategic planning for its future.  </P> <P> While declining to divulge specific plans, Ummel said he was exploring several  "exciting career opportunities" locally and out of state. "I'm confident that  I'm leaving Memorial stronger and more resilient than when I assumed this  position," he said.  </P> <P> No plans have been made to find a permanent replacement, according to hospital  spokesman Ron Yukelson. "Institutionally, we all wish him well in his future  career and endeavors," Yukelson said of Ummel, whose departure was announced  Wednesday, a day after it became effective.  </P></p>

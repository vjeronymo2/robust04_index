			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'ORGANIZATIONAL JUGGERNAUT';  </P> <P> NEW YORK OPPONENT SAYS PHOENIX HOUSE IS 'TOUGH'  </P> <P> A salesman who helped lead an unsuccessful fight against Phoenix House in his  New York community warned Lake View Terrace residents Tuesday that it will be  difficult to stop the firm's Nancy Reagan Center for drug-abuse treatment.  </P> <P> Richard Tramonti said the Phoenix House drug center, which opened in 1981 near  his house in Shrub Oak, N.Y., has caused few problems. But he said he objected  to the "pure arrogance" of the company in not checking with the community  before deciding to start a drug treatment center.  </P> <P> "They are an organizational juggernaut," Tramonti said at a news conference  called by the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. "They're tough."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 210-Bed Center  </P> <P> Phoenix House has proposed putting the 210-bed center, where the former First  Lady will have an office, in the vacant Lake View Medical Center.  </P> <P> "Visiting this site, I think we're lucky in Shrub Oak," said Tramonti, who was  in Los Angeles visiting sick relatives. "At least we have space between us and  them."  </P> <P> In Shrub Oak, a community of 3,500 people north of New York City, the  250-student Phoenix Academy is housed in a former Jesuit seminary. The  buildings are about 500 yards from the nearest houses, while the Lake View  Medical Center buildings are within about 40 yards of houses.  </P> <P> Phoenix House representatives could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  Mitchell S. Rosenthal, company founder and president, has said hard feelings in  Shrub Oak and other communities are based on misconceptions about the firm's  centers.  </P> <P> "We do not feel good about causing worry about people's homes and their  children," he said after a public hearing in Lake View Terrace in January. "But  most of the fears and concerns are imaginary."  </P> <P> Complimentary letters from the Yorktown Police Department, which patrols Shrub  Oak, and town Supervisor Nancy Elliot were submitted to the city of Los Angeles  with Phoenix House's application for a permit to operate the Lake View Terrace  center. Elliot said she opposed the center at first but later changed her mind  after problems did not materialize.  </P> <P> But Lewis Snow, vice president of the homeowner group, said Tramonti's comments  confirm that Phoenix House would not be a good neighbor.  </P> <P> "It does show we're not running around like Chicken Little," Snow said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loophole in Law  </P> <P> Tramonti helped lead Shrub Oak residents who fought Phoenix House. But when the  town would not grant Phoenix House a permit to open its center, the company  found a loophole in state law that allowed the center to open as a branch of  New York City's schools.  </P> <P> Tramonti offered few facts Tuesday to support his claims that Phoenix House has  broken promises to the community.  </P> <P> The center has not admitted Shrub Oak drug users despite promises to clean up  the community's drug problems, he said.  </P> <P> Phoenix House representatives have said they were forced to revise plans to  treat Shrub Oak youths because they could not get the permit from the town.  Because the Phoenix Academy is licensed as a New York City school, its clients  must be former or current students of that district, company officials have  said.  </P> <P> Tramonti said supervision at the center has sometimes been lax. He said he has  seen adolescents wandering on country roads near his house two or three times  in the eight years since the center opened. He said some of them claimed to be  Phoenix House clients and appeared to be high on drugs. He said he never  reported the incidents to authorities.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria  arrived at midday today at Madrid-Barajas international airport  and will be received in the next few hours by his Spanish  counterpart number, Javier Solana. In these talks they will  deal with questions relating to the peace process and the  holding of the second part of the general elections in El  Salvador on 27 April.    However, it is possible that in the talks they will discuss  the documents published by the daily THE WASHINGTON POST  indicating that the U.S. Administration knew of the involvement  of the Salvadoran Army in the murder of Spanish Jesuits in  November 1989.</p>

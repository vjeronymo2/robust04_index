			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Eastern demand lifts Cognac spirits: The industry expects valuable markets in China and Vietnam The Cognac region of south-west France is in better cheer. Producers of what Victor Hugo described as the 'liqueur of the gods' are starting to see stronger shipments after years of sober demand. More important, the industry is hoping the rise of valuable new markets, notably China, will lead to a further surge of exports. 'In the next 10 years, China has the potential to become by far the world's biggest market,' says Mr Gilles Hennessy, vice-president of Hennessy, one of the largest Cognac houses. 'Along with markets such as Vietnam, this is where we see future growth.' This is echoed by industry analysts. In a report on Remy Martin, the biggest name in China, Mr Edouard de Boisgelin, a Merrill Lynch analyst, describes the market as 'a new Eldorado'. He believes growth will be uneven and vulnerable to political and economic developments, but the coastal Chinese market could reach 29m bottles by the year 2000, against 6m at present, and 20.8m in the US, the biggest market in 1993. For the Cognac producers, the importance of China and other new markets reflects several factors. The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac, representing the 300 or so Cognac companies, says about 94 per cent of sales comes from exports, with the lion's share accounted for by the US, Japan, Hong Kong and western Europe. As a result, the industry depends on markets which in many cases are mature or sluggish. But room still exists for growth. The US has rebounded from recession to regain its position as the number one market. Analysts also expect recovery in Japan, badly hit by economic downturn. 'There, a lot of purchases were on corporate entertainment budgets and these have been hit as companies have tightened their belts,' says Mr Hennessy, whose company is the market leader. Overall sales in Japan fell to 17.4m bottles-equivalent in the year to the end of August, from 22.3m in the same period in 1992-1993. Price cuts have prompted improvement, but the return to previous levels has so far proved gradual. Despite resurgence in shipments to the US, and Japan's recovery prospects, few observers see rapid growth in existing markets. New markets are prompting the enthusiasm. 'Emerging markets such as China are the main hope,' one analyst at a French bank said. This hope is partly justified by the Chinese market's rapid growth. 'The Chinese have always had a taste for Cognac,' says Mr Hennessy. Whether the appetites of the Chinese consumer and the Cognac companies will be satisfied depends on progress in resolving the obstacles. Most important are the high taxes facing importers of liquors and spirits. Tariffs increase the cost of a bottle of Cognac by about 150 per cent; taxes take the total price rise to almost 250 per cent. Import barriers are an important element in talks on China's membership of the World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which comes into effect at the start of next year. One Cognac executive said progress was being made, partly because Beijing was seeking to curb the black market through which most Cognac at present enters China. But the gap between the Chinese offers on tariff cuts and the demands of the international spirits industry still remains to be bridged. Partly because of high tariffs and taxes, emerging markets in Asia, Russia and Latin America remain vulnerable to counterfeit producers. But things have improved somewhat over the past two years, one senior executive in the industry says. In Thailand, he estimates counterfeit Cognac now represents a few per cent of the market, against up to 30 per cent a few years ago. Steps are being taken to limit the problem in the new markets. In China, Hennessy has agreed to set up a laboratory with Chinese partners to root out counterfeit products. The company believes such moves will help smooth access for French producers, but the process may take a long time. Given the market's potential size, the wait would seem worth it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sia [Godfather] P. Pet is spending 300 million baht  to develop 36 rai of land in the middle of Nakhon Phanom. He is  building a huge open-air market with 1,800 stalls. He is trying  to curry favor with merchants in order to win votes. He is also  planning to build a trade center, commercial buildings, and a  bus station. Construction is scheduled to get underway at the  beginning of 1994. On the political front, he is continuing to  fight even though ``Big Chiu'' [Chawalit Yongchaiyut] has  announced that he will run in Zone 1.    Mr. Thanong Siriprichaphong, or Sia P. Pet, the president of  the Little Duck hotel group and a Thai Nation Party MP [member  of parliament] from Nakhon Phanom Province, told THAN SETTHAKIT  that he is developing 36 rai along Nittayo Road in the heart of  Nakhon Phanom City. He is building a large open-air market, a  trade center, commercial buildings, and a bus station. He is  investing about 300 million baht in this project. Construction  is scheduled to get underway in 1994, and it is expected that  businesses will open that same year. To date, no name has been  given to the project.    The open-air market, which will be located on approximately  seven rai, will have 1,800 stalls. Merchants in Nakhon Phanom  Province will be able to buy or lease stalls at a low price.  This will help solve the problems of merchants in Nakhon Phanom  who lack places to sell their goods. There is now only one  open-air market. Another problem is the lack of space at the  existing stalls. This will also make it easier for people to buy  goods.    The trade center will be very large. It may have mini-stores  or super-stores, but there are no plans to build a large  department store. The bus station, to be located nearby, will  occupy approximately four rai. Commercial buildings will be  built around the area. Various bus lines will be allowed to use  the facility. At present, the various buses park in different  locations. If they all stop at this bus station, this will make  things more convenient for the people.    ``Right now, I can't give you all the details. Nakhon Phanom  City plans to build a new road through this area. The exact  location of the road isn't clear yet. This project must be  located near this road. We should know the details in the near  future. As for construction, all the preparations have been  made. Once we know where the road will be built, we will begin  drawing up the plans. Actually, it was villagers who came and  asked me to build this project. They are particularly interested  in our building an open-air market, because there are quite a  few problems concerning this.''    Thanong said that he will continue to engage in politics  even  though it is now certain that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the  leader of the New Aspiration Party, will move his base from  Nonthaburi Province and run for election in Zone 1 in Nakhon  Phanom Province, which is the same zone where Mr. Thanong will  run for election. General Chawalit has organized an election  team in the area. In the next election, he [Thanong] will  definitely run for election, and he is ready. He frequently gets  out to visit people. How the election turns out is up to the  people. Mr. Thanong denied the rumor that General Chawalit had  sent people to ask him not to run for election. He said that  there is no truth at all to that rumor.</p>

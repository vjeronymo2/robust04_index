			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- Milan Babic, chairman of  the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina, and Vojislav Seselj,  chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, signed an inter-party  agreement in Belgrade today on a coalition for the formation of  new bodies of power following elections in the republic of Serb  Krajina. It was stated that the newly-formed coalition will act  jointly in the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina and will  jointly form a government and other bodies of power. The  agreement envisages that each party, i.e. member of the  coalition, should participate in the government and other bodies  of power in proportion to the number of seats in the Krajina  parliament.    In last week's parliamentary elections the Serbian  Democratic  Party of Krajina won 32 seats while the Radicals won 16 of the  overall number of 84 seats in the assembly of the republic of  Serb Krajina. A statement from the meeting today says that the  coalition partners reached an agreement on the division of the  posts in the presidency of the Krajina assembly and Krajina  government which correspond to these parties.    Following this meeting, Seselj stated that the two parties  have agreed that one party will hold the post of assembly  speaker while the other will have the prime minister's post.  The political goal of the coalition, as the statement says, is  the affirmation of the national and state interests of the  Serbian people and the republic of Serb Krajina, and the  securing of stable conditions for the democratic functioning of  bodies of power, while the basic goal is the unification of all  Serbian lands and the establishment of a unified Serbian state.</p>

From an economic point  of view, "Italy is OK" although political uncertainty will still  be felt over the next two months. Budget Minister Luigi  Spaventa, who will be running as a progressive candidate in the  upcoming elections, entered the field to comment on the  difficult stage which our economy -- jolted by turbulence on the  international markets -- is currently undergoing. Spaventa made  a number of statements yesterday [2 March] on TG2 [TV news]:  "Regarding the lira's [L] exchange rate," the budget minister  said, "I do not believe that there is any reason for serious  concern, at least not as long as these fluctuations take place  below the L1000 to 1 German mark level." On the other hand,  relative to interest rates, Spaventa stated "the drop has  already been interrupted. In fact, we have experienced a rise.  I am afraid that this climate of uncertainty or, in any case,  the fact that the rates have not dropped further," he added,  "may continue for another couple of months."    As a matter of fact, according to the progressive candidate,  it is political uncertainty which is disturbing the markets  most. Spaventa explained why "when it rains elsewhere, here in  Italy it hails." The budget minister believes that "as [Prime  Minister] Ciampi said, we are OK from an economic point of view  in the areas of checking inflation and adjusting our balance of  payments. If we are considered to be at risk, this is largely  due to the political uncertainty which will continue for several  more months. The most harmful effect will be felt, in fact, in  terms of the interest rates, given the repercussions the  increased cost of the debt will have on overcoming the deficit  in public funds."</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Rail sale may delay BR and London fare rises British Rail and London Transport fare increases due on January 1 face postponement because of difficulties resulting from rail privatisation and performance targets set by the Passengers' Charter. British Rail is expected to announce average increases of 3 per cent to 4 per cent for 1995, nearly double the level of inflation but lower than the 6 per cent the Treasury is believed to have been pressing for. London Transport, whose fares normally rise in unison with British Rail's, is expected to putbus and Underground fares up by about 5 per cent a week later than normal on January 8. However the BR increases may have to be deferred. BR has faced obstacles in agreeing rises for the increasingly independent train operating units that are taking over the running of train services. Some of these will soon become independent companies to be sold into the private sector, while others will be sold later in the privatisation programme. The Department of Transport, the Treasury and the prime minister's office are understood to have discussed the level of rail fares increase. Mr John Major is believed to have insisted that rises should be modest. The Passengers' Charter imposes limits on increases on lines that fail to meet reliability and punctuality targets. That means that for the second year running BR has had to work out smaller increases for parts of the network and agree them with the Transport Department. Failure by BR and London Transport to increase fares simultaneously means Underground passengers who buy Travelcards, which can also be used on BR, would pay more than passengers who start their journey with BR. A limit on increases will be good news for travellers but will put financial pressure on BR.</p>

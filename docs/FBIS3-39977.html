Turkey  is not satisfied with Russia's explanations on the issue and is  asking for additional clarification.    Russian Ambassador to Turkey Albert Chernyshev indicated  that  he has little information on the conference in which  organizations affiliated with the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] are participating and added that Russia has not  changed its views on Turkey's unity and territorial integrity.    In a statement to a Russian paper, President Suleyman  Demirel  said Russia has shown sensitivity toward Turkey's difficulties  as regards terrorism. But, Demirel added, our people are  extremely sensitive. He stated the need for additional  explanations so that the people don't get the impression that  Russia is supporting terrorism.</p>

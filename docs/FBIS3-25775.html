			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Voters Urged To Determine Transition Outcome -- "Mr Nelson  Mandela's meeting with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Tuesday may  turn out to be more than another round of political theatre, but  don't bank on it," states the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in  English on 27 February in a page-22 editorial. "Mr Mandela has  moved about as far as he can towards meeting the Zulu leader's  demands, and Mr Buthelezi is too wounded, too aggrieved, too  defensive to risk a generous impulse. There is a chance of  progress, but it's a slim, slim chance." Continuing, the  editorial questions whether the talks that have been going on  between the government, the African National Congress [ANC], and  the Freedom Alliance truly qualify as negotiations and not  simply "manipulation of public perceptions." At the end of the  day, what the public must do is "brace" itself "for the  probability that the election will go ahead without either  Inkatha or the Conservative Party," and because support for the  Freedom Alliance is not large enough to cause the boycott to  "change the course of our history," the electorate must now deal  with "the sombre prospect that they will try by terror and  violence to achieve what they cannot do by democratic methods."  Therefore, "the decent majority of voters must gather their  courage and harden their determination to vote no matter what  the threats or the terror inflicted by the violent minorities."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   Plan Against Election Spoilers Urged -- "As the election  campaign of the ANC reaches fever pitch, we hope the  organisation has not relegated the importance of defending the  country's democratic constitution after the April elections to  the bottom rung of its priorities," begins the Johannesburg  SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 February in a page-6 editorial.  "We cannot recall in history anywhere in the world where there  was a major rupture with an old political order and transfer of  power without resistance from the old rulers." Because of this,  "what is needed is a concrete contingency plan to thwart any  attempt to prevent the democratic government from taking office."</p>

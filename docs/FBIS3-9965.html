The president also denied that he wanted  to reduce Guzman's sentence to life imprisonment.    The president was obviously answering an alarming piece of  news disseminated by television on 16 February, according to  which the government signed a 10-point "peace agreement" with  Guzman that included an item on improving Guzman's prison  conditions and ended with a general amnesty for him and his  henchmen.    It was good for Fujimori to have denied in Bogota the  existence of such a pact because it worried some groups of  people -- which possibly constitute a majority of the population  -- who worry more about the severity with which they think  terrorists should be treated than for the alleged trampling of  their human rights.    These groups reacted with indignation when President  Fujimori  said he had granted Guzman and Iparraguirre preferential  treatment in order to get them to write the letters calling for  peace. This indignation was reflected in the polls at the time.  We will never know how many "Yes" votes [for the approval of the  new Constitution] he lost with that revelation.    He should not then repeat the mistake by stumbling on the  same rock again. Guzman's letters had the positive effect of  creating great confusion among Shining Path cadres, true, and  encouraging a split between their leaders and militants. But  they have not stopped the violence, which has continued. This  continued violence has made many people doubt government  policies on the matter, believing that they are unnecessarily  indulgent with individuals who do not deserve anything other  than the harshest punishment.    In fact, as we proposed in this column earlier, the  efficient  Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa-Gadea should make public a  detailed report on Guzman's imprisonment conditions and what  assurances we have that he will not be able to leave his jail  until the end of his days. The television crew who filmed him  without his striped uniform, warmly calling for an unconvincing  pacification, should now show us where he is and who he is  talking to.    Because we still have the bitter taste of his letter with  instructions to Scandinavian Shining Path followers, which was  first published by EXPRESO, and the fact that no one was able to  explain how the letter left the jail, first, and how it left the  country, second.</p>

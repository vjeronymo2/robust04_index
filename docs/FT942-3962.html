			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Unflappable Kohl sees the tide turn in his favour: Both the European and local elections have brought welcome news for the chancellor The first big test of Germany's 1994 election marathon yesterday left Chancellor Helmut Kohl the clear victor, confirming a dramatic reversal of the trend in public popularity and opinion polls for the past two years. The combination of European elections nationwide and local elections in seven of Germany's 16 federal states saw the unflappable chancellor emerge yet again as the dominant force in German politics. He shrugged off personal unpopularity in the polls, and last year's drastic slump in the economy, to prove the forecasters wrong. The key appears to have been a sharp reversal in public pessimism over the state of the economy and the nation, with growing confidence that recovery is well under way. Mr Kohl has caught that turn in mood and exploited it to the full. The chancellor's Christian Democratic Union managed to improve its position in the European poll by around three percentage points and remain the strongest single party in local elections in east Germany, against virtually all forecasts there. The results amount to a resounding endorsement of the chancellor's strategy of selling himself as the one stable, reliable, internationally trusted and thoroughly pro-European figure in the German political establishment. For Mr Rudolf Scharping and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), which has been in front in the polls until the past few weeks, the day demonstrated a clear failure to make a breakthrough against the ruling CDU, in spite of rising unemployment and the economic recession. The uncharismatic Mr Scharping now faces an uphill struggle. And yet the outcome in October is by no means clear, not least because the liberal Free Democratic party, the preferred coalition partner for both Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping, remains desperately weak. If that party cannot recover from yesterday's debacle, when it failed to gain the minimum 5 per cent support needed to win seats in the European parliament, the two big parties may yet be condemned to a grand coalition. The other joker in the pack is the performance of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the former Communist party in eastern Germany, which has shown that it can still command solid minority support - and will very probably win its way back into the Bundestag. The far-right Republicans fared miserably in the polls, seeing a halving in their support from 1989, in spite of the fact that everyone saw the European election as a classic opportunity for protest voting. In stark contrast to the SPD's showing, the day was a big success for the Greens and their eastern allies, Alliance-90: they look set to win more than 10 per cent in the European poll, in apparent justification of an unashamedly radical platform of environmental reform and pacifism. Yesterday's outcome is likely to polarise the political debate far more than before. Mr Scharping's strategy has been primarily to prove that his party was 'capable of government'. He admitted last night it had 'lost the first round. We have failed to persuade the working people of the need for a clear policy of job creation and social justice.' Yet the polls last night suggested a crucial failing in SPD policy: since January, when a majority saw the party as more economically competent than Mr Kohl's coalition, the tables have been turned. In June, according to a poll for ZDF television, only 18 per cent still thought so. Mr Scharping may have failed to get his message across. Many in his party will now accuse him of having been too desperate to move into the political centre, stealing the clothes of the CDU. The real victor, however, is Mr Kohl himself. He has repeatedly rejected the forecasts of the polls, demonstrating an absolute belief in himself, in the success of the process of German unification, in the recovery of the German economy, and in the absence of any realistic alternative to his conservative-liberal coalition. He has tirelessly toured from sports hall to beer tent, showing an inexhaustible enthusiasm for electioneering which his rivals cannot match. The perception of gathering economic recovery is a crucial factor behind the revival of his party's fortunes but the secret of his success is what they call the 'Kanzlerfrage' - the question of the chancellor. He knows he looks like a chancellor, and Mr Scharping does not. And he is exploiting it quite mercilessly.</p>

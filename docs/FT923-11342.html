			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: Not a rod with which to beat BR, nor a recipe for results (2) Sir, Every manager knows that unclear or divided responsibility is a recipe for poor results. The government stressed with regard to rail privatisation that would-be franchisees for future railway services will have to make commitments to quality, and even suggests that contracts may be withdrawn for failure in this area. But if Railtrack runs the infrastructure the operator will clearly blame it for delays caused by signal or point failure. Equally if the delay is due to problems on a train run by another operator, the buck will again be passed. At least at present one can lay responsibility for delays with a single person (the chairman of British Rail) - even if in recent years he has largely failed to improve things.

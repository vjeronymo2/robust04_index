			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador </F> to the United Nations, by unidentified correspondent in New York  on 18 February; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] The UN Security Council this evening  is discussing UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report  on the presence of members of the Croatian Army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this reason, we have phoned Mario  Nobilo, our ambassador to the United Nations. Good evening, Mr.  Nobilo. Please tell us whether the debate in the Security  Council is still going on.    [Nobilo] In fact, there will be no debate today after my  conversation with the chairman of the Security Council. The  debate will probably be put off until next week. There is no  urgency in the Security Council's moves, and I managed to  explain to the Security Council chairman at today's meeting that  Butrus-Ghali's report itself--unfavorable for Croatia at first  glance--warns about UNPROFOR's limited resources in verifying  the withdrawal, which I had noted in my letter to Butrus-Ghali  yesterday.    However, what is important in the earlier Security Council  demand is the insistence that progress be made. We are  primarily linking the progress to the guarantees we are  demanding of the Security Council for the security of the Croat  enclaves in central Bosnia. It also depends on the progress  achieved in the promising negotiations between the Croat and  Muslim sides in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And, of course--there is a  new element here--the withdrawal of enormous quantities of heavy  weapons and the new military situation around Sarajevo create a  new military balance in the region. That could be used against  the Croat side; we would like the Security Council to prevent  the regrouping of Muslim forces against the Croats. I do not  believe that will happen, but the Security Council is aware of  the new circumstances.    I believe, therefore, that this whole report is a form of  pressure on Croatia--not only on Croatia, but on all sides in  former Yugoslavia--to reach a peaceful settlement. This  particularly serves the West and the international community in  their endeavors to have the remaining disputed issues between  the Croat and Muslim sides resolved and to see the defining of  the future good and dynamic relations between the two peoples  and states--which is why I think this pressure should be viewed  in the context of such a process. This is primarily a process.    What is important, however, is that finally we have an  active  consensus of the great powers on the European level and that  people are finally talking in resolute tones. Croatia will  certainly--in this sense, as it has hitherto--be the most  cooperative party so that there is no direct danger if this  process--which began with the president's Bonn initiative--were  to continue to develop favorably, despite international factors  being as active as they are now.    [Correspondent] In the secretary general's report--at least  according to the text that we have received--quite a few things  are unclear. Mr. Butrus-Ghali says the blue helmets were not  able to supervise the withdrawal throughout the area, but there  was a withdrawal. It is stated that not a single command center  of the Croatian Army nor activity by any brigade was identified,  and it speculates that the formations of the Croatian Army are  probably significantly more careful. Dr. Nobilo, what can  transpire from such a report for Croatia?    [Nobilo] Nothing directly. But I repeat: It will always be a  way of exerting pressure on Croatia if things deteriorate, and  things will resolve themselves if things improve so that there  are no immediate effects. Butrus-Ghali's report itself  distances itself from all this by saying that they think, and  they believe, and they do not have sufficient proof, and they do  not have sufficient people and mechanisms to carry out the  inspections. This is indicative of the possible relations in  this military area, but it is also certainly to be seen in the  context of the situation in central Bosnia and the talks on the  latest developments around Sarajevo. It should always be seen  in a broad context. We should try not to do ourselves harm  here, but on the contrary, to benefit from it.</p>

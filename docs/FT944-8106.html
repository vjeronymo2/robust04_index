			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / OECD praises US on economic growth: But warns of both macroeconomic and structural problems in the future The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development gives the US high marks in its annual survey* for economic performance over the last two years, but warns of both macroeconomic and structural problems in the years ahead. 'The fundamentals seem sound for the immediate future. The expansion has become more firmly established, and job creation has accelerated without the re-emergence of any wage and price pressures thus far,' the OECD says in the survey, published yesterday. The organisation says policy-makers have recognised that there is very little slack left in labour or product markets and have acted early, by standards of the past, in order to head off a clear acceleration in inflation - although the OECD still believes that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates further over the next year. 'Only if such action succeeds will the expansion be sustained for a longer period, avoiding the bust which inevitably follows a boom,' the report says. The OECD forecasts gross domestic product growth slowing from 3.8 per cent in 1994 to 2.9 per cent in 1995, with inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, accelerating from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.8 per cent in 1995. It projects a current account balance worsening to Dollars 147bn or 2.2 per cent of GDP this year and to Dollars 161bn or 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1993. But the Paris-based organisation sees cause for alarm both over the US's fiscal health in the longer term and over worsening social problems. 'Many of these problems are related to inequities: between those at the top end of the income distribution - who enjoy some of the finest health and education services in the world - and those at the bottom - who lack access to even minimally adequate social services. Only if these inequities are attended to will the long-term economic future of the nation be secure,' the OECD says. On the fiscal front, the OECD applauds the 'gratifyingly significant deficit reduction' undertaken by the Clinton administration, but warns that much of this improvement is largely cyclical. In the near term, the administration's budget projections may be too rosy, the report says, because they rely on real interest rates remaining extremely modest in comparison with the 1980s and lower than the current reality. In addition, a number of popular tax provisions such as the research and experimentation tax credit are due to expire, and will have to be paid for if they are renewed. The OECD also questions the official budget assumption that federal pay rises will average less than 2 per cent a year for the six years from 1994 to 1999, a cut in real terms of more than 8 per cent, which is inconsistent with the declared goal of eliminating the estimated 26 per cent pay gap between government non-defence employees and their private sector counterparts over the next nine years. In the longer term, the OECD warns that much more needs to be done to cut the budget deficit. 'First and foremost, the United States remains at a serious disadvantage with respect to the rest of the world in terms of its lack of investment and especially saving, and there seems little prospect of the private sector providing much relief in this respect' since federal borrowing, although down from a peak of 87 per cent in 1992, still accounts for more than three quarters of total net credit market borrowing. 'There is, therefore, widespread agreement that the surest way to alleviate the shortage of saving is for the public deficit to be cut,' the OECD says. While noting the Congressional Budget Office's doubts about whether the Clinton administration's proposed reform of the healthcare system would in fact bring down the deficit, the OECD warns that an overhaul cannot be avoided much longer. 'Differences of view on the design of healthcare reform must not become a stumbling block to the enactment of any significant reform programme. For without a comprehensive overhaul of some sort, spending pressures are likely to remain unabated, while inequality of access to adequate care will continue to increase,' the report says. Noting the worsening financial projections for Social Security and Medicare, which respectively provide pension payments and health insurance to the elderly, the OECD also urges action to control entitlement spending. 'The longer that action is delayed to deal with these solvency problems, the more draconian the solutions will have to be,' the report says. The survey also provides some support for suggestions by some leaders of the new Republican majority in Congress for scrapping taxes based on corporate and personal income in favour of a consumption-based tax. This might expand the tax base, the OECD says, because all the credits, loopholes and tax expenditures contained in the current system will cost the government as much as Dollars 436bn this year. 'To put it another way, as much as 37 per cent of the tax base has been eroded. Reversing that erosion would allow the same revenue to be raised with lower statutory rates which presumably would be less distortionary,' it notes. * OECD Economic Survey of the United States.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Scalfaro asks banker to be PM: Political outsider promises electoral reform and fiscal austerity in Italy MR CARLO Azeglio Ciampi, the veteran governor of the Bank of Italy who has never held political office, accepted a challenge from Italy's president yesterday to form the country's 52nd post-war government. His appointment comes against the background of a deepening corruption scandal. Mr Ciampi, aged 72, promised to carry out the radical electoral reform endorsed by Italy's voters this month. He pledged that he would also continue with fiscal austerity, defend the lira and regain the lost momentum of privatisation. The surprise move represents the personal choice of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has used his constitutional powers to the limit. It is the first time that a non-parliamentarian has been asked to head a government, a fact that underlines the deadlock among the main parties over a replacement to Mr Giuliano Amato, whose four-party coalition government resigned last Thursday. Mr Ciampi is understood to have had reservations about accepting the task and has demanded freedom from the normal tutelage of the party leaders in choosing his cabinet. He hopes to be able to announce his team today. It will then have to be endorsed by parliament - a process that cannot be taken for granted. Temporarily Mr Ciampi's position in the Bank of Italy will not be filled. Earlier this year he indicated his desire to retire, but the political parties have been squabbling over who should succeed him. His government will have the limited aim of introducing a new set of electoral laws as soon as possible and will then hold early elections. The financial markets reacted positively to the news, with the lira strengthening from L941 against the D-Mark to L933 by the end of the day. In his acceptance speech, Mr Ciampi made a point of promising to continue to reduce the public-sector deficit. The president has gambled on Mr Ciampi's professional prestige to be able to pick a government that can achieve a broad consensus in parliament. Last night, though, political commentators pointed out that electoral reform - the central task after last week's referendum - would be extremely difficult to steer through parliament. The choice of Mr Ciampi was greeted with caution last night by the main opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Left, and by the principal new political grouping, the Lombard League. The Socialists, one of the two dominant partners in the outgoing coalition, also made clear that Mr Ciampi was not their first choice. Profile, Page 2 Italian bond rally, Page 29</p>

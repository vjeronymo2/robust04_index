			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SCHRADER DRIVES TO WIN; WALLACE TAKES POINTS LEAD  </P> <P> Ken Schrader won his second Winston Cup race and Rusty Wallace vaulted past  Dale Earnhardt into the series point lead in the All-Pro 500 Sunday at  Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C.  </P> <P> Schrader came out of the final series of green-flag pit stops to pass Mark  Martin and take the lead only 25 laps from the finish of the 500-mile race.  </P> <P> Harry Gant passed Martin two laps from the end, but his Oldsmobile Cutlass  finished a distant second, 3.75 seconds behind Schrader's Chevrolet Lumina.  </P> <P> Martin was third, followed by Elliott, Davey Allison, Derrike Cope and Sterling  Marlin.  </P> <P> Earnhardt, who had a 75-point lead over Wallace coming into the race, started  12th but his camshaft broke on the 13th lap.  </P> <P> Wallace leads Earnhardt, 3,612-3,577 points. Martin moved into championship  contention, trailing Wallace by 157 points and Earnhardt by 122.  </P> <P> Driver Bobby Donner III of Colorado Springs, the open-wheel division winner of  the 1989 Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb, was killed when his race car hit a deer  during a qualifying run for the Fall Teller County Hill Climb near Colorado  Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> Witnesses said Donner's car was going an estimated 120 m.p.h. when it struck  the deer near the end of the 4.6-mile dirt road course.  </P> <P> Donner, 29, was flown from the race course about 20 miles to St. Francis  Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  </P> <P> Teller County Sheriff Gary Shoemaker said the yearling doe, which was cut in  half by the impact, crashed into the open cockpit of the race car, apparently  killing Donner instantly.  </P> <P> "We could hear him coming up the road," said Kevin Baker, a member of Donner's  pit crew. "I could see him coming, and then I saw the deer come out of the  woods and walk right out in the road."  </P> <P> Gary Ormsby set new performance records en route to a top fuel victory at a  National Hot Rod Assn. event at Ennis, Tex.  </P> <P> Ormsby, from Roseville, Calif., drove his dragster to a 4.919-second, 294.88  m.p.h. quarter-mile records. The elapsed time is the quickest in the sport.  </P></p>

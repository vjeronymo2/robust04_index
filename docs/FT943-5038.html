			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Neither foes nor allies The Chinese foreign minister describes his country's warming relationship with Russia as 'neither confrontation nor political alliance'. His choice of negatives is a remarkably honest assessment of the agreements signed in Moscow at the weekend by Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Jiang Zemin of China. The agreements themselves, with the largely symbolic declaration that neither side would target nuclear weapons at the other, are modest, designed to tidy up the frontiers and clear up potential impediments to pragmatic trade and co-operation. But they do mark another useful stage in the Sino-Russian detente which has developed over the past decade. Good relations between Russia's far east and the bordering north-eastern provinces of China have become steadily more important in recent years as Moscow and Beijing have decentralised their economies. Deprived of the goods which used to be allocated by the central plan from distant European Russia, the under-populated regions bordering Russia's Pacific coast have welcomed the chance to buy cheap Chinese consumer goods in exchange for Siberian timber, furs and raw materials. The trade and other economic co-operation agreements signed at the weekend reflect mutual recognition of the beneficial nature of these links. Putting their trading relationship on a more formal and secure basis makes obvious sense for both countries. Mutual recrimination For China, the concentration of economic growth on the coastal cities and the south has left its three north-eastern provinces eager for growing opportunities for trade across the Amur and Assuri rivers which form the often contested borders between the Asian part of Russia and China. This two-way trade, much of it on a private basis, rose sharply to over Dollars 7bn last year but has dropped significantly over the last few months. This follows mutual recrimination over shoddy goods, rising criminality and Russian security concerns over the presence of increasing numbers of Chinese traders. The search for a modus vivendi between the great communist powers was given fresh impetus by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. He, and after him Mr Yeltsin, ended the strategic confrontation with Nato and toned down the ideological and great power rivalry with China which for decades led to the stationing of over 600,000 Soviet troops along the 6,640km Sino-Soviet border. Sino-Russian detente has allowed both countries to devote more of their resources to civilian purposes, although China has been far more successful to date in creating new wealth than Russia which has been bogged down by the immense difficulties of redirecting its militarised industries into more productive use. Military hardware Given the difficulties of military conversion it is not surprising that Moscow is looking harder at potential markets for military hardware. China, with a much less sophisticated military industry and busily modernising its armed forces, is a natural market for cheaper Russian arms whose sale will be facilitated by the latest agreement. On the other hand, the agreements do not bother to disguise the continuing existence of long-term strategic rivalry between Russia, China and Japan in the region. Much of Russia's Asian territory was conquered from the decaying Chinese Empire in the 19th century. Many Russians fear that it is only a question of time before a revitalised China, with over 100m people in the three northern provinces alone, tries to win it back. To prevent this, Russia needs to realise the economic potential and increase the population of a vast region with only 7m inhabitants and vulnerable communications along the Trans-Siberian railway. Above all Russia needs foreign capital to develop its Siberian resources and is more likely to find it in Japan and the US than China. The latest agreement with China is a useful diplomatic achievement. But Russia's long-term future as a prosperous part of the Pacific rim still depends upon coming to agreement with Japan over the future of the four disputed Kurile islands and creating the necessary legal and investment framework for US and other investors to share in the development of Siberian resources.</p>

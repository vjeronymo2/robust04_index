			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 9 May -- Last night, Russian border guards  patrolling a sector manned by the Pyanj border detachment  thwarted an attempt by a group of Tajik opposition guerrillas to  force their way across the border from Afghanistan.    Commenting on this report, Lieutenant General Anatoliy  Chechulin, commander of Russian border guards in Tajikistan,  said that recently, the hard-line Tajik opposition, which has  gone to ground in the northern provinces of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan, has markedly stepped up its provocative sallies in  the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy and Pyanj border  detachments. During the past week alone Russian border guards  manning these sectors had thwarted four attempts by small but  well-armed groups to infiltrate Tajikistan from Afghanistan.    The Russian general noted that border guards, using  artillery, had destroyed all these groups. He also declared  that Russian border guards would suppress any further  provocations with all the firepower at their disposal.</p>

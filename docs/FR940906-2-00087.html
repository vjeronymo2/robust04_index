These rules include requirements for notices and applications submitted to the PBGC. The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request and solicit public comment on this collection of information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All written comments (at least three copies) should be addressed to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0040), Washington, DC 20503. The PBGC's request for extension will be available for inspection at the PBGC's Communications and Public Affairs Department, Suite 240, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Judith Neibrief, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ). Part 2675 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2675), Powers and Duties of Plan Sponsor of Plan Terminated by Mass Withdrawal, implements requirements of ERISA sections 4041A and 4281 (29 U.S.C. 1341A and 1441) for the administration of multiemployer plans that have terminated by mass withdrawal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 4041A, which governs the payment of benefits under such plans, the PBGC may authorize the payment of benefits in amounts or forms not otherwise permitted, and the plan sponsor must reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 4281.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 4281, if the annual valuation of such a plan shows that plan assets are not sufficient to satisfy all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan, the plan sponsor must amend the plan to eliminate benefits that are not eligible for the PBGC's guarantee to the extent necessary to ensure that plan assets are sufficient (as determined and certified in accordance with PBGC regulations) for all nonforfeitable benefits. If, after a plan has been so amended, the plan becomes insolvent ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  unable to pay benefits when due for a plan year), the plan sponsor must suspend benefits in excess of guaranteed benefits to the extent that their payment cannot be supported by the plan's available resources. In addition, if the plan's available resources are inadequate to pay guaranteed benefits, the plan sponsor must request financial assistance from the PBGC (see also ERISA sections 4245(f) and 4261 (29 U.S.C. 1426 and 1431)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assure the consistency and adequate quality of required submissions, Part 2675 includes rules for notices of the adoption of a plan amendment reducing benefits and of any restoration of benefits (&sect;&sect;2675.23 and 2675.24), notices that a plan is, or will be, insolvent and annual updates (&sect;&sect;2675.34 and 2765.35), notices of insolvency benefit level (&sect;&sect;2675.36 and 2675.37), and applications for financial assistance if a plan is, or will be, unable to pay guaranteed benefits when due (&sect;&sect;2675.16 and 2675.38). Part 2675 also provides for the submission of an application for PBGC approval to pay benefits not otherwise permitted (&sect;2675.17). The PBGC uses the information submitted in making statutory determinations and in identifying and estimating cash needs for financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of this collection of information (OMB control number 1212&hyph;0032; expires September 30, 1994) for another three years. The PBGC estimates the total annual burden of these requirements at 427 hours: 10 hours for notices of insolvency and 8 hours for benefit reduction notices with respect to two plans; 4 hours for an application to pay benefits not otherwise permitted under one plan; and 36 hours for annual updates, 45 hours for notices of insolvency benefit level, and 324 hours for applications for financial assistance with respect to nine plans. (The PBGC expects to receive benefit restoration notices so infrequently that the number per year is assumed to be zero.) These estimates are averages that, among other things, take into account PBGC assumptions about increases in the number of insolvent plans over time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, this 29th day of August 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Martin Slate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21893 Filed 9&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7708&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

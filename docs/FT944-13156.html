			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Tokyo Electric Power in Y100bn issue Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's leading electric utility company, will issue Y100bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in 20-year straight bonds for public subscription next month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Japanese government bond market has been affected by expectations of higher short-term interest rates and the issue could have a further negative impact on the market. Tepco, which has been forced to scale down the amount of the issue from Y150bn after surveys of prospective investor demand, will launch the issue with a coupon of 5.05 per cent on November 28. Nikko Securities will serve as lead manager. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned the bond a double-A plus rating, while Moody's Investors Service rated it Aaa.</p>

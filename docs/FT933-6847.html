			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Graseby to cut pay-out to ensure expansion GRASEBY, the electronics group, is to cut its final dividend to retain more funds for expansion. The group, which yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 4.87m in the six months to June 30, will maintain an interim payment of 3.3p. But at the full year it will pay only another 3.3p, making 6.6p for the year, a substantial fall on last year's total of 10.7p. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said he felt it was right to maintain the dividend while the group had been restructuring following its acquisition of Tace and Goring Kerr two years ago and the sale of most of Cambridge Electronics' businesses from which Graseby evolved. The board now felt it was appropriate to retain more of the cash within the company to fund growth. The shares fell 6p to close at 179p on news of the dividend cut. The company's scope for investment in its businesses has been hampered by a high level of debt and the cash drain from its dividend payments. In March the group said it planned to strengthen the balance sheet by floating its US environmental business on Nasdaq, raising about Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.7m) but retaining control. This would be floated once market sentiment in the US environmental sector had improved, possibly by the first quarter of next year. Graseby's half year profits rise represented a 12 per cent increase in earnings from 5.1p to 5.7p. Sales grew 22 per cent to Pounds 55.1m. Gearing rose from less than 100 per cent to 119 per cent at the end of the period on net debt of Pounds 26.7m as a result of payment of the Pounds 4.7m dividend bill. COMMENT Setting a more conservative dividend policy was always on the cards once a decent interval had elapsed after the restructuring. By cutting the dividend payment and floating the US business, Graseby could within 12 months have repaid all its debt, finally allowing acquisitions that involve goodwill write-offs. The hitch is if Graseby is forced to delay flotation of its US businesses because the environmental sector remains in the doldrums - it has underperformed by 20 per cent in the past six months. But even without the float proceeds, profits are likely to be Pounds 10.5m for the full year, giving 11.7p of earnings and a market rating justified by the yield premium that still remains after the dividend cut.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] No session of the peace talks was held in Lusaka,  Zambia, today.    Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye is presently examining  documents received from the government and the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] connected with the  implementation of modalities for national reconciliation. Alves  Antonio reports:    The mediator in the Angolan peace process has changed his  tactic. He is currently examining the documents from the  government and UNITA connected with the implementation of  modalities for national reconciliation, so as to come up with a  compromise which will serve as a foundation for the  negotiations. Thus, the representatives of the government and  UNITA remain on alert in their hotels.    President Frederick Chiluba is expect to receive Alioune  Blondin Beye today to discuss issues connected with the Angolan  peace process.    Meanwhile, members of opposition parties from the  extra-parliamentary group began the day well. They were  received by Ambassador (Rocha Pares), representing the troika of  observers in the Angolan peace process, and they gave him a  proposal which they consider as an alternative for the present  peace talks. Thereafter, they met with government  representatives. At the end of the meeting, the spokesman for  the extra-parliamentary group spoke to the reporting team of the  Angolan National Radio.    [Begin unidentified official recording] Today, 28 June, we  also held a meeting with the government team. We presented our  plan and they briefed us on ongoing discussions. We saw a  certain understanding, a clear optimism on the side of the  government, and thus we think that the process is on the right  track. We encouraged the team to continue with this conduct so  that peace can be found as soon as possible, since many people  are dying in Angola. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China is willing to  further develop its friendship and enhance its co-operation in  all fields with Mauritius on the basis of equality and mutual  benefit.    Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress  (NPC) Standing Committee, said this here today when meeting with  Mauritian President Cassam Uteem.    During their meeting in the Great Hall of the People Qiao  and  Uteem expressed their mutual wish to expand the bilateral co-  operation.    Qiao praised the great efforts made by President Uteem and  the Mauritian Government in developing the Indian Ocean  country's national economy and raising its people's living  standards.    The experience of Mauritius shows that, Qiao said, so long  as  a country maintains political stability and national unity, and  concentrates on developing its economy in accordance with its  national conditions, it will surely keep its economy  continuously developing and its people's living standards  continuously rising.    President Uteem said that he believed that his present trip  to China would further enhance the friendly relations between  the two countries.    China's rapid development has aroused great attention in  Mauritius, the president said.    He added, "We believe that China will play a more important  role in the future in international affairs."</p>

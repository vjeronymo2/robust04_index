			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  proposed Thursday [14 April] that top leaders of the seven  coalition parties decide by themselves to convene a meeting to  discuss the choice of successor to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, coalition officials said.    This was part of a set of proposals adopted at a Thursday  evening session of the coalition's decision-making forum at the  level of secretaries general.    The package of proposals also included agreement to launch  talks on policy matters toward establishment of a new government  and an appeal for new party Sakigake [Harbinger], one of the  seven ruling parties, to come back to the forum, the officials  said.    The secretaries general of the parties in the forum, which  was boycotted by Sakigake, shared the perception that the  eight-month alliance might be dissolved if the parties involved  reject the accord, the officials said.    Leaders of three of the seven parties -- the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and  Sakigake -- gathered to consider the set of proposals Thursday  evening but agreed to reject it.    Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura,  convened a general meeting of all its 15 members in the House of  Representatives on Thursday, who agreed unanimously to reject  the coalition agreement on the launching of policy talks,  Sakigake officials said.    Sakigake has insisted that party leaders, and not the deputy  chiefs, should work out a combination of political parties that  would comprise the new coalition government and pick a candidate  to succeed Hosokawa.    In a three-way morning meeting, SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Takemura  agreed that a breakthrough should be sought through a meeting of  party heads, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news  conference.    The three parties earlier called for a forum of the seven  coalition party leaders to select a candidate for new premier,  but Shinseito [Japan New Party], Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan  New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal.    Takemura said in TV interviews Wednesday night that he  considered it important to establish a democratic system of  decision-making within the coalition.    Takemura also urged the coalition partners to coordinate  their basic policies, decide on the framework of a new coalition  government and select a candidate for the premiership.    Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is  head  of Shinseito, was reported to have emerged as the most probable  successor to Hosokawa.    Hata is in Marrakech, Morocco, for a ministerial meeting  that  will conclude with the signing of a treaty on the Uruguay Round  of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Hosokawa, 56, suddenly announced his resignation last Friday  after a string of financial scandals paralyzed Diet debate on  the fiscal 1994 budget over Hosokawa's rejections of opposition  demands to summon his financial aides to the Diet to have them  testify on the case.    He will remain in office until a replacement is picked.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Doomed BES has twins - The Budget and You People hoping that chancellor Kenneth Clarke would say something about a 'son of the business expansion scheme' - due to be abolished at the end of the year - will be pleased that the BES has spawned twins, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. One is somewhat premature, since only sketchy details of 'a new type of investment trust called a venture capital trust, to invest in unquoted companies,' have been revealed. It will pay dividends free of income tax and gains will not be subject to capital gains tax. This makes it similar to a personal equity plan, but other details will be worked out only after Clarke issues a consultation paper in the new year. The earliest legislation would be in the 1995 Finance Bill. By contrast, the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) for new investment in qualifying unquoted companies is to come into effect from January 1; but since the legislation for it will not be in place until several months later, it is likely to get off to only a slow start. The main features are: Income tax relief at 20 per cent (instead of at the taxpayer's marginal rate under the BES), and full CGT exemption. Full tax relief for losses made on the sale of shares. Investors can become paid directors. Maximum investment raised from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000. Investment in private rented housing will not qualify for relief. Shares must be held for five years. Carryback relief is Pounds 15,000, instead of Pounds 5,000 as under the BES. Companies are limited to raising Pounds 1m, instead of the BES's Pounds 5m (apart from shipping companies, which are allowed Pounds 5m). Qualifying companies must have traded in the UK for three years but do not have to be incorporated or resident there. Ian Pugh of the Allenbridge Group, a BES analyst, said: 'It's taking the BES back to its original intention as venture capital for small businesses. 'It is less attractive than the BES because it is less secure; and there is less scope for tax arbitrage since the front-end tax relief has been reduced from 40p in the pound to 20p. However, the CGT and income tax relief on loss can be exploited.' Charles Fry of Johnson Fry, a BES sponsor which invented the successul 'loan-back' scheme, said the task would be to come up with packages attractive to investors combining the CGT roll-over provision extended by Clarke to all investors (see main article on this page). Investors would still have to pay CGT on their original gain. John Snelgrove, partner for private client services at accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, added: 'We are back to the original BES scheme except that an investor can become a paid director.'</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / School funding move attacked LABOUR alleged yesterday that the Pounds 25m allocated by the government for improving technology facilities in state schools has become a further unfair subsidy for schools that have opted out of local authority control. The Department of Education has announced that 20 per cent of the Pounds 25m intended for 1992-93 will go to the opted-out, or grant-maintained sector, which contains only 3.5 per cent of secondary schools. Such schools already receive favourable capital funding allocations from the government. They also benefit from a funding formula which obliges local education authorities to top up the schools' budgets by an extra 16 per cent. That is intended to meet administration costs no longer provided by the local authority, and is fixed irrespective of the costs incurred. In the approach to the election the latest figures will fuel controversy that the government is seeking to 'bribe' schools to break free from local authorities. Mr Derek Fatchett, a Labour education spokesman, said: 'These figures illustrate the government's double standards in education. We need to improve resources for technology teaching, but there can be no justification for giving nearly seven times as much to children in grant-maintained schools.' In recent reports on school technology teaching school inspectors criticised standards.</p>

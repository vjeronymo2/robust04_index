			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Record tax write-off as collection rate falls: Revenue says high number of insolvencies to blame The government is writing off more in uncollected tax than at any time in history, at a cost of billions of pounds to the Treasury. Figures released this week show that collection rates for a range of taxes have fallen sharply over the 13 years to 1992, the most recent for which information is available. The government is now remitting or writing off more than 3 per cent of the sum it collects for three taxes: schedule D tax on the self-employed, capital gains tax and corporation tax. The taxes in question were assessed but were not collected. The proportion of tax lost in this way has more than trebled since 1980. A total of Pounds 1.36bn in 1992 alone was written off from all direct taxes, which include pay as you earn and National Insurance contributions. The rate of decline in tax collected has been particularly steep since 1990. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said the figures were 'a two-fold failure' reflecting both the depth of the last recession and recent Inland Revenue staff cuts. 'We knew the Tories are not the party of low tax; now we know they are the party which cannot collect tax,' she said. The Inland Revenue said last night that more than three-quarters of the amount of tax written off was the product of insolvencies during recession. This included a higher rate of failures associated with the growth of self-employed businesses over the last decade. 'We aim to collect all tax that is legally due, otherwise it would be unfair to other taxpayers,' it said. Other large sums were written off because the taxpayer had gone abroad or could not be traced, or because the costs of recovery had become too great to justify pursuing outstanding tax. The Revenue also changed its accounting policies in 1992. This resulted in the immediate write off of any tax claims against insolvent companies. If this is taken into account, the amount remitted or written off in 1992 rises to almost Pounds 1.7bn. Ms Harman said she planned to write to Mr Robert Sheldon, MP, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, to urge him to investigate the government's tax collection record. The figures were released by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, in a series of parliamentary written answers to Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat MP for Truro, and Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool.</p>

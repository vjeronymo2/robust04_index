			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, May 27 (YONHAP) -- Tension is mounting in  this southwestern city as students from across the country  arrive to celebrate the eve of the sailing of the second-term  Hanchongnyon (the Korea Federation of Student Councils).    The nationwide student organization will hold its main event  Saturday at the Choson University stadium, where Friday  evening's celebration is also being held. On Sunday,  Hanchongnyon plans to stage a parade after a citizen-student  resolution rally in front of the South Cholla provincial  government building.    The local police agency, estimating over 30,000 students  from  throughout the nation will attend, plans to mobilize 14,000 riot  troopers from 117 police companies to handle any emergencies.    Scores of illuminators and loudspeakers have been installed  around a large podium and other places on campus in preparation  for an inauguration rally and other celebratory functions.    Hundreds of placards and flags are waving at every corner in  the campus area, trumpeting the festival organized by the  student group.    Hanchongnyon has completed arrangements for lodging 50,000  students from across the country it expects to attend while  preparing some 200,000 lunch boxes and thousands of printed  leaflets for the event. Those involved in printing and  supplying food for the lunch boxes are doing a booming business  in Kwangju.    Furthermore, the Choson University student organization has  organized a corps of 1,500 volunteers to assist participants.    Hanchongnyon leaders said students from other parts of the  country started to head for Kwangju early Friday morning, adding  that all preparations for the event are progressing smoothly.</p>

No longer than that,  or we will lose control of the country." For Mikhail Maley, a  former member of the military-industrial complex who was Boris  Yeltsin's adviser before supervising the conversion of the  defense industry for the Russian Security Council, the  composition of the new government does not give rise to  optimism: "The new team has no notion of the country which it  is supposed to govern. It is acting accordingly." Yet Mikhail  Maley was a fierce opponent of Yegor Gaydar's monetary  stabilization policy. But he admits that the former government  "at least had the advantage of basing itself on an idea, one  which was certainly wrong but which was real."    All the signs of an imminent disaster exist, he warned:  "Agriculture no longer has fertilizer or fuel. Unless we take  emergency measures, the sowing will not take place in time."  "In the railroads, I predict a crisis in the spring. There  will be nothing to pay the salaries..." The crisis in the  energy sector is such that Mikhail Maley fears that the  electricity cuts might spread, because the power stations have  not been paid for their services and have no more money for  their energy suppliers.    Unemployment also worries the Russian official: "The next  set of graduates and students will not find work. They have  hitherto found jobs in commerce, in the criminal world. But  every niche is occupied... In the current atmosphere of damaged  pride, lack of heating and electricity, the demonstrators will  not just be angry grandmothers..."  <H5>  Last Asset </H5>   The West is mistaken therefore in abandoning Boris Yeltsin  at  the very moment when the situation is becoming really critical:  "You forget that we are still a big nuclear power, even if we  have become an economic pygmy. We must have access to the  international arms market. Otherwise, we will no longer be able  to respect the rules set by a well-fed and self-important West.  We are being strangled."    Only the military-industrial complex can still save the  country from the crisis, he concluded. With its 6 million men  and its network of enterprises capable of producing almost any  goods, "it is the only organized force which remains in Russia,  the country's last asset."    Judging from what he says, President Yeltsin is beginning to  understand the importance of the issue and supported the defense  industry's plans in the last two meetings of the Security  Council. But he is still too "disorientated" to really commit  himself. "Boris Nikolayevich feels he has chosen the wrong model  of reform, but he is still reluctant to change it," Mikhail  Maley suggested.    The president may not fully share the certainties of his  former adviser on the role of "magic potion" which the defense  complex could play. Indeed, it is far from being monolithic.  It is seriously affected by the crisis.    The defense industry sector has not been spared by the  problem of mounting debts. It is suffering the effects of  government nonpayment amounting to $1.5 billion. IZEVESTIYA  this week devoted the front page of its edition to the explosive  situation in the military enterprises in Siberia. According to  the Russian daily, the Krasmash misile factory has not been paid  by the state for the 11.3 billion rubles worth of orders it  supplied in 1993, and it has not been able to pay any salaries  for four months. The angry workers are furious and marched on  the residence of the region's governor to demand their due. The  governor had to flee to Moscow where he was promised money.  "But the money has still not arrived and there is no more  work," IZVESTIYA reports.</p>

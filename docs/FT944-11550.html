			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MS shares fall Shares in MS International, the Doncaster-based specialist engineering products manufacturer, have fallen 17p to 30p since a profit warning by Mr Michael Bell, the executive chairman. For the six months to October 29 a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 1m is expected against profits of Pounds 462,000. He blamed 'exceptional and difficult trading conditions' experienced by two subsidiaries, MSI-Transportation Systems and Ernst Wilhelms. The rest of the group was trading profitably.</p>

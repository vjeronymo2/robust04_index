			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Yeltsin announces tough economic package THE REFORMIST Russian government of President Boris Yeltsin last night unveiled a proposed package of stringent economic measures, before the country's conservative-dominated parliament gathers today to debate Mr Yeltsin's future. The measures, including higher interest rates and a moratorium on foreign debt repayments, would be enacted by presidential decree under powers assumed by Mr Yeltsin on Wednesday. Their announcement came after a cabinet meeting at the end of a day which brought an abrupt about-turn by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. Moves to impeach Mr Yeltsin for exceeding his authority appeared unlikely after Mr Khasbulatov said he was no longer in favour of this action. 'Frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeachment,' Mr Khasbulatov told reporters. This follows his declaration on Tuesday that the case for impeachment was 'as clear as day'. But, a direct confrontation between the president and parliament is still possible at today's Congress of People's Deputies. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, said he expected the parliament instead to invoke a constitutional clause which strips the president of his powers if he tries to disband or suspend other elected institutions. The deputies, said Mr Shakhrai, would be invited by Mr Khasbulatov to resolve to bring this clause into play if Mr Yeltsin continued his confrontation with them - and would clarify the clause by laying down that, in that case, the office of president would pass to General Alexander Rutskoi, currently vice-president. Such a procedure might not require the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment, and which the conservatives had been struggling to reach. The impact on the congress today of the government's seizing of the economic initiative could not immediately be gauged. The severity of the other measures was tempered by a proposed 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage for state employees to Rbs4,500 a month. But the package was clearly too much even for some cabinet members. It was tabled in the absence of prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who was absent from the meeting to meet the visiting Slovak leadership. Chief among the dissenters was Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the central bank and ex-cabinet member. Earlier yesterday he received a letter from Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for the economy and finance, warning him he intended to seek Mr Gerashchenko's dismissal for failing to act in accordance with government policy. Mr Gerashchenko said he would return any future such messages without reading them. Russia in turmoil, Page 2</p>

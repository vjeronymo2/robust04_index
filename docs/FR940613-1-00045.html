			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing to define the regulatory terms under which a secured creditor may, consistent with the statutory exemption, avoid responsibility for corrective action as an owner and operator of an underground storage tank, as well as proposing an exemption from certain financial responsibility requirements. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section III.D), the statutory exemption from corrective action liability addresses only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> owners <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of underground storage tanks, while the statute and EPA's implementing regulations extend liability to both owners and operators. The Agency believes that without promulgating a rule under EPA's broad grant of rulemaking authority applying the protection found in the statutory security interest exemption to operators as well as owners, the statutory exemption may be rendered virtually meaningless, since an owner of an UST is also typically an UST operator. EPA does not believe that Congress, in creating section 9003(h)(9), intended for an otherwise exempt holder of a security interest to nonetheless fall subject to corrective action obligations as an operator. As such, EPA's exercise of its rulemaking authority in the proposed rule is appropriate and, perhaps, needed to fully effectuate the purpose of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Agency has explicit rulemaking authority to, in its discretion, exempt certain classes of owners and operators from corrective action obligations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  holders of security interests as described in this proposal). Section 9003(b) permits the Agency, in promulgating regulations under subtitle I, to make distinctions in its UST regulations between types or classes of tanks, based upon,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``the technical capability of the owners and operators.'' Because security interest holders are typically not as a general matter engaged in the operation and maintenance of USTs (and thus do not possess the technical capacity of most UST owners and operators), EPA does not believe that requiring them to comply with highly detailed technical requirements is appropriate where requiring them to do so is not necessary for protection of human health and the environment. Furthermore, the Agency believes an exemption from these regulatory requirements is appropriate in the context of this proposed rule, where an exemption will serve, albeit indirectly, to advance the goals of subtitle I by making credit more available and thus aiding in the implementation of tank upgrade requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this authority is not open-ended, as section 9003(a) requires EPA to promulgate regulations that are protective of human health and the environment. Without compromising the level of protectiveness established by the UST program, EPA previously relied on its section 9003(b) authority when it excluded a group of owners and operators from RCRA subtitle I requirements in the final Financial Responsibility Rule (53 FR 43322, Oct. 26, 1988). (In relevant part, the preamble to the final Financial Responsibility Rule states: ``The Agency does not interpret the Congressional intent of subtitle I to preclude exempting any class of USTs from otherwise applicable requirements when the Agency has determined that such requirements are not necessary to protect human health or the environment.'') That rule exempted states and the federal government from the UST financial responsibility requirements since those entities were, as a class, able to satisfy the purpose of the financial responsibility requirements in the absence of regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, for purposes of this proposal, EPA believes that it is reasonable, in light of the purposes behind this proposal, to exempt a holder from RCRA subtitle I corrective action requirements as an operator if its USTs are empty and secure (as would be required under today's proposal) or if the holder chooses to also engage in environmentally beneficial activities (as discussed in Section III. E of this preamble). Because of the requirements a holder must meet before enjoying this proposed exemption, EPA's UST regulations will satisfy the statutory requirement that they be protective of human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Liability of a Holder as an Owner of an Underground Storage Tank or Underground Storage Tank System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sections describe the key terms used in this proposed rule. For the most part, these are also terms used in the section 9003(h)(9) security interest exemption. This section specifies the activities that are not ``participating in the management'' of a tank and which a holder may under today's proposal, engage in consistent with subtitle I regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

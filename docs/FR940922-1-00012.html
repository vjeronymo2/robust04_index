			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Idaho's SIP submittals for Ada County/Boise do not provide for implementation of control measures which assure timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, nor, in the alternative, do they show that the adoption of available control measures would be economically or technologically unreasonable. Therefore, the submittals do not meet the specific statutory requirements to provide for the implementation of RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Residential Wood Burning Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State relies on control strategies designed to reduce wood smoke for timely attainment of the 24-hour and annual PM&hyph;10 standards. The residential wood burning program has three main objectives: 1. Reduce wood burning during critical periods; 2. Improve the performance and efficiency of wood heating equipment; and 3. Provide reasonable alternatives to wood heat. The State's available control measures to be implemented in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area that address the main objectives include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Episodic Wood Burning Curtailment Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SIP submittal discusses an episodic two-stage voluntary and mandatory wood burning curtailments in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. The first stage is a voluntary burn ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels in the nonattainment area are predicted to equal or exceed 100  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 prediction is made after an IDEQ meteorologist calculates lower atmospheric stability and evaluates PM&hyph;10 equivalent sampler, nephelometer, upper air temperature sounding, snow cover, surface temperature, delta temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, National Weather Service and occasionally commercial weather service data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second stage is a mandatory curtailment program. In 1986, Boise adopted an ordinance imposing a mandatory burn ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels actually attain or exceed 110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3, and stable meteorological conditions are expected to persist for the next 24 hours (see Boise City Code, Tit. 4, Ch. 6). This ordinance was amended in January 1993 to reduce the trigger point for mandatory burn bans from 110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 to 100  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3 (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP states that Garden City also has a mandatory curtailment program, but no documentation of the Garden City program was included in the initial SIP submittal. The SIP further states that the State would attempt to persuade other Ada County jurisdictions to implement mandatory curtailment programs similar to the Boise program. To date, EPA has informally received copies of mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances (some are signed and others are unsigned) for unincorporated Ada County and the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian. These ordinances, however, have not been adopted into the SIP and have not been formally submitted to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its SIP submittal, the State notes that a county-wide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mandatory wood smoke curtailment program is necessary to bring the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area into timely attainment of the NAAQS because approximately 30% of the wood burning in the area occurs outside of areas covered by mandatory wood burning restrictions. For this reason, the SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise cannot be considered to satisfy the RACM requirement because the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available control measures necessary for expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and technologically feasible control measures have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable). Specifically, the State has not adopted and submitted mandatory burn ban ordinances for Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. EPA urges the State to promptly adopt and submit to the EPA the necessary mandatory residential wood smoke burning ban ordinances on which the State relies in its SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter to the EPA, dated August 14, 1992, the State argued for the exclusion of the locality south of Amity Road and west of Cloverdale Road (the Kuna area) from proposed mandatory burn bans because the area is located in a separate stream drainage from the Boise River Valley, and thus does not significantly contribute smoke to the valley where the PM&hyph;10 exceedances have been recorded. The State also noted that the emission inventory, modeling and visibility observations indicate that the Kuna area air quality is markedly cleaner than the ambient air in the Boise River Valley, which includes downtown Boise. EPA acknowledged in an August 27, 1992 letter to IDEQ, that the State had adequately demonstrated that mandatory burn bans in the Kuna area were unnecessary to demonstrate attainment and EPA formally proposes to make this determination in today's action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the SIP submittal cannot be considered to satisfy the RACM requirement at this time, EPA is proposing limited approval of the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, Boise City Code Tit. 4, Ch. 6, pursuant to sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act in order to strengthen the SIP and make the ordinance federally enforceable. EPA believes that this control measure will result in reductions in PM&hyph;10 emissions in the nonattainment area and thus advance the Act's air quality-related protection goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Wood Smoke Public Education/Awareness Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area plays a critical role in achieving the aforementioned three main objectives of IDEQ's residential wood burning program. The wood smoke public education/awareness program was first officially initiated in 1986, following the passage of Boise's local wood burning ordinance. Brochures, television and radio public service announcements, newspaper advertisements, outreach meetings at public schools, media interviews and press conferences are the main components of the integrated awareness package. Various points have been focused on during the program's existence, including the nature of the wood smoke problem, health impacts, meteorological factors (including tips asking citizens to refrain from burning on clear, calm and/or cool days) and how to burn cleaner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IDEQ and the City of Boise are responsible for a majority of the continuing wood smoke public education/awareness program. According to IDEQ, local surveys and building department statistics show reductions in the numbers of wood stoves installed, reduction in the average volume of wood burned per household and widespread public cooperation during poor air quality periods as the result of the wood smoke public education efforts. These surveys and statistics are the basis for the 10% annual credit IDEQ is claiming for the wood smoke public education/awareness program during 1990 through the year 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that IDEQ has adequately demonstrated, through surveys and building department statistics, that the well-established, extensive, wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area has achieved at least a 10 percent wood smoke emission reduction. Therefore, EPA proposes limited approval of the wood smoke public education/awareness program described in the Ada County/Boise SIP as a SIP strengthening measure and proposes to accept the 10 percent credit requested by the IDEQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Wood Stove Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance initiated a requirement mandating all wood burning appliances sold and installed within the city to be certified as meeting certain emission standards (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;9). The ordinance is enforced by city and county building department inspectors. The initial certification program was based on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality standards. The current program is based on the national wood burning device New Source Performance Standards developed by the EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation and enforcement of the certification program resulted in the City of Boise accelerating the introduction of certified stoves and the phase-out of old, high emission uncertified stoves. However, IDEQ does not take any credit for the emission reductions that have resulted from the wood stove certification program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to the SIP submittal, Meridian, Eagle, Garden City, unincorporated Ada County, Nampa and Emmett also require that only certified wood stoves be sold and installed within their respective jurisdictions. However, no documentation (i.e. ordinances) supporting this statement was included in the SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the enforceability of the City of Boise wood stove certification program and its advancement of the PM&hyph;10 air quality goals, EPA is proposing limited approval of this program as a SIP strengthening measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Wood Stove Change-Out Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An initial feature of the City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance was the development of a financial incentive program to replace uncertified wood stoves with certified stoves (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;18). Low or no interest loans were offered to individuals participating in the program. In order to receive a loan, the participant was required to give the uncertified wood stove to the city building department for destruction. The loan program began in September 1986 and ended in September 1988. Approximately $800,000 in loans were made, resulting in the replacement of 494 uncertified wood stoves with cleaner heating devices. IDEQ does not take credit for reductions in the emissions, even though 84 uncertified wood stoves were removed from the airshed after the area source emission inventory base year (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

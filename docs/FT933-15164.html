			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: In a world of change, the Japanese remember their manners - Jurek Martin revisits his old haunts in Tokyo THE only constant in life these days, Bill Clinton says with every other sentence, is change. The question for this correspondent, who has not lived in Japan for seven years, is whether Tokyo has suffered some kind of mutation. The powers of observation this week have necessarily been limited. Summits are all about massaging journalists with briefings 36 hours a day, all because everybody reporting from Tokyo, except the Japanese themselves, have bizarre deadlines. But escapes from the cocoon were possible. Physically the capital has long been in a state of permanent flux, even without earthquakes. The nice, rickety, three-bedroom house not far from the Diet that was home for four years is now another anonymous office bulding. The vast Komatsu earth mover perched on top of a building in Akasaka has been replaced by an even larger Spanish galleon. At least that seemed to be the case late one night, but neither was there next morning. Probably both were holograms, since there appears no commercial market for Komatsu galleons these days and tractor sales are not what they were. Possibly the Japanese, anticipating zero tariffs on imported distilled spirits, have started adding interesting hallucinogens to the home-grown product. The good things of Tokyo certainly have not changed. A return to a much-loved little neighbourhood restaurant was like the warmest of second homecomings - and the menu and the prices, in yen, much as they were. A favourite bar was like an old shoe. The Foreign Correspondents Club is still deeply politicking - but thinking of installing a marble floor. At the Okura Hotel, as ever seriously discreet and distinguished, the western breakfast remains curiously inedible - and 15 times as expensive as the fry-up obtainable at any decent American roadhouse. It must be a work of Japanese art, or a non-tariff barrier, to render all eggs and all bacon without flavour. The bubble economy has burst, but has left no mark on male clothing. A personal lunchtime survey of Kasumigaseki, where civil servants wait for the green light at crossroads, revealed a familiar sea of whiteness  - to be precise, 94 of 100 shirts were solid or off white, five blue-ish, and one shocking pink with bright brown brogues (probably a Finance Ministry mandarin). However, ties are more colourful and the white sock count was down to 23. There was one sign that things had changed. Traffic accidents used to be rare and minor, probably because vehicles do not go fast in jams. But the press bus from Haneda airport and a truck had a disabling shunt, at speed. Glass flew and the uniformed stewardess in the pill-box hat was cut. But it was all right in the end. The truck and the bus drivers, though shaken, did not scream and yell at each other or whip .44 Magnums out of the glove compartment. They apologised - to each other, to the police, to the hacks, to the rubberneckers. Japan has not changed as a civil society.</p>

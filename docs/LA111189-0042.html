			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING SHOCKS VENTURA COLLEGE  </P> <P> Only two days before a big game against Moorpark College, two Ventura College  football players were shot late Thursday night after attending a Moorpark High  football game.  </P> <P> Leading rusher John Johnson and starting cornerback Roderick Jones, both of  Oxnard, were injured by an apparently random shotgun blast fired from a passing  car at a Moorpark shopping center and will miss the remainder of the season,  including a pivotal 7:30 home game tonight against Moorpark.  </P> <P> "I don't know if they've had time to digest the situation," Ventura Coach Phil  Passno said of his players, who learned of the incident at a 9:30 practice  Friday morning. "Obviously, their first concern is about their friends who've  been hurt. The game takes a second-place atmosphere. After time, the feeling  becomes that they want to play well for these guys."  </P> <P> Ventura can ill afford to lose another running back. Ryan Rapoza, who has  rushed for 544 yards, only nine fewer yards than Johnson, will play sparingly  because of a broken finger.  </P> <P> Passno scheduled a 3 p.m. workout for his quarterbacks and running backs today  to try to sort out the backfield situation.  </P> <P> "It really doesn't affect too much," said Johnson, who was hit by seven pellets  -- three of which remain in his legs -- and will attend the game in a  wheelchair. "We've got eight running backs, and they're all good."  </P> <P> Whoever replaces Johnson will have the unenviable task of facing a Moorpark  defense ranked first in the state against the rush and fourth overall.  </P> <P> Last year, Moorpark, unbeaten at the time, lost to Ventura, 12-10, on a  last-second field goal. The loss knocked the Raiders out of Potato Bowl  consideration.  </P> <P> "I think they'll probably be the toughest team we play all year long," Moorpark  Coach Jim Bittner said. "It's like the USC-UCLA type thing. You like to play  good against your friends. . . . I think it's a good rivalry. I think both  programs tend to make the other stronger. It's almost like two brothers going  at it."  </P> <P> The teams initially met in 1968, and they split the first two contests. Ventura  won 10 in a row from 1972 to 1981 and holds a 16-5 advantage. Despite winning  two of the past three meetings, Moorpark still has a chip on its shoulder pads.  "Coach Bittner gave us a pep talk," linebacker Scott Yurek said. "He said when  Moorpark was down for all those years, Ventura beat them, but now it's  changing."  </P> <P> This time, the game should decide more than just the champion of Ventura  County. If Moorpark (7-1, 6-1 in Western State Conference play, 3-0 in the  Northern Division) wins, it will be guaranteed at least a share of the Northern  Division championship. Ventura (7-1, 6-1, 2-1) needs to beat Moorpark and  Glendale to win the Northern Division. Moorpark and Ventura are ranked ninth  and 11th in the state, respectively.  </P> <P> Ventura has been so focused on playing Moorpark that it was upset last week by  Harbor, 26-20. "I think the attitude was we lost the game because we couldn't  concentrate," Passno said. "We thought so much about winning this (Moorpark)  game."  </P> <P> Moorpark also was banged up in its last game, a four-hour marathon win over  Glendale. Yurek, who almost blocked Ventura's winning kick last year, has a  severely sprained ankle but may play. Leading receiver James Gambrell could  miss the rest of the season because of a strained medial collateral ligament.  </P> <P> Moorpark's offense ranks second in the state. Quarterback Jayson Merrill has  passed for 1,380 yards, and Freddie Bradley, the leading scorer in the state,  has rushed for 971 yards.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Page B3  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, the newly  installed governor of the Central Bank of China, said Monday [6  Jun] that he is confident Taipei can become a financial hub of  the Asia-Pacific region.    In aiming for that goal, which is one of the CBC's top  priorities, the bank first wants to see Taipei become a regional  funding center -- a source of capital for financial institutions  and private enterprises both at home and abroad, Liang said when  answering questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.    In an effort to further open a [words indistinct] speed up  the development of the local financial services market, the  Ministry of Finance recently lifted restrictions on foreign  investment on the local banking market, allowing foreigners and  Overseas Chinese greater access in opening new banks and  expanding operations here.    Liang said more financial instruments and better services  would result because of the new policy, and added that so far,  38 domestic and foreign banks have been allowed by the CBC to  take part in offshore banking operations here.    Aiming to avert possible speculation on the local stock and  foreign exchange markets brought about by huge foreign capital  inflows, the CBC will use the foreign capital to meet the need  of the manufacturing sector for its medium and long-term  development, which plays an indispensable and vital role in the  nation's economic growth, Liang said.</p>

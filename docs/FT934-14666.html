			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Guide to empire-building aspirations of accountants Sir, I share the reluctant admiration expressed by Mr George Lapsley (Letters, October 8) at the empire building inherent in the draft guidance produced by the working party of the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the audit of internal controls. But he is mistaken in suggesting that it has not also thought of extending the suggested audit to other fields such as marketing, quality, value for money and product development. These (and other) fields are specifically considered in the 67 pages of the draft and its 6 appendices (incidentally the original Cadbury code of best practice is a modest two pages). For example, Chapter 2 refers to 'commitment to quality and competence', which is said to be useful in preventing or limiting fraud, and 'commitment to truth and fair dealing', which is said to be a guide to how employees will react to pressures. These audit processes are said to be desirable for all business activities, no matter what the size. The working party is curiously silent on auditing the prompt payment of bills or assessing the auditors on a value for money basis. By coincidence, Christopher Lorenz on the same day ('The best way to rear corporate babies') comments on the proven need in the development of new business ventures by large corporations for them to be 'sheltered from normal planning and control systems; otherwise they will be strangled'. Perhaps that exclusion explains the vigorous growth of local business on the Pacific rim, where the UK chartered accountant is rarely seen. But let's not confuse matters by imagining that strangulation is bad for business. It does, of course, enable the chartered accountant to fulfil another fee-earning role - that of corporate undertaker. G M Simon, The Manor, Haseley Business Centre, Warwick CV35 7LS</p>

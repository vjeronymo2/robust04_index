			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia conclude free trade pact Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia have concluded negotiations on a free trade pact to come into effect in the first half of next year, according to Mexico's trade ministry. The treaty will bring together economies with a combined population of about 150m, and gross domestic product of more than Dollars 360bn (Pounds 241.60bn) in 1991. Mexico has already signed trade pacts with the US and Canada, and separately with Chile. Colombia yesterday signed a free trade agreement with Chile. The agreement between the 'Group of Three' will have only a small economic impact, since trade between them is a small part of their total trade. However, the agreement marks a step in Latin America's quest for economic integration and closer political co-operation. Mexico's trade ministry gave no details of the agreement, except that it covered six areas: access to markets; rules of origins; investment rules; government purchases; trade in services and intellectual property. Tariffs will be gradually phased out, rather than abolished immediately. The Chile-Colombia accord, details of which were hammered out last month, scraps non-tariff barriers on all but the most 'sensitive' products from the start of next year. From 1994, tariffs on 300 products, including coffee, wood pulp and synthetic fibres, will be cut by a quarter. The remaining 75 per cent of barriers and all customs taxes will be removed by 1999.</p>

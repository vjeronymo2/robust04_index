			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme </F> Council session in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych, esteemed people's  deputies! The issues that have been submitted for your  consideration are of an exceptionally important significance.  Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent  state depends to a large extent on the decision you will adopt  today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme Council of  Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of the START  Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol with certain reservations. Among  other things, it also contained an instruction to the president  of Ukraine and the government to hold appropriate negotiations  between interested states and international organizations with  the aim of due protection of both Ukraine's security and its  material interests, which would open the possibilities of the  START I treaty entering into force and would initiate the  process of genuine nuclear disarmament in the world.    You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted  resolution. After this decision of the Supreme Council, Ukraine  stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative  image that our state earned because of this, began to intensify  to a level that opened the possibility of imposing more than  just economic forms of pressure.    In the present economic crisis situation, this has already  concealed a threat to the very existence of the Ukrainian state.  It is precisely to avoid this danger that, in accordance with  my instruction, trilateral negotiations were held with the  United States and Russia, with the aim of justly resolving the  problems of nuclear weapons, to drag Ukraine away from the  interminable conflicts with Russia and the world community, and  to concentrate our international efforts on the creation of  favorable external conditions for carrying out deep reforms in  Ukraine's economy.    The statement and appendix signed in Moscow, even though  they  are not international agreements, define the political  obligations of the three presidents within the framework of  compromise reached between the three states in resolving the  problems of nuclear weapons that Ukraine inherited from the  former USSR. The text of the statement and the appendix are  proof of the realization of Ukraine's strategic policy in  acquiring nonnuclear status that was defined in the declaration  on state sovereignty, in Supreme Council statements on Ukraine's  nonnuclear status, and parliamentary resolutions on additional  measures to guarantee that Ukraine acquires nonnuclear status.  None of the resolutions adopted by the Supreme Council has cast  doubt on this policy.    In particular, the accords achieved in Moscow envisage --  after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to  the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] -- the granting to  Ukraine of guarantees for its national security, which include  pledges regarding confirmation, concerning Ukraine, of its  independence, sovereignty and existing borders, and refraining  from threats of force or the use of force or measures of  economic pressure.    The next thing envisaged is the pledge by the United States  of America to grant Ukraine the appropriate funds for the  dismantlement of nuclear weapons, with the possibility of  increasing the volume of such assistance in the future.    The withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from Ukraine to  Russia  for their dismantlement is envisaged with the concurrent  granting of compensation in the form of deliveries of fuel  assemblies to Ukraine for its nuclear power engineering  requirements.    Apart from that, and this is of especial political  significance, it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States,  and Russia will cooperate between themselves as equal partners,  and that relations between them should be developed on  principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity of each state. The United States also  stated its readiness to render assistance to Ukraine in creating  a market economy in Ukraine.    Some people say that the text of the statement does not  fully  correspond to the reservations formulated by the Supreme Council  because it supposedly departs from specific figures of  limitations regarding elimination of warheads and carriers  [nosiyi] fixed in Point 6 of the 17 November resolution.    But this same article says that this same point makes it  possible to destroy nuclear weapons in excess of the established  limitations. That is, the executive power received the authority  to agree on the dismantlement of warheads, the process (?of  destruction) of which should take place in compliance with  procedures, which have not been established by the START I  Treaty.    That is, the point is that we strove to carry out those  maximum possibilities laid down in the Supreme Council  resolution, but naturally certain compromises are inevitable in  these cases. Thus, the tripartite statement and the appendix to  it, and also their implementation, in our opinion, and this is  true, meet the demands set forth in the resolution of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993.  I emphasize, the principle reservations, principle  reservations by the Supreme Council have been carried out by the  executive power. This is a reply to our just doubts and the  reservations with regard to the resolution by our Supreme  Council. In connection with this, I introduced a proposal  through a legislative initiative in accordance with Article 103  of the Ukrainian Constitution, on the removal of the  reservations contained in the Supreme Council resolutions dated  18 November 1993 regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, and  Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons.    It seems that the issue of the need for Ukraine to accede to  the NPT that was at the center of attention not only here in  Ukraine, but also in the whole international community, should  be obvious and understood by everyone who lives in the real  world. This corresponds to Ukraine's long-term national  interests, including the interests of guaranteeing our national  security. It is true that some either consciously or  subconsciously are twisting the facts, attempting to prove that  Ukraine could become a nuclear state; that because of this its  security would supposedly increase and its importance in  international relations would grow, and that we could defend our  independence, territorial integrity, and the future flourishing  of the Ukrainian people with nuclear weapons. I repeat, data  about the real state of affairs demonstrate that it is simply  impossible to defend this thesis if one knows and listens and  take these realities into account.    The situation for our military men, leading scientists and  nuclear workers, and other experts who are involved with this  affair is absolutely clear. I remind you of some irrefutable  facts. First, the nuclear button, i.e. the entire command  infrastructure necessary for the targeting and launching of  missiles is located, as before, in Moscow. Nobody, and this  must be taken into account, will allow us to take over this  control without unforeseen consequences as some people naively  suggest. Such actions could only provoke the emergence of an  acute military danger for Ukraine. I repeat, it will not protect  Ukraine's security, but will provoke the emergence of a danger.    Since nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not controlled  by us, they cannot play the role of a factor restraining a  potential aggressor. They cannot. As it is known, strategic  missiles that are on combat duty in Ukraine today are a threat  only to the United States. And it seems that everyone  understands it is not preparing to attack us. But there is also  a danger for us through the dangerous condition of the missiles  because of the lack of supplies of vital components, first of  all from Russia. Beginning from this year, the guarantee  period, not only of combat capability, but simply of safe  storage of a considerable number of warheads, is being  terminated. In 1995 this process will take on a catastrophic  nature. Specific calculations and data are proof of this. But  the moment that the nuclear warhead guarantee period is  exhausted, it becomes a danger for others and a danger for us,  i.e. for those on whose territory they are based. Such nuclear  warheads must be taken away to be dismantled and reprocessed  since, as you know, we do not have the appropriate factories.  But the weapons' manufacturers are in Russia. If we do not do  this, then there could be a danger of a new tragedy, this is a  reality. I think that it is a great responsibility for us all.  Through our Defense Ministry, I received an appropriate  decision from the chief designers of the nuclear warheads. I  would like you to know about this and probably there is now no  need to conceal it from the Ukrainian people.    Now I will read this in the original. In connection with the  fact that the service life of certain warheads expired, we moved  them out [of Ukraine] at the end of December to be dismantled.  Designers provide us with the following data: [switches to  Russian] I inform you about the decision by the chief designers,  developers of nuclear warheads, coordinated with the  interdepartmental commission of the Ministry of Nuclear Power  Engineering and the Ministry of Defense of Russia, on the  results of the defect-finding inspection [defektatsiya] of the  three combat units whose term of technical servicing expired and  which were delivered from Ukraine.    During the visual inspection of the combat units, the  commission members found corrosive products on the surfaces of  the uranium parts that are the source of heightened toxic and  radiological danger. Proceeding from the results of the work  done by the commission, the chief designers arrived at a  conclusion that the violation of the rules of technical  servicing of nuclear warheads leads to the emergence of  irreversible processes of aging in them, to the changes in  physical and chemical properties of dangerously explosive and  radioactive materials. The above phenomena increase the danger  during the nuclear warheads' dismantling. Further use and  storage of these warheads aggravates the processes taking place  in them, which may lead to the formation of dangerously  explosive mixtures within their hermetic capacities. [back to  Ukrainian]    Here is such a piece of information. I would like to tell  you that my consultations with relevant scientific institutions  in Ukraine and the scientists who are involved in this, confirm  this assessment and this danger.    So, the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former  USSR not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but  are a threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific  nor the manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of  billions of dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture  new nuclear weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons  could be tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's  deputies of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the  opinions of leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which  was on Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear  state and gain something positive from this, then why not accede  to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180  world states?    Why should we insist on preserving the situation as it is,  whereas at the meetings between the president or other leaders  of Ukraine and world leaders, or at the diplomatic talks, or at  any other meetings, those with ordinary people and the mass  media, they always begin the talk with one and the same thing:  People just do not understand why we are insisting on exactly  such a stand.    Though some people believe that the world's concern about  Ukraine's attitude toward nuclear weapons is for the benefit of  Ukraine, that this adds to our state's authority. Well, at this  point they somehow forget that before the signing of the  trilateral statement, Ukraine had increasingly often been placed  in one group of states that have an unequivocally negative  reputation throughout the world. I felt this personally, and  the foreign minister who was taking part, as they say, from the  Rome to the Brussels meetings, and who is present here, will  have a chance to share his impressions with you.    The fact that the problem of nuclear arms stationed in  Ukraine remained in suspense had, until recently, been one of  the main obstacles in the way toward a full-blooded development  of mutually advantageous cooperation with foreign countries.  After the Supreme Council had adopted the resolution on the  START ratification, they were emphasizing it straightforwardly  and unequivocally at all levels, that until Ukraine ratified the  Lisbon Protocol in full volume and joined the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, the rendering of effective aid toward  building a market economy would be just impossible.    Moreover, it was difficult to hope for a normal attitude  toward us on the part of many countries of the world. They say  that this is the dictate. One can agree with this. We, they  say, must show our protest. But to do this we should act in  compliance with the obligations that we assumed and not ruin the  situation that took shape.    Ukraine now is being accused of something very serious: If  we  do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier,  we are stopping further world disarmament. START II comes under  threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused.  Although the state of our economy and the possibility of  reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is  true -- without support from international financial  institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money  but also with experience, private investments, and the granting  of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we  would not be able to do without the Russian market.    Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress,  normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful  problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken.    In this connection, I would like to say this: It is exactly  now that we have almost managed to completely reach an  understanding of our problems, the main one of which being the  readiness to assist us in the complicated matter of reforming  the economy on the part of leading Western countries and  international institutions. Our nearest neighbors' attitude to  us is also different now.    Just now, we have received a statement on behalf of the  chairman of the European Union, saying that the trilateral  accords, reached in Moscow, open the way for the development of  full-scale, fruitful relations and cooperation between Ukraine  and the European Union. During his stay in Kiev, U.S. President  Bill Clinton assured us that the United States had made use of  their ability to influence leading international financial  organizations in order to provide the assistance we need.    The delegation that held negotiations in Washington last  week  reports that we have already seen a fundamental change in the  attitude toward Ukraine of both the United States and the  international community, the International Monetary Fund, and  the World Bank. They are ready to provide our state with  considerable financial and technological assistance and credit.  A mechanism has been initiated to realize this assistance in  all-sided economic cooperation. The details of this are known  to you, I hope, from the joint statement that has been made  public. These, strictly speaking, are some of the first  reactions and proposals. I am sure there will be others that  will be no less serious.    Everything will now depend on us alone and our readiness to  make use of this moment and these possibilities, and to unite in  performing our most important task today, which task, in my  view, is to curb the crisis trends in our economy and carry out  serious reforms in the direction of creating a democratic state  and a socially-oriented market economy.    I would once again like to emphasize this: Today, the future  of Ukraine as an independent, influential and -- in the future  -- a prosperous European state, does not depend on nuclear  weapons. The former USSR had more than enough of them, but  however, did not come to its rescue. The future of Ukraine  depends on the economic well-being and social stability of our  society. If we do overcome the current economic crisis, we will  be able to safeguard our independence and inviolability of our  borders. Nor will we -- once again with the help from  international organizations -- allow anyone to interfere in our  internal affairs.    I think the time has come -- and a decisive time it is too  --  for every one of us present in this hall, to once and for all  understand that in order to make a realistic policy, really  aimed to protect our vital national interests and those of all  ordinary people, one should first of all conscientiously look to  reality, weigh up the possibilities, and finally be ready to  take serious and responsible decisions. I am (?more than)  convinced that it is exactly this decision that Ukraine needs to  make today.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Former BNL man jailed before trial A US judge has jailed Mr Christopher Drogoul, the man at the centre of the scandal over more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of improper Iraqi loans extended by the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), writes Alan Friedman in New York. Mr Drogoul, the former manager of the BNL Atlanta branch, is due to stand trial on June 2 over the affair. Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that more than half of the BNL loans to Baghdad helped to finance Mr Saddam Hussein's development of nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects. According to Ms Gerrilyn Brill, the first assistant US attorney in Atlanta, Mr Drogoul was jailed because of fears that he might flee the country. Ms Brill could not, however, explain why such fears had arisen some 14 months after Mr Drogoul was originally indicted; he has been at liberty ever since. It is understood that US prosecutors were infuriated four weeks ago when Mr Drogoul broke his long silence and told an Italian newspaper that US government officials had secret knowledge of the BNL Atlanta loans to Iraq's military procurement network.</p>

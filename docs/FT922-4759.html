			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Berlin to take contested properties: City acts to end deadlock over more than DM10bn in rival claims BERLIN'S city government, in a landmark decision, has ruled that more than DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in east Berlin properties claimed by companies and private individuals will instead be taken over by the city. Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman of the Berlin Finance Office, said the ruling, expected to be legally challenged by former owners, allowed the city to end the deadlock in rebuilding east Berlin caused by rival property claims. He estimated that 'considerably more' than DM10bn in property was affected. Among the most valuable real estate to revert to the city is a sprawling site on Leipziger Platz, near the former Berlin Wall, which previously belonged to the Jewish-owned Wertheim department store chain, now part of the Hertie group. Prime sites owned by the Hohenzollern family, descendants of the former German Kaiser, were also affected by the decision. A total of 589 companies and 951 property sites, mainly in the inner-city Mitte district, are being claimed by the city. The decision runs counter to a previous 'recommendation' by the German government that the properties, which were confiscated shortly after East Germany was established in October 1949, should be returned to the previous owners. Only properties previously confiscated by the Soviet occupation administration (SMAD) from former Nazi activists, war criminals and persons who 'aryanised' Jewish property in the 1930s were not to be given back. This was acknowledged by the Germans in their unification treaty of 1990. The Berlin Justice Office, however, issued a legal opinion this week that East Germany's confiscation of the east Berlin properties was merely an administrative act carrying out a sovereign decision in 1946 by the SMAD. Mr Kammradt said the way was now clear for the city-owned properties to be developed by investors who could well include some of the former owners. It was up to the Bonn government to decide whether restitution would be paid to former Jewish owners, their heirs, or the Jewish Claims Commission, he said.</p>

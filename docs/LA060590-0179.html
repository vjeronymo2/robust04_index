			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLAZERS LOSE SABONIS TO SPAIN AGAIN  </P> <P> Lithuanian basketball star Arvydas Sabonis, expected to play for the Portland  Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Assn. next season, signed a one-year  contract extension today with Forum Filatelico of Spain.  </P> <P> Team officials announced the signing but declined to say how much they would  pay Sabonis, who helped the Soviet Union win the Olympic gold medal in 1988.  </P> <P> Sabonis, a 7-foot-3 center, originally signed with the Spanish club in June,  1989. That contract was worth $1 million, but most of the money was to go to  sports authorities in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Sabonis said at the time that he hoped to play in the NBA after one year in  Spain.  </P> <P> Portland, which drafted Sabonis in 1986, holds NBA rights to the 25-year-old.  </P> <P> Sabonis had hoped that the less strenuous schedule in the Spanish league would  help him to recover from an Achilles' tendon injury that had bothered him since  before the Olympics.  </P> <P> In an interview last May, Sabonis said the tendon was better.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- In the 18th round of the  Estonian-Russian negotiations, the parties almost reached  agreement on the dismantling of the Paldiski nuclear reactors,  Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the talks  and head of the military issues working group, said at a press  conference today.    Tiiman told reporters Estonia put forward an "entirely new  idea" for dismantling the reactors at Paldiski, which the  Russian side is now studying. "The proposal differs from the  earlier ones," Tiiman said. "Our position is that the rods must  be removed from the reactors by the end of June, and the rest of  the jobs, such as dismantling the reactors and removing nuclear  wastes, completed as quickly as possible."    Tiiman declined to disclose the details of the idea, but  declared Estonia's new plan would be optimal in costing the  country less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The dismantling of  the reactors takes place in three stages. Tiiman said in the  first stage nuclear fuel is removed from the reactors and taken  out of Estonia; Russia will remove "military secrets" from the  reactors during the second stage; and, lastly, the reactors and  nuclear wastes will be transported to Russia. Should Russia  agree to Estonian proposals, the complete dismantling of the  nuclear reactors in Paldiski will take roughly three years.    Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in  Paldiski, earlier said the first stage of dismantling is  expected to begin in the second half of April. Russia will not  allow even Estonian experts to attend the second stage of the  operation, Tikk said, because they claim the reactors contain  secret equipment.    Rescue Department Director Harry Hein said a special rescue  squad of over 300 men and 100 machines has been formed to ensure  security during the dismantling operation. The unit comprises  fire, rescue, medical, law and order enforcement, evacuation,  and other task forces, he said.</p>

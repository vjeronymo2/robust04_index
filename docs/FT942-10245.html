			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Qantas sell-off expected in next financial year Qantas, the state-owned Australian airline in which British Airways holds a 25 per cent stake, will be privatised in 1994-95. In its annual budget statement yesterday, Australia's federal government announced a number of asset sale proposals, which are expected in the next financial year. The sale of its remaining 75 per cent interest in Qantas is the biggest single item. The shares are likely to be sold through a stock market flotation. 'Current planning is proceeding on the basis that a float will be undertaken within 1994-95,' the budget stated. The sale of the government's remaining interest in Qantas has already been much-delayed - largely because of the internal turmoil within Qantas as it tries to meld its international operations with the business of Australian Airlines, the domestic carrier acquired in 1992. Although privatisation had been seen as likely in 1994-95, both Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas' chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, his counterpart at BA, have suggested they would prefer this to be undertaken later, rather than sooner. In March, when Qantas announced interim figures, Mr Pemberton referred to Qantas' ADollars 400m-plus (USDollars 288m) profits target as 'the right return on shareholder funds'. In the first half of 1993-94, the airline made only ADollars 71.6m, and warned the second half-year could produce 'something less'.</p>

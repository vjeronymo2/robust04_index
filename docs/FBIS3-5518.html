The agency said the nation's economy is still undergoing  adjustment and in an overall slump, practically unchanged from  expressions used in the previous month's report.    An agency official briefing reporters said there are some  signs showing an upswing such as household spending, durable  good sales and spending for leisure.    "But for such positive indicators the levels are still low  and there are too many other negative indicators," the official  said.    Private-sector capital spending plans for fiscal year 1994  that starts April 1 will decline 4.5 percent from the previous  year, according to a quarterly survey conducted by the Bank of  Japan in February.    On the labor front, unemployment has steadily increased and  job offers have decreased, particularly in the manufacturing  sector.    The report noted that inventory reduction has progressed but  industrial output has been lackluster.    Concerning business failures, the figure for companies going  broke stood at the previous year's level, it said.    The only bright spots are public works spending, boosted by  the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, and booming  housing construction, buoyed by low interest rates, the report  said.</p>

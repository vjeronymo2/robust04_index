			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Andersen moves up to third in Big Six Five of the UK's 'Big Six' accountancy firms experienced virtually stagnant fee incomes and cut staff sharply in the last year, according to figures released yesterday. Only Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - showed appreciable growth, with revenues excluding expenses up 11.7 per cent and an increase in both partners and other professional accountancy staff. The changes elevated Andersen, the UK arm of the only truly global accountancy partnership, to the third largest firm in the country, compared with sixth place two years ago. Among the six large firms, Touche Ross suffered most from recession, reporting the only absolute decline in revenues: by 0.8 per cent to Pounds 332.9m, adjusted to exclude income from the Channel Islands. Last year all the firms except Andersen reported absolute revenue declines and cut staff: reductions in staffing have continued, with Price Waterhouse cutting professionals by 409. It cut partner numbers by 67, although it said 60 were being reallocated to full-time work in other countries. Mr Peter Smith, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said it was increasingly impossible to compare firms. 'We are not a body shop providing armies of people to run large computer facilities,' he said, in a swipe at Andersen Consulting. However, Mr Jim Wadia, managing partner of Arthur Andersen, said: 'Let them say whatever they like. We want to grow and succeed. We are very pleased.' The figures are compiled with comparable year-ends. The Big Six firms audit the vast majority of UK quoted companies and are substantially larger than any competitors. Grant Thornton, next in size, reported fee income down 6 per cent to Pounds 107m. BDO Binder Hamlyn, most parts of which are expected shortly to merge with Andersen, reported fees down 1.8 per cent to Pounds 106.5m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    BIG SIX ACCOUNTING FIRMS: RESULTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       1993-94                              other                         fee    % change  no. of     %      prof'l   %                       income    92-93   partners  change   staff change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Coopers &amp; Lybrand      560.0      1.3     677     -3.4     6265    -3.6 KPMG Peat Marwick      497.6      1.4     594     -0.7     6179    -4.4 Andersen               433.3     11.7     270      9.3     3932     6.1 Ernst &amp; Young          388.4      3.8     392     -1.8     4445    -4.9 Price Waterhouse       384.6      0.6     415    -13.9     3919    -9.5 Touche Ross            332.9     -0.8     342     -4.5     3760    -1.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Big Six accountancy firms  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Hanoi     Finds New Outlet for Surplus Labor      Judging by a 1 March VNA report, Hanoi has found new  opportunities for employing its surplus labor in Libya.  According to VNA, 100 Vietnamese workers left Hanoi on 28  February to fill jobs in Libya under a "construction contract"  signed by Vietnam's overseas construction company VINACONEX and  South Korea's Dong Ah Consortium.  These 100 laborers, VNA said,  are the "first batch" of a 2,000-person contingent of  construction workers and overseers who will be sent to Libya in  1994 to work on a man-made river project.  These workers will  join the 1,500 Vietnamese workers already working in Libya under  a contract between VINACONEX and Dong Ah Consortium.  Hanoi has  routinely sent workers overseas in order to relieve its  unemployment problem and to help pay for needed goods.   (AUTHOR:  HEBBEL.

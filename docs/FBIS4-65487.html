			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F> by "A.Bo." in Brussels on 16 May: "Delors: Martino Wanted To  Reassure Me -- But I Am Prudent, I Will Judge From the Facts" --  first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] Brussels -- Jacques Delors remained cautious. Even  after his personal meeting with [Italian Foreign Minister]  Martino, the president of the European Commission was not thrown  off balance: "The new foreign minister strove to reassure me  that Italy will pursue its traditional policies in the European  field. This is all. I have noted what he had to say," he  stated to a small group of journalists in a corridor at European  Council headquarters.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do you indeed feel reassured, Mr.  President?    [Delors] I am a prudent man. Experience has taught me to  judge from facts, not words. On the other hand, I do not want  to call intentions into question.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What assurances or guarantees have you  requested from Minister Antonio Martino as regards the  continuity of Italian policies?    [Delors] None. In fact, what articles of the Community  treaties could I have invoked in order to put his Europeanism to  the test? I am certainly not a teacher examining students and  giving out marks. This is not my role.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Early in the year you met [Prime  Minister] Silvio Berlusconi in Brussels. Did you discuss  politics with him, or did you receive him simply as a private  businessman?    [Delors] Yes, I met Mr. Berlusconi, but only in his capacity  as a businessman. Of course, I asked him for his opinion -- as  a businessman -- of the economic situation in Italy. But we did  not discuss politics. If anything, we talked about movies and  Cinecitta [film studios in Rome], a subject I am very interested  in.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Are you now planning to meet  Berlusconi  in his capacity as head of the new Italian Government before the  European summit in Corfu?    [Delors] There are no meetings scheduled. On the other hand,  I believe Mr. Berlusconi's agenda is very, very full.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX SCORES THREE GOALS IN 7-5 WIN  </P> <P> After five National Hockey League games last season, Mario Lemieux was already  being called the new Great One, better than Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> He had nine goals and in one game he scored eight points. He went on to win the  scoring title and help the Pittsburgh Penguins finally reach the playoffs.  </P> <P> In his first five games this season the big, powerful center had only one goal  and nine points. Lemieux said he was a step behind a year ago.  </P> <P> The Lemieux of last season showed up Tuesday night at Pittsburgh, scoring three  goals and assisting on another to lead the Penguins to a 7-5 victory over the  weak Toronto Maple Leafs.  </P> <P> "It's coming slowly," Lemieux said after getting his 22nd hat trick. "I still  have a ways to go."  </P> <P> Coach Gene Ubriaco, who seemed to be the only one not concerned about Lemieux's  slow start, said: "The big guy has been right at the doorstep of doing this.  He's ready now."  </P> <P> Calgary 8, Quebec 8 -- In the wildest finish of the early season, the defending  champion Flames tied a league record by scoring short-handed goals four seconds  apart at Quebec to tie the Nordiques.  </P> <P> The Flames trailed, 8-6, when Gary Roberts was penalized for roughing with just  19 seconds left in regulation. The Flames pulled their goalie. At 19:45, Doug  Gilmour scored with a quick shot from the left faceoff circle. Then at 19:49,  Gilmour fed Paul Ranheim off the ensuing faceoff for the tying goal.  </P> <P> Earlier in the final period the Flames pulled into contention by scoring three  goals in 27 seconds.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, New York Islanders 3 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy  assisted on five goals at Uniondale, N.Y., as the surprising North Stars  remained the only unbeaten team in the league.  </P> <P> Minnesota, which won only 27 of 80 games last season, are 5-0-1.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, New York Rangers 3 -- Greg Gilbert's wrist shot off a pass from Troy  Murray with 3:21 left in regulation play at New York gave the Blackhawks a tie.

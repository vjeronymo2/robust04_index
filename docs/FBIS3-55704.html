			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1915 GMT on 10 January carries its "Moment of Truth"  program, hosted by Andrey Karaulov, who interviews Robert  Kocharyan, chairman of the State Defense Committee of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The interview was recorded on 4  January 1994. Topics covered include Kocharyan's personal  background, the danger of escalation of the war in Karabakh, the  causes of the conflict, the Khodzhaly massacre in February 1992,  whether anything has been gained since the conflict began,  whether the Armenians' demands were realistic in 1988, how the  Armenians obtained their weapons and whether they received aid  from Armenia proper, and the state of the Karabakh economy.    Asked by Karaulov whether he would be prepared to sit down  together with Azerbaijani Leader Geydar Aliyev in another  edition of "Moment of Truth," Kocharyan says: "Yes, I would.  What's more, we have things to talk about; I am ready, of  course. I think that in general terms, if it works out, maybe  it will save a few lives. If it only saves one life, it is  already an achievement."    Pressed by Karaulov to confirm that Nagorno-Karabakh would  never be prepared to be part of Azerbaijan, Kocharyan replies:  "On 10 December 1991 a referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh,  and the will of the people was expressed in the terms you have  used. I believe that at the present time it would be more  correct to freeze the war, if need be to bring in some  disengaging forces which would simply take the heat out of the  conflict between the two sides, and talks would be held, talks  on status, talks on relations. Maybe some kind of mutually  acceptable solutions would be found, some kind of treaty-based  relations with Azerbaijan. It is not necessary at present, in  the current situation, to touch on the subject of territorial  integrity, the subject of independence, but simply to stop the  war, and give people time to get their breath back. The people  will decide what should then be done, it's their right, their  business."    At the end of the program, a caption states that news of the  latest Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh came in just as  the program was being prepared for broadcasting, and that a  statement has just been received from Kocharyan by telephone  specially for the program. The statement says: "Azerbaijan,  having rejected the Russian initiatives for a cease-fire and the  CSCE Minsk group's plan for a settlement to the conflict, began  a major offensive in early December along the entire front.  Continuous heavy fighting has been going on for more than a  month. The situation is extremely difficult. On the southern  section of the front the Azerbaijani army has managed, in spite  of heavy losses, to make substantial headway. The territory of  the adjoining state is being used in the offensive. The  Azerbaijanis have prepared the offensive quite thoroughly. A  large number of new tanks and armored personnel carriers have  appeared, and troops are armed with 1993 model firearms,  American anti-tank systems, American military radio sets and  shells, and Turkish mortars. Artillery is constantly in action.  All this testifies to major supplies of munitions and arms. And  this is alongside the existence of a number of UN Security  Council resolutions banning arms supplies to the region.  Fighting in the Azerbaijani army are mojahedin from  Afghanistan, specialist instructors from Turkey, and numerous  mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia. It only remains to ponder  on who pays for all this. It is very difficult for us to fight  back with our limited human and material resources. We are too  few to fight everyone. We are relying on the courage and will  of our people."</p>

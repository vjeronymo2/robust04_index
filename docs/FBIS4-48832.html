			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Draft legislation to pave  the way for the establishment of the Constitutional Court and  the Human Rights Commission was approved by cabinet this week, a  spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said on Thursday. He said  four bills had been submitted to the state law advisers for  vetting.    The measures would:    -- establish the Judicial Services Commission, the body that  would present the president with a list of ten nominees for the  Constitutional Court, and set out the framework of the court;    -- amend legislation on remuneration and service conditions  of judges to bring the Constitutional Court judges into the net;    -- establish the Office of Public Protector, as provided by  the Constitution; and    -- set out how the Human Rights Commission would operate and  make the appointment of the commissioners possible.    The spokesman said the bills were presented to cabinet by  minister of justice Mr Dullah Omar, who regarded them as "of the  utmost importance". He said he was unable to speculate when  Parliament would deal with the measures. "Hopefully they will  be able to fit it in fairly soon," he said.    Members of the Parliamentary Secretariat said on Thursday  morning that none of the standing committees that discuss  legislation before it comes up for full debate had been named.  They could not say when the committees were likely to sit on  the justice department legislation, or on a number of other  bills believed to be in the pipeline, including some  constitutional amendments, police measures and "one or two  education things". "We're just as much in the dark as everyone  else," said a staffer. The committees would be able to discuss  the legislation as soon as it was tabled.</p>

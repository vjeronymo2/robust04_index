			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan stalling talks, says US A senior US trade official yesterday accused Japan of trying to renegotiate the hard-fought terms of the US-Japan trade negotiating framework reached at last year's Tokyo summit. At a congressional hearing, Mr Jeffrey Garten, the commerce undersecretary, said Japanese negotiators were resisting 'point by point' the setting of 'multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria' which would measure progress in opening its vehicle market. The US is seeking a 'significant' increase in the number of direct franchise agreements between Japanese dealers and foreign vehicle manufacturers. It also wants continued increases in the North American content in cars produced by Japanese manufacturers in the US. Japan has sought to position itself on the high ground in its trade stand-off with the US. American demands for 'benchmarks' to measure import penetration sectors are being stoutly resisted on the grounds that Tokyo reformers want less, not more, government intervention in the marketplace. 'We do not seem to have even a common understanding of the problem, let alone consensus on the solutions,' Mr Garten said. Japanese officials believe that agreement on 'benchmarks' will evolve into market share commitments. Memories of past highly-touted but ultimately ineffectual bilateral trade pacts with Japan haunt the proceedings. The US has now endured 28 years of merchandise trade deficits with Japan, with last year's climbing back to Dollars 59bn. There is little doubt that a failure of the framework talks would bring swift congressional action; at the very least it would mean renewal of Super 301, a now expired tough US trade law. Congressman Richard Gephardt is considering legislation which would direct the Commerce Department to establish unilateral import targets for Japan, making failure to reach those targets punishable by sanctions. US companies might also move quickly. At least one Washington trade group - Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan - has been researching US trade law in preparation for private-sector attacks on Japan's exclusionary structure and practices. Mr Bill Leonard, a Stroock senior partner, says there are three options: an expansion of the countervailing duty law to cover domestic subsidies which benefit Japanese companies to the exclusion of US exports; section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which may enable US producers to exclude imports produced through exclusionary practices like keiretsu; and section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act under which the US imposes punitive duties on imports from countries which unfairly exclude US products.</p>

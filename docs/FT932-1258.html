			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Launch costs push loss at ERF to Pounds 4.12m - Sales growth points to recession coming to an end SAVAGE competition and the worst UK market conditions since the 1950s contributed to steeply increased losses at ERF, the truck maker, in the year to April 3. However, the biggest element in the pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.12m, against Pounds 613,000 restated for FRS 3, was the Pounds 2.42m exceptional cost of launching new trucks designed for Europe, and the setting up of a continental network to sell them. 'We have taken all these costs as a single hit and are beginning this year with a clean sheet', said Mr Peter Foden, chairman, who indicated that the most severe recession in the industry's post-war history had turned the corner. Excluding exceptionals ERF, the UK's last quoted independent heavy truck maker, would have made a small pre-tax profit of Pounds 77,000 in the second half against losses of Pounds 1.78m in the first six months. With total UK sales of trucks above 15 tonnes, the sector in which ERF specialises, currently running 9 per cent above 1992 levels, 'there are definite signs that the recession is coming to an end', Mr Foden added. However, the length of the recession and heavy discounting, with some makers selling Pounds 60,000 vehicles for as little as Pounds 38,000, has taken its toll. Debt-free until two years ago, ERF's gearing rose to 17 per cent last year and now stands at 36 per cent, with borrowings reaching about Pounds 8.5m. But with the bulk of its four-year, Pounds 14m investment programme now in place, ERF maintains that its bankers are playing a very supportive role. Unit sales last year totalled 1,942, down from 2,176 in 1992 and about 4,000 units at the peak of the last boom in 1989. Mr Rod England, marketing director, forecast that the UK market would recover by 10 per cent this year, to about 17,500 units, and to 20,000 in the course of 1994. ERF also expects to benefit from 20 per cent productivity improvements arising from a reorganisation of its assembly operations and the introduction of flexible working practices. It also claims to have picked up considerable orders during the period in receivership of Leyland DAF. However, ERF is launching its continental venture at a time when some key target countries are experiencing sharp falls in demand. The French market is plunging to an expected 18,000 units this year from 38,000 in 1990, and the Spanish to an expected 7,000 from 17,000. ERF also took a small loss on its interest in ERF South Africa, offset by the first profits from ERF Leasing, a joint venture with Capital Charter. Turnover fell from Pounds 117.6m to Pounds 111.7m. Losses per share came out at 46.25p (13.26p). With no interim, the proposed final dividend of 2p compares with a total of 4p for last year.</p>

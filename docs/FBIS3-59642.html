(PNC) will begin producing the interior  equipment for a facility where technology for producing fuel for  a demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR) will be  developed. Although the construction of the facility's building  within the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel development facility  ended in 1989, production of the equipment to go inside the  facility was postponed for about five years because of the  Electric Power Development Coordination Council's lack of  progress in negotiations on the site for the demonstration ATR  (electrical output: 606,000 kW). The plans are to build the  demonstration ATR in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. According to  the STA Atomic Energy Bureau, the ATR fuel production line is to  be completed within about five years, and then will supply  uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for the demonstration  ATR after the reactor is put through trial runs and completed.    The newly constructed demonstration ATR fuel production  technology development facility is adjacent to the FBR fuel  production line facility in the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel  third development building. The FBR line facility will produce  the fuel for the initial loading of the prototype Monju FBR  (electrical output: 280,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture).  The ATR line building has a floor space of 5,000 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; .    The new ATR line is to cope with the increase in MOX fuel  supply accompanying the development of the demonstration reactor  that will follow the prototype Fugen ATR (electrical output:  165,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture). According to the  plan, a 10-ton/year production line will be built. The goal is  to increase the capacity by 20 tons/year after completion of the  demonstration reactor and to ultimately have a 30-ton/year line.  Along with the completion of the new ATR line, the second  development building, which up until now has produced the fuel  bodies for Fugen exchange, is to change over into a base  facility for R&amp;D of fuel production technology.    Remote manipulation technology and automatic operation  technology will be brought into the new ATR fuel production line  to automate nearly everything except maintenance operations. In  addition, preparations for the construction of the new  demonstration reactor continue to be made, e.g., the basic  design for safety inspections is complete. Construction is  expected to begin in 1996 and operations to start in 2002.</p>

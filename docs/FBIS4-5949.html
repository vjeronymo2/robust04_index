			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Departing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale  agreed Friday [15 April] to continue cooperating with each other  in further enhancing ties between Japan and the United States.    The two reached the accord at a dinner party hosted by  Mondale and his wife, Joan, at the U.S. envoy's official  residence in central Tokyo, Hosokawa told reporters. Hosokawa's  wife, Kayoko, also attended.    Mondale reportedly voiced regret over Hosokawa's decision to  resign due to the Diet paralysis on the fiscal 1994 budget,  which was spawned by allegations of his financial improprieties.    Mondale also called on Hosokawa to continue working with him  after his resignation to further promote bilateral relations,  the premier said.    Hosokawa, 56, who suddenly offered to step down last week,  will remain on board until his successor is chosen.    Friday night's dinner party followed an earlier invitation  from Hosokawa asking the Mondales to his official residence.</p>

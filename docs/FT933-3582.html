			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Badgerline accelerates up the takeover trail BADGERLINE Group, the bus operator which is coming to the stock market in November, has expanded rapidly by acquisitions in the seven years since a group of managers and employees succeeded in a Pounds 3m buy-out of the National Bus Company subsidiary. It has taken over no fewer than seven other former NBC operations in a strategy similar to that pursued by other fast-growing operators such as Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator which came to the market in April, and Drawlane Transport Group. Of the 62 NBC companies sold to management buy-out teams, a large number have subsequently lost their independence. As a result, the Department of Trade and Industry has expressed anxiety over the rate at which small bus companies have been swallowed up, reducing the competition promised by the break-up of the NBC. Mr Trevor Smallwood, Badgerline's chairman, said that the position was monitored by the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Problems only arose in particular local areas and had been solved by giving assurances to the regulatory authorities. He believed there was still scope for further consolidation. Badgerline is one of the few companies to have expressed an interest in running some of British Rail's bigger operations, if they are privatised. Mr Smallwood said he was still interested in principle, but would need much more knowledge of the terms before making a decision. The group, which runs 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands, south Wales and the southern England, is also interested in bidding for local authority bus services as they are sold off and in offering services in London. It already runs 70 Thamesway buses servicing south Essex. About 1,000 of Badgerline's 6,200 employees currently own about 90 per cent of the group's shares. Each year the original shares are traded among employees on a 'matched-bargain' basis. At the last auction, in April, shares originally worth 3.3p fetched Pounds 3.20. The final value of the shares will not be settled until the structure of the flotation is agreed, but they are likely to be worth significantly more than Pounds 3.20. The flotation will be sponsored by Lazard Brothers, and Cazenove will act as brokers.</p>

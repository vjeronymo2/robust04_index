			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Retail sales volume falls 0.3% in July THE WEAK state of consumer demand was underlined yesterday by government figures showing that retail sales volumes were 0.3 per cent lower last month than in June. The seasonally adjusted figures showed that people were still refraining from spending in most categories of stores and that the small high-street upturn that followed the Conservative general election victory was short-lived. Spending on food fell for the second consecutive month while spending in shops selling both food and other goods fell to its lowest volume for six months. The only sector to show an increase was clothing and footwear - probably reflecting the marked price discounting that helped cut headline inflation in July. The gloomy picture is lightened by the underlying trend. Retail sales showed a rise of 0.3 per cent in the three months ending on July 31 compared with the previous three months. In the three months to the end of July volumes were up by 0.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. This rise may be due mainly to the boost in consumer spending in the two months after the April election. Revised figures for the three months to June indicate a 0.8 per cent increase in volumes in April compared with March. That was followed by flat demand in May and June. Between May and July spending in food shops showed a 0.5 per cent increase compared with the previous three months. Spending in shops which sell food and other items showed a 0.7 per cent fall on a three-monthly basis. Non-food sector spending rose 0.5 per cent over the last three months. Sales of household goods were down 1 per cent. The British Retail Consortium said retailing continued to be highly competitive. It added that July's sales were above those in July last year in value and only just down in volume. 'The fortunes of retailers are unlikely to improve significantly until consumer confidence returns and the housing market improves,' the consortium said.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           RETAIL SALES                  (Index number of sales per week: 1985=100)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   All retailers    Non-food    Clothing   Household  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 1992             120           124.4        116         138 July 1992             119.6         124          117         138 Latest 3 mths on previous 3 mths     +0.3          +0.5         +2          -1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Amev sells Grolsch stake AMEV, the Dutch insurer, has sold a 5 per cent stake in Grolsch, the Netherlands' second-largest brewer, to an unidentified buyer through a transaction carried out on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It sold the shares on Monday for Fl 179.00 (Dollars 100) each, one guilder below the price prevailing on the bourse that day. According to the bourse's official price gazette, the shares were then sold on to an undisclosed buyer for Fl 179.50. Yesterday, Grolsch closed Fl 1.50 higher at Fl 182.50. Amev said the sale was not connected to Grolsch's agreement on buying Ruddles, the UK brewery, from Courage, a subsidiary of Australia's Fosters Brewing. Whenever they invest in domestic companies, big Dutch institutional investors tend to hold at least 5 per cent of the capital in order to qualify for tax breaks. Under new Dutch legislation which took effect this month, investors must inform publicly quoted Dutch companies whenever their shareholdings rise or fall below the 5, 10, 25, 50 and 66 2/3 per cent barriers. Among Grolsch's biggest shareholders are members of the founding Groen family, who own around 40 per cent of the capital. The company has said around 25 per cent of its shares are held by UK institutional investors.</p>

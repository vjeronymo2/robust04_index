			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Biondi Advances Anti-Corruption </F> Proposals"]    [Text] (ANSA) La Valletta, June 14 -- Italian Justice  Minister Alfredo Biondi today proposed to his colleagues in the  Council of Europe that a multi-disciplinary work shop be set up  which tackles all the various aspects of corruption as well as  its penal, civil and administrative ramifications.    Reference to Biondi's proposals was also made by the Council  of Europe's ad interim secretary general, Peter Leuprecht, who  in his opening address called on the organization's 32 members  to collaborate more closely to both prevent and repress  corruption "a phenomenon from which no European country is  saved."    Biondi went on to argue how it would be "extremely  opportune"  that the workings of this group be also open, either as members  or observers, to other international organizations or countries  which are not members of the Council of Europe, so they can  contribute their different experiences.    He also recalled how the theme of the conference here, on  the  various aspects and levels of corruption, as well as the role of  the judiciary, was based on an initiative from the Italian  Justice Ministry "born from the conviction that this argument  cannot be an exclusive monopoly of one nation."    "But the search for individual responsibilities for judicial  ends" Biondi stressed, "must in no way push into second place  the need to respect the basic rights of the individual,  guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights."    The problem of repressing corruption must be on the same  level as efficiently preventing corruption, the Italian minister  continued, "We must introduce into our legal systems all the  judicial measures needed to prevent, as much as possible, the  creation of `at risk' situations, in which corruption can  germinate and blossom."    The conference here is slated to conclude tomorrow with the  adoption of a number of resolutions and sees the participation  of the justice ministers from almost all 32 of the Council of  Europe members as well as observers from Russia, the United  States and the Holy See.</p>

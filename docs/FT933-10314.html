			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Vulnerable currencies improve against D-Mark THE FRENCH and Belgian francs and Danish krone rose sharply against the D-Mark yesterday after the countries' respective central banks kept the cost of borrowing their currencies at extremely high levels in the more relaxed conditions of the European exchange rate mechanism. In price movements which astonished many currency dealers, the French franc ended more than 5 centimes higher against the D-Mark in London trading, while the Belgian franc closed inside its old ERM fluctuation band. In New York yesterday, the Danish krone was trading at DKr3.9316 to the D-Mark, close to its old ERM floor against the German currency of DKr3.9016. There was no indication yesterday that the three central banks were acting in concert to support their currencies against the D-Mark, or that they had established any informal exchange rate targets. Several dealers in London said the foreign exchange markets had been taken by surprise, and there may have been heavy losses for banks and speculative hedge funds which had sold these currencies in the expectation of interest rate cuts. 'A lot of our dealers and customers do not know what is going on in the market right now,' said the head of sales at one of London's leading commercial banks. Other market operators took a more relaxed view of yesterday's events, saying that trading had been comparatively thin. In Paris, there was no indication whether the authorities were aiming to maintain the franc's exchange rate against the D-Mark or whether interest rates would be cut today in the Bank of France's regular money market operation. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, however reaffirmed his government's commitment to the stability of the franc and to monetary discipline following the easing of the French franc's link with the D-Mark in the ERM. 'Nothing that has happened leads me to think that there can be less financial discipline,' the prime minister was reported as saying. The sharp decline in the value of the D-Mark was due mainly to the cost of borrowing funds in the money markets of France, Denmark and Belgium. The cost of borrowing French francs for one day hovered at about 12 per cent yesterday, partly because the Bank of France had still not restored a large portion of the French francs removed from the market when it intervened last week. The French franc peaked at FFr3.45 to the D-Mark at one stage, close to its old ERM floor of FFr3.4305. It later fell back to close at FFr3.466. The D-Mark's decline also helped to push up the dollar in European trading. It gained more than  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM1.7105. In New York it slipped back to DM1.7068.

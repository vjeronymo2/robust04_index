			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Schools minister backs performance-pay link Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, is calling for teachers' pay to be more decentralised, and linked more closely to performance. His intervention sparked the first dispute between the government and the teachers' unions since Mr John Patten was replaced by Mrs Gillian Shephard as education secretary last month. It came in a letter to the School Teachers' Review Body, the quango which advises the government on setting teachers' pay. Mr Forth was acting in Mrs Shephard's absence. He said he wanted the body to report on 'how the pay of all school teachers might be more closely related to individual performance, and what measures might be taken to ensure that pay discretions are used for this purpose'. He also wanted to ensure that schools had 'adequate flexibility to recruit and retain teachers and to reward the taking on of extra responsibilities'. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said that this was 'a further indication of the review body's lack of independence'. If teachers still had their negotiating rights such a worthless scheme could not be forced on the profession, he said. He added that performance-related pay 'has no place in education'. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers also opposes performance-related pay. Mr Brian Clegg, the union's assistant secretary responsible for pay and conditions, said: 'Every year since 1991 the review body has been asked to look at performance-related pay. 'It's particularly annoying at the moment because the review body have looked at it and done some research over the last couple of years. Instead of waiting for the review body to carefully research things step by step, I think the government are being a little greedy.' The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said Mr Forth's letter showed 'a short-sighted concentration on flexibility, along with insufficient resources'. But the association suggested that it was more prepared to countenance performance-related pay than the other teachers' unions. It wanted the review body to provide 'new long-term opportunities, including promotion in the classroom'. Last September the Department for Education announced that it was to introduce a pilot performance-related pay scheme in 14 schools. Mr Michael Portillo clashed with health secretary Mrs Virginia Bottomley while he was chief secretary to the Treasury over privatising the National Health Service's supplies authority, according to letters leaked to the Health Service Journal. In the letter, written in December, Mr Portillo said the housing and distribution arm of NHS supplies should be contracted out 'as early as possible in 1994', along with market testing of information technology facilities. But Mrs Bottomley replied that implementation should be over a 12- or 18-month period starting this summer. She said: 'This is not an area where a big-bang approach seems sensible.' Mrs Bottomley's department has decided that market testing for NHS supplies' distribution arm will not now start until 'the early part of next year'.</p>

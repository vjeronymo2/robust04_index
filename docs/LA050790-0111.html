			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LITTLE MERMAID ALMOST LOSES HER HEAD TO VANDAL  </P> <P> Denmark's national symbol, The Little Mermaid, has been vandalized by someone  who tried to sever the bronze statue's head using a metal cutter, police said  today.  </P> <P> "Whoever did it seems to have been frightened off in the middle of the job.  </P> <P> A 7-inch slice is missing from the left-hand side of the neck," Copenhagen  police inspector Jens Christensen said.  </P> <P> Damage to the Little Mermaid is always handled by the Copenhagen homicide  squad. The famous statue was created by Danish sculptor Erik Eriksen in 1914 in  honor of the fairy tale of the same name by Danish storyteller Hans Christian  Andersen.  </P> <P> Thousands of tourists flock to Copenhagen harbor each year to view the  melancholy mermaid, who looks across the choppy waters of the open harbor.  </P></p>

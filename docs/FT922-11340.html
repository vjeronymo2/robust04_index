			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Labour candidates set for horse-trading: Bryan Gould 'just short' of nominations needed LABOUR is preparing for a flurry of political horse-trading on Monday as MPs return to Westminster and candidates for the party leadership seek the support they need to secure nominations. Last night an aide of Mr Bryan Gould, who is contesting the leadership and the deputy's post, said the shadow environment secretary was just short of the nominations required on both counts. Candidates need the nominations of a fifth of the parliamentary Labour party. Last night people all but assured of the 55 signatures needed were Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite to succeed Mr Neil Kinnock as leader, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, one of the front-runners for deputy leader. In a move that appeared partly designed to pre-empt charges of a 'stitch-up', Mr Robin Cook, Mr Smith's campaign manager, issued a statement calling for the proportion of the party required to nominate a candidate to be reduced to a tenth in future contests. The task of getting 55 signatures has been made more difficult by the reluctance of many of the 69 new Labour MPs - more than a quarter of the parliamentary party - to nominate any candidate until they know them better. Nominations must be submitted to the party's Walworth Road headquarters in south London by Tuesday evening. Each MP may nominate only one candidate - but those who have already made a nomination may withdraw it and submit a new one. Mr Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East, in London, is also contesting the leadership. The other candidates for the deputy leadership are Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow overseas development minister, and Mr Bernie Grant, MP for Tottenham in London. Meanwhile, there has been criticism from one of the largest unions over plans to weaken union influence in the party. Mr Ken Gill, general secretary of the MSF general technical union, said excluding unions would be 'an unmitigated disaster'. However, Mr Gill said a change in the balance of the electoral college - in which the unions have 40 per cent of the votes, against 30 per cent each for both MPs and constituency parties - would be 'legitimate'. The TGWU general union, Britain's biggest union, now looks certain to ballot its 1m members to decide how to cast its vote in the leadership contest. The union will formally announce its position on Monday, but officials say it is most likely to choose either a workplace or postal ballot. A workplace ballot would be cheaper and encourage a higher turn-out and will probably be the preferred option.</p>

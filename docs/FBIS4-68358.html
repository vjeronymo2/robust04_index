			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Grachev by Galina Grigorenko; place and </F> date not given: "The Political Situation in the Republic of  Tatarstan Is Developing Normally"]    [Text] Two days ago the 19th session of the Supreme  Soviet of our republic adopted a decree on termination of the  authority of the people's deputies who have been elected to the  State Duma of the Russian Federation. They include Ivan Grachev,  who was for several years the head of the Power of the People  parliamentary faction of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of  Tatarstan. But the change in status does not, of course, mean  that this politician is no longer interested in problems of a  republic scale. He frequently travels to Kazan and coordinates,  as before, the activity of the Equality and Legality election  bloc. Our correspondent met with Grachev on the first day of  business of the present session of the Republic of Tatarstan and  put several questions to him.    [Grigorenko] Ivan Dmitriyevich, how would you evaluate the  present session?    [Grachev] Quite a standard session, nothing new or  interesting. I have a negative view of the budget message of the  president of Tatarstan. In what way, for example, does a feudal  state differ from a democratic one? In the first the ruler  distributes the requisitions from various classes at his  discretion, in the second, the collected taxes are transferred  to the representative authority, which determines the rules of  their expenditure and monitors all outlays.    I know from personal experience that the deputies of  Tatarstan had no opportunity to exercise supervision of budget  funds and the actual income from the republic's foreign economic  activity or to influence the distribution of taxes. The real  structure of the budget is now as follows: for the needs of the  agro-industrial complex, up to 70 percent of all investments in  the national economy, and for the development of "defense,"  which is the future of the Republic of Tatarstan, only two  percent. This imbalance is unfair to the urban electorate and is  fraught with the danger of a surge of unemployment and the  destitution of many thousands of inhabitants of the republic.  Even today we need to be creating new jobs in the cities of  Tatarstan and to be seeking options for support of the  "locomotives"--the most active industrial enterprises. All this  will require much material expenditure because nothing comes  free. The well-known saying: "The skinflint pays twice," should  not be forgotten.    [Grigorenko] What step, in your view, should the corps of  deputies take?    [Grachev] It would be expedient to vote down the proposed  budget for approximately a month. Within this time a working  group composed of people's deputies, members of the government,  and businessmen would examine the most serious problems. I refer  primarily to an easing of the tax burden, which is far higher in  the Republic of Tatarstan than in the Russian Federation. Thus  at industrial enterprises of Russia there are per R1 of profit  an average of R1.4 direct and indirect taxes, in our republic,  R1.7. Were it possible to find a solution that would make it  possible to lower certain types of taxes, many municipal  structures and industrial enterprises would have a pretty good  chance of development.    [Grigorenko] Lately, information has been heard from various  sources that the Government of Tatarstan will very shortly be  forced to resign or, at least, undergo significant personnel  changes. How do you view this prospect?    [Grachev] The members of Power of the People do not intend  to  vote for the resignation of Prime Minister M. Sabirov. I am  convinced that for the reform of the managerial structures a  transitional period, in which it is necessary to preserve  stability and set about the reforms in earnest, is essential.  Mukhammat Sabirov is coping successfully with the first task,  and the accomplishment of the second is not, from our viewpoint,  confined merely to this candidate. The opposition is opposed to  revolutionary changes in the government. Let the team that is  there now maintain economic stability in the republic. And a  market managerial structure imbibing more and more powers should  grow and gradually strengthen.    [Grigorenko] What, in your view, is the political situation  in Tatarstan?    [Grachev] It is developing in the right direction. The fact  that more than 30 parties and blocs are operating in the Russian  Federation at this time is of little use, in my opinion. A two-  or three-party political system may be considered suited to  regulation of the economy. A favorable situation is taking shape  here in Tatarstan in this sense. We have the Equality and  Legality bloc, the party of the nomenklatura, Unity and  Progress, the national political organizations, the communists,  who will, most likely, "degenerate" into social democrats....  Ultimately a three-party system will be formed in the republic,  and the electorate will know precisely at the next elections for  whom to vote.    [Grigorenko] Judging by foreign press reports, the rating of  the leader of the Yabloko bloc has begun to grow once again.  Among the candidates for the office of president in the  not-too-distant future experts put Grigoriy Yavlinskiy second  after Viktor Chernomyrdin....    [Grachev] From the viewpoint of personal image the leader of  our bloc could lay claim to first place also. But, as practice  has shown, an excellently organized team, which gathers all the  necessary information, distributes leaflets, and performs  precisely many other assignments, is also needed for the  achievement of complete success. It is this election machine  that Yabloko lacks. I am prepared to help Yavlinskiy create it.    [Grigorenko] May the suppositions of certain of the  capital's  journalists that the president will necessarily acquire such  allies as the Russia's Choice and Yabloko blocs be considered  objective?    [Grachev] There need be no doubt about Russia's Choice, but  close interaction with the Yabloko bloc with a normal  development of events is unlikely. The situation could change  only in the event of a powerful showing of the Zhirinovskiy and  Zyuganov factions.    As far as my personal opinion is concerned, Yeltsin should  not run in the next elections: he has already honorably done all  that he was supposed to have done. Of course, the president's  entourage could play a part. These people are no longer in a  position, evidently, to nominate a new leader and for this  reason are prepared to instill in Boris Nikolayevich the idea of  the need to take part in the elections once again.    [Grigorenko] There are stories in Moscow about the fine life  of deputies of the State Duma. A few words about how your daily  routine is arranged and whether normal conditions for work have  been created.    [Grachev] I am staying in a hotel and I have been promised  an  official apartment at the end of summer. I can summon a car,  although I am successful here far from always. But, like other  deputies of the State Duma, I am most depressed by the fact that  practically none of us has his own work place. It is not even a  question of the lack of an office but of an ordinary writing  desk in the parliament building.</p>

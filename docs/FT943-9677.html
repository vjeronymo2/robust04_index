			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Clinton perseveres with 'fast track' request President Bill Clinton and 17 top US business leaders yesterday agreed it was vital to win a new 'fast track' trade negotitating authority, so as to allow the administration to negotiate free trade agreements which cannot be amended by Congress. The request for 'fast track' authority, which the White House has attached to the Uruguay Round implementing legislation heading for a House-Senate conference committee, is widely regarded as a test of Mr Clinton's credibility on trade. The president could use the authority to negotiate free trade arrangements with Chile, perhaps Argentina and others. Administration officials do not want him showing up at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta without the capacity to conclude trade and investment treaties. Mr Clinton was due to meet the heads of companies including Texas Instruments, Caterpillar, Boeing, Monsanto, Eastman Kodak, Chemical Bank and Salomon Brothers. Congressional staffers now say the fast-track request was a risky one and perhaps a sign of over-confidence by the US Trade Representative's office. Having produced a number of successes - including passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and completion of the Uruguay Round - it requested a seven-year fast-track authority. Authority is usually granted from two to four years, and in this case, the administration wanted a longer period without even having agreed a strategy for the post-Nafta era. The fast-track request is in trouble because the administration wants to include labour and environmental provisions in future trade agreements. The business leaders and many Republicans oppose that but several Democrats will vote against the Uruguay Round, if a fast-track request does not declare the administration's intention to negotiate on labour and environment. If the president concedes to the Republicans, he is likely to lose 20-30 Democratic votes in the House. It should still pass the House but, without liberal Democratic support in the Senate, the entire implementing legislation could face a Democratic filibuster. A House-Senate conference to write a final Uruguay Round package is being delayed while the House Ways and Means Committee works on a compromise over funding the Uruguay Round pact. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen met late Monday with Bill Archer, the ranking minority member of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, to discuss Republican concerns over an inventory taxation proposal.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Fidel Ramos wins Philippine election MR Fidel Ramos, who helped topple a dictator and defeat six coup attempts, has won the Philippine presidential election after a convoluted vote count, Reuter reports from Manila. The Philippine Congress still has to proclaim the winner of the May 11 elections, but the official tally of election returns showed the 64-year-old, West Point-trained general winning with 5.34m votes. In second place was Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, a fiery anti-corruption crusader, with 4.47m votes; businessman Mr Eduardo Cojuangco was in third place with 4.1m. The results of the official tally came more than five weeks after the election. The delay was caused by complex rules designed to thwart widespread cheating that took place during the presidency of Mr Ferdinand Marcos. Both houses of Congress, meeting in special session, are expected to proclaim the successor to President Corazon Aquino either by the end of this week or early next week. Mrs Aquino steps down on June 30 after a six-year term. Mr Ramos, a former defence secretary and armed forces chief, secured less than a quarter of the vote in a seven-cornered battle for the presidency. He edged out Mrs Santiago, a former cabinet minister who has vowed to launch nationwide protests against the result, alleging vote-rigging. Mr Ramos was supported by Mrs Aquino. He had helped her to power in a 1986 popular revolt which ousted Mr Marcos, and kept her in office through six coup attempts. Aware that he was elected by the smallest percentage in the country's history, Mr Ramos has already sought the support of opponents.</p>

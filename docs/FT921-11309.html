			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Return to profit for Palmerston Palmerston Holdings, the property trading and investment group, returned to profits in the half year ended September 30 1991, making Pounds 476,000. That compared with a loss of Pounds 2,700 for the corresponding period and a deficit of Pounds 2.68m for the full previous year. The directors take the view that, for the company at least, 'the worst is behind us'. But they will continue with the recent cautious dividend policy and have cut the interim from 1.65p to 0.5p per share. Earnings were 2.12p (losses 0.01p). Mr Philip Rose, chairman, said the main contributors to the results were an increase in net rental income to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 2.64m), a decrease in the share of losses of associates to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 2.21m), and the ability to achieve a greater return from trading activities.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Indy-cisive It is hard to quibble with Sir Ralf Dahrendorf's appointment as chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the owners of The Independent. Currently warden of St Antony's College, Oxford, he has been variously a German politician, European Commissioner and director of the London School of Economics. He even sits on the board of Glaxo, Britain's biggest company. A member of the great and the good, Dahrendorf is a fine figure head and his northern European temperament should help balance the boardroom contributions from La Repubblica and El Pais, the Indy's two important Latin shareholders. However, whether an Anglo-German sociologist is the best man to have at the helm of a newspaper if there were to be a financial crisis is debatable. Meanwhile, the equally important issue of splitting Andreas Whittam-Smith's role as chief executive and editor still needs resolving.</p>

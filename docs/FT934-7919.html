			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / LDP members told to vote against reform proposals THE LEADERSHIP of Japan's divided opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday called on members to unite and vote against government plans to clean up the scandal-ridden political system. The call, by Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, is unlikely to upset the government's predicted victory in today's parliamentary vote to reform the electoral system and curb political donations. Political observers expect the proposals to get a four-to-five seat majority today, after which they pass to the upper house, the final hurdle before becoming law. The upper house, where the seven-party coalition government also has a majority, is expected to take about a month to clear the proposals. Prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa had hoped to reach agreement with the LDP. But he was forced to break with tradition and put the four reform bills to a vote after negotiations broke down on Tuesday morning. Later that day, the bills won a 20 to 19 majority in a parliamentary committee, opening the way for them to proceed to the full house. Despite Mr Kono's attempt to restore party discipline, more than 10 LDP MPs are expected to vote for the government's plans. Two to three times that number are thought to be considering leaving the LDP, which has 227 seats in the 511-seat lower house. That would seriously weaken the LDP, which ruled Japan for 38 years until last July. The coalition looked set to hold together in today's vote, despite the fact that amendments, made in an attempt to win LDP support, have offended some members of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member. Socialist officials said three to four members might vote against the government despite calls for party unity, but this would not be enough to deprive the coalition of a majority.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Warburg sends shivers through the City: Norma Cohen and Nicholas Denton study the lessons of the largest UK investment bank's profit warning For British investment banks watchful of the experience of New York firms and already facing the prospect of a severe trading setback, yesterday's news from SG Warburg could not have been more worrying. Interim profits for the group, the largest in the investment banking sector, will be less than half those in the 1993 period. Given that asset management has held up, that implies that profits from investment banking have almost totally dried up. Warburg, like the integrated US investment banks which reported sharply lower first-half results, has suffered from volatile bond, equities and derivatives markets. Yesterday's news still came as a surprise. 'I was really astonished,' said Mr Martin Cross, analyst at UBS. 'I had not entertained that profits could be Pounds 100m lower.' It appears unlikely, however, that there will be any immediate moves to sack staff or withdraw from key businesses. 'I suspect that there will be a tightening of the cost line but no major review of strategy, no major soul-searching,' said Mr Philip Gibbs, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'There may be a slightly more cautious approach and a slowing of recruitment.' Nor do Warburg's rivals expect any abrupt change in strategy. 'I wouldn't have thought for a minute that they would make a decision like that based on one set of results,' said the head of market making at one of Warburg's leading competitors. There does appear little prospect of an upturn in trading profits. Warburg's performance also prompts questions as to the profitability of market-making and the sense of Warburg's strategy of becoming a US-style integrated investment bank. 'The problem is that these bad times don't last long enough,' said the head of operations at another large investment bank. 'If they did, there would be a good shake-out.' But the so-called integrated approach that Warburg has taken - emulating the model set by its larger US competitors - is a strategy which requires a significant trading presence. It assumes that without trading activities, investment banks cannot compete for the primary market business of underwriting and placing blocks of securities, nor can they act effectively as a broker between buyers and sellers. 'If you deal in secondary markets (buying and selling securities of a particular issuer), you have a much better chance of getting primary market (underwriting new issues) business. This is the gospel now,' said Mr Gibbs. The largest US investment banks have pioneered integrated investment banking which enables them to offer a corporate client a range of services. Such an approach does not require a move away from trading activities but means using marketmaking, proprietary trading and the creation of derivatives products for individual clients to generate fee-based income. The advantage of this is that it balances the low-returns but more constant income from fees and commissions with the highly cyclical gains from trading activities. For all the strategic logic of Warburg's attempt to turn itself into a full-service investment bank, it has been an expensive venture. 'To protect one business - corporate advisory - you go into another which has very low returns and is incredibly risky and competitive,' Mr Gibbs said. Warburg is more heavily exposed to trading profits - profits derived from using its own capital to buy and sell securities - than most of its competitors. According to Mr Gibbs, 70 per cent of Warburg's profits came from dealing last year. Warburg denied that it had lost money on trading on its own account. But Mr David Poutney of stockbroker Collins Stewart was sceptical. 'I perceive they have blown their socks off on proprietary trading. If you look at the others they are all ahead at the half-way stage.' Kleinwort Benson has adopted such an approach, with impressive results. It too reported a sharp fall in trading income in the second quarter of 1994, but its overall profitability rose, thanks to a sharp increase in fee and commission income. Few of Warburg's competitors yesterday took the opportunity to question the company's strategy of integration. 'The strategy has to be right for where they are now,' said an executive at a rival merchant bank. 'If you take bigger and more aggressive positions, then this sort of thing inevitably happens. The test is to see how much money they can make when things go well.' Warburg's timing has not been the best. It began to make markets more aggressively and take positions just as the bond and equity markets turned. It could recoup its losses. 'Perhaps the investing public is going to have to get used to these firms having more volatility in their results than before,' Mr Cross said. Lex, Page 20</p>

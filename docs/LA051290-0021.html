			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's double standard has never been more odious and  obvious than by its criticism of El Salvador's leaders for their cover-up and  failure to prosecute those responsible for the killing of the six Jesuit  priests.  </P> <P> In the meantime, this same Administration is doing a "soft shoe" on the arrest  of a Mexican citizen, apparently by the DEA, in Mexico and his removal to the  United States, all illegal and in violation of Mexican sovereignty.  </P> <P> In short, how can we "read my lips" when one talks out of both sides of the  mouth?  </P> <P> WILLIAM T.

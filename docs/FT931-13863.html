			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Observer: Absorbing While it's puzzling how something best known for insolvency can be digested, that is what looks to be happening to Cork Gully after its merger with Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Like Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells which went the same way beforehand, the insolvency specialist is seeing its name disappear. Its annual commentary has this year been retitled the Coopers review, for instance, and top Cork Gully staff appearing in public are labelled as Coopers partners. Could someone have decided that, much as the 1986 insolvency act is the kiss of death to corporate recoveries, the old name bestows a hangman's handshake on struggling companies?</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Gorbachev cancels trip after court ban MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president and Communist party leader, has cancelled a scheduled trip to South Korea after the Constitutional Court banned him from leaving Russia. Mr Gorbachev faces legal action, including possible imprisonment, if he continues to refuse to testify before the court, which is determining whether or not the party he led was 'constitutional'. Mr Gorbachev said on Saturday that he had become the first Russian political 'refusenik', claiming that the the court's demand for him to testify was itself anti-constitutional. 'From a political standpoint,' Mr Gorbachev said, 'such an action is administrative lawlessness, fraught with the revival of the practice of deprivation of rights for political motives (a reference to the Stalin era).' The court has heard testimony from a number of former top Communists, including Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, prime minister during most of Mr Gorbachev's leadership, and Mr Arkady Volsky, a former senior aide to several party leaders and one of the few such officials to have kept a top job, as head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.</p>

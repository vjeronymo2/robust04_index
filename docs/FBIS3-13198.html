			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordanian official reaction differed over His  Majesty King Husayn's return from Saudi Arabia at dawn Wednesday  [9 March] without holding an expected meeting with Saudi King  Fahd to mend fences after three years of strained ties.    Reactions here varied from resigned pragmatism to anger and  disappointment that an opportunity to reconciliate Arab ranks  after the Gulf war was not made use of.    The King, who was officially reported to be going to Mecca  and Medina on the holiest day of Ramadan to perform 'Umra,  returned to Amman at 02:00 a.m. Wednesday morning.    Officials have been careful not to play up the visit's  political value and stressed the King's wish to be at the  Prophet's burial place in Medina on Laylat al-Qadr--the night of  destiny--which, according to Islam, is the night when the skies  are opened to receive worshippers' prayers.    Privately, however, politicians and anaylsts had expressed  hope that the visit would be an opportunity to break the  deadlock in relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia which  resulted from the 1990 Gulf crisis.    A well-placed source told the JORDAN TIMES that King Husayn  was aware that his trip to Mecca and Medina was to be a "purely  spiritual visit."    The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no  political significance or hopes should have been attached to  this short trip except that a "psychological barier" had been  removed with the King's insistence on the visit despite  continued tension in political relations between him and the  Saudi monarch.    "The King's insistence on performing 'Umra was a duty he  felt  as a Muslim," the source said adding that "this was a religious  trip and not a political one... there should be no  disappointment."    "A psychological barrier, if one is to think politically,  has  definitely been removed," the source said, explaining that while  King Husayn had previously stayed away from the Islamic holy  shrines because of the political situation between the two  countries "he was able to break that barrier" with Tuesday's  trip.    But the source conceded that had the two kings been able to  meet and resolve some of their differences "it would have been  differences "it would have been perfect."    However, other officials, who also acknowledge that the king  had no scheduled meeting with the Saudi monarch before he left  for 'Umra, did not hide their disappointment.    "The attitude by the Saudis was definitely negative and not  conducive to reconciliation," said a senior official.    "When interests of states are at risk, top state officials  should rise above personal disputes," he added.    Western diplomats here concur with the disappointed  officials. Analysts describe the Saudi decision as "counter  productive."    News agencies quoted Saudi diplomats as saying that while  they had been told by Jordanian officials that there was no  scheduled meeting between the two monarchs, "the royal court  only informed us that the King wanted to perform 'Umra," a  senior Saudi diplomat, who refused to be identified, was quoted  as saying by the AP. "There was no request for any high-level  meetings."    A source close to the palace said there was no attempt by  the Saudis to make any high-level contact with the King or any  member of his delegation.    "We are very disappointed," said the source. "The King was  reaching out in reconciliation but King Fahd did not respond."    Although neither Jordan nor Saudi Arabia officially  confirmed  a reconciliation meeting, official sources had privately said  that the two kings were to meet Tuesday for the first time since  the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in 1990.    Relations between the two kingdoms soured after Iraq invaded  Kuwait in Aug. 1990 when Jordan refused to join Saudi-based  U.S.-led multinational forces that drove Iraq out of Kuwait.    Jordan, at the time, declared that while it condemned Iraq's  takeover of its smaller neighbour Kuwait it felt that the  problem had to be contained within Arab ranks.    King Husayn conducted a shuttle diplomacy between Iraq and  Egypt immediately after the invasion, trying to withhold an Arab  League condemnation of Iraq with Iraqi leadership promises that  he was ready to withdraw from Kuwait.    His attempts to contain the problem within Arab ranks,  however, failed when the Arab League voted to condemn Iraq  despite earlier promises to withhold the decision.    Saudi Arabia, enraged by the Jordanian position, responded  by  cutting off much-needed economic aid to Jordan and discontinued  its fuel supplies to the country.    Relations suffered a serious setback and diplomatic missions  between the two countries have operated with minimum staff since  that time.    Officials here hoped that a meeting between the two monarchs  would have turned a new page in bilateral relations.    "The Saudis had told us that the King was welcome to perform  the 'Umra but that there was to be no scheduled meeting with  King Fahd," a senior official said.    "Yet we were hopeful that this meeting would be arranged by  the time King Husayn arrived in Saudi Arabia," the senior  official added.    Analysts believed that King Fahd's decision to meet  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Yemeni leader 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih was an "encouraging" sign that the Saudi  leadership would also move to normalise relations with Jordan.  The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Yemen adopted a  similar position to that of Jordan after the Aug. 2 Invasion.    Amman's ties with most of the Gulf states, except Saudi  Arabia and Kuwait, have improved especially with Qatar, the  United Arab Emirates and Oman.    Officially, Jordan was careful not to raise hopes by  stressing that the King's visit on Tuesday was for purely  religious reasons but sources had also revealed that an advance  team from the palace was sent a week before the King's trip to  arrange for the meeting.    King Fahd normally grants courtesy audiences to most heads  of  state visiting his country on pilgrimage.    Some analysts here now expect relations between Jordan and  Saudi Arabia to worsen after King Fahd's "rebuff."    "At best Jordan will try to contain the problem," said one  analysts. "But the King will not try such a gesture again. He  has gone out of his way."    Other analysts, however, disagree and say that there were no  high expectations of reconciliation at this time and that things  will just have to "take their own pace."</p>

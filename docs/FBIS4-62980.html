			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 0835 on 17 May broadcasts a 40-minute program on the merging  of the Russian and Belarussian monetary systems. The program is  in two parts and consists of, first, a 25-minute live interview  with Stanislaw Shushkevich, former chairman of the Belarusian  Supreme Soviet, by Leonid Sviridov, Radio Rossii's correspondent  in Minsk, followed by, after a break for the news, a 15-minute  question and answer session with listeners.    The live interview begins with Sviridov expressing surprise  at Shushkevich's assertion, before going on air, that although  the treaty on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian  monetary systems has been signed, the official text of the  treaty does not show the date when it was actually signed.  Commenting on this, Shushkevich says:    "You are absolutely right to point this out. The Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Belarus finds itself in a laughable  situation. The point is that a different document was signed --  it was signed on 6 September last year and ratified by the  Supreme Soviet. Now the Supreme Soviet is, so to speak, playing  a joke -- or else it has had a joke played on itself. This is  because the Supreme Soviet ratified an agreement which should  have come into force on 1 January. Then our esteemed premier  [Vyacheslaw Kebich] announced that its implementation was being  postponed to 1 April. Well, this did not happen, of course, and  now nobody knows when it will come into force, because this is  an authentic copy of the treaty, and there is no date here. So,  nobody knows when it was signed.    "Furthermore, as you see, the signature of the chairman of  the National Bank [Stanislaw Bagdankevich] does not appear here.  In other words, he has objections."    Sviridov then interjects to explain that Bagdankevich's  objections were based on Article five in the Belarusian  Constitution.    Shushkevich continues:    "Well, if the chairman of the National Bank felt that he  could not sign it, his reasons are understandable. He did not  dare to contravene the Constitution. What is more, I think that  perhaps he objected to the agreement as a whole because he  regarded it as unbeneficial.    "But I would like to delve into the background of this  treaty. Everything began with the establishment of the CIS.  After all, the aim of setting up the CIS was to halt the  disintegration. If anybody were to take the text of the Viskuli  Agreement [setting up the CIS], they would see that it calls for  a single currency and a customs and payments union. In other  words, what was intended was an extremely integrated economic  union, more integrated even than the European Community. We  decided to build a law-based Commonwealth and to develop proper  economic relations.    "But what transpired? Very often, these days, we hear  complaints that the agreement is not working. A very simple  truth has emerged. In conditions of the market economy  governments cannot impose from above those ties which they might  prefer. Market economies are effective because they establish  logical and necessary ties. So, far fewer ties have been  established by all the agreements signed on the CIS than those  initiated from below. But this process has gotten going. There  is no problem here. Such ties as military ones, ties in the  field of transportation and communications, for instance, can be  established from above, by government decisions. The movement of  citizens and the openness of borders must be handled in this  way. Economic ties, however, will be established by the due  logic of things.    "Against this background it was announced that salvation for  our structure -- the Republic of Belarus -- lay in the  unification of monetary systems. I fear that Russia has very  little idea of the state of our economy."    Shushkevich goes on to say: "I don't want to tax the  listeners with complex matters. A few days ago [Prime Minister]  Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin had an article published in the  FINANCIAL TIMES in which he said that the output slump in Russia  amounts to 25 percent. That is a very big figure. But Russia  has reformed itself. Obviously, reform is always accompanied by  slump. Russia is building on a completely different foundation.  The Russian prime minister put it this way: This is the low  point; things will improve from here. Clearly, he must have  reasons for saying so, since he made this statement to such an  authoritative publication.    "But what has happened in our republic? Here the slump  amounts to 40 percent. Production fell by 40 percent in the  first quarter of this year, compared with the first quarter of  last year. Just listen to our radio and TV broadcasts.  Everywhere, government servants -- I was going to call them  satraps because of the mindless praise they go in for --  everywhere they forget about this catastrophic slump. Instead  they say that everything is fine. I will not go so far as to  quote the words of Utesov's song "Everything is fine, fair  marchioness" but that is more or less what it amounts to. The  collapse has actually been catastrophic. But we say that there  is a way out of this predicament."    Returning to the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems, Shushkevich says:    "The Viskuli Agreement also stipulated that we would all  use the same ruble. But what happened subsequently? Every  newly formed country strove to gain an advantage at the expense  of others. The banks were unable to agree on how to control  emission. In other words, no mechanism of confidence and  control was worked out. So, I ask, won't the same thing happen  if we unite? Does such a mechanism exist or not? Generally  speaking, there is nothing new in this. I do not know of any  legal agreements which have been reached. So, the same thing is  bound to happen again. Assuming we do not want it to happen,  let us ask what will be the significance of the transnational  bank to be formed when the National Bank of the Republic of  Belarus is abolished. This signifies that Russia and Belarus  have to have a common budget. And how can we have a common  budget without a single taxation system, because Russian  citizens will not pay out for Belarusians or Belarusians for  Russians? So, there will have to be a single, fair taxation  system. That is obvious.    "What does a single taxation system mean? Tt means there  must be a single law on property. That is obvious. What does a  single law on property mean? It means there must be a single  procedure for privatization. But the show has never gotten on  the road here in Belarus, if you don't mind my saying so.  Grassroots privatization, voucher privatization, has not  started. In Russia, by contrast, it is now ending.    "What does a single procedure for privatization mean? It  means joint administration of state assets. How can it not be  joint? What does joint administration of state assets mean? It  means centralized release of credit and identical rates of  interest. When I was driving to the studio today, I heard  someone on the radio saying that Russia has reduced its bank  rate to 200 percent. Here, however, such an interest rate would  be impossible, it would be equivalent to a subsidy because our  inflation rate is so high. So, this is not realistic.    "But if this were actually to be implemented, welfare  benefits in the two countries would have to be the same. How  can such a thing happen, I ask you? It can only happen in a  unified state. Given the differences in our legislation and the  state of our economies, this is unrealistic. So, why all this  hypocrisy? Let me ask a blunt question: What basis is there  for all this talk of unification, and so on, and so forth? There  is a great deal of hypocrisy here.    "Basically, the issue at stake here is not unification of  monetary systems. These are populist election slogans, and our  premier makes no effort to hide the fact. Speaking at the  Belarussian State University a few days ago, he said that those  articles of the law which have come into force, relating to the  customs union, will operate until 31 July provided he [Kebich]  is elected. Actually, they will stay in force after that. So,  why is he dictating terms? What kind of interpretation is this?"    Sviridov then refers to a warning by Kebich, reported by  ZVYAZDA on May 14th, that Belarusia's entry to the ruble zone  might not actually go ahead if there is an upset in the  presidential elections. Shushkevich replies:    "Who then should Russia, anybody in Russia, support? After  all, such an attitude destroys the common strategy drawn up by  the CIS, that is, the idea of mutual settlements through a  payments union and an interstate bank. This is the decision of  the CIS. We have an interest in this. Why can't we -- we have  a very big interest in resolving questions with Russia -- but  why can't we do the same with Ukraine? It can be done through a  transnational bank. I think Russia has an interest in this,  too. And the CIS has made a decision on this.    "So, it has to be ratified by the states involved. But this  is being put off. In other words, the agreements signed by all  members of the CIS must be implemented. Why is this not being  done in our republic? The answer is transparently clear. Our  government is bankrupt and it hopes that Russia will settle our  debts at the expense of the Russian taxpayer.    "But I don't think this is very good for Russians. I repeat,  I am convinced that the Russians do not realize how bad our  economic situation is."    Asked to explain his position with regard to monetary  unification, which seems to have changed since 1991 from  supporting it to categorical rejection of it now, Shushkevich  says:    "Let me make it clear. It is true that I was angrily  criticized by the government because I said that I have nothing  to do with this menagerie -- I mean all these hares, aurochs,  and other beasts -- because I believed that we should carry out  the same anti-inflation policy as Russia.    However, this was not to be. It was decided that we would  kill two birds with one stone. First of all, we were to  introduce the cash that Russia could not give us, but at the  same time we were to keep the exchange rate of one-to-one, and  the two currencies were to be in parallel circulation.    But there are no miracles. If we restrict the outflow, the  consequences will be exactly as I said they would be. And I am  not the only one to say so. I am not a prophet. Half the Supreme  Soviet were such prophets. We explained all of this from the  rostrum. In fact, the exchange rates began diverging and now the  exchange rate is one-to-ten. So, what happened? It was decided  that we would print as much money as we needed. If the  agriculture is ruined, we will give credits. We have a  catastrophically high inflation rate, that is, price rises are  very much greater than in Russia. But at the same time, we  wanted to have a stable monetary system. These are the naive  dreams of the government.    "So why is there such a desire now? Well, I was against  the creation of this money. I understood what it would lead to,  because no one can make miracles happen. It is impossible to  make ordinary people live according to market rules, but let the  leadership live according to distribution rules. And this is  what they were trying to achieve here."    Shushkevich goes on to say: "Look at what happened this  year.  [Viktor] Chernomyrdin believes that there is a slump in Russia,  but it is dictated by the reforms, and one can understand this.  Russia bravely decided to follow the path of reforms and create  a new class of owners. But we have no reforms. All we've got  are individuals close to the government, and they grab more and  more property. And look what happened in one year! I have  already said that there is a 40-percent decline in the gross  national product, prices have gone up 24 times while incomes  have increased 15 times. The decline in average income is 40  percent. And if you take into account the polarization of  society, we have a lot of destitute people."    Shushkevich is then given some statistical data about the  general dissatisfaction with the pace of reforms by the ordinary  people in Belarus. "Well, it is just one more shattered dream.  See what the people have been told: that they can exchange  200,000 rubles one-for-one. So, those who have a million hares  in the bank, well, they will be pleased, won't they?" But, he  adds, because of various restrictions imposed by the government  for the forthcoming exchange of the Belarusian currency for  Russian rubles, only a very exclusive circle of people close to  the government will benefit from it.    He says: "In 1991, thanks to a very honorable offer by  Russia, we had a zero agreement, which meant that we had no more  debts. At present, we will have $2 billion in debts by the end  of the year. Some say that there is no real debt. But this  year, the officially determined sum allocated for servicing the  debt is $305.5 million. We must amalgamate these debts right  now. But at the same time, Belarus is going to lose rental  payments from Russian military bases. We are also going to lose  the land tax from these bases. Another tax that we are losing is  the transit transport tax.    "One would say that this is all very fine and that we will  receive cheap oil in exchange for all of this, without any added  value. But this is not exactly the case. And the first steps  have already shown that excise duties are increasing, and the  price [of Russian oil sold to Belarus] is slowly going back to  what it was. All of this is a fairy tale, a myth, because once  people start barter deals -- I will give you a bit of this if  you give me a bit of that -- instead of counting everything in  money, misunderstandings arise right away."    Shushkevich goes on to say that Russia should refine all the  crude oil it exports to the West, and that it should do it  together with Belarus, because of transportation links existing  in Belarus. He then adds: "A question arises. Who wants this  treaty? Who wants to transport oil to the West, quickly and  free of charge? Is it the Russian state? We are not going to  take this money from commercial structures. Do you understand?  One must always look for a reason, and it seems to me that it  is not the Russian state which is more interested in this, but  rather the Russian Gazprom and other commercial structures.  They are forcing us to make our taxpayers pay for this transit  facility, ostensibly for Russia, but it is not for Russia that  we will be doing this, but for some entirely different  structures.    "Why is it that commercial structures will not be paying any  taxes? Russian commercial structures will not be paying any  taxes for the transit of gas through Belrusian territory! I  don't think this is fair! And in general, I would say that  whenever something somewhere is going for free, there is a  culprit. And in the final account, Russia will be guilty. I do  not think this is right, I do not think this is in Russia's  interest."    During the question and answer session at the end of the  program Shushkevich is asked why he is giving his interview to  Radio Rossii rather than to Belarusian radio. Shushkevich  replies:    "In our republic, you know, the authorities have what  amounts  to a monopoly over all the mass media. Our government has  decided that no one holding views different from itself shall  have airtime on Belarusian radio and, especially, Belarusian TV.  There are very few exceptions."    The program ends with a final question about why Belarusian  sour cream is being exported to Russia.</p>

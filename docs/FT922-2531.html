			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 1m bribe charge for ex-GWR employee GREAT WESTERN Resources, the oil and gas company which is in legal dispute with its once-largest coal customer, has announced the criminal indictment of a former employee. Mr Clyde Goins, former president of Great Western Coal, is alleged to have taken a Dollars 1m bribe to encourage the Dollars 8.5m purchase by Great Western of the Burning Star Coal Company in 1988. Mr Goins left GWR in September 1991. The company said yesterday that it did not believe the indictment would have any material effect on the bankruptcy proceedings of its coal subsidiaries or the litigation with the public utility, South Carolina Public Services Authority. 'If the allegations are correct,' a statement said, 'GWR and its coal subsidiaries would have been victims of the alleged conspiracy and GWR will deal with this in an appropriate manner.' SCPSA had charged GWR's coal division, Mr Goins, and Mr Joe Norman, a former employee of the utility, with conspiracy, fraud and unfair trade practices. In a separate case, SCPSA is also disputing in court the validity of certain coal contracts with GWR, which once represented more than 50 per cent of the natural resource company's revenue. The US utility is withholding some Dollars 33m in coal payments. However, it was announced recently that the two companies have begun talks with a view to settling out of court.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Fuse burns low on unemployment time-bomb - Russia's hidden jobless rate will not remain so for long THE TWO largest barriers to a radical economic reform process in Russia were the parliament and fear of the effects of radicalism on employment. Only the latter remains, but it could soon be a critical problem. Officially, unemployment is still low: around 800,000. But hidden unemployment is much higher, according to Mr Fyodor Prokopov, head of the federal employment service. Sooner or later, the part-time work ploys and unpaid 'holidays' that constitute hidden unemployment will emerge as real job losses. 'The situation of hidden unemployment cannot last,' says Mr Prokopov. . . 'We have no good figures on this, but we estimate at least 3m people are in this kind of situation (holidays without pay). Beyond that, many more are on occasional work regimes, or very part-time work. In all, we reckon between 5m and 7m would be really unemployed in normal conditions.' That is 7-10 per cent of the working population even before large-scale bankruptcies begin. The city of Ivanovsk, Russia's textile centre, which has been hit hard by a loss of market, and even more a loss of cheap raw material from Central Asia, is a case in point. Factories there have had to close or partly close  -the official unemployment rate is a mere 4 per cent - in part because the region's administration has introduced a subsistence wage for people who remain on companies' books but have neither work nor pay. 'In such a region, and in others, the figure could easily and quickly reach 20 per cent or more, once the hidden unemployment becomes open,' says Mr Prokopov. The federal employment service, a creation of the past two years, is 'too weak yet to assist very much', according to Mr Prokopov. Unused to working with the service, neither workers without work nor employers requiring workers inform their local employment bureaux - both still rely on the traditional word of mouth, friends or relatives. The employment service is one of the many stepchildren of a government desperately strapped for cash and too obliged, at least until now, to subsidise enterprises to prevent their bankruptcy to spare much for a service which would cope with bankruptcy's results. It has had some assistance from the German, Canadian, British and Scandinavian governments, but a World Bank Dollars 70m loan has not been taken up because the finance ministry is struggling to keep down debt. Perhaps because of the reluctance of the government to move, labour militancy is very low. Mr Igor Yourgens, first deputy president of the General Confederation of Trade Unions (the branch of the old official unions which groups all the former Soviet era republican unions) says 'people have their heads down. The government has a clear field for action. Not only is the parliament gone but unions cannot stimulate militancy in members'. However, this may change slowly. One of the many decrees passed after parliament was banned removed the unions' responsibility to administer the social security system, one of their largest tasks. The intention was to start creating a system clearly run by the state. The other effect may be to make the unions more independent of a state on which they have traditionally depended, and create a far more combative relationship. The spectre of unemployment concerns more than a few Russian officials. Last month, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a new UK think-tank, called for a Dollars 10bn safety net to cushion the effects of mass unemployment - which it estimated would rise to 10m-11m - to allow benefit to be paid at the rate of around Rbs16,000-Rbs17,000 (about Dollars 180) a month, less than half the average wage. It remains the most feared threat: yet it is an inescapable companion of reform. Once the present government drafts its economic programme, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy finance minister, presents his budget which will now have no parliamentary opposition to countermand it, we will be able to see how real the threat is.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Lautro tightens rules on finance product sales LAUTRO, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, has issued a guide for sales agents spelling out circumstances in which they should not recommend a purchase of any of their products to a client. The rules, which dwell on the issue of 'suitability', define much more narrowly the kind of product which can be recommended in certain circumstances, and are likely to have a significant impact particularly on insurance companies which market a limited product range. Sales agents have been interpreting rules on suitability to mean the product offered by their employer that comes closest to meeting the client's specific needs, even though it may not meet those needs exactly. Lautro warned in a bulletin issued yesterday that its enforcement staff and its complaints subcommittee will 'routinely look particularly closely at queries about 'best advice' which arise in the context of such members'. The Financial Services Act requires sales agents to give best advice about which product to purchase. Industry regulators have said one of their chief aims is to curb the sale of 'unsuitable' products. Sales of such products often lead to early encashment of insurance policies. The front-ended nature of most insurance contracts means that those who cancel early lose most of the premiums paid in the first year or so, costing investors millions of pounds every year. In its enforcement bulletin 23, Lautro said it was trying in response to enquiries from members to clarify an earlier statement. That statement had told members how to check that sales agents had ascertained a client's needs and had recommended only the purchase of a suitable product. 'Some members then ask: 'How is suitability to be defined?',' Lautro said. 'It will be clear . . . that in general terms the monitoring committee does not regard suitability as synonymous with the closest match.' Among factors to be taken into consideration are whether a client is likely to need the proceeds of any investment before the investment matures. If so, will the value of the investment be sufficient to meet client needs, and will it represent a reasonable rate of return? Also, the client must demonstrate his ability to meet the costs of the investment. A product which requires too great a proportion of a client's disposable income will not be deemed suitable.</p>

The proposal to tax such fees will be studied under fiscal  1994 tax reform plan, but the officials say opposition is  expected from the Finance Ministry and the Health and Welfare  Ministry on the grounds that life insurance companies are facing  a severe management environment.    The employees' pension fund system was created in 1967 and  the government exempted from taxation the fees charged by the  insurance companies for managing the funds. Home Affairs  Ministry officials said the special treatment puts the national  pension fund system at a disadvantage.    In addition, no tax exemption is allowed if the pension fund  management is entrusted to trust banks, they said. The ministry  calculates there will be an increase of tax revenues of some 1  billion yen annually if the special tax holiday is abolished.</p>

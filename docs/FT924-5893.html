			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There were 17,017 packages for the day, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Landed Assams met improved competition at 5-10p dearer, while prices for better mediums were often appreciably higher. Bangladesh teas proved irregular and the plainer sorts attracted limited interest. Brighter liquoring east Africans were well supported with further gains of 5-15p. Offshore: strong general demand at dearer rates throughout. The highest price realised this week was 212p for a Kenya pd. Quotations: quality 190p, good medium 165p, medium 145p, low medium 102p.</p>

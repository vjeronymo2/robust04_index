			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Share trading compensation row THE GOVERNMENT is pressing the Stock Exchange to raise from Pounds 50m to Pounds 1bn the proposed compensation ceiling to cover losses by personal shareholders through the Taurus electronic share settlement system. The argument has added to the rift between the City and the Department of Trade and Industry about the development of the long-delayed electronic system, which will replace share certificates by entries on computers. The compensation scheme would protect all losses in any one year by private shareholders in the event of electronic failure, fraud or error. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, sees the higher limit as a way of winning the confidence of individual shareholders in the system. The DTI is understood to have based its call for compensation of up to Pounds 1bn on the fact that private individuals own about Pounds 84bn of UK shares. Once Taurus is fully operational all these shares will be 'dematerialised', or brought into the electronic system. The DTI said yesterday that its aim was to secure sufficient protection for investors without adding to their costs. It said it was discussing with the exchange a level for the compensation scheme which would reflect this balance. The exchange has told the DTI that the cost of insurance to cover a Pounds 1bn scheme would add significantly to dealing costs for private investors. Most of the premiums would fall on private client brokers. The exchange has also said it could not buy enough insurance to match the Pounds 1bn ceiling because there was not enough capacity in the market. It added that such a limit was unnecessary, as tight security and a daily reconciliation of all shares held in Taurus would make such vast losses impossible. With the delays, Taurus, originally planned for October, is unlikely to come into operation before the summer of 1992 at the earliest.</p>

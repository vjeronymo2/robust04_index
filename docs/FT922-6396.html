			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Agrochemicals industry warns of 20% cut in sales REFORM of the common agricultural policy could cut sales of agrochemical products in Europe by as much as 20 per cent, the industry said yesterday. Manufacturers of agricultural equipment, however, were relieved that the uncertainty over the extent of the CAP reforms had been removed. Some equipment suppliers said that farmers who had post-poned making investment decisions while ministers were deliberating might now make long-awaited purchases. As a result tractors and other equipment could be boosted in the short term. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer of agrochemicals, warned that the reforms would lead to a significant upheaval and shake-out in the industry. According to ICI the worst affected markets would be France, Germany and the UK. It said western Europe accounted for about 30 per cent of the industry's worldwide sales. Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest agrochemicals supplier, said that with less land being cultivated the number of competitors in the industry could decline from 14 to six over the next decade. ICI said that the sales decline in western Europe was likely to be offset by increases in other markets, in particular Latin America. The overall world market for agrochemicals was expected to remain static in spite of the decline in the west Europe market. Sales of agricultural equipment, particularly tractors, have plummeted in the past 18 months as farmers have held back from making new investment. According to the Agricultural Equipment Association, the number of tractors sold in Britain last year fell by almost 16 per cent to 15,280. This compares with 28,000 in 1983. UK tractor manufacturers export about 90 per cent of their production, of which about a third goes to EC countries. In addition, about 60 per cent of exports of other kinds of agricultural equipment also goes to the EC. Manufacturers were concerned about the effect CAP reform would have on other EC countries which, according to the association, were likely to be more vulnerable than the UK. Mr John Young, chief executive of the agricultural equipment division of Wolseley, the UK engineering group, said: 'It is too early to say what the ultimate effect of the reforms will be. But there could be a slight recovery in sales initially.' Manufacturers were concerned that farmers faced with lower product prices and with less land being cultivated would need to reduce their cost base. This, however, might be achieved through increased mechanisation, said Mr Young.</p>

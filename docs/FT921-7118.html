			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / EC likely to step up Central America aid THE European Community is expected to increase its aid to Central America and establish a four-year programme in support of human rights during a two-day meeting of European and Central American foreign ministers in Lisbon. The foreign ministers of Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia are also attending the meeting, which ends today. Discussions were expected to focus on economic co-operation, with EC ministers emphasising the link between economic and social progress and the defence of human rights. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, said the EC would contribute to national reconstruction in El Salvador - ravaged by a 12-year civil war which ended in January. The meeting was also expected to discuss an Ecu50m (Pounds 35.4m) priority EC aid programme for the country. Mr Jose Manuel Pacas Castro, the Salvadorean foreign minister, was due to present details of a national reconstruction plan. A new Ecu1.5m human rights programme would help to pay for technical assistance to train the Salvadorean police and armed forces. A special commission of EC and Central American experts would supervise the programme. Discussions on trade were expected to focus on Central American demands for free access to the EC for their agricultural products. The region's producers fear that they will be excluded from exporting bananas into the Community once the European single market is completed.</p>

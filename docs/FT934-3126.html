			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Auditors receive Cadbury guidance Auditors will be required to highlight any aspects of non-compliance with the Cadbury code of corporate governance that companies fail to list, under guidelines published yesterday. They must produce a statement drawing attention to any departures from the code not flagged in a statement by the directors, according to a bulletin issued by the Auditing Practices Board (APB), the standard-setting body for the profession. The advice is preliminary because detailed guidance is still being developed on two outstanding areas recommended in the Cadbury code. They are commentaries on internal controls and on whether the company is a 'going concern'. Meanwhile, the APB strongly advises auditors not to make any comments on these aspects of the code. It says auditors are not required to perform additional procedures to investigate the appropriateness of non-compliance. They should review all meetings, question directors and attend audit committee meetings as part of their review. But Mr Michael Boyd, vice-chairman of the APB and a partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'This advice goes further than Cadbury required. An auditor would disregard it at his peril.' The guidance came into effect immediately. Companies must provide a statement of compliance with the Cadbury code for accounting periods after June 30 this year. APB.

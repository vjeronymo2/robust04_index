			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Goodhead falls 39% and omits dividend GOODHEAD GROUP, the printing, publishing and paper company, suspended its interim dividend yesterday as pre-tax profits tumbled 39 per cent to Pounds 429,000 for the six months to November 30, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr John Madejski, chairman, sought to reassure investors, saying the board had 'every intention of declaring a final dividend'. Fully-diluted earnings per share fell from 2.3p to 1.2p. Mr Colin Rosser, chief executive, said each of the group's divisions was trading profitably. This had not been the case in the second half of last year, when the group returned a profit of Pounds 62,000 purely due to an exceptional Pounds 782,000 gain. Similarly, first-half profits this year were entirely due to halved interest charges of Pounds 706,000 following the Pounds 4.5m sale of the Wiltshire printing business in April. Debt at the half-year was Pounds 10m. Turnover fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 22.2m. Just under half of the decline in sales was due to the Wiltshire sale, with Pounds 5.8m of the drop coming in the paper division. The paper market remained very soft, although profits had been helped by more spot deals, where margins are higher. Mr Rosser said the publishing business - mainly free newspapers - had been the hardest hit, with advertising revenues down by 30 per cent on the previous year. The contract printing operation, which traditionally provides the bulk of profits, increased its contribution by 5 per cent to Pounds 700,000.</p>

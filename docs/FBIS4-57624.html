			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Luis Enrique Vasquez] </F>   [Text] Panama City, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Victims of the 1989  U.S. military invasion of Panama will exert international  pressure in an effort to force Washington to pay them  compensation, it was announced today by the plaintiffs' lawyers.    Gilma Gloria Camargo told NOTIMEX the OAS Human Rights  Commission will take the case before the international community  as a way to exert pressure on the United States. The lawyer  arrived in this capital to inform the victims on the status of  their claims and to brief others who were affected by the  conflict on the steps they need to take to legitimize their  claims.    Payment to the first 70 victims was estimated at $250  million, but there are 1,500 depositions to date, which  represent more than $1 billion in compensation, Camargo said.  Camargo, one of the Panamanian lawyers at the Center for  Constitutional Rights Headquarters in New York, said the victims  are claiming loss of human life; injuries; and the destruction  of homes, household effects, and businesses.    "The United States might refuse to pay for damages because  it  has not subscribed to some human rights agreements.  Nevertheless, we believe that the commission can make a  recommendation to the OAS court and that we can exert  international pressure," Camargo added.    The lawyer said the pressure may be exerted in a few days,  after the Inter-American Human Rights Commission [CIDH]  publishes the acceptance of the Panamanian complaint in its  annual report. The OAS accepted the complaint in December, but  the United States later requested a review of the case.  However, the complaint was ratified by the OAS, Camargo  explained.    Camargo insists: "The United States always says other  countries should abide by international law. Therefore, it also  should abide by the law in Panama's case."    "Only noncombatant" civilians, who were in this country  during the 20 December 1989 armed invasion to oust General  Manuel Antonio Noriega, "qualify" as plaintiffs, she noted.  Those who meet the requirements may get OAS application forms  by presenting the necessary evidence at the Panamanian Human  Rights Commission offices. These forms will then "be sent to  the Center of Constitutional Rights in New York," she concluded.    According to human rights organizations' estimates, the  armed  intervention cost approximately 2,000 lives and $1 billion in  damage. U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have  rejected until now accusations made by Panamanian victims of the  invasion.</p>

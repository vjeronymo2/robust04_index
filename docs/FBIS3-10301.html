The project was promoted by Guatemalan Deputy Juan Ayerdi  Aguilar and is part of the recommendations emanating from the  August 1993 First Human Rights Seminar organized by the  respective Parlacen commission in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Human  rights ombudsmen representing each of the Parlacen member  countries participated in the seminar.    The new ombudsman will be a Parlacen commissioner who will  have to observe the political constitutions of each member  state, the universal declaration of human rights, as well as  treaties and agreements signed between the regions' governments.  The ombudsman will also have his own legal status and will be  independent from any human rights organization, institution, or  official but will respect the jurisdiction of the other  countries human rights ombudsmen.    Ayerdi Aguilar explained that any candidate who seeks to  occupy the position must be a lawyer with at least five years  professional experience as well as a citizen of one of the  Parlacen member countries. The ombudsman will enjoy the same  prerogatives and immunities as Parlacen deputies.    The position is not open to public sector workers, national  congress or Parlacen deputies, or leaders of political parties,  workers unions, or business associations. Neither will the  position be open to persons who are ministers of any religious  denomination. In addition, the person selected will be barred  from participating in his profession during his term as  ombudsman.    The candidate will be selected by the full Parlacen Assembly  with a favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the total number  of deputies. In addition, the candidate's nationality will be  determined in accordance with the order in which the presidents  were elected to the regional forum. For that reason, the first  ombudsman will be a Guatemalan national since Roberto Nicolle  Carpio, who first presided over the Parlacen, originates from  Guatemala.    The human rights ombudsman will hold the position for three  years and will not be eligible for reelection.    Ayerdi explained that there will also be a deputy ombudsman  who will substitute for the official ombudsman in case of  temporary absence. The selection of an assistant ombudsman will  follow the same procedure as those established to select the  regular ombudsman.</p>

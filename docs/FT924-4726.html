			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Satellite view of Premier Sir, May I draw attention to an inaccuracy about the position of satellite in a recent article by Raymond Snoddy, 'Writs fly after dirty work at the crossbars' (November 20), before it becomes accepted as incontrovertible fact. Mr Snoddy says that, in the week beginning September 29, BSkyB had an audience of 500,000 for live Premier League football which, compared with its subscription base of just over 1m, gives viewing figures of nearly 50 per cent. Mr Snoddy thus confuses household subscriptions and individual viewers. I do not have exact figures for household size of subscribers to Sky Sports, but I would guess it to be between three and four, giving viewing figures closer to one-eighth than a half.

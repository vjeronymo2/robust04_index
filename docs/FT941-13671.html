			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Chile's lower house to debate market reforms Long-awaited reforms to Chile's capital markets, due to be discussed by the house of deputies today, are expected to become law by the end of the month. The reforms, championed by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister, seek to broaden options available to Chile's powerful investment institutions and to regulate the stock market more effectively. Deputies will vote on amendments to the bill introduced last week in the Senate intended to expand investment possibilities and to soften some of the bill's regulatory clauses. This is the final stage of a year-long legislative process which has been hostage to party bickering and relentless lobbying of congressmen. New legislation will allow privatised pension funds (AFPs), which have amassed savings of Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) since 1981, to increase their foreign investments and to expand options at home. The amount AFPs can invest abroad will be raised over four years from the present ceiling of 3 per cent of funds to 12 per cent. The original bill, before Senate amendments, envisaged a 10 per cent maximum. There will also be a 6 per cent floor in an effort to force pension funds to spread their risk. Chileans are obliged by law to invest 10 per cent of their earnings in an AFP. At home, pension funds will be allowed to buy stock in a broader range of companies and to provide project funding and venture capital. They will also be able to trade in futures and options for hedging purposes. The number of companies available for AFP investment will be raised from the current 40 or so blue chips to more than 200. The bill also includes a stiffer regulatory framework to ensure new freedoms are not abused. New rules will be introduced on corporate governance, privileged information, and the independence of AFP directors - though some of these elements were weakened at the Senate stage. Nevertheless, prison sentences are to be introduced for cases relating to the abuse of confidential information. Also, brokerage houses with members represented on the board of a company will be prohibited from dealing in stock of that company. Together with reforms of the banking sector, also close to becoming law, Mr Foxley said the new law would 'permit an enormous impulse towards the modernisation of Chile's financial sector'.</p>

It should wonder why it does not feel safe." It was  interesting to note that another column on the same page discussed recent  incidents of documented police abuse that have gone unpunished. Is police abuse  less evil? Or did we just flinch!  </P> <P> MICHAEL P. OSTRYE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 4: Strong incentives for diversification - Equity Investment ACROSS Europe today, property investment capital is mainly on hold. Whereas the late 1980s were characterised by opportunistic cross-border raids, now there is the busy clatter of domestic rebuilding. From a few corners comes the glum note of wounds being licked. The last takeover of note was the Pounds 500m agreed bid by the Swedish insurance group SPP for London &amp; Edinburgh Trust in early April 1990. Five months later, in August, another Swedish company (the property group, Njordstjernan) held earnest bid talks with Speyhawk before aborting the deal and leaving the British group's shares to fall by a third. International commentators were not surprised by the abrupt withdrawal of the Swedes. They had only just been freed to invest abroad and had seized the opportunity perhaps over-enthusiastically. But the problems of Swedish companies as they faced up to over-gearing at a time of falling valuations, was to have echoes elsewhere, even among those seasoned internationalists, the Dutch. In 1988, fired with enthusiasm for the equity route into the UK property market where it had snapped up the niche operator, Haslemere, the Dutch property fund Rodamco made a Pounds 1.3bn bid for Hammerson, Britain's third-largest property group. It failed. Buttressed by Standard Life, its loyal 29 per cent shareholder, Hammerson saw the Dutch off with a sparkling earnings forecast and a tailor-made set of valuations nearly Pounds 2.50 a share higher than the offer price. That was in January 89. Before long, unfortunately, both parties were to wilt under the changed climate. Last year, Hammerson's performance visibly sagged, but 1991 was no happier for Rodamco. The decline in international property values, especially when translated into guilders, has forced Dutch property funds to abandon their buy-back guarantees to investors. Rodamco has also thought it prudent to find a protector in ABP, the Dutch government workers' pension fund, which has agreed to take a 12.5 per cent stake, and to discuss 'co-operation' - up to and including a merger - with PGGM, the joint local authorities fund. Under this overtly defensive strategy, however, most observers sense the Dutch fund repositioning itself for its next surge forward. The ABP deal would bulk out Rodamco's war chest by as much as Pounds 800m. A possible deal with PGGM would lead to it managing a further Pounds 1.5bn property portfolio in addition to more than Pounds 3bn of ABP's. Some think that Mr Cornelis van Rijn, Rodamco's chairman, might come again for Hammerson, this time having squared matters with Standard Life. Others think that the psychological barriers against revisiting defeat will lead him to look elsewhere in Europe. Rodamco's is not the only restructuring underway on the Dutch property scene. In January this year, another property fund, VastNed, absorbed its own international management arm - Compagnie Financiere du Benelux  - which provides property expertise for a number of groups, including the Luxembourg-based property fund, Immocorp. But the most interesting alternative to the Rodamco arrangements is the negotiation currently underway between Wereldhave, the property company which owns one of the middle-ranking British groups, Peachey, and VIB, a prominent Dutch insurer. Those who feel Rodamco's cuddling up to ABP excludes the ordinary investor hope the Wereldhave/VIB talks will lead to a full merger and a continuing stock market quotation. A meeting of minds between Wereldhave's entrepreneurs and the prudent insurers and actuaries of VIB is expected to take some time, however. Meanwhile the honour of reopening cross-border property takeovers may fall elsewhere. Mr Ray Jones, property analyst for Paribas Capital Markets, thinks the Spanish could be the first to make a move. At least two leading Spanish property groups have recently carried out capital raising exercises which would give them respectable fighting funds if they felt inclined to go on the offensive. Moreover Vallehermoso, the group which dominates the domestic markets, is thought to have been sniffing out potential targets in recent months. In France, which has also been conspicuously absent from cross-border takeovers, the boot seems to be on the other foot. There, property companies which had hitherto shunned the spotlight are now actively seeking international institutional investors. The ending of the near tax-free status of French property companies is the reason for the change of heart. If they must pay tax like other industries there is little attraction in keeping the shares within a tight family circle any more. A collection of passive shareholders from different countries could allow the founders to defend themselves against predators through a divide-and-rule policy. British institutions are the most likely takers. Although most have large direct property portfolios - both at home and abroad - they have learned from long experience of international property investment that it is rash to step off an aircraft in a foreign country with bundles of money to spend on buying buildings. The indirect route, through equity investment in local developers, remains an attractive alternative. Unfortunately, until it is clear that the worldwide property recession has bottomed out, would-be cross-border shareholders may continue to sit on their hands. A number of unit trusts specialising in pooled international property investment are thought to be on the launch pads. But they, too, are waiting - until the smaller pension funds are ready to open their cheque books once again. It will happen; the incentives for international diversification are strong and the need for alternatives to direct property holdings also pressing. According to the analysts the depression will not take long to vanish once it has begun to lift.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 25 February and 4  March.    Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 26 February reports that  the Baracoa Cacao Experimental Station has produced 2.5 million  hybrid cacao seeds over the past 3 years -- a feat that has  positive effects on Cuba's cacao situation. The seeds were  planted on 62 caballerias in Guantanamo and on smaller areas in  Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, and Granma Provinces. The station's  goal this year is to produce over 1 million such seeds. By using  these seeds, it is possible to have plants in 4 months, as  opposed to 1 year using another method, and the resulting plants  are much more productive, with higher yields and greater  resistance to diseases and pests. Some of the hybrid seeds that  will be produced by the experimental station this year will be  distributed to other provinces; in Guantanamo, they will be used  to plant 17 caballerias, replant another 79, and supply a  portion of the seedlings that will be necessary the following  year.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports that "the  first Cuban firm to specialize in tourism by road has just made  its official debut in Havana Province, under the name Tropitur."  The firm began operations on 16 October 1993 and intends, in a  first phase, to provide cafeteria and bar service and sell  flowers and souvenirs on two roads frequently traveled by  foreign tourists, the national highway and the Via Blanca, which  link important tourist hubs. Tropitur has four units: El Cayuelo  and Habana-Club in Santa Cruz del Norte, the Los Morales farm in  Nueva Paz, and the (Copei) in Madruga.    Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 28 February reports that the  nation's 1993 laboratory animal needs were fully met by the  National Center for the Production of Laboratory Animals,  located in Havana. Millions of dollars worth of imports were  thus avoided. "Because of the center's high productivity and  quality, it was also possible to export a number of animals to  Latin America, as well as to make all the concentrated feed for  the animals."    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 1 March reports that the sale  of  construction materials such as cement, ceramics, and marble  brought in $14 million in 1993; in this connection, the  Transportation Ministry made $3.5 million in transportation fees.    In the same newscast, Rebelde notes that Cubana de Aviacion  has received the first two of eight 44-passenger Dutch Fokker  planes Cuba has purchased from the Spanish company Aviaco.    Rebelde adds that Cuba's largest bicycle factory, currently  under construction in Santa Clara with PRC cooperation, will  begin operating in the second half of 1994. Half the factory  equipment is in Cuba, the remainder in the port of Shanghai  awaiting shipment. The factory will produce 150,000 bicycles a  year.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 March reports that Orlando  Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of Small  Farmers, ANAP, has stated in Havana that during 1993  approximately 2,000 people joined agricultural-livestock  cooperatives. This brings the number of people working in  cooperatives to 62,000 nationwide.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 March reports that El Cobre  mine workers plan to produce 1,300 tons of copper concentrate,  approximately 7 percent over 1993. The mine complex is  undergoing renovation and technological updating, and this is  already contributing to increased efficiency.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 4 March reports that the  Luxembourg Government today donated 18 tons of nails and 1,000  hammers to the victims of the heavy rains that affected the  eastern provinces. The Luxembourg envoy to Havana handed over  the donation to Carlos Morales, representative of the State  Committee for Economic Cooperation. This is the result of the UN  humanitarian aid program, which submitted the request to the  Luxembourg Government. Luxembourg also donated medicines worth  $68,000 for the Calixto Garcia and the Pediatric Hospitals in  Havana.</p>

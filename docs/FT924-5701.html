			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Peru in talks with US banks PERU has taken an important step towards settling a series of US lawsuits filed by international bank creditors more than two years ago, paving the way for restructuring about Dollars 10bn of outstanding external debt and interest, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The lawsuits, launched by more than 200 banks, and seeking to recover more than Dollars 2bn of debts, were filed to meet a US statute of limitations deadline. ***** Citibank, which chairs Peru's debt advisory committee, this week announced an agreement under which the banks would withdraw their lawsuits if the Peruvian government dropped its concerns about the statute of limitations on legal claims by the creditor banks. Both sides said they would try to resolve the dispute by next April 15. ***** The Walt Disney Company, the entertainment group, and Nestle, the Swiss-based foods company, are to enter a long-term alliance for licensing, sponsorship and marketing purposes. The new accord, which marks the latest development in an expanding international partnership, calls for Nestle to sponsor a pavillion at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida as well as a sponsor at Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney World Resort. ***** Upjohn, the US drugs group, said it was informed by the US Food and Drug Administration that after a year-long probe, the agency has determined that no further action is warranted regarding the Upjohn drug Halcion, Reuter reports.</p>

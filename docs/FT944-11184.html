			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Swedish leaders plead EU cause: Growing fear of No vote galvanises the pro-membership camp Sweden's senior political leaders yesterday moved to bolster faltering support for joining the European Union, sounding an anxious chorus of warnings about the serious economic consequences facing the country if it rejects membership in a referendum next Sunday. A series of opinion polls suggesting a swing towards the anti-EU campaign alarmed Stockholm's financial markets, weakening the krona, knocking more than 1 per cent off share values on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and pushing up yields on five-year government bonds to more than 11 per cent. This further widened the premium paid on Swedish debt compared with most of its European competitors. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, his top ministers and opposition leaders said worse would follow if the outcome on Sunday was a No vote, with damaging effects on the country's effort to control its big budget deficit and fast-growing state debt. Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister, said he would have to add to the SKr51bn (Pounds 4.3bn) package of tax increases and spending cuts he announced last week. 'With a No, I would be forced to go back to the Riksdag (parliament) this month with proposals for further financial measures - this is undeniable,' Mr Persson said. Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative former prime minister ousted by the Social Democrats in September's general election, said the prospect of a No vote was 'deadly serious'. 'The No side now owe citizens an answer on how they consider the dangerous and damaging interest rate consequences of their policy would be managed,' he said. Most of the latest opinion polls have given the No side only a marginal lead at best. But what has worried the Yes camp is an apparent break in a trend of growing support for membership which followed the general election. Pro-EU campaigners, trying to steady their nerves, point out that opinion polls in Austria also lurched towards the No campaign shortly before the referendum there on EU membership in June, but the result was a hefty majority in favour of more than 66 per cent. The latest polls have galvanised the Yes campaign. With the full weight of the political and industrial establishment now uniting for a Yes vote - and many voters still undecided - a Yes is still quite possible. However, anti-EU feeling has always been far more deeply entrenched in Sweden than it was in Austria, with all polls in the two years until late summer showing a lead for the No camp. A No vote in Sweden, the biggest of the three Nordic applicants, would be a serious snub to the European Union. It would almost certainly presage a rejection of membership in Norway, which votes on November 28. That would leave only Austria and Finland of the four European Free Trade Area countries which have negotiated entry terms set to come in. Even in Finland a small doubt has crept in following the postponement on Sunday of parliamentary ratification of last month's referendum approval until after Sweden has voted. Finnish EU opponents are hoping that a No vote in Sweden might win over enough MPs to form the necessary one third minority needed to block ratification - although most observers doubt their chances. In Sweden, there is concern among Yes campaigners that they may have miscalculated their tactics by being too defensive and unfocused, running, for example, posters proclaiming 'It is more fun to say Yes', or showing stereotyped citizens of EU countries saying 'Welcome Sweden'. This allowed the No side, dominated by the left and environmentalists, to seize the initiative by playing on fears that EU membership would erode the country's democratic traditions, neutrality and its 'Swedish model' welfare system. Mr Bildt and his supporters are critical of Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, for deliberately adopting a low-key pro-EU campaign in which the new government has not adopted an official pro-Union position. Mr Carlsson was wary of mounting a strident campaign for fear of alienating many Social Democrats who are sceptical about or hostile to the EU. Instead, he appointed two prominent anti-Union campaigners to his cabinet and allowed anti-EU Social Democrats to run their own party-financed campaign. Critics say this has made the task of winning over opinion within the ranks of the party, by far the country's largest political organisation, much more difficult. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Partnership and Cooperation </F> Agreement With Ukraine Initialled"; as released by Brussels  Textline database]    [Excerpt] Sir Leon Brittan and Hans van den Broek (for the  European Commission), Ukraine Foreign Minister Mr. Zlenko and a  representative of the Greek Council Presidency initialled the  EC/Ukraine partnership and cooperation agreement on Wednesday  [23 March] in Brussels.    Negotiations for the agreement were concluded last Friday.  No date has been set yet for the signature, after which  ratification procedures may begin in the twelve EU Member States  and the Ukraine. External political relations Commissioner van  den Broek told the press of the "extreme importance" the EU  attaches to this agreement, not only because it enables the two  parties to "institutionalize" and "intensify cooperation in many  areas," but also because it is the first accord of this type  concluded with one of the republics of the former USSR. Sir  Leon Brittan, Commissioner for external economic relations,  called it a "historic" event opening a new era in relations  between the Union and Ukraine, notably because the partnership  agreement establishes as an objective the creation "at some  future date" of a free-trade area. "We will see if this is  possible in 1998," said Sir Leon Brittan, adding that the  "success of the agreement" will also depend on the progress and  results of economic reforms underway in Ukraine. Despite myriad  problems, this country "has not hesitated to pursue its reforms"  and, of all the republics of the ex-Soviet Union, is today one  of the most sound economically and politically. The agreement  establishes facilities in a multitude of sectors: trade (Sir  Leon mentioned steel, textiles and coal), investment, capital  movements, copyright and so on, in the interest of both parties.  The Commissioner also recalled that the accord contains a  most-favoured-nation clause, under which the Union will treat  Ukraine on an equal footing with its other GATT partners. Now  that the accord exists, it will have to be implemented and given  tangible effect, concluded the Commissioner. Ukraine Foreign  Minister Mr. Zlenko (who spoke not only in his own language, but  also in English and French) welcomed "this important step,"  saying it marks progress towards his country's future accession  to the European Union, one of Ukraine's top priorities. "For  the future, our dream and our goal is to join the European  Union," insisted Mr. Zlenko (though Sir Leon noted that there is  no reference to such a goal in the agreement). As to his  country's reaction to the fact that, in the accord, Ukraine is  not considered to be an economy in transition to a market  economy (while the EU considers Russia to be a transition  economy), the Minister commented that independently of the EU's  assessment, "Ukraine is in a transitional period and it is  unimportant whether this is stated or not. Reforms are underway  for building a market economy and we will bring them to a  successful conclusion," he said. Asked about the matter of the  so-called referendum in Crimea (planned for next Sunday, but  cancelled by the Ukraine government), Mr. Zlenko insisted on the  "purely internal" nature of this matter and recalled that his  government considers such a referendum unconstitutional. Hans  van den Broek recalled, for his part, that respect for Ukraine's  territorial integrity is an important principle for the European  Union and has been incorporated into the agreement.

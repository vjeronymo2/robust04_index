			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: Sponsors of the arts should be given credit for their role Sir, Mr Massil's letter (February 8) on business sponsorship of the arts shows he has no understanding not only of arts sponsorship, but also of arts funding. No government has funded the arts to everyone's satisfaction. As Mr Massil knows, there were sponsors in ancient Greece, though his comments on sponsorship of the Parthenon make no sense. Business has no moral or legal obligation to fund the arts. Sponsorship is a business deal, a transaction where both sides benefit. If the media steadfastly refuses to credit sponsors then the business rationale within a company becomes increasingly difficult. No sponsor is asking for its logo to be emblazoned across Frances Barber's bosom in the National Theatre's Night of the Iguana. Data General is seeking recognition for its sponsorship of this wonderful new production - are the four words 'sponsored by Data General' too much to ask? Fortunately not, in the FT at least, though other newspapers have been slower in following this lead. ABSA stresses that sponsorship should be a supplement to, never a substitute for, government support. Business is a partner with government, central and local. Sponsors, by bringing their guests to 'hospitality rooms' and then a performance, are increasing the potential audiences to the arts. Hostility towards business is an example of ignorant prejudice. The arts need the support of business - let us encourage more money from the private sector, not less.

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Clarke nudges UK base rate The half a percentage point cut in the UK base rate of interest announced yesterday is a bit of a disappointment. It is disappointing not so much in itself, as for what it suggests about the prospective balance of fiscal and monetary policy. If next week's fiscal adjustment were of comparably modest proportions, the chancellor would have failed to achieve the necessary rebalancing of UK macroeconomic policy. A country with a floating exchange rate can at least correct monetary policy mistakes relatively easily. Fiscal mistakes are another matter. If this opportunity for a decisive rebalancing were to be lost, it may prove difficult to correct the error before the next election. By then, it could well be too late. When Mr Clarke states that the base rate cut takes 'full account of the overall stance of the Budget', he would seem to be making two points: first and most obviously, that no further cuts can be expected at the time of the Budget; second and more speculatively, that the Budget will contain only a modest further fiscal tightening. That the Bank of England has been allowed to determine the timing of the decision is not all that important. It is intended to reinforce credibility by divorcing the timing of changes from any specific political event or particular economic indicator. This is sensible. But Mr Clarke remains the organ grinder. Yesterday's cut is the first one of just half a point since May 1992, which suggests that the exceptional period of large cuts that followed sterling's exit from the ERM is now over. Small frequent changes are indeed a sensible way of adapting to modest changes in circumstances. Small, infrequent changes are another matter. Lower inflation This is, after all, the first interest rate cut in 10 months. Yet that period has seen encouraging progress on inflation, particularly in view of the devaluation. It has also seen a marked downward adjustment in expectations of inflation. At the same time, recovery has proceeded at a modest pace, if faster than the Treasury expected last March. If this performance justifies no more than a half point cut in base rate, the government does indeed seem determined to lower inflation towards the middle of its 1-4 per cent target range. The top end is, it appears, not low enough. The aim is defensible. The UK has after all paid a high price to get inflation down. But pursuit of the aim in this way is risky. One danger is that fiscal tightening may become still more necessary, since slow recovery would of itself entail a correspondingly modest improvement in the fiscal position. The worry is that no more than a modest improvement from what is the UK's biggest ever inflation-adjusted deficit in peace time may undermine the credibility of the government's low inflation objective. This would increase the chances of an economically depressing rise in long-term nominal interest rates. Monetary easing The possibility that a modest monetary easing may, in the end, necessitate a larger fiscal adjustment than a sharp one is only one danger. Also problematic is the UK's external position. It is possible to take a purist position on the fact that the UK is running a current account deficit while output is still well below potential. But the purist position depends on the implausible assumption that resources can be shifted smoothly and easily into the production of tradeable goods and services. All the evidence on the performance of the UK economy over the long term suggests this is not true. It takes a long time before changes in profitability lead to increased investment in industries exposed to the pressures of external competition. This makes it still more desirable that the fiscal and monetary policy mix be consistent with securing sustained profitability. The UK's economic position today offers an invaluable opportunity to secure that aim, alongside low inflation. A large fiscal adjustment offset by further reductions in base rates would be the best policy. True, it would risk a short-term spike in headline inflation. But it would also rebalance the economy and reduce the risks posed by the fiscal deficit. Boldness is sometimes safer than the comfortable alternative of 'steady as she goes'. This is such a time.</p>

For 1989, net income jumped 59% from 1988 to a  record $267 million, principally because of a $193-million gain on the sale of  its cable television system. Revenue totaled $1.8 billion, up 4%. The results  were attributed to regional economic weakness and previously disclosed charges  involving its forest products investment, costs of voluntary staffing  reductions at the Times, costs associated with its recent acquisitions of  McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines and a legal settlement  with independent home delivery dealers.  </P> <P> Tables, D8  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Wellcome launches employee share plan WELLCOME, the drugs group, has launched an employee share option plan which, it claims, will be one of the most ambitious international schemes ever mounted. Employees in 26 countries will be given options to buy 500 shares in Wellcome at 772p a share. That compares with a price of 800p at which the Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, sold 270m shares this week. Employees can exercise their options between three and 10 years from now. The plan applies to about 15,000 of Wellcome's total of 18,500 employees. Companies setting up international schemes have usually opened them only to senior executives. Wellcome's innovation lies in making the scheme tax-efficient to employees in different tax regimes. In the UK, the options are being granted under the 1984 Finance Act, making them income-tax-free. There are some countries where it has proved impracticable to launch the offer, but the company says it is exploring other methods in those places. An employee share option trust has acquired 400,000 shares. If the options are exercised in full, the company will have to issue about 7.5m shares, worth about Pounds 58m.</p>

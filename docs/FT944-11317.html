			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Observer: Ploughshares While hapless broadcasters at the BBC's central and east European language services (mostly anti-communist emigres) in London's Bush House are wondering how much longer they might have jobs - the end of the cold war substantially eroding their raison d'etre - the corporation is gladly reaping peace dividends where it can. Bonuses are springing up in the oddest places. Audio tapes of a World Service Radio history of the cold war - The World That Came in from the Cold  -and 50,000 copies of an accompanying book have now been adopted as teaching materials in 2,400 Slovak secondary schools. Now that the Tory government seems to be running out of steam with the mammoth privatisations of yesteryear, surely this creative approach from the BBC might fruitfully be explored in other fields of government activity? A further sword-into-ploughshare idea might be to send out to former communist states the 500 GCHQ intelligence-gatherers the UK government now plans to sack; they could surely find work as itinerant professors, from Tirana to Bialystock? Hmm. Probably unsound, on reflection - they might start spreading ugly notions about industrial action.</p>

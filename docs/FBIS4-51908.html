			<p>BFN     [Text] The ROK Government has begun to make efforts in  earnest to obtain votes to become a nonpermanent member of the  UN Security Council. Toward this end, the government has sent  or will send presidential envoys to Africa, the Middle East, and  Central and South America.    The government has sent No Yong-chan, Foreign Ministry  ambassador-at-large, to a UN African Economic Committee meeting  scheduled from 2 to 5 May. In the capacity of a ROK  presidential envoy, he will deliver a keynote speech and call on  participants to support the ROK's bid to become a nonpermanent  member of the UN Security Council.    Ambassador No will later visit Nigeria and Zaire, major  players in Africa.    The government will also send a presidential envoy to a UN  Asian Economic and Social Committee meeting that will open on 27  May in Jordan. He will carry out activities to gain support for  ROK's bid for a UN Security Council seat from Middle East  countries.    The government will also send Vice Foreign Minister Hong  Sun-yong and First Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin to  Central and South America to visit five to six countries to  attract votes.    A government official concerned said: "A country should get  two- thirds of votes at the UN General Assembly to become a  nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council." He added: "We  must try to win votes from countries in Africa, the Middle East,  and Central and South America, where there are many UN members."    In the meantime, the government officially notified the UN  Secretariat last February that it would run for a UN Security  Council seat for the 1996-97 period.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Carson Pirie Stock Rises on Bid: Shares of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. shot  higher after a Swiss-owned retailing company based in Milwaukee launched a  $280-million buyout for the Chicago-based department store chain. Carson Pirie,  struggling with an attempt to rebound from financial setbacks in recent years,  responded coolly to the $20-a-share bid from P. A. Bergner &amp; Co. But Wall  Street warmed to the idea that the long-rumored takeover target had finally  received some interest, pushing its stock to a $7.625 gain at $21.50. Carson  said it was "not for sale" but that its board would consider the Bergner offer  "in due course." Bergner has 31 department stores in Illinois and Wisconsin;  Carson Pirie has 33 department stores in Chicago and Minnesota and owns County  Seat casual wear stores.  </P></p>

ELNs may provide for periodic interest payments to holders based on fixed or floating rates, or they may be structured as ``zero coupon'' instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  ELNs may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved the listing and trading of ELNs on May 20, 1993. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32343 (May 20, 1993), 58 FR 30833 (``Exchange Act Release No. 32343''). The Commission subsequently approved an amendment to the listing standards for ELNs to provide for alternative capitalization and trading volume requirements for the underlying security. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has agreed to notify the Commission if an issuer of ELNs intends to provide for periodic interest payments to holders based on a floating interest rate.

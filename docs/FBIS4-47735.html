			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Although the Liberian Transitional Government is  finally in place, and the slow process of demobilization is  under way, the problems of Liberia are far from over. For  weeks, bitter fighting has been going on between Krahn and  Mandingo factions within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia]. There have also been clashes between the  Liberian Peace Council and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia]. And reports are now emerging of  fresh incidents involving what appears to be groups of  indisciplined NPFL fighters, impatient at the long delays in the  demobilization process. (Jonathan Payleily) has been traveling  around the Nimba County in north-eastern Liberia and he telexed  us this report from the NPFL capital, Gbarnga:    In one incident two weeks ago, a group of 15 heavily-armed  men, under the command of an NPFL general, entered Zaou, a  township 15 miles north of Ganta, at night. According to  eyewitnesses, they held residents, including pregnant women, at  gunpoint, then they beat them and stole their money, cattle, and  a large quantity of rice. The NPFL commander who headed the  group was said to be taking revenge for a relative who was  involved in a local property dispute.    While visiting the area last week, I spoke to a victim of  the  assault, an elderly man who told me he was flogged, tortured,  and detained for one week in the town of Sakripie, where the  soldiers are said to have come from. NPFL soldiers in Ganta  told me that the commander of the raiding team was later  arrested by NPFL forces and is now under investigation.    In another district, Tapeta, 53 miles north of Ganta,  harassment cases are being brought every day before the district  commissioner. In an incident two weeks ago, armed soldiers went  into a nearby village, firing into the air and taking people's  belongings as they fled away.</p>

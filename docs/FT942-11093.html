			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Go-ahead likely soon for Channel 5 A government go-ahead within the next few weeks for a new television channel for the UK looks increasingly likely, Raymond Snoddy writes. The Independent Television Commission hopes to be able to take the decision on Channel 5 at its meeting on May 16. The government is pursuing what it sees as the ideal solution - setting up Channel 5 using existing analogue technology without prejudicing in any significant way the future of digital television. Following a ministerial meeting last week, the Radio Regulatory Agency has been asked to carry out further work to ensure that this is practicable. The agency is being helped by NTL, the privatised former transmission and engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority. It is believed NTL will report that a middle way is possible, although compromises may be needed. Three potential bidders have declared an interest in Channel 5 - NBC, the US network, Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and a consortium linking Time Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.</p>

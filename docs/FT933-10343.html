			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MG denies being caught in a tight LME copper market METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals group, yesterday vehemently denied rumours that, along with some of its big customers, it was on the wrong end of the squeeze in the London Metal Exchange's copper market. 'It is wrong to assume that MG or its customers can be squeezed,' said an official. Although two customers and one MG company had sold copper short (sold in the expectation that the price would fall) 'every ounce short has been delivered or will be delivered', the company said. Nevertheless, MG has urged clients to be cautious because of a possibility that the squeeze might become tighter in October. Conditions in the copper market have twice led the LME board to give a warning that it would take any action necessary to maintain order. The MG official suggested that the latest warning could be interpreted as a message about not selling copper short unless able to deliver. The extreme technical tightness in the market has eased only slightly since the latest LME warning last week. Yesterday the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) slipped to Dollars 9 a tonne compared with Dollars 17 last week. Analysts suggested the drop was likely to be related to options declarations today. Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, deputy general manager of Sumitomo Corporation's non-ferrous metals department, said earlier this week that, contrary to any market rumours, no organisation was manipulating the copper market to drive prices upward. He pointed to the steep fall in prices in May and suggested that many market participants had been building big short positions during the past few months. Recent covering of those short positions had pushed up prices, he said. Other traders suggested that North American copper producers had sold short but were well able to cope with any squeeze - which might not be the case for organisations that granted options during the copper price collapse in May. In spite of the battering some trading houses suffered then, when the copper price fell by 25 per cent in five weeks, and any punishment that might be suffered from the coming squeeze, there have been no suggestions of LME traders facing financial difficulties of a kind which might have an impact on the exchange. Mr David King, chief executive, said that 'the market is deeper, more liquid, more professional and has many more checks and balances' than it had 10 years ago.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------ (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium  +12,650 to 1,961,450 Copper      +1,075 to   464,325 Lead        +1,050 to   273,550 Nickel        +228 to   101,796 Zinc        +1,350 to   716,650 Tin            -10 to    20,905  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: REJECTIONS JUST KEPT ROLLING IN UNTIL . . . ;  </P> <P> AUTHOR NOREEN AYRES' LUCK CHANGED RADICALLY WHEN SHE ATTENDED A WRITERS  CONFERENCE AT SQUAW VALLEY -- AND SHE HAD ALMOST STAYED HOME.  </P> <P> Writer Noreen Ayres hadn't had much luck finding a literary agent. After all,  36 of them passed on the chance to take on her first novel.  </P> <P> But Ayres' luck changed dramatically after she began writing a new novel and  attended the Squaw Valley Writers Conference in August.  </P> <P> She not only met an agent from the William Morris Agency, but the agent loved  the first 30 pages of Ayres' new novel so much that he agreed to represent her  on the spot.  </P> <P> The result: Ayres' Orange County-set suspense mystery, tentatively titled "A  World the Color of Salt," has just been sold to William Morrow &amp; Co. for a  "six-figure advance." And the novel -- about a forensic scientist, an ex-cop,  ex-stripper named Smokey Brandon, working in the Orange County Sheriff's  Department crime lab -- is only half completed.  </P> <P> "I really feel lucky," said Ayres, 50, a former technical writer who began  writing fiction five years ago. "Actually, I feel lucky just getting the agent  and everything after that is anticlimactic."  </P> <P> Although most writers go to Squaw Valley with hopes of making valuable contacts  among the editors and agents who lead workshops during the weeklong conference,  Ayres said she went "with very low expectations."  </P> <P> "In fact, I almost didn't go," she said. "It's hot up there, and I couldn't  afford it. I guess I went thinking the best I could do would be to get some  current feedback on my work. But I really walked off with three prizes."  </P> <P> She said she not only met Michael Carlisle, a vice president of the William  Morris Agency ("He doesn't even take on clients of his own any more") but also  Doug Stumpf, who would become her editor at William Morrow.  </P> <P> "He conducted a workshop where my stuff was critiqued. He told me he was  extremely interested and wanted to see the rest of it," she said. (Stumpf was  Long Beach novelist Robert Ferrigno's editor on "The Horse Latitudes," also set  in Orange County.)  </P> <P> Ayres' "third prize" was meeting a movie producer who also expressed interest  in her novel. But, she said, "we're not pursuing the movie thing right now."  </P> <P> For Ayres, it was all too good to be true.  </P> <P> "I first went into this depression, thinking, 'This can't be happening.' You'd  think I would be walking on air. But I kept thinking of Robert Duvall's line in  'Tender Mercies': 'I don't trust happiness; I never have and I never will.'  </P> <P> "To me the biggest thing was getting an agent. It's so hard to get an agent."  </P> <P> Ayres knows that all too well.  </P> <P> Her unpublished first novel, "South of Midnight," is a mystery set in Pasadena.  The 36 agents Ayres sent it to told her they liked the writing but didn't like  the story.  </P> <P> At her lowest point, Ayres said, she sent her 30 sample pages to one agent "I  had my heart set on. But before I even got to let him read it, I talked to his  answering machine and said, 'I know this is terrible thing for a writer to do,  but I just want to tell you I think what I've given you is dreck and you  shouldn't even read it.' "  </P> <P> And, she said, "this was after (former Irvine mystery writer-writing  instructor) Bob Ray went out of his way to introduce me to this man."  </P> <P> Ayres remembers "sitting in the dark with tears rolling down my face, thinking  what a fool I am. What more self-defeating thing could a writer do?  </P> <P> "I guess the whole thing is indicative of the roller coaster of emotions all  artists have. Some artists have this wonderful, pinnacle ego, but I think most  of us go through these peaks and valleys of doubt and confidence."  </P> <P> Ayres, who is a member of Fictionaires, the elite Orange County writers  workshop group, gave up trying to sell her Pasadena mystery five months ago.  But by then she had already started to work on her Orange County mystery.  </P> <P> "I think you have to move on, you have to start a new thing that you can get  excited about," said Ayres, who is writing six hours a day to meet the novel's  January delivery date to her publisher.  </P> <P> Ayres recalled driving home from her first forensic science class at UC Irvine,  which she was taking for background information, when the startling first line  of the new novel came to her: "First they shot him in the mouth."  </P> <P> Recalled Ayres: "When this first line came to me, I knew I was going to sell  it."  </P> <P> Book Signings: KUSC radio host Jim Svejda ("The Record Shelf Guide to the  Classical Repertoire") will sign from 2 to 4 p.m. Saturday at Rizzoli  International Bookstore in South Coast Plaza. . . .

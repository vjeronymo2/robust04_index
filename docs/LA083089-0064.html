			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Live snakes sent to video rental shop owners in London to promote a horror film  will be retrieved and the stunt will be canceled because of public outcry, the  organizers said Tuesday. Cinema International Corp., which began sending out  700 Chinese rat snakes to shops nationwide last week as part of a promotional  package for the video release of the film "The Serpent and the Rainbow," said  it was worried about the nonpoisonous reptiles. "We were worried that all this  unwarranted attention could get the public overly interested in the snakes, and  result in them coming to harm," said Paul Brett, the company's marketing  manager. "We thought the best thing to do was to take them back." The Royal  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had a different view on what  might cause the snakes harm. It pointed out that directions accompanying the  snakes had incorrectly said they didn't need to be fed during what Cinema  International planned as the snakes' monthlong stay in the shops. But an RSPCA  spokeswoman said Tuesday it welcomed the end of the promotion, adding  "obviously CIC has seen the error of its ways, and we're very pleased about  that."ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

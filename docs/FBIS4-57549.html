			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of draft letter of intent addressed to IMF Executive </F> Director Michel Camdessus and released by the presidential Press  Secretariat on 8 May]    [Text] 1. This letter explains the Peruvian Government's  economic policy for 1994 within the context of the Extended Fund  Facility that was approved by the executive board on 18 March  1993. The development of the economy in 1993 was in general much  better than was expected in the program's projections. It is  estimated that the real GDP has increased by 7 percent, double  what was estimated in the program's objectives, while net  international reserves increased to approximately $265 million  when compared with the program's goal of $195 million. Fiscal  and monetary discipline has permitted a reduction in inflation  from 57 percent in 1992 to 39.5 percent in 1993, and to a rate  of 27 percent per annum during the second half of 1993. All the  program's goals to December 1993 have been complied with, with  the exception of the accumulation of delays with official  creditors that was canceled on or around 9 February 1994.    2. The 1994 economic program has the intention of continuing  with the reduction of inflation to between 15 and 20 percent,  and of increasing the Central Bank's net international reserves  by $151 million within the context of a real growth in the GDP  of between 4 and 5 percent. The government will increase  structural reforms in order to improve efficiency and increase  national savings by providing the base for a sustained growth  and for the viability of the balance of payments. In order to  complement these internal efforts, the Peruvian Government will  ask its creditors for a reduction in the balance of the foreign  debt and its servicing in such a way that it will be viable with  foreign accounts. The government will intensify its efforts to  reduce poverty, improve the health, education, and other  services of the population, and its efforts to consolidate the  country's pacification, which is essential for the program's  success.    3. In order to achieve these objectives, the public sector's  primary surplus (prior to the income from privatizations) will  in 1994 be increased to 0.6 percent of the GDP (up from 0.1  percent in 1993), which represents a significant advance that  will help in covering the cash interest payments after the debt  has been reduced. The public sector's consolidated deficit will  be maintained at under 2.3 percent of the GDP, and will be fully  financed with external resources. Efforts will be increased to  increment tax income to finance the programmed expansion of  public investment, social programs, and national security.    4. The government plans to achieve an increase in its  current  income from 10.5 percent of the GDP in 1993 (11.4 percent in the  fourth quarter of 1993) to 12.1 percent in 1994. Any lack of  achievement in this respect will be made up with additional tax  measures. It is hoped that the tax reform that was implemented  in December 1993 will bring in additional income equivalent to  0.4 percent of the 1994 GDP; it also expands the tax base and  simplifies the tax system; and it is hoped that it will give  continuity to the 1992 tax reform. The government will continue  to expand the tax base. In will require an overall adjustment  for inflation in order to estimate the value of assets that are  subject to the minimum income tax of enterprises and for the  payment of income tax in 1994. No new tax stability contracts  will be signed that grant specific tax benefits to enterprises.  The government will motivate voluntary resolutions of the  contracts that were signed in the past. The government will not  create new free trade zones.    5. Within the context of deregulation measures aimed at  promoting privatization, the prices set in November 1993 for oil  by-products at the refinery (Petroperu) [State Petroleum Agency]  were comparable to international prices, while the prices for  consumers were deregulated. Payment of royalties by Petroperu  and by private contractors, as well as the special rate paid by  Petroperu to the Public Treasury--that is, 7.5 percent of its  domestic sales--will be maintained at least until the end of  1994. These changes are expected to generate additional revenues  that will account for approximately 0.4 percent of the GDP in  1994. Other utility rates will continue to be adjusted pursuant  to the established target rates in their specific regulatory  systems.    6. Revenues will also increase as a result of improvements  in  the area of tax administration (Sunat) [National Tax  Administration Superintendency], especially through new control  systems implemented this year that include: a) a system of  collecting taxes through banks; b) a roster of taxpayers (RUC)  [Centralized Taxpayer Registry]; c) a system of control of the  use of credit resulting from the General Sales Tax (IGV) by  exporters; d) a system of cross-checking tax information  concerning individual companies, their main suppliers and  purchases, and their import statements; and e) an expansion of  the system designed to verify compliance with their tax payments  by the 7,000 leading taxpayers. The simplification of the tax  system implemented in December 1993 will also contribute to  improving efficiency in collecting revenues, including the new  system of fixed payments that are not entitled to fiscal credit  (RUS) [Simplified Tax System] [Regimen Unico Simplificado],  which replaces the IGV and income tax, which will incorporate a  large number of small taxpayers. With IMF technical assistance,  Sunat has developed a plan to strengthen auditing and monitoring  mechanisms and has completed an evaluation on evasion of IGV  payments. Sunat will implement the revised version of the Tax  Code that was promulgated in December 1993, which markedly  increases its auditing powers and further simplifies  administrative procedures. The revised Tax Code also strengthens  the Fiscal Tribunal. Sunat will provide funds to improve the  tribunal's operations. There will be two chambers specialized in  hearing tax lawsuits, and it has been established that the  Economy and Finance Ministry will be able to increase the number  of these chambers, if necessary.    7. During 1994 the National Customs Superintendency will  continue with its personnel training program and will extend its  automated system to all of its offices nationwide. New  legislation will be submitted to Congress during the first half  of 1994 to fight smuggling more intensively, by meting out  stiffer sanctions and by investing Customs with greater powers  to deal with criminal cases in direct coordination with Sunat.  Like the Fiscal Tribunal, the Customs Tribunal will consist of  six chambers, though this number could be even higher.    8. The fiscal program incorporates the use of $250 million,  in cash revenues from the privatizations to be undertaken in  1994, to supplement current revenues in order to finance social  investments and the government's structural reforms. Moreover,  up to one-fourth of proceeds from privatizations that exceed the  aforementioned amount can be earmarked--with the help of the  World Bank and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank]--for  projects having a high social rate of return, especially in the  construction industry, highway maintenance, and infrastructure  in rural areas. The ceiling for these endeavors is $626 million.  The remaining amount will be deposited in a Treasury account at  the Central Reserve Bank. Funds from this account may be used  for paying debts that pay a high interest rate, or to prefinance  loan disbursements for projects approved by the World Bank or  the IDB with agreement to reimburse. The government pledges to  follow the programs closely to ensure that their objectives of  stabilization and growth are met.    9. Total expenditures by the nonfinancial public sector  (excluding interest payments) will rise from 10.8 percent of GDP  in 1993 to 11.8 percent in 1994. The expansion of capital  outlay--which will lay stress on infrastructure development,  social programs, and structural reforms--accounts for most of  the increase. Expenditures from the social emergency scheme  (including outlay by the National Compensation and Social  Development Fund, Foncodes) will increase from 0.6 percent of  GDP in 1993 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 1994. This program,  together with other expenditures in social programs amounting to  approximately 3 percent of GDP, will especially target the  following areas: nutrition, primary health care programs, and  education, to alleviate poverty in rural areas and in those  areas that have been hardest hit by terrorism and drug  trafficking. The central government's payroll and spending on  defense are expected to increase at a faster pace than GDP  because of salary arrears going back to 1993; readjustment of  civil servants' salaries, which are still low compared to those  in the private sector; and expenses in the ongoing effort to  consolidate the pacification of the country, to rout terrorism,  and to combat drug trafficking.    10. The Central Reserve Bank will continue to make every  endeavor to meet the program's targets concerning inflation and  the balance of payments. During 1994, the Central Bank's net  domestic assets will remain unchanged, and there will be no net  domestic credit to the overall nonfinancial public sector. The  Central Bank's net international reserves will increase by some  $151 million. The fiscal deficit will be eliminated thanks to  the reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements  in foreign exchange in November 1993 and fresh revenues stemming  from Treasury interests on the capitalization of the Central  Bank in May 1994. The Central Bank will try not to reduce  minimum reserve requirements in domestic currency, and will  grant discounts only in cases of transitory liquidity problems.  The growth of the monetary base will be limited to 20 percent  this year.    11. During 1994, the government will continue to implement a  floating exchange rate policy. It is estimated that the recent  reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements in  foreign currency, together with the programmed fiscal position,  will reduce capital flows and ease off pressure on the  appreciation of the currency in 1994. The Central Bank will  follow developments in the exchange market very closely, and if  circumstances make it necessary to step up foreign  competitiveness, the government will be willing to effect a  greater fiscal adjustment than the one envisaged in the fiscal  program.    12. The 1994 program is fully financed, taking into account  the debt relief by the Paris Club in May 1993 and the payment  postponement of debt obligations to other creditors. Peru has  reached bilateral agreements with most of its creditors listed  in the minutes of the agreement with the Paris Club in May 1993,  and will seek to soon end negotiations with the remaining  creditors. Peru has started negotiations with the commercial  banking sector, and it is hoped that these negotiations will end  in a voluntary reduction of the debt and the servicing of the  debt by late 1994 or early 1995. Agreements to reschedule the  debt have been reached with certain creditors, and in 1994 Peru  will start contacts with other private and bilateral creditors  that do not belong to the Paris Club, with the purpose of  exploiting other ways to normalize financial relations. The  government hopes that the possible agreements with the  commercial banking sector and other creditors will significantly  contribute to settling Peru's balance of payments and its fiscal  creditworthiness. Peru's high debt ratio compared to its GDP,  and the exceptionally high amount of interest in arrears, will  have to be taken into account for these agreements. Within the  context of the privatization of public enterprises, and as part  of a strategy regarding the amount of the debt and its  servicing, the government has included a scheme for converting  the debt into investments, allowing all its creditors to use  debt notes for this purpose. In order to continue improving the  Peruvian foreign debt, the program limits the medium- and  long-term foreign public debt (which is different from the debt  with multilateral organizations and that contracted in the form  of concessions) contracted in 1994 to $300 million, and the  increase in the short term debt to $25 million. No delays in  payment to international financial institutions nor to the Paris  Club creditors are expected.    13. During 1994 and early 1995, the remaining public  enterprises, of various sectors of the economy, will be  privatized. The Cerro Verde mining company and the  telecommunication companies (CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company]  and Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise]) were sold in  early 1994, and the other mining company (Centromin [Central  Peru Mining Enterprise]) will be put up for sale around May.  There are plans to put a commercial bank (Interbanc) up for sale  by June 1994. Moreover, during the second half of 1994 the  Peruvian Government will offer for sale 60 percent of the  Electro-Lima [Peruvian State Electric Power Enterprise-Lima]  generating and distribution network, the Minero-Peru [Peruvian  State Mining Enterprise] refinery in Cajamarquilla, part of  Petro-Peru [State Petroleum Agency], and part of the fishing  company Pesca-Peru [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production  Agency]. As is stated in Paragraph 12, in February 1994 the  government issued regulations on the use of the mechanism to  convert the debt into investments in the case of the  privatization process. The use of this debt conversion system  will be allowed in specific cases when the privatization process  faces greater difficulties.    14. Through the application of the new Banks Law promulgated  in October 1993, in 1994 the National Superintendency of Banks  and Insurance Companies (SBS) will continue to enhance sound  regulations by intensifying the inspection of banks, seeking a  policy that will handle the problem of dubious bank assets, and  promoting the capitalization of the financial system. By late  1994 all provisions for bad credits and credits that lack  guarantees will be required. A special SBS unit will place all  risk debtors at the same level. The SBS will also focus all its  efforts on improving the handling of information and its human  resources with technical assistance from the IDB.    15. The government promulgated a new statute for the Bank of  the Nation in January 1994, and its restructuring is expected to  conclude around September 1994, in accordance with the  guidelines recently agreed upon with the World Bank. As the  agent of the Treasury, bank operations will be restricted to the  management of public accounts, and will not include commercial  operations with the private sector or interbanking operations.  The Popular Bank branch in Bolivia was privatized in November  1994 [as published] and the liquidation of the Popular Bank is  expected to be completed in December 1994. The liquidation of  the remaining assets of the development bank will also be  concluded in December 1994.    16. The creation of the Private Pension System in June 1993,  as an alternative to the public pension system, is expected to  contribute to the increase in overall savings in the economy. A  new Superintendency of Private Pension Fund Administration was  created to regulate the funds. The regulations in this area will  continue to be improved as necessary. The Peruvian Institute of  Social Security will only provide health services, and therefore  it will restructure its personnel in accordance with its new  functions established in 1994. The Social Security Normalization  Office (ONP), which will begin operations in June 1994, will  gradually take over responsibility for the operation of the  public pension system. The pension payment will be financed with  a transfer of about 300 million soles from the Treasury in 1994.    17. The government will continue to liberalize and simplify  the trade system. The list of products subject to the 25 percent  tariff rate was reduced even further in 1993, leaving less than  2 percent of the value of imports at this tariff level. The  objective is to unify all tariffs at 15 percent by 1995. A  timetable was reached with the IDB, within the context of the  Sectorial Loan for Trade, to gradually reduce the surcharge on  agricultural products with the objective of eliminating it by  July 1997. The government will conclude the privatization of the  National Enterprise for Industrial Marketing (ENCI) by December  1994. In addition, the trade negotiations with the Andean Group  have concluded satisfactorily. Agreements are also being  negotiated with other countries, like Argentina, Chile, and  Mexico, to reduce trade barriers. Peru has signed the Uruguay  Round agreement.    18. The government will strengthen its policies to reduce  poverty as an essential element for consolidating the  pacification program and the substantial progress made in  stabilizing the economy. In 1994, Peru began a global program of  social stabilization which will coordinate efforts in the areas  of education, health, nutrition, justice, and job creation with  its own resources, donations, and funds from multilateral  institutions. For this purpose Peru has asked for technical  assistance from the IMF and the IDB to implement the programs  against poverty, within the context of a general follow-up to  the policy and management of public spending.    19. During 1994 the government will continue its efforts to  increase educational coverage and quality. These efforts will be  concentrated on decentralizing education and introducing a  direct budget appropriation system for schools based on the  number of students. A pilot plan will be carried out during  1994, in an attempt to cover between 100,000 and 150,000  elementary school students.    20. Substantial progress was attained during 1993 to make  the  labor market more flexible, through the proclamation of a law  that allows several kinds of labor contracts, a flexible  position regarding job security, and which regulates the  collective labor bargain process with the purpose of minimizing  labor disputes. The government will propose a new Labor Code  that will consolidate and harmonize the existing laws, with the  purpose of further reducing the strict norms of the labor market  according with the new 1993 Constitution. The arbitration  procedures will be revised in order to expedite labor dispute  settlements.    21. The government believes that it is necessary to  substantially improve its knowledge of the macroeconomic  situation in order to better analyze and plan the economic  policy. Many of the recommendations made by the IMF monitoring  mission during its March/April 1993 visit have already been  implemented. The government has established a permanent  interinstitutional committee made up of high-ranking officials  from the Economy and Finance Ministry, the Central Reserve Bank,  and the National Institute of Statistics and Information  Science, to help adopt coordinated measures to improve the  macroeconomic statistics of each sector and to promote a  consistent statistical methodology among all sectors. The  government will likewise take action to improve the compilation  of national accounts and to correct deficiencies in the  Consumers Price Index and in the GDP deflators, with technical  assistance from the IMF.    22. The government considers that the policies described in  this letter are appropriate for attaining the objectives of the  economic program, and it will adopt any additional measure  appropriate for this purpose. The Peruvian Government and the  IMF will hold periodical meetings according to the policy on  such meetings, as specified in our 18 March 1993 letter. Before  the end of August 1994, and every three months from then onward,  the external financing of the economic program will be reviewed  until a satisfactory agreement is reached, as specified in our  19 March 1993 letter. The execution of the economic program  described in this letter will be revised together with the IMF  before the end of August 1994. The evaluation criteria of the  program are described in Charts 1, 2, and 3. The evaluation  criteria for 1995 and the calendar for future revisions of the  economic program will be established not later than 15 March  1995. The IMF will maintain at the disposal of Peru the funds of  the Expanded Financial Facilities Agreement. Peru may use these  funds, if necessary, to finance debt restructuring programs;  Peru will also be able to ask for an increase of the funds of  said agreement, according to what is established by IMF norms in  these cases.    Respectfully,    Jorge Camet, Minister of Economy and Finance    German Suarez Chavez, President of the Peruvian Central  Reserve Bank</p>

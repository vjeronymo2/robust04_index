			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDING 'BROOKLYN BOY'  </P> <P> Through an editorial error, the last sentence in Pauline Mayer's review of Alan  Lelchuk's "Brooklyn Boy" (Book Review, Jan. 21) was omitted. That sentence  read: "Nonetheless, with its intriguing overlapping patterns and its endearing,  questing hero, Lelchuk's new work does further enrich that rich body of  literature about growing up a 'Brooklyn boy.' "  </P></p>

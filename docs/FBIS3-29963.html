Downplaying the previous military criticism that the  requirement would hinder the armed forces' arms acquisition  process, Adm Prachet said the requirement represented a new  policy and it should be welcomed as it would be beneficial to  the country. Adm Prachet said that soldiers in democratic  societies had no choice but to respect and obey and the  Government's policy. [sentence as published] "In the democratic  system, government officials have to follow the Government's  policy and soldiers have to know their exact role in the  system," said Adm Prachet, who will retire in 1996.    The Navy commander said it was understandable that the  Government's barter trade policy has caused confusion during its  initial period. "Now the misunderstanding has been resolved.  Initially, there are different views on the issue but now we  have a clear understanding," explained the Navy commander. He  said he was optimistic that problems would not occur during the  implementation of the policy in acquiring arms. "There should be  no problem," said the Navy commander.    He said under the government barter trade policy the armed  forces had to separately submit their arms acquisition plans to  the Cabinet for approval should it exceeded 1 billion baht.    Adm Prachet said he was optimistic that the Cabinet would  give its final approval during its next meeting to the Navy's  proposal to buy a new fleet of attacker A-7 Corsairs from the  United States. He said the attacker was part of the Navy's  development plan which would cost about 2,000 million baht.</p>

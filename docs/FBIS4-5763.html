			<p>CSO     [Text] NTT has begun a quiet change in course. It has  determined that sole reliance on intracompany managerial  resources will not allow it to compete in the turbulent  information technology (IT) world. President Kojima has decided  that survival will require an aggressive tie up with overseas  ventures.    NTT supposedly led the advanced world of technology in the  areas of integrated services digital networks (ISDN) and optical  fiber networks, but Kojima felt, "If NTT does not take  appropriate action, it will be left on the wayside by rapidly  advancing U.S. technology."    It was two years ago that President Hitoshi Kojima of NTT  was  struck by a sense of crisis. At that time, he was energetically  engaged in meetings with executives of U.S. companies that were  world leaders in the development of software, such as Chairman  Bill Gates of Microsoft and officials of Lotus and Novell. Each  meeting he held with these individuals impressed Kojima with the  speed with which the IT technology revolution including  multimedia was advancing and diversifying and that it was  impossible to determine which area would prevail in the IT  revolution. Kojima asked himself, "Can we compete effectively  with such venture firms with our present resources?"    Originally, NTT was supposed to have led the world in the IT  field. Even in connection with the common household, it had  initiated experiments in ISDN with digital communications  capabilities in 1984. In 1985, it built an infrastructure  including a 3,400-km optical fiber cable relay net traveling the  length of the Japanese archipelago.    Based on that experience, in 1990 it launched a "Visual,  Intelligent, and Personal Plan" (VI&amp;P concept) shaping a  multimedia communication age which called for connecting  households with optical fiber cables by the year 2015. The plan  called for services such as the remote transmission of  high-vision static images and telephone connections with  individuals carrying cellular telephones in any part of the  country.    Even the information highway concept, which is now a  substitute term for IT, proposed by Vice President Gore was  conceived out of fear for the NTT plan and encompassed the goal  of building a communications infrastructure which could compete  with Japan. However, now that 10 years have passed since the  inception of ISDN experiments, the United States leads in the IT  field.    President Kojima admits, "The VI&amp;P concept was a dream  which  was not accompanied by technology of a practical nature." It was  the United States that backed up this dream with rapid technical  innovations beginning with digital techniques.    The University of North Carolina has commenced experiments  involving the transmission of images taken by computer  tomography (CT) scanners over optical fiber cables to remotely  located supercomputers, analysis of angle and volume of  radiological exposure for therapeutic purposes, and transmission  of three-dimensional images to the concerned physician.    The question is, why is Japan, which was supposed to have  been first in entering into the "high-level information  society," now being left behind the United States in a cloud of  dust? Even now, President Kojima does not feel that Japan lags  in the hardware area in terms of communications technology.    In 1990, NTT led the world in developing asynchronous  transmission mode (ATM) switching systems which represent the  heart of next-generation communications services and leads the  industry in the research and development of switching systems.  It is a top-class firm in transmission technology, initiating  high-speed transmission experiments on optical fiber circuits  with the capacity to transmit 10 gigabytes per second or the  equivalent of 10 years of newspaper text in one second. Current  world networks have a maximum capacity of 2.4 gigabytes per  second. The proposed system will have a capacity which is four  times greater. The capability to develop such basic technology  will enable completion of conversion to digital switching  systems and 100 percent digitalization of communication systems  by fiscal year 1997.    In 1997, conversion of U.S. communication systems to digital  switching systems will have reached a level of only 80 percent.  The United States is serviced by nearly 2,000 telephone  companies, including financially strong firms such as the  AT&amp;T  long-distance carrier and the baby Bells which were created as a  result of the break up of the former AT&amp;T and a number of  small  and medium firms. Not all of the firms have the financial  resources to purchase the newest technology. Even in terms of  ISDN services, which were initiated in Japan in 1988, U.S. firms  have not been able to successfully interconnect and are unable  to provide nationwide services.    On the other hand, however, in the United States, it is  possible to use computer networks for instantaneous access to  President Clinton's speeches or other government information.  Vice President Gore can use personal computer networks to hold a  dialogue with citizens and obtain a copy of the record of such  conversations from the network. Businesses make active use of  such networks. There's also the story about the listing of  Chairman Bill Gate's electronic mail number in a magazine and  the subsequent inability to cope with the daily volume of 5,000  communications per day.    The lesson learned from the past 10 years concludes with the  statement, "No IT revolution can be realized without the  necessary software."    Although Japan is advanced in hardware, IT is actually being  used in the United States. What caused this disparity? President  Kojima lists the following four reasons: First, he mentions the  low rate of personal computer installations, especially the  small number of computers linked to networks. Second, he  mentions the lack of progress in digitalizing the information  data base beginning with visual assets. Third, he mentions lack  of progress in cable television (CATV) installations,  accompanied by the low rate of household coaxial-optical fiber  cable installations. And, finally, he mentions the lack of  progress in the use of software to make effective use of  networking systems.    The lesson learned from the last 10 years leads to the  simple  conclusion that, "We cannot even start an IT revolution based on  hardware initiatives. We cannot start an IT revolution even if  we develop ATM switching systems of the highest technology,  build networks of the highest technology and are told to use  such systems. It is essential that such hardware be serviced by  a network so that they can be used by any terminal." Even if we  were to lay optical fiber cables, we cannot initiate the IT age.  Terminal devises must play a primary role.    It is said that "Telescript," developed by General Magic  Inc.  will become a world-class standard for multimedia and can be  installed on and used on computer terminals. However, it has not  been developed completely from a technical standpoint.    One member of NTT's Technical Department states, "We are  still at the stage where we must first study General Magic's  technology. During the former NTT days, it was  verboten to affiliate with third-party technology  without becoming completely conversant with the system."  However, we have reached an age where we must make crucial  decisions without reaching a knowledgeable level.    President Kojima comments, "A research center is filled with  a variety of ideas and concepts. However, when it comes to  reaching a practical stage, they say wait two or three years.  But such an approach does not allow us to keep up with the pace  of technological innovation." We must attain developmental  speeds reached by U.S. venture firms.    The same applies to the Multimedia Promotion Section, under  the direct control of President Kojima, which is reviewing the  developmental concepts centered on ATM systems.    In the past, the communications world was not so concerned  about competing in terms of speed. Standards applicable to the  industry are normally developed in meetings held by worldwide  communications operators at the International Telecommunications  Union (ITU) in Geneva which result in the submission of a  package recommending international standards in four-year cycles.    However, the procedure changed with the arrival of ATM  systems. The portion of the actual standards involving intimate  work by the computer industry were developed by an industry  group composed of leading firms such as Sun Microsystems,  International Business Machines, and Hewlett-Packard and later  endorsed by the ITU.    Communications formed intimate relations with the computer  world. Advances in technology accelerated and standards  decisions were made on the basis of market competition. The  strong survived and de facto standards became the "world  standards." NTT could no longer resist this trend.    NTT took its first step by investing in General Magic Inc.  In  January of this year, NTT announced "NTT's Basic Plan Directed  at the Multimedia Age," and made clear its strategy to  aggressively tie up with terminal and information producers.  Concurrently, it established in February a Multimedia Promotion  Section under the direct control of the president for the  purpose of selecting firms with which to affiliate and to  formulate specific strategy.    The IT revolution will change the very status of the  communications industry. President Kojima states, "We are in an  age where anyone can operate an electrical communications  business as long as he has a router."    In the markets for routers which are switching systems to  interconnect networks, U.S. venture firms such as Cisco Systems  command a controlling share with information network systems  which function with great agility. The small-scale switching  system purchased by the Academic Information Center under its  fiscal year 1993 supplemental budget was made by Four Systems  Inc. of the United States. Just as downsizing has taken place in  the computer arena, downsizing is about to begin in the  communications world.    President Kojima admits, "We have already discarded concepts  centering on ATM systems." He has thus parted ways with  preference for huge networks centered around ATM switching  systems which can handle images, sound and data in one unit. We  are no longer in an age where size guarantees competitive  capabilities.    AT&amp;T Vice President Kakes Roger [as transliterated]  comments,  "An important factor of the multimedia age is the adaptation of  technology held by venture firms." Even AT&amp;T, which leads the  world in technical development and operates the Bell  Laboratories which discovered the transistor and gave birth to  the basic technology for today's semiconductor, has actively  affiliated itself with and invested in 3DO Inc., which developed  the "REAL" multimedia player which is to be sold domestically by  Matsushita Electric Industrial, and EO Inc., a maker of portable  computer terminals.    Venture firms rich in creative talents will play a principal  role in the IT revolution. Competing with the pace maintained by  such firms will preclude sole reliance on in-house technology.  Even President Kojima states, "We should bet on the winning  horse." Unless one is willing to do so, he will not be able to  survive in this rapidly changing world.  <H5>  ISDN </H5>   ISDN represents a digital network which uses a single  telephone circuit to transmit items such as facsimiles and  computer data. The system was developed to eliminate the  previous inconvenience of having to use separate circuits for  each service and to sign separate contracts. However, as  terminals became sophisticated and as long as the necessary  equipment was purchased, it became possible to use telephone  circuits by themselves to transmit facsimiles and computer data  and the significance of integration diminished for the user.  However, there is the advantage with ISDN that information can  be transmitted at a higher speed than with a telephone circuit.  "INS" is the trade name for NTT's ISDN service.  <H5>  ATM Switching Systems </H5>   This is a switching system called broad-band integrated  services digital network (B-ISDN) referred to as the  next-generation digital communications infrastructure. ISDN  which NTT launched in 1988 can process data in higher volumes  than analogue circuits, but cannot transmit animated images for  television. B-ISDN can transmit high-definition television  images without affecting quality. ATM switching systems enable  the efficient volume transmission of data in this manner and are  manufactured and marketed in places like the United States by  Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, and Oki Electric Industry.  <H5>  Routers </H5>   Switching equipment of telephone companies such as NTT have  the capability to select circuits to reach the number being  called and to select alternate circuits if the originally  selected circuit malfunctions. A router serves as a switching  system for computer networks. As an example, they are used when  there is a need to interconnect, via relay lines, a local area  network (LAN) installed in Tokyo headquarters with a LAN  installed in a research center located in Yokohama. Routers  accomplish the task of selecting circuits for the accurate  transmission of data, just like the case with telephones, when  transmitting data from one LAN to another LAN.  <H5>  Eli Noam, Director, Columbia Business School </H5> Telecommunications Information Research Center    If you remain immobilized by fear of what you will lose, you  will be left by the wayside.    The impact of the information highway is not limited to  making personal lives more pleasurable. It will have a dramatic  effect on improving industrial productivity. Inclusive of that  benefit, the market potential for the information highway is  immeasurable. It would be myopic to attempt an estimate of the  market size for each area, such as that for video on demand or  home shopping.    When automotive highways were built and people and  industries  moved to the suburbs, the United States witnessed the  abandonment of inner cities. The next developmental cycle will  witness the repetition of the same process on a larger scale. On  the one hand, small and midsized venture firms and poorly  situated firms will benefit greatly, but large firms that fail  to change will not be able to keep pace with the new competitive  world created by the information highway. Failure to change will  cause many problems. Firms which fail to build competitive  capabilities suitable for the information highway age will  probably be forced to effect considerable personnel cuts and  modify business operations.    When advances are made in the installation of the  information  highway, businesses will be able to cope adequately by retaining  only those core technologies and operating resources essential  to its operations and by using outside resources for its  peripheral needs. Since the exchange of information will be  simplified significantly, the number of previous in-house  functions to be satisfied on a contract basis can be increased.  In fact, if a future image of the company can be clearly defined  and attributes superior to other firms can be acquired, it would  be preferable to assume a slimmed-down structure.    I would like to advise Japanese businessmen that when they  face major changes of this magnitude, they must not fear for  their losses. Japan possesses core technology in the information  communications field, a world-class domestic appliance industry,  a respectable entertainment industry--albeit not as powerful as  that of the United States--and people with a high educational  level. If one were to identify Japan's lagging areas, he would  probably point to the low level of CATV installations and the  need for further deregulation.    Deregulation in the United States gave birth to increased  competition and the adverse impact of rising unemployment, but  produced major economic benefits overall. Japan should be able  to play a useful role in the information age, if it will proceed  with deregulation without fear for change.    It is a complete error to assume the interpretation that the  information highway concept in the United States is being  advanced under the principal leadership of government. The  information highway will not be built in the same manner as the  Apollo program or the aircraft industry. Government merely  played the role of the rooster that signaled the arrival of  daybreak, and it would be more accurate to say that the  realities of the new age had already manifested themselves. The  government-prepared idea of the information highway is very  crude, no more than a rough guideline, and has very little  reference value.    There are some who associate the information highway with  nationalism, but Japanese businesses need not be concerned.  There is no doubt that U.S. firms consider the information  highway as providing a large market opportunity and that it will  play an important role in strengthening U.S. industry's  competitiveness. However, in those areas of the system which  relate intimately to individuals' personal lives, it is hard to  visualize a situation where U.S. citizens will opt against  low-priced, good-quality Japanese-made terminals.    The IT revolution will provide Japanese firms with major  business opportunities and if the IT revolution takes hold in  Japan, businesses will benefit on a worldwide basis. The reason  is that the information highway in itself will serve, in  reality, to tear down national boundaries of the business world.</p>

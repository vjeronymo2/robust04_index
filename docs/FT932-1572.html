			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Smothered in goo but still top hole - Television How depressing to find the BBC introducing its first afternoon of Wimbledon coverage with another of those childish compilation tapes in which players are seen grimacing, punching the air, blowing kisses and so on, all cut to a monotonous disco dance number. Snooker began this grubby little habit, then it turned up in rugger and athletics and now it is being inflicted upon tennis fans. It seems there is no event which the BBC will not attempt to smother in goo, from the Cardiff Singer Of The World contest to the once dignified Wimbledon. If it was not for the excellence of the real McCoy - the live coverage - it would make you wonder about continuing to champion the BBC as our main national broadcaster.                             *      *      * Having said which, there is a nasty trend in Committee Room 15 at the House of Commons where the National Heritage Committee is inquiring into the future of the BBC (yes, again; there does not seem to be a flicker of light at the end of this inquiry tunnel). Listening to some of the witnesses and, more worrying, some members of the committee, you could easily get the impression that cable and satellite are already available to most British viewers. They talk as though the days of terrestrial television - BBC, ITV, Channel 4 - are over and multiple choice is here, so that there is no longer any need to impose the hideous burden of the licence fee on a seething and rebellious population. So powerful was this impression last week that it seemed sensible in giving my evidence to make the point that the biggest weekly share of viewing for satellite and cable ever recorded by BARB was 6.5 per cent, leaving 93.5 per cent to terrestrial broadcasters. Time permitting, I might have added that the British seem remarkably happy with the terrestrial operators, showing less enthusiasm for the new technologies than viewers in other countries. The British take-up rate for cable (those paying to hook up when the cable passes their door) is very low, and even in the small number of homes that have dishes, only 32 per cent of time is spent with satellite channels, leaving 68 per cent to the terrestrials. Most of the hostility, I suspect, is inspired by the doctrinaire political feeling that the licence fee is part of an old fashioned collectivist system which, along with the welfare state, should now, in the post-communist world, be replaced by something more market driven. Pragmatism suggests this is crazy: compared with any other scheme the BBC and the licence fee have proved astoundingly productive and efficient, and foreigners from Warsaw to Oshkosh would tell the committee they are mad even to think about scrapping them. Dislike of the licence comes chiefly from politicians who would dearly like the general public to object, but who can rarely scrape together more than half a dozen letters of protest when challenged.                             *      *      * Regular readers may have noticed that while television critics elsewhere were rending their clothes and falling on their remote controls at the ending of Cheers, the event passed without a murmur from this column. Now that the repeats are up and running it may be time to say why. Although Cheers was (given the repeats, is) an efficient vehicle for delivering American wisecracks, it never produced a character as strong or memorable as Bilko or Lucy. You may say that was never the intention: this was not a star series like those old shows, its strength was in ensemble playing from a large cast of near equals. Perhaps so, but if it is to be judged on those grounds then its inferiority becomes clear the moment you consider MASH Not only did MASH take ensemble playing to a considerably higher level, but it managed, year after year, to combine comedy and pathos in a way that Cheers aspired to but rarely achieved. MASH had the advantage of ambivalence arising from its setting: the jokes gained a keen edge from the perpetual proximity of pain in the frontline operating theatre. No doubt the funny and sympathetic depiction of the lonely and inadequate in Cheers was (is) hugely appealing to many viewers; but that does not make it one of the great sitcoms. It is good but not outstanding.                             *      *      * Those with a passion for Italy and some knowledge of the country may have thought that 'Italian Week' on BBC2's Late Show would not be for them: too busy offering a child's guide to the new politics, or rowing back over the mafia trials. In the event quite a lot was, indeed, familiar and you realised once more how superior print can still be when it comes to detail. For instance, in describing the new magistrate hero, di Pietro, the programme never hinted at his mastery of computers and the central importance this has played in his fight against crime, though FT readers learned this in detail months ago. However, Nick Hornby gave an excellent report on Italian football and its symbolic significance, even as a substitute for politics; David Stafford and Tom Conti offered a wickedly accurate and consequently hilarious 10-point charter for being Italian ('Dress British . . . Think taupe . . . Dare to be similar . . .'); the importance of public opinion in the new drive against the mafia was well read; we were given an unexpected and eye-opening report on the Rome opera house; and, even if the studio discussion was disappointing, anyone who watched throughout the week will have ended with a much clearer idea of what it means at the moment to be an Italian.                             *      *      * The shift away from adult television and into tabloid telly continues inexorably. Among last week's newcomers was Fantastic Facts on ITV which presenter Jonathan Ross promised us would be 'outwageously funny'. It was not. Fantastic Cliches would have been a better title. From Ross's script ('Without further ado . . .') to the 'fantastic' items (you can adopt a pothole in Minnesota) there was little that the normal viewer would not have come across several times before, including the famous fainting goats. The biggest giggle came when the camera showed us a boy's book with a decorated cover and the title 'Scouts In Bondage', but you need more than that and yet another stuntman's expose to make a half hour programme. The most embarrassing moment came in the network trailer which assured us that one of the items was 'incredulous but true'.                             *      *      * ITV's three-part Thursday drama Telltale, featuring two detectives and a supergrass, is proving a bit of an enigma: is it just another proficient but unsurprising police drama starring Bernard Hill who, however good he may be, is currently dangerously over exposed? Or is its chief preoccupation really the home lives of the detectives, a theme beloved of Z Cars writers in the 1960s? Or, as I vaguely suspect, is its real concern 'Stockholm Syndrome', the tendency of captors and captives, in a bank siege or aircraft hijacking, to develop a common front against the world? Only the final episode tomorrow will tell, but I shall be disappointed if Stockholm Syndrome plays no part.                             *      *      * Last week's column on commercials failed to mention Paul Merton's current campaign for Cusson's Imperial Leather where he bursts in on the children's bathtime, drops his microphone in the bath, and promises the irate mother compensation: 'We'll give you about . . . eight quid'. Why or whether it sells soap is anybody's guess, but it made me laugh more than any of the week's sitcoms.</p>

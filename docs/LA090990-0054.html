			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLSTOY'S FINAL DAYS;  </P> <P> THE LAST STATION BY JAY PARINI (HENRY HOLT: $21.95; 290 PP.)  </P> <P> Tolstoy was one of the greatest novelists in any language. As a man whose  ideals often contradicted his life, he has a less certain reputation.  </P> <P> Among his many idiosyncrasies, none seems more apparent, nor more responsible  for tormenting his last months, than his habit of laying guilt upon others to  atone for his own excesses; or, to turn the same coin on its opposite side, his  fondness for half-baked ideals which actually arose from some personal  inability. For example, though he was born to the wealthy, land-owning  nobility, his opulence embarrassed him, since he believed -- and continually  lectured those around him -- that to own property is to be a thief; yet the  only possessions he ever tried to give away were the copyrights to his work, a  gesture that could only have hurt others.  </P> <P> Similarly, his once-prodigious sexual appetite -- indeed 13 legitimate children  and at least one illegitimate one were born at his huge estate, Yasnaya Polyana  -- later influenced him to preach against all forms of sexual activity. Yet  here, too, he did not so much surrender a comfort as find relief from a burden,  for he was already an old man becoming increasingly estranged from Sofya  Andreyevna, his wife.  </P> <P> Perhaps most ironic of all, this consummate creator of intensely emotional  characters eventually believed the novel a frivolous form, later abandoning it  for the craft of essayist and philosopher, though he had often called analysis  inferior to love. Yet it cannot be a coincidence that by this time he feared  his creative powers had waned.  </P> <P> In Tolstoy's last months, the most obvious manifestation of this attack of  conscience, and coincidental evidence of his deteriorating marriage, was the  battle between the author and his wife over the copyright to his works. Leo  Nikolayevich wanted to atone for his own privileged birth by assigning the  copyright to a publisher, Chertkov, a disciple who had promised to make the  works available to the public in inexpensive editions. To Sofya Andreyevna,  this was the worst kind of disloyalty -- failure to provide for his family's  future, while preferring a hanger-on who would only enrich himself. A mortal  battle developed, not between Chertkov and Sofya over the soul of Tolstoy, for  Sofya had already forbidden Chertkov to set foot on Yasnaya Polyana, but  between Tolstoy and his wife over which way Tolstoy would bestow his  affections.  </P> <P> "The Last Station" unfolds the fascinating story of these Dantean circles --  made by both Tolstoy and others -- that closed about Russia's then greatest  writer and most outspoken critic during his last year. In his closest circle, a  constant jockeying for the great man's quixotic affections alternated with  sincere attempts to effect what these several people in their different ways  deemed his best interest. Others were ruled by self-interest, as careers and  incomes stood in jeopardy.  </P> <P> And at the widest circle was the ruthless world beyond, hovering like birds to  screech the latest scandal in Tolstoy's marriage, as it had done a decade  earlier; gossiping that the celibate wife-murderer in "The Kreutzer Sonata" was  an image of Tolstoy himself; or flapping in delight when some Tolstoyan  disciple had been imprisoned for slandering the czar's government. And all the  while everyone ghoulishly awaited news of Tolstoy's health.  </P> <P> Jay Parini faithfully re-creates these events with the unusual technique of six  narrators, all historical figures, who offer their perspectives of the  day-to-day activities leading up to Tolstoy's death. As each chapter ends, a  new narrator takes over. Chertkov has the fewest chapters, three; Tolstoy's  doctor has four; his secretary-daughter five, and his wife eight.  </P> <P> The largest role -- nine chapters -- and most attractive personality belong to  a young writer whom Chertkov had sent to Tolstoy to be a kind of research  assistant/spy. His name was Valentin Bulgakov (not to be confused with the  near-contemporary Mikhail Bulgakov, author of "The Master and Margarita").  </P> <P> Several of these narrators believe that the overly dramatic Sofya became so  unstable, and so obsessed with what she thought was her husband's sordid  attraction for Chertkov, that she drove Tolstoy to leave her secretly in the  middle of the night of Oct. 28, 1910, on a desperate journey that caused his  death nine days later. This belief, however, overlooks some obvious facts.  </P> <P> When he converted a domestic temper tantrum into a secret journey, Tolstoy was  a man so advanced in years that his health was already precarious. Then,  exploding the secrecy of his trip by sending letters and telegrams to everyone  and by giving something of a public lecture on the train suggests that he was  as much of a self-dramatizer as his wife. Moreover, this final journey,  especially its first stop at a sparse monastery to visit his sister, a nun at  the adjacent convent, may have appealed to Tolstoy as a symbolic rejection of  the worldly possessions he had often philosophically disowned.  </P> <P> Although a sub-title describes the book as "a novel of Tolstoy's last year"  (Gore Vidal even calls it a historical novel), this may be a misleading  category. For, apart from two poems signed J. P. and an unsigned sestina  probably also by the same hand, the entire work is a tour de force of editing.  As Parini himself says, the subject first suggested itself to him in a  used-book shop in Naples while he was browsing through Bulgakov's diary of  Tolstoy's last year. He later learned that Dr. Makovitsky wrote a book about  his prominent patient; Sofya wrote extensively about these times; Tolstoy's  daughter Sasha kept a diary. Even that archvillain (from Sofya's point of view)  Chertkov published his version of these events.  </P> <P> Having access to all of these first-hand accounts offers a splendid advantage:  a variety of narrators giving authentic historical perspectives, many  incompatible. But there are disadvantages as well. By presenting these voices  twice removed from their original sounds -- once due to the translation from  Russian to the English from which the author worked, and then in editing for  continuity -- Parini gives us six narrators who sound very much alike. Some of  this editing doubtless improves the book, as a brief look at Parini's sources  clearly shows. (The colorless, blunt style of Andreyevna's diary required a  more extensive editorial effort than did the interesting prose of Bulgakov,  which was largely taken verbatim.) Nevertheless, the final result is not  exactly a novel, with all that that term implies about an author's invention.  </P> <P> One example of the author's skillful selection of material from the available  diaries provides happy relief from what might otherwise have been a lugubrious  chronicle of an old man's decline. Bulgakov, the young assistant, was staying  at Telyatinki, a Tolstoy residence a few miles from Yasnaya Polyana, where he  met and fell in love with Masha, another young Tolstoyan. The passages  describing this affair, like fresh air let into a musty room, remind us of what  the young Tolstoy must have been like when he was passionately in love with his  22-year-old wife and the two of them worked together on "War and Peace," he  writing new material a few pages at a time, she copying it in smooth draft and  making suggestions along the way. Sofya often said that these were the happiest  days of her life.  </P> <P> In the contrast between the young lovers Bulgakov and Masha and the tired old  warriors Tolstoy and Sofya we see, then, not only the beginning and end of one  of the world's greatest artists but also the two facets of Tolstoy's life. This  story is about deeply emotional people who were willing to sacrifice everything  for each other, and the complicated life that Tolstoy himself actually led  outside his art. By selecting the most interesting observations of people whose  works we would perhaps never consult, in a novel that grows more compelling as  it proceeds, Parini has made a valuable contribution to our understanding of  Tolstoy.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, he confirms what we have always known in some subconscious way,  but still need to learn: that we can always trust a great writer's works, never  his commentary -- on anything.  </P></p>

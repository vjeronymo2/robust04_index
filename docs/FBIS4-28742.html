			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By T. Mohan] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Cambodian Investment Board [CIB],  as the operational body of the Cambodian Development Council,  will be empowered to render its decision on a normal investment  project within 45 days from the day it receives the completed  application form with all the relevant information, including  feasibility and profitability studies.    The CIB, which will also be entrusted with the  implementation  of the soon to be ratified Investment Law of the Kingdom of  Cambodia, shall also publish its decision on the promotion of  investment projects.    To enable this, it is empowered to inform potential foreign  and local investors on the investment opportunities inn the  kingdom, promote, analyse, evaluate and approve investment  projects, study and identify investment and economic strategies,  and assist and facilitate foreign and local investors by making  the board a one-stop service organisation.    In addition to this, the CIB shall also issue an Investment  Promotion Certificate to the promoted company in which the  benefits and obligations of the company in one or more areas  shall be clearly stated.    This ranges from amount and origin of capital, nationality  of  the investors and the number of shareholders and directors, the  number of local and foreign staff, training schedules of local  nationals, to details on the implementation schedule and details  on benefits incentives granted.    The Investment Law, which is implemented by the CIB, shall  govern investments made by foreign and local investors within  the territory of the kingdom.    For the purpose of this law, investors may be either a  person  or a corporate entity.    Investments may be made in any economic activity or sector  provided they have received prior written approval from the  board and do not fall under section 16 of the law.    Section 16 of the law states that the CIB will not grant its  approval on projects where activities and sectors are forbidden  by the Constitution of the Kingdom, those listed in the  restricted list issued by the board and that which involves  trading and activities which the board has confirmed by written  notice to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of  Commerce.    The Investment Law also supersedes any other existing  investment law and calls for non-discriminatory treatment of  both local and foreign nationals in respect to all rights,  benefits, guarantees and obligations attendant to their  investments, except for ownership of land as specified in the  said law.    Under the law, the government has guaranteed that it shall  not expropriate, nationalise or take any measures having the  same or similar effect with respect to investments established  in this nation.    The government shall not impose price control on the  products  or services of the promoted company.    The Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia stipulates the  guideline on the benefits and obligations related to private  investments here.    Its objective is to attract investments that could sustain  the economic development of this nation and contribute to the  building of a strong and dynamic private sector.    It is also designed to boost the competitive advantage of  this nation among other nations, through a pragmatic economic  policy in line with the spirit of the free market system in  which the government will act as the facilitator of the private  sector.</p>

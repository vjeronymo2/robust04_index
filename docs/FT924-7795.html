			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Ministers launch drive to boost confidence in the economy SENIOR ministers yesterday launched a concerted drive to strengthen optimism in government ranks and confidence among businesses and consumers after Thursday's announcement of measures to spur economic recovery. But as cabinet ministers sought to reap the political benefit of a new cheerfulness among Tory MPs, the plans were given a cooler reception in the City, where several analysts complained that they would be insufficient to ensure growth. Leading UK equities lost virtually all Thursday's gains, with the FT-SE 100 index closing at 2,697.5, down 28.9 points. UK gilts fell sharply, with long dated issues down nearly a full percentage point. However, sterling, which declined sharply against the D-Mark in overnight trading after the Autumn Statement, more than recovered its losses. It closed in London at DM2.4275, up  3/4 pfennigs on the day, and gained just over 2 1/2 cents against a generally weaker dollar to close at Dollars 1.5495. In New York, sterling closed at Dollars 1.5505, and was quoted in late trading at DM2.4374. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the Autumn Statement improved Britain's economic outlook 'immeasurably'. The three percentage point drop in interest rates over the past two months was a 'huge potential injection of liquidity into the economy', he told BBC radio's Today programme. Consumers should be more confident in spite of their large stock of debt because of a 'dramatic' lowering of debt servicing costs. As Mr Lamont urged industry to make the most of low interest rates, a competitive pound and the government's moves to boost confidence, senior party managers emphasised that the Autumn Statement would enable the Tories to put their recent divisions behind them. Initial signs of a more united approach appeared as Tory MPs across a range of opinion, both for and against the UK rejoining the exchange rate mechanism, expressed approval for Thursday's decisions. Mr John Major sought to play down the Tories' recent difficulties, contrasting 'the very strong support for the strategy for growth we produced' with disaffection among a 'small number of backbenchers'. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said that 'the Autumn Statement enables us to draw a line under those past difficulties', while Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said: 'Today, for the first time in many weeks, the load of anxiety is lifting'. The encouragement to business from Mr Lamont to 'go for it', was repeated by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. Both Mr Major and Mr Lamont, however, warned that there was no magic solution to bring about instant recovery. The Conservatives' immediate euphoria will be tested next week when the spending plans and measures for growth will come under sustained scrutiny. Both Mr Lamont and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, face questions from the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs early next week. The Commons will also hold a two-day debate on Thursday's statement. The significance of the Autumn Statement for the government's political fortunes will be underlined when the prime minister makes the annual speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet on Monday. Traditionally an occasion for dealing primarily with foreign policy, the signal from Downing Street is that his theme is likely to be the domestic economy.

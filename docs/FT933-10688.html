			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / BT 'special offer' calls ruled unfair A RECENT British Telecommunications 'special offer' to customers was discriminatory to competitors and must not be repeated, Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, ruled yesterday. BT will be obliged to agree new rules with Oftel to ensure that future special offers do not favour its business to the detriment of competitors. The ruling is a blow to BT, which sees special offers as a way to contain competition from Mercury and cable TV companies, which are building local phone networks in conurbations. Oftel's decision concerns BT's 'Sunday Special' of November and December, when most long-distance calls after 3pm on Sundays were charged at the local cheap rate. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said the BT tariff for the Sunday special 'failed to cover the costs of network usage, if those were assessed on the basis used for other operators connecting to the BT network'. Similar behaviour by BT in future 'would have a significant effect on competition in the telecommunications market' and could not be permitted. Oftel has not imposed a penalty on BT, but its new rules governing future special offers are likely to require BT to demonstrate that competitors can take advantage of the same network tariffs for the use of the BT network as the company charges itself. In the longer term, Oftel's recent proposals for full accounting separation between the 'network' and 'retail' parts of BT's business would make it harder for BT to discriminate against competitors. BT said it remained committed to special offers 'as far as they are permitted by the regulatory regime'. Mercury said Oftel's decision highlighted 'faultlines' in existing regulation. 'We don't think tinkering with the existing regime is enough, but . . . we want to see all competitors free to make exciting offers provided they do not discriminate,' it said.</p>

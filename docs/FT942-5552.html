			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Rare two-year offering from the Province of Manitoba New issuance in the eurobond market was muted yesterday due to the continued volatility in financial markets. Choppy conditions this week have forced Salomon Brothers to delay the launch of a Dollars 250m five-year issue for Japanese Development Bank because a fall in Japanese government bond prices played havoc with a currency swap linked to it. However, syndicate managers believe issuance will pick up in the next few weeks. There are rumours that the Province of Ontario is close to coming to the market now that the uncertainty over its rating has been dispelled. Mr John Madden, Ontario's assistant deputy minister of finance, confirmed yesterday that he was looking closely at the euroyen sector but he declined to comment further. Among yesterday's deals, continued demand from retail investors in continental Europe for Canadian dollar paper prompted a rare CDollars 150m two-year offering from the Province of Manitoba, which last tapped the euro-Canadian dollar sector six years ago. Redemptions of Canadian dollar eurobonds are estimated at CDollars 1.9bn this month, CDollars 500m in July and CDollars 1.9bn in August, and holders are keen to roll over their positions rather than realise the currency losses they have suffered. Manitoba's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 7 3/4 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1996, which syndicate managers said was too tight, even taking the borrower's rarity value into account. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened out as far as 34 basis points over Treasuries, according to some dealers, before coming back in to around 28 basis points. However, lead manager Wood Gundy said the spread had widened only to around 26 basis points, which partly reflected the stronger underlying market. By contrast, the pricing on the CDollars 100m five-year offering from GE Capital Canada, at 18 basis points over Canadian Treasuries, was thought fair. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened only marginally to 20 basis points while the price rose to 99.70 from a fixed re-offer level of 99.55. The proceeds are thought to have been swapped into floating-rate Canadian dollars. Elsewhere, Japan's Sapporo Breweries issued the first eurodollar warrant bond since March. Yamaichi, the lead manager, said that demand for the Dollars 200m four-year offering came from across the board It added that investors that did not want the equity exposure in the issue had swapped the bonds for floating-rate dollars, achieving a yield of Libor plus 20 basis points in the process.</p>

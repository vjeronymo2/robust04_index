			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH WINS FIRST BATTLE IN WAR ON DRUGS BY GAINING POLITICAL ADVANTAGE  </P> <P> Before President Bush decided to put the war on drugs at the top of his  domestic agenda, some aides tried to warn him off. "They said it was an uphill  fight and he could get hurt politically," recalled one White House staffer.  </P> <P> But the program Bush unveiled in his nationally televised speech won resounding  public approval, opinion polls demonstrated, and enabled the President to put  his Democratic opponents in just the political box that brought them to grief  with voters in the past. "In the short term this certainly helps Bush,"  conceded Democratic pollster Paul Maslin of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Democrats fought back, mostly by demanding that Bush spend more, and last week  they claimed to have won a victory of sorts when a tentative agreement was  reached to increase drug war funding. But no matter what gains Democrats make  in the funding battle, Bush seems to have a better chance of winning the  political war in the hustings.  </P> <P> For on this issue, the President appears to have aligned himself with the  majority of American voters by defining the drug problem the same way they do.  Bush tailored his proposals, which emphasize stern law enforcement, to protect  the middle class from the mindless violence of the drug scene.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Use Changing  </P> <P> What gives this approach its political power is the changing nature of drug  use. Because it appears to be lessening in the more affluent city neighborhoods  and in suburbia while the scourge rages unabated in the inner cities, the drug  problem threatens to polarize Americans along racial and economic lines.  Indeed, the recent violent eruptions in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of  Brooklyn and in Virginia Beach suggest that race tensions may already be on the  rise.  </P> <P> Drug abuse is fast becoming what Yale University medical historian David F.  Musto called "a two-tier problem," with inner-city residents increasingly being  stigmatized by middle-class Americans as drug users.  </P> <P> "The middle class will become more and more angry about drug use," Musto  predicted, and thus less likely to support proposals for helping to solve the  drug problem by improving economic and social conditions in the inner city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ominous for Democrats  </P> <P> Politically, such polarization is especially ominous for Democrats. Their party  has strong ties to the black community and counts on it as an indispensable  base in its electoral arithmetic. At the same time, the Democrats need white  votes if they are to regain the White House.  </P> <P> "The issue of drugs and crime is being manipulated cynically by the Republican  Party to get into the racial aspects," complained Democratic pollster Maslin.  </P> <P> Republicans reject such charges of implicit racism. They point out that in his  introduction to the 154-page booklet setting forth Bush's drug plan, White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director William J. Bennett made a  point of rejecting a racial approach, declaring: "No inevitable link exists  between urban life -- however disadvantaged -- and drug use. The majority of  American city residents -- rich or poor; male or female; black, white or  Hispanic, well-or poorly educated -- do not take drugs."  </P> <P> Yet in the next breath Bennett acknowledged that the fight against drugs is "a  two-front war": one battle, which is being won, against casual use, mostly by  the white middle class; and the other, which is being lost, against drug  addiction among the urban poor.  </P> <P> When Bush went on national television and presented his solution to the drug  problem with its stress on tight spending -- about $8 billion -- as well as  tougher law enforcement, it proved popular with the President's white,  middle-class constituents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Majority Favors Approach  </P> <P> A Washington Post-ABC News survey taken after his speech showed 75% of those  interviewed approving of the way he is handling the drug problem, up from about  50% last month. A New York Times-CBS News survey gave the Bush plan a 70%  favorable rating.  </P> <P> Many voters in the Post survey said they thought Bush should do more. But  measures they favored, harsher penalties and tougher law enforcement, were  consistent with Bush's anti-crime approach.  </P> <P> On the other hand, blacks and other low-income citizens, who are most directly  afflicted by the problem, wanted more federal funding -- and especially more  attention to treatment and prevention.  </P> <P> That tends to push Democrats into the position of urging higher spending on  people many white voters regard as threatening, not objects of sympathy.  Instead of regarding drug abuse as a social welfare need like health care and  child care, which Democrats have a good reputation for handling, middle-class  voters are expected increasingly to see drugs as a crime problem. And crime is  an area in which voters generally consider Democrats to be weaker than  Republicans, a point Bush reinforced during the 1988 campaign.  </P> <P> What makes such prospects particularly bitter for Democrats is that until Bush  tackled the problem in full view of the television cameras, their party  appeared to have an advantage on the drug issue. As they are quick to point  out, Democratic congressional leaders last year pushed through the 1988 omnibus  anti-drug abuse bill, which created the White House Office of National Drug  Control Policy that Bennett now heads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Forced to Act  </P> <P> The new law also made it difficult for Bush not to confront the drug issue by  requiring that he submit a national plan for a drug war.  </P> <P> Perhaps as a result of such efforts, Democrats can cite polling data before the  speech that showed voters had more confidence in them than in Republicans to  solve the drug problem. And other polls indicated voters recalled that Bush had  been more or less in charge of fighting the drug problem as former President  Ronald Reagan's vice president and agreed he had failed to accomplish much.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Altered Perceptions  </P> <P> But by unveiling his own proposal and putting the prestige of his office behind  it, Bush seems to have altered these perceptions.  </P> <P> Democrats contend that Bush will not be able to sustain his current high  approval ratings unless he can make significant progress in the drug war --  progress they say is unlikely, given what they regard as the inadequacies of  his program.  </P> <P> "The question is whether it's a program that really gets at the problem," said  Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee. "And the  answer depends on the total level of Uzi shells you find on the street corner  in your neighborhood."  </P> <P> His reference was to the drug-related gun battles and other street crimes that  take place almost exclusively in the inner cities, not the suburbs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Symbolic Threat  </P> <P> It is true, as Democrats point out, that middle-class citizens feel threatened  by inner-city crime. But this threat mainly is symbolic and indirect, based on  impressions conveyed by the news media.  </P> <P> And Bush and his advisers, who showed themselves in the 1988 campaign to be  masters of creating media impressions favorable to themselves, already have  begun to make their mark on the drug war. The President has been on television  regularly, demonstrating his concern over the drug problem to middle-class  voters.  </P> <P> One day he managed to establish a link to schoolchildren, urging them "not to  look the other way" if their friends start using drugs, and to reinforce his  commitment to law and order by flashing the badge of a New York City policeman  slain in a drug investigation.  </P> <P> Moreover, Bush expects to be able to back up the symbols with statistics,  measuring decline of drug use in accordance with goals set by Bennett. As  critics point out, the goals seem notably modest, aiming for declines in  middle-class drug use at a slower rate than was recorded even before Bush  launched his program.  </P> <P> In their frustration over the issue, Democrats were quick to complain that the  President's proposals did not go far enough, particularly in the areas of  treatment and prevention. "The Democrats are taking some risk in going on the  attack," said A. James Reichley, Brookings Institution specialist in  presidential-congressional relations. "The public has no great conviction that  Bush's plan will work. But they think it needs to be tried."  </P></p>

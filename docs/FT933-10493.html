			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Rise in M0 lifts hopes of recovery A SHARP rise in the amount of money in circulation last month provided further evidence that the economic recovery is continuing. Bank of England figures yesterday showed that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, grew a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in July, the largest monthly rise since September 1988. It had risen only 0.3 per cent in May. Last month's figures lifted the year-on-year growth rate to 4.8 per cent, an increase on June's figure of 4.4 per cent, and significantly above the government's zero to 4 per cent monitoring range. Other figures yesterday from the British Bankers Association confirmed that lending by the main retail banks in the second quarter was Pounds 5.1bn compared with Pounds 4.1bn in the first quarter. The association said part of the increase over the first quarter represented the normal seasonal element, but that compared with the same quarter a year ago lending was 19 per cent higher. The association believes there has been an upturn in bank lending, albeit from a low level. The rise in notes and coin in circulation, which comprises almost all of M0, was somewhat smaller at 1.1 per cent month on month. But it was still the fastest growth since March. Some analysts said the rise in M0 meant retail sales would also turn out to have strengthened last month, because the two figures are considered to follow a similar pattern. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The continued gain in M0 contrasts with the more downbeat signs in the CBI's survey. It suggests that retail sales remain on an up trend.' Others warned against reading too much into the new data. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at brokers Midland Global Markets, said: 'Monthly M0 figures can give a very distorted picture. July's sharp increase is a one-off to make up for the fall which occurred in May. There is absolutely no reason to think that the narrow money growth is accelerating.' Strong M0 growth has been apparent since the start of the year. In the latest six months, on a year-on-year basis, it grew by 5.7 per cent. Official gold and foreign currency reserves rose by an underlying Dollars 395m last month, including proceeds of Dollars 213m from the third British Telecommunications share sale. The overall level of reserves rose by Dollars 1.42bn, taking reserves at the end of the month to Dollars 43.3bn. Proceeds from the quarterly tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes amounted to Dollars 636m while the existing amount outstanding under the UK Ecu-denominated revolving credit facility fell by Dollars 4m as a result of exchange rate changes, the Treasury said.</p>

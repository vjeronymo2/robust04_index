			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> EPILOGUE;  </P> <P> ON ENTERING AN AGE OF PARADOX  </P> <P> "Start with the recognition that something profound has happened," said former  Secretary of State George P. Shultz, reflecting on the changes sweeping the  world. "This is a new epoch. That doesn't mean everything is different -- but  it means all the important things are different."  </P> <P> For five centuries, history seemed to move -- with frequent reverses and  sidetracks, of course -- largely in one direction: toward a single, global  civilization based on universal democracy, free trade and secular governance by  increasingly powerful nation-states.  </P> <P> But now history has bumped into new realities, from the revival of ethnic and  religious fervor to the increasing obsolescence of the nation-state. Is this,  as some have argued, the "end" of the historical progression? Is it a return to  an earlier age, the game of nations of the centuries before the Cold War? Or is  it a transition to a new path?  </P> <P> We are still caught in midstream; our vision is still too close up. When  Columbus returned home to Spain five centuries ago, he believed that he had  found the Indies; it never occurred to him that he had, instead, found an  entire hemisphere and helped invent the modern world. Like Columbus, we may  need another decade or two of exploration before we know exactly where we are.  </P> <P> The least that can be said is that we are entering an age of paradox:  </P> <P> * A world that is becoming simultaneously more violent and less dangerous --  more warlike in some ways, more pacific in others. For every conflict resolved,  from Berlin to Managua, a new one springs up to take its place.  </P> <P> * A world in which the United States stands uncontested as a global leader --  the organizer and spearhead of a vast alliance in the Persian Gulf -- yet finds  its power more circumscribed than at any time in a century. The real change has  not been the historically common redistribution of power among a few big  countries, but a wholesale diffusion of influence among countries, corporations  and populist groups of many stripes.  </P> <P> * A world in which nations still pursue power and wealth, but sometimes find  that the best way to gain more power is to surrender some to others. Witness  the nations of Western Europe that have found greater strength and influence  than at any time since World War II by yielding sovereignty to the European  Community.  </P> <P> * A world in which the quest for new political freedom and the demands of  economic competition push societies in two directions at once, integration and  disintegration. Czechs and Slovaks, Kashmiris and Croats, all want some variant  of the same paradoxical goal: political and cultural autonomy combined with a  place in the global economy.  </P> <P> * A world in which the standard of living of billions of people surges ahead,  accompanied by a rising sense of dissatisfaction. From the new democracies of  Eastern Europe and Latin America to the emerging economies of India and  Thailand, people expect democracy to bring an approximation of the Western  prosperity they see on their television screens.  </P> <P> Compared to this new world of paradox, the 40-year-long Cold War was an era of  unusual clarity: two superpowers, two economic systems, two competing creeds,  each fully occupied with the overriding purpose of besting the other.  </P> <P> The challenge facing President Bush and Americans today is more ambiguous. As a  people, Americans like their foreign policy to join the national interest with  solid principles. But how far can that be carried in such a fragmented and  tumultuous world?  </P> <P> Bush for one has insisted that the United States must continue its world  leadership. And he has made gestures toward defining a new goal, especially in  his speeches explaining the dispatch of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia: "Out of  these troubled times . . . a new world order can emerge . . . " he told  Congress.  </P> <P> What the Administration has failed to do is develop a plan for achieving that  new world order.  </P> <P> "We need a strategic concept, and we aren't hearing one," said Paul H. Nitze,  who helped draft President Harry S. Truman's strategies for containing  communism. Last spring, the 83-year-old ex-Cold War warrior drafted another  one, much as he had 43 years before. "The central theme the United States  should support in the future is the accommodation and protection of diversity,"  he wrote -- "a world climate in which a large array of political groupings can  emerge, each in its own individual, and perhaps eccentric, way."  </P> <P> Whether it is Nitze's vision or something else, the objectives of a strategy  for the decades ahead will be complex. One element must be preventing the  outbreak of major wars. Another must be enhancing America's economic  competitiveness. But the nation must do more than avoid military conflagration  and make money. It must renew its own vision -- for the sake of its own people  and for millions around the world who still look to America for evidence that  ideals can be made real.  </P> <P> "We are looking for something new -- organization, structure, concept," said  Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France. "What is strange is  that, at the moment, there is no thinker who is suggesting a possible course."  </P> <P> Part of the problem, ironically, stems from America's success in winning the  Cold War: It may be more difficult to unlearn old habits and remake old  institutions in the wake of victory than in the face of defeat.  </P> <P> Sometime around 1985, in his third year as secretary of state, Shultz came to  see that the world was changing in fundamental ways and asked his aides at the  State Department to prepare a study. But the bureaucrats, adept as they were at  examining immediate, specific problems, could not focus on the long range.  "Everybody wanted to discuss the subject in terms of the treaties we had to  negotiate," Shultz recalls, "but I said . . . 'That's not what I have in mind.  I'd like to have somebody who's capable of thinking big and broad.' "  </P> <P> Unable to delegate the task, the secretary of state, an economist and former  university professor, did it himself -- "in my spare time," as he explained  later.  </P> <P> "My thesis was (that) the world is in a different age and it's an information  age, and in order to flourish in such an age, people have to have a sense of  freedom and openness," Shultz says. He realized that an opportunity might exist  to influence the basic attitudes of a newly appointed Soviet leader, Mikhail S.  Gorbachev. In a series of contacts with Soviet officials, Shultz tried to  convince him that the Soviet Union could prosper only if it opened up its  political and economic system. It was an effort that Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze later described as "very important" in the evolution of  Soviet reform.  </P> <P> Alas, deriving immediate policy from a comprehensive vision of the future is  the exception, not the rule. Moreover, the way the government is organized  often fragments policy-making. Economic policy, for instance, is often divided  from political and diplomatic policy, even though -- especially in today's  world -- the three should be closely coordinated.  </P> <P> Some of the government's institutions have tried to change in response to the  new realities. One year ago, the Central Intelligence Agency created a new  division -- the "fifth directorate," to focus on global changes that fell  between the cracks of traditional, region-by-region intelligence analysis. But  one involved official observed: "We know how to watch, but we don't know how to  get people (in the Administration) to pay attention."  </P> <P> The transition from one era to another is never a simple affair. Historians  cannot mark the point clearly on a calendar; they can only note the seismic  events, like the collapse of the Berlin Wall or the invasion of Kuwait, which  reveal that the terrain has changed.  </P> <P> The end of the Middle Ages and the opening of the Modern Age began around the  time of Columbus' first voyage in 1492, but it was two centuries before that  transformation was complete. Even the birth of the Cold War in the ashes of  World War II took more than two years. History is moving faster now, but its  path is far from fixed. Many and various as the snares may be, there is still  time for leadership to affect history's course -- for good or ill.  </P></p>

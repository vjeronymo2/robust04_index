			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Raise the Level of Propaganda and </F> Ideological Work, Strive To Accomplish Our Historical Mission";  from the "News" program]    [Text] The regional propaganda and ideological work  conference has come to a successful conclusion. This is a  significant meeting of the largest scale and highest quality in  the regional propaganda and ideological front since Tibet's  peaceful liberation. The spirit of the conference will  certainly have a far-reaching influence on propaganda and  ideological work in Tibet, and will contribute positively to its  reform, development, stability, and all-round social progress.  Party and government organizations at all levels as well as the  propaganda and ideological front must earnestly implement the  spirit of the conference by obtaining a clearer understanding of  the situation, further emancipating minds, achieving greater  unity in understanding, and heightening spirits so as to  effectively strengthen and improve propaganda and ideological  work throughout the region.    Propaganda and ideological work has always been an important  component of the party's work. In the past four decades since  Tibet's peaceful liberation, the propaganda and ideological  front has done a tremendous job and achieved remarkable  achievements in earnestly implementing the party's basic  theories and lines in various historical stages to bring about  momentous changes in Tibetan society and to accomplish the  party's various tasks. Especially since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the propaganda and  ideological front has greatly inspired cadres and people  throughout Tibet to emancipate their minds and change their  mindsets; it has harnessed the initiative, enthusiasm, and  creativity of the masses in dedicating themselves to reform and  the establishment of a socialist market economy. It has also  effectively promoted the anti-splittist struggle and stability;  has enriched the people's spiritual and cultural life; has  publicized the outstanding Tibetan cultural traditions; has  safeguarded the motherland's unification and unity of  nationalities; and has facilitated the smooth progress of  reform, opening up, and modernization construction in Tibet.  The facts have proved that Tibet's propaganda and ideological  workers are a contingent of people loyal to the cause of the  party and the people; who possess special strengths and fighting  capacity to endure hardships and sacrifice; who are full of  vigor and vitality; and who can be trusted by the party and the  people.    Under the party's correct leadership, people of all  nationalities in Tibet are implementing the guidelines of the  14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary Enlarged  Session of the Fourth Regional Party Committee; they are  striving to build a new socialist market economic system. A new  situation of reform and opening up has emerged in Tibet. In the  process of this historic change, the propaganda and ideological  front is confronted with two fundamental tasks: to study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and conscientiously adhere to the party's basic  line to facilitate Tibet's socialist modernization and safeguard  the motherland's unification, and to enhance the unity of  nationalities and oppose splittist forces in order to ensure  Tibet's social stability. In the final analysis, these two  fundamental tasks are issues concerning reform, development, and  stability; they are the main issues of Tibetan social life at  present and for some time to come in the future.    All propaganda and ideological departments in Tibet should  firmly grasp these issues. They should follow Comrade Jiang  Zemin's instruction that we should arm our people with  scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion,  inculcate them with noble ideals, and encourage them with fine  works of literature and art. They should persist in the  orientation of serving the people and socialism, and should  adhere to the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a  hundred schools of thought contend. They should bring into play  their specialties and advantages in publicizing the spirits of  our times, promoting a flourishing socialist literature and art,  and creating more and better quality intellectual products to  the delight of the masses. They should continuously satisfy the  masses' growing demands in spiritual and cultural life, raise  the level of propaganda and ideological work, enhance propaganda  effects, and work hard for Tibet's social stability and economic  growth.    The propaganda and ideological front is facing a glorious  yet  arduous task. Presently propaganda and ideological departments  in Tibet are facing difficulties and still cannot cope up with  the demands in building the two civilizations and in stabilizing  the situation. However, we are convinced that so long as  propaganda and ideological departments take the just concluded  regional propaganda and ideological work conference as a new  starting point and work hard to forge ahead and fulfill various  tasks, they will certainly be able to raise the level of  propaganda and ideological work in Tibet and accomplish the  historical mission entrusted by our times upon propaganda and  ideological work.</p>

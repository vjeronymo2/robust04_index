			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Europe will follow US lead over high-definition TV EUROPE will have to fall in line with the US on a transmission standard for digital high-definition television, the EC industry commissioner has said. Mr Martin Bangemann said there was no point starting a global battle over advanced television standards by trying to set an exclusive EC standard. His comments mark the end of the EC's costly standards-based HDTV strategy and could mean that the US technology, which should be selected later this year, will be adopted worldwide. Mr Bangemann, who took over responsibility for HDTV last month, says the EC should concentrate on salvaging the best elements of its ill-fated eight-year programme to develop advanced, cinema-quality television. 'A digital standard doesn't need to be set (by the EC),' he said. 'Global standards are always the best solution.' EC taxpayers have invested at least Ecu625m (Pounds 516m) in research and development of analogue HDTV since 1986. Companies such as Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France have also ploughed funds into developing the EC standards, and are ready to mass-produce televisions to those norms. The aim of exclusive technical standards for European HDTV was to gain a head start against Japan and the US. But technological advances and political opposition have meant that EC satellite transmission technology has been almost overtaken by US digital standards. Mr Bangemann believes digital technology could be developed by 1997. Unlike EC analogue technology, digital standards can be used for broadcasts by terrestrial television stations. Britain is blocking further EC funding of Ecu500m over the next five years, on the grounds that digital technology may arrive on the market earlier than predicted. As a result, Philips announced last month it would not start making HDTV televisions to European standards. However, if the EC does adopt the US standard, the two principal EC manufacturers will not necessarily lose because they are both involved in one of the consortia bidding to produce the US technology. Philips and Thomson also argue that the HDTV programme has had useful spin-offs. Japan, which has concentrated on analogue HDTV technology, may also be forced to adopt the US digital norms. Analysts estimate digital HDTV in Japan and Europe will lag about five years behind the US. Mr Bangemann is now seeking to amend the commission's plans to concentrate on developing lighter, cheaper wide-screen televisions, and the conversion and production of programmes for the wide-screen format. The commission has asked the Danish presidency of the EC for a special meeting of telecommunications ministers to debate the future of HDTV policy, ahead of the scheduled council on May 10.

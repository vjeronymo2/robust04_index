			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus,  reacting to statements by Polish President Lech Walesa in  today's LIDOVE NOVINY, said he would be a bad Czech politicians  if he did not place the Czech interests above the joint aims,  never formulated, of the Visegrad Four.    "I am very disappointed," Walesa told the paper. "In  difficult times, solidarity is necessary," Walesa said. "But  here, priority is given to some particular interest over common  aims. In my opinion, (the Czech politicians) are committing a  mistake which will cost all of us something. If the talks fail,  we will have to say that the organizers are to be blamed.  Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles wanted a joint strategy. I even  proposed that Vaclav Klaus presented the joint statement on  behalf of the four countries. But I did not manage," Walesa  stated.    Walesa is right in accusing the Czech Republic of placing  Czech interests over the joint aims of the Visegrad countries,  Klaus said, saying he thought that Walesa was also placing  Poland's interests before the Visegrad Four's. The joint  interests of the Visegrad Four are a common denominator of the  four countries' interests, nothing more and nothing less, Klaus  said.    "The offer to present a common position of the four  countries  Walesa is talking about was never conveyed to me. As a result,  I could not have refused it," Klaus stated.    Klaus added that the Czech Republic had neither organized  nor  initiated the talks of U.S. President Bill Clinton with Visegrad  Four representatives. The Czech Republic "only" gladly accepted  the American initiative and welcomed the idea of holding the  talks in Prague. Klaus said he could not see any reason why the  talks should fail.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Points To Ponder In Enacting Money Laundering Control Law" </F> by "Nakhon Thon Bank's Technical Section"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The application of the law  against money laundering will support the prevention of  laundering illicit money, help prevent damage to the financial  system, help discourage financial crime, and prepare the country  to become the regional financial center. It will also create a  good image and credibility in the eyes of other countries. the  following points should be taken into account, however:    1. The application of the law against money laundering will  involve several agencies, such as the Finance Ministry, the Bank  of Thailand, the financial institutions, and the law enforcement  agencies. Therefore, these agencies should jointly study the  impact of the law.    2. The law should be considered in conjunction with the  principles of the financial liberalization policy and the  national economic development policy.    3. Other relevant laws and the money laundering laws of  other  countries should be studied for possible adaptation.    4. The methods and tricks used in money laundering, which  are  becoming increasingly complicated as time passes, should be  monitored.    5. More steps that have to be followed by foreign investors  should be taken into consideration, as well as the trouble these  steps may cause them.    6. The increased burden and cost to financial institutions  must be considered.    7. Legitimate rights of honest businesspeople must not be  affected.    In any event, before a money laundering law is in effect,  effective control and monitoring measures existing in current  laws can help prevent and control money laundering practices.</p>

A few days ago,  a number of experts spoke on four major existing problems when  analyzing and forecasting the social situation in China.    1. Severe conflicts and problems have arisen in some  important social and economic fields. Consequently, social  lives are being markedly affected, and there are more unstable  factors appearing in the social order.    It has been learned that, from January to September 1993,  the  cost of living in large and medium cities in China reached the  highest growth rate compared with the same periods over the past  several years. At the same time, the unemployment rate has been  increasing, and the number of all sorts of cases handled by the  public security organs has also increased slightly compared with  that of the same period of last year. In addition, the blind  establishment of development zones became a very severe  phenomenon. This kind of chaotic economic life affects the  overall mentality of society and has an adverse effect on the  country's political, economic, and social life.    2. Corrupt practices committed by a handful of officials  have been quite severe. They have abused power for private gain  and have squandered and embezzled state property, which does  great damage to the image of the party and the state and  corrupts social values. According to the statistics, from  January to September 1993, over 5,000 party and state  functionaries were involved in cases cracked by procuratorial  organs throughout the country, including 20 cadres at the  department and bureau levels, one cadre at the vice-minister  level, and more than 1,100 judicial personnel who were  prosecuted for committing crimes. During this period, over  40,000 economic cases of corruption, bribery, and embezzlement  of public funds were placed on file for investigation, including  nearly 24,000 large cases, each involving over 10,000 yuan, and  a total of 504 officials at and above the county and department  levels.    3. Not much progress is being made in readjusting various  social relations. Those which are most important are: The  relations between the central and local authorities are being  affected by some negative factors, and the gap between the  coastal developed areas and other localities is widening. The  growth of investment along the coastal areas in eastern China is  obviously higher than that of the areas in central and western  China. As far as the investment made by state-owned units in  October 1993 was concerned, investment made by 12 coastal areas  in East China exceeded 43 billion yuan, registering an increase  of nearly 76 percent over that of the same period last year.  Investment made by eight areas in central China exceeded 16  billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent, and investment made by  nine areas in West China reached 8.6 billion yuan, which merely  increased 20 percent. Moreover, it is still very obvious that  the gap between urban and rural income is putting more and more  peasants in a psychologically unbalanced state .    4. The extent of conformity in terms of social ethics and  value concepts is lower; money worship has become a prevailing  trend; the "blank spots" of social norms have not been filled  promptly; all kinds of immoral behavior still exist even though  efforts are repeatedly made to check it; and the phenomenon of  lacking ethical progress is worsening.    The experts have advised that real progress in the  anticorruption struggle should be made this year, and a critical  step should be taken to establish sound laws and systems  accordingly.    They maintained that the central government's authority  should be strengthened to straighten out the relations between  the central and local authorities and that the promotion of the  divisional taxation system should be used as opportunity to  establish new relations between the two.    In addition, they also suggested that the media should be  used to give wide publicity to the central government's policies  and that it is necessary to let the people air their opinions  more frequently, to communicate with them, to monitor changes in  public opinion, and to promptly redress the grievances of the  masses. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to strengthen the  supervisory and communication functions of the media so as to  purify the general mood of society and to enhance social  cohesion.</p>

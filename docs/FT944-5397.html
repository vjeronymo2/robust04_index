			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Haunting glimpse of a future imperfect - Wall Street / Bonds can see the light but the stock market omens are gloomy In normal times, evidence of a strengthening economy is bad news for the bond market and good news for the stock market. There are sensible reasons for this: typically, economic growth feeds inflation. This undermines the value of bonds but, at the same time, bolsters corporate earnings, which boosts the value of company's share prices. These, however, are anything but normal times. Take yesterday. The US government released one of the most encouraging monthly employment reports in recent years. The statistics showed that an impressive 350,000 people were added to non-farm payrolls in November (analysts had predicted an increase of about 250,000). Also, the national unemployment rate last month fell from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent, an unexpected decline which took the jobless rate to its lowest since August 1990. Yet, contrary to traditional behaviour, the November jobs data prompted a surge in bonds and a decline in stocks. By mid-morning yesterday, the 30-year bond price was up more than three-quarters of a point and its yield back below 8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had retreated from early gains and was below 3,700 for the first time since early July. What was going on? In a word: 'decoupling'. Ever since the Dow plunged more than 90 points on November 22, Wall Street has been talking about the decoupling of the stock and bond market. Although share prices have not crashed to the extent of bond prices, stocks have been following the Treasury market's lead for the best part of this year. Investors in bonds feared rising inflation and rising interest rates - worries that were shared by investors in stocks. They curbed their demand for equities even though the inflation data remained reassuring and rising interest rates appeared to be having little impact upon economic or corporate earnings growth. Now, however, the paths of the two markets appear to have diverged. In the past 10 days, the Dow has fallen 3.7 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of stock market performance, has slipped 2.6 per cent. Bond prices, however, have risen over that period, lowering the yield on the long bond from 8.1 to 7.9 per cent. The gains in bonds have been all the more remarkable because recent data has showed few signs of any impending slow-down in the economy. Just the opposite, in fact. This week alone, figures on third-quarter gross domestic product (revised upwards), consumer confidence (at a four-year high), retail sales (strong), manufacturers' purchases (at high levels) and employment (robust) all pointed to continued growth in economic activity. The bond market's rally in the face of such seemingly-negative data reflects an important shift in opinion among investors. Confident in the belief that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy (six interest rate increases in the past 10 months) will slow growth significantly next year and subdue any inflationary pressures in the economy, investors are now impervious to bad (ie, good) news on the economy. After a dark and dismal 10 months, the bond market can see light at the end of the tunnel. For the stock market, however, that light represents an oncoming train which, in the form of an economic contraction (or, quite possibly, a full-blown recession) is going to smash into corporate profits, equity valuations and investor sentiment. In anticipation of that collision, some investors are already taking flight. This week, fund managers reported that, for the the first time in a long while, investors have begun to take more money out of stock mutual funds than they have been putting in. Much of those cash outflows are heading into more money-market funds or bank certificates of deposit which offer investors a combination of security and increasingly attractive comparable yields. Although it is too early to tell if this trend will be sustained, the sight of money flowing out of mutual funds is a troubling portent for a market that has feasted on huge demand from equity funds for the best part of four years. To make matters worse, foreign investors also are shying away from the stock market because of concerns about the outlook for earnings and share prices. In the second quarter (the latest period for which data is available), foreign investors sold a net Dollars 2.2bn of US stocks. It was the first time since mid-1992 that institutions and individuals overseas had sold more US stocks than they had bought. When the foreign investors' sales, the outflows of cash from stock mutual funds, and the string of recent circulars from Wall Street broking houses recommending clients to cut their holdings of equities are all put together, the omens for the market are not good. In a week when the latest musical version of Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol opened on Broadway, the stock market got a glimpse of its future. It was a haunting sight.  -------------------------------------- Dow Jones Ind Average  -------------------------------------- Monday     3,739.56  +31.29 Tuesday    3,738.55   -1.01 Wednesday  3,739.23   +0.68 Thursday   3,700.87  -38.36 Friday     3,745.62  +44.75  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Friendship organisations  of Japan called for a detente on the Korean peninsula.    The Kochi prefectural council for the promotion of  Japan-Korea friendship in a statement April 11 said tensions  will increase and the danger of war will not disappear in the  world as long as the United States continues to seek "domination  of the world by strength". It demanded an immediate halt to the  clamor for "sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea.    The statement urged that the United States should  discontinue  the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for good, withdraw  its forces from South Korea and sign a peace agreement with the  DPRK through talks with it.    Speaking at the sixth Kennan, Ibaraki Prefecture,  Japan-Korea  friendship district meeting held on April 24, the chairman of  the Kennan district liaison council for Japan-Korea solidarity,  Tamaru Kawaguchi, said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.    A letter of request to the Japanese Government was adopted  at  the meeting.</p>

Estonian authorities don't know who these people are,  because  the Russian embassy has refused to reveal the names of its  country's citizens here, Olesk said.    "Russian Ambassador Alexander Trofimov told me at the end of  last year that the names were not to be revealed because the  people had so requested for the fear of persecution. Some kind  of possibility to check who these people are will come up when  the Citizenship and Migration Department starts receiving  applications for excluding these people from Estonian  citizenship," the Estonian minister said.    Only two such applications have been submitted so far.    Olesk said Russia was pursuing a policy of dual citizenship,  when Russian citizens don't have to declare giving up the other  country's citizenship," he said. Therefore it is impossible for  Estonian authorities to know whether a person is a Russian  citizen, holds dual citizenship or is a stateless person, Olesk  added.    The minister said that about 11,000 persons had become  naturalized Estonian citizens after the country regained its  independence. He didn't rule out that some of them might be  simultaneously Russian citizens.    He said it was in the interests of Estonia's national  security to avoid the formation of a large Russian citizen  community in Estonia. He said massive presence of legal Russian  citizens in Estonia would provide Russia with good opportunity  to interfere with Estonia's internal affairs and prompt the  Russian-speakers to set territorial claims.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Cuts phased in to protect recovery - Miras THE MEASURE A further reduction in the rate of mortgage interest relief, taking it to 15 per cent from April 1995. IN DETAIL The rate of mortgage interest relief will come down by 5 per cent in each of the next two years, falling from 25 per cent at present to 20 per cent in April next year as announced in the March Budget, and to 15 per cent in April the following year. The ceiling of Pounds 30,000 on the amount of home loan that qualifies for relief will remain unchanged. This latest reduction would cost someone with an endowment mortgage of Pounds 30,000 or more about Pounds 10 a month. This was only a 'tiny fraction' of the benefits people had received from the fall in interest rates over the past three years, the chancellor said, but will come on top of the similar-sized increase in monthly payments as a result of the cut in the relief announced in March. The effect of the reduction in relief will be offset by the cuts in mortgage rates expected to be announced shortly by many of the largest building societies in the wake of last week's 0.5 of a percentage point cut in base rates. The Nationwide has indicated that it will be cutting its mortgage rate from 7.99 per cent to 7.74 per cent, and other societies are expected to follow suit. THE BACKGROUND While the combined effect of the two-stage change will be an increase in mortgage repayments of Pounds 20 or so a month, the phasing of the cuts in mortgage interest relief appears to be helping to raise revenue without jeopardising the fragile recovery in the housing market. The shift in the rate of the relief has intensified expectations that mortgage interest relief will be abolished altogether in the coming years.</p>

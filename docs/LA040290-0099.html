			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> QUESTION: What's worse than too many Medflies? Answer: Not enough. . . .  California's entire congressional delegation has signed a letter demanding  faster production of sterile Medflies at the federal government's Hawaiian  laboratory. . . . Released in hordes, the sterile flies interfere with normal  breeding and are an alternative to controversial aerial spraying. . . . A  federal official said 100 million sterile Medflies will be sent to California  this week but that full production -- 500 million a week -- won't be achieved  before October. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

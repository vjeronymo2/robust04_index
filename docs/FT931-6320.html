			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / GPA shares priced at Dollars 1 in latest issue GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, is offering its shareholders the right to buy shares at Dollars 1, compared with the Dollars 30 it said they were worth less than a year ago. In an attempt to raise new funds, GPA has set the conversion price of its Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) preference share issue at Dollars 1. The cash is needed to ensure the company's survival. The price compares with Dollars 20 a share offered in the Irish-based company's aborted flotation last June and the Dollars 30 a share it said they were worth less than a year ago. Nomura International, the Japanese securities house which is organising the new share issue, has told GPA's shareholders that restructuring the Dollars 5.5bn of debts depends on raising new equity. Shareholders have been asked to give their response before the end of this month, when the restructuring is due to be completed. One shareholder said: 'If we do not take part in this share issue, we have been told the banks will take effective control of the company.' It is the third time in less than a year GPA investors have been asked to raise cash. The company was forced to pull a preference share issue, with a conversion price of Dollars 8, at the end of last year following its failure to go public in the summer. Of the four big shareholders which account for 35 per cent of the group, Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, is unlikely to take part. A spokesman said last night that the airline was 'keeping the situation under close review. The matter was discussed at last week's board meeting and no decision was made.' Air Canada has not yet made a decision. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation and Irish Life are understood to be inclined to take part, although part of Irish Life's shareholding is made up of non-beneficial trusts which may not take up the new shares. Other shareholders contacted yesterday said they had yet to decide whether to take up the new shares. GPA's banks have already make clear they will only agree to the restructuring if shareholders take part in the new issue. The banks are being asked to defer to late 1996 approximately Dollars 1bn of debt repayments due between the end of last year and September 30. The issue means a dilution of stakes owned by shareholders unable to take part in the fund raising.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (4): Points scored - Jyske Bank discloses more than expected Jyske Bank, the Jutland-based bank which ranks as the country's fourth largest with assets of about DKr56bn, has long enjoyed the role of provocateur, never losing an opportunity to score verbal points off the big Copenhagen-based banks. It has done it again this year. It has defied the recommendations of the Bankers' Association and the Finance Supervisory Authority by disclosing much more information about the bank in its 1993 annual report than the supervisors recommend or other banks disclose. Jyske's action has not met with universal acclaim, and some of the wind was taken out of its sails by Unidanmark, which when it launched its international equity issue in February had to disclose more information in the prospectus than would have been required by an issue directed at domestic investors). There was just a touch of sour grapes in the comment from a senior manager at Den Danske Bank, who pointed out that much more extensive disclosure practices by the Swedish banks had not helped either them or their investors to foresee the difficulties which the Swedish banks met in 1991-92. The problem is not so much a general desire to restrict disclosure, however, as the argument that the banks should first agree on what to disclose and to ensure that the criteria for the information disclosed means that like can be safely compared with like. The problem is a long-standing one, and the Bankers'Association and the Supervisory Authority are still working towards acceptable definitions and standards. Information which is not normally disclosed by Danish banks includes the size of non-performing loans, the size of the contingency reserve (the sum of past loss provisions after deduction of realised losses), lending by business sectors, and a detailed analysis of credit policy and market risks arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange gyrations, share price movements, and liquidity risks. 'I'm blowed if I can see why we shouldn't tell our own shareholders and customers as much as Unibank has to tell foreign investors,' said Jyske's chief executive, Mr Kaj Steenkjaer, when he presented his bank's 1993 annual report at the bank's headquarters in the mid-Jutland town of Silkeborg. The report contains all the above information and more and he received an accolade on the same occasion from the bank's biggest shareholder, the representative of the ATP National Labour Market Pension Fund, for its efforts to improve the transparency and informative value of its own accounts. Jyske demonstrated the courage of its convictions by increasing disclosure at a time when it is still carrying heavy loss provisions, rather than waiting for a year when everything looked wonderful. Like all the banks, the bottom line improved last year. Jyske made a profit of DKr429m compared with a 1992 loss of DKr919m. Loss provisions were cut to DKr844m from DKr1.26bn in 1992, while realised and unrealised gains on securities added Dkr708m to 1993 profits against a loss of DKr7m in 1992. The bank's capital adequacy ratio is strong, with tier one capital at 8.1 per cent of risk-weighted assets and its total capital adequacy ratio at 10.9 per cent. But non-performing credits, which were under one per cent of loans and guarantees in 1989, climbed to 4.10 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 1992. Loss provisions were still a relatively high 2.2 per cent of loans and guarantees, though down from a peak of 3.1 per cent in 1992. We also now know that Jyske Bank always has DKR2bn in liquid assets on hand to meet day-to-day needs, or about five per cent of deposits. At the end of last year it had liquid assets on hand to cover a period of 12 weeks in a worst-case situation, when no deposits were renewed. The message seems to be clear: there's no need to rush.</p>

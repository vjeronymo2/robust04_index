			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Sterling is suspended within ERM: Government forced to retreat MR JOHN MAJOR'S government was last night forced into a humiliating climbdown from its attempt to hold sterling's value against the D-Mark. The reversal came after an unprecedented 5 percentage point rise in interest rates to 15 per cent failed to avert a full-scale sterling crisis. The announcement that sterling's membership was being 'suspended' in the exchange rate mechanism brought acknowledgment at Westminster that the pound would be devalued against the D-Mark before rejoining the ERM. The decision meant sterling was, in effect, left to float at the mercy of the markets. The depth of the political and economic crisis was underlined last night when the government bowed to opposition demands and announced that parliament would be recalled next Thursday. Sterling's fall below its ERM floor had begun after the close of trade in Europe and finished in New York last night about 8 pfennigs below the floor. The decision to suspend sterling plunged Mr Major's government into political turmoil, undercutting the central plank of the prime minister's economic strategy. Mr Major had repeatedly insisted that he would never devalue. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the suspension meant that the second of the two interest rate rises announced during yesterday's chaos would not come into effect. Base rates will stand at 12 per cent this morning, against 10 per cent yesterday. As senior EC officials began talks in Brussels - at the invitation of Mr Lamont in his capacity as president of the EC finance council - on the turmoil which engulfed the European exchange rate mechanism, there was speculation among Tory MPs that Mr Lamont might be forced to resign  - but the initial signals from 10 Downing Street were that he would remain in office. Mr Lamont was understood to be hoping that sterling would rejoin the ERM on Monday, after the French referendum. However there is no precedent for a currency suspending its ERM membership. No decision has been taken on the level at which sterling would rejoin the mechanism. As the atmosphere of crisis engulfed Whitehall, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, joined ministers to discuss whether the government would have to abandon the central plank of its anti-inflation strategy - maintaining sterling's DM2.95 central rate in the ERM. In spite of yesterday's increase in UK interest rates and massive central bank intervention to support the pound, sterling had closed in London at DM2.7500, down 3 pfennigs on the day and below its ERM floor of DM2.778. The government's vain efforts to defend the currency began with large-scale buying of pounds by the Bank of England. Next came the announcement of two rises in interest rates and finally, the suspension of the currency in the ERM coupled with a reversal of the second of the increases in borrowing rates. Yesterday was the first time in modern history that the Bank had raised interest rates twice in one day. It is also the first time on record that UK interest rates rose 5 percentage points within 24 hours. The rises in interest rates came as the Bank of England spent an estimated Pounds 7bn - roughly a third of its foreign currency reserves - in buying sterling for D-Marks. The Bundesbank and the Bank of France co-operated in the intervention to prop up the UK currency, spending an estimated Pounds 2bn. The increase in credit rates, coming as Britain remains in the grip of its longest peactime recession since the 1930s, was defended earlier in the day by Mr Lamont on the grounds that Britain would 'take whatever measures are necessary' to maintain sterling's ERM parity. The speculation against the present ERM parities also threatened to spark a political crisis within the European Community, with Britain blaming the Bundesbank for fuelling the speculators' selling of the pound. The series of emergency meetings of government ministers yesterday had prompted widespread speculation in Whitehall that Mr Lamont would have to leave the government if there were a general realignment of ERM currencies. One or two Tory MPs called publicly for the chancellor to resign immediately. Among those summoned by Mr Major to his temporary Whitehall office were Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. As the clamour grew, prompted in part by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for a recall of parliament from its summer recess, Mr Major also consulted party managers and senior Tory backbenchers. The rises in interest rates had brought protests from business and the threat of open revolt by some Conservative MPs. Mr William Cash, a Tory backbencher and a stern critic of Mr Major's ERM policy, said: 'We are in a state of political shambles.' One suggestion last night was that the present ERM parity would be suspended until after the result of Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht. Another was that the pound would be devalued with the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta in a general realignment of exchange rates which could include another cut in German interest rates. The two interest rate hikes effectively wiped out all the reductions in interest rates since Mr Major took sterling into the ERM as chancellor two years ago. Labour officials were suggesting last night that the opposition would to make the prime minister - rather than the chancellor - the principal target for the party's attack when parliament is recalled. The officials said: 'We are not going to accept that Norman Lamont might be the ultimate fall guy, for it was the prime minister who could not have been more categorical about staking his reputation on the value of the pound.'

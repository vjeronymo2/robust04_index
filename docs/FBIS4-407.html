			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint statement by State President F.W. de Klerk, King </F> Goodwill Zwelithini Kabhekuzulu, ANC President Nelson Mandela  and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi issued by the ANC on the  SAPA PR Wire Service on 9 April]    [Text] Delegations led by the state president, Mr F W de  Klerk, King Goodwill Zwelithini, Mr N Mandela and Chief Minister  M G Buthelezi met today for several hours in the Kruger National  Park. The delegations discussed a number of issues, including  the future constitutional accommodation of the Zulu monarchy,  calls for Zulu sovereignty, the problem of violence, the state  of emergency and proposals for international mediation.    The parties agreed on the necessity to make proper  constitutional provision for the recognition of the Kingdom of  kwaZulu and tabled substantial proposals in this regard. They  agreed to establish a working group to deliberate further on  these proposals and to report back to the respective leaders by  Thursday next week.    The parties agreed that, on the subject of outstanding  constitutional issues, international mediation should proceed in  order to seek a constitutional settlement and political  reconciliation. Urgent negotiations should take place to reach  agreement on the terms of reference and the procedures to be  followed. A follow-up meeting late next week is foreseen to  discuss the progress achieved in negotiations and to consider  the implications arising from this.    His majesty the king and the three leaders were unanimous in  their condemnation of violence and of the known and hidden  forces that are involved in fomenting violence. They made an  urgent appeal to their followers and to all South Africans to  end the killings, to exercise maximum restraint and to pursue  their objectives by peaceful means. Kruger National Park 8 April  1994</p>

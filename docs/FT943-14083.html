			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Colosio's assassin 'acted alone' The special prosecutor investigating the assassination of Mexican ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio has presented his final report on the killing - and then promptly resigned as a public outcry condemned his conclusions as insufficient and unbelievable. The prosecutor, Mr Miguel Montes, said in his final report, which was expected to close the case, that Mario Aburto, the confessed assassin, acted alone when he shot Mr Colosio during a campaign rally last March in Tijuana. This contradicted his preliminary report, which claimed that Aburto was part of a conspiracy that included Tijuana members of Mr Colosio's own Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). Reaction to the new theory was swift and harsh. All leading political parties, deep into their campaigns, criticised the report, with the opposition claiming it was an attempt to close the case without scandal before the presidential elections on August 21. Public opinion polls show that Mexicans overwhelmingly believe that Aburto did not act alone and that the government is unwilling or unable to find the intellectual authors of the assassination. In announcing Mr Montes' resignation, President Carlos Salinas stressed that the case had not been closed. Instead, he said Mr Montes' replacement, Mr Olga Islas de Gonzalez, would specifically look into whether Aburto acted on orders of others. Mr Salinas also set up a commission to review Mr Montes' work, the fourth such panel the president has created in as many months in an attempt to give the government investigation some credibility. The lawyer representing Mr Colosio's widow Diana Laura in the investigation, Mr Juan Velasquez, welcomed the resignation. 'A complete revision of the case should be done to remedy the deficiencies of the investigation. . . which were to produce absolutely subjective conclusions,' Mr Velasquez said. He called Mr Montes' final report 'ridiculous'. Mr Colosio's substitute as the ruling party presidential nominee, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, also criticised Mr Montes' findings, even though a lone gunman theory saves the PRI from suspicion that it participated in the assassination. But most political analysts agree that Mr Zedillo simply could not support an investigation that had lost its credibility.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> JUDGE IS ELEVATED TO SUPERIOR COURT  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday elevated Orange County Municipal Judge Frank  F. Fasel to the Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> Fasel, 51, of San Juan Capistrano, is a former Orange County deputy district  attorney and Superior Court commissioner.  </P> <P> He will fill the seat vacated by Judge Gary L. Taylor, who was appointed to the  federal court earlier this year, the governor's office announced.  </P> <P> "He's a straight shooter who will be good for both sides of the council table,"  said Marshall M. Schulman, a Santa Ana criminal attorney who has known Fasel  since his days in the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "He certainly deserves the elevation," Schulman said Thursday. "I've never  heard anybody say a bad word about him."  </P> <P> Fasel had been a commissioner for the Orange County Superior Court from 1980 to  1989, when he was appointed to the West Judicial District municipal court.  </P> <P> He is also a former Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, and worked as  a deputy district attorney in Orange County from 1975 to 1979, the governor's  office said. From 1979 to 1980, he was an attorney in the Santa Ana firm of  Bunt &amp; Fasel.  </P> <P> Fasel graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1961 and earned a law  degree from the University of San Diego in 1968.  </P> <P> His new judgeship pays $94,344 a year, the governor's office said.

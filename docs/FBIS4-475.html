			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley and Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Excerpt] "One of us will come out bruised, and it will not  be me," ANC president Nelson Mandela has reportedly said about  his much-awaited television encounter with President F W de  Klerk, scheduled for Thursday [12 April] this week.    With just four days to go until the cameras beam the two  leaders into the living rooms of millions, election image-makers  on both sides have expressed jitters about the high-risk  encounter. A bad performance by either leader could cost him  thousands of vital votes from those still undecided -- perhaps  even determining whether or not the ANC will get the 66 percent  vote it needs to write the constitution on its own.    While Mr Mandela will project the image of a stately saint,  there are those in his campaign team who fear he may be too  stiff and long-winded to cope with the strict time limits. ANC  insiders believe Mr Mandela appears uncomfortable on television,  often insisting on buttoning up his jacket in the correct old  school way and failing to make eye contact with viewers by  looking into the camera.    And NP [National Party] election guru's are fearful that Mr  Mandela will launch a strong personal attack, which could  unnerve President De Klerk, who has often said he prefers  playing the ball to playing the man.    The ANC considers the debate to be the most crucial event  between the two leaders so far -- even more important than the  showdown at Codesa 1. "It epitomises the climax of this whole  election campaign in which people will have to make a choice  between oppression and despair and democracy and a better life,"  spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. Mr Mamoepa said the debate had  the power to swing votes, but the ANC was confident Mr Mandela  would come out tops. "Obviously we don't think for one split  second that our president can fluff it," he said.    Mr Mandela is taking seriously preparations for the debate,  leaving nothing to chance. On Wednesday, he will spend an  entire day with senior members of the National Executive  Committee being briefed on issues, and deciding which ones to  project. They will even decide on what he will wear -- dark  suit and certainly no grey shoes.    The preparations will not include matters of presentation,  apart from the cautionary plea -- "keep it short and concise,  please Madiba". Like all ANC candidates, Mr Mandela has already  been through a course in television technique. He has had to  undergo mock interviews in front of a television camera where a  room full of people have fired questions at the candidate. They  assess the performance later.    NP election guru Martinus van Schalkwyk is equally upbeat  about Mr De Klerk: "He's really a natural. Of course, we will  prepare him, but because he's a natural, we won't over prepare  him," he says. But he would give no details on the preparation.  [passage omitted]</p>

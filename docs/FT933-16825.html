			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow flat as equities await NAPM data Wall Street US prices were flat-to-firmer yesterday as the financial markets prepared for tomorrow's all-important employment figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.77 at 3,516.08. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.16 lower at 450.52, while the Amex composite finished up 0.72 at 434.24, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.88 at 703.95. Trading volume on the NYSE was 282m shares. After Tuesday's string of bad economic reports, investors and dealers were reluctant yesterday to push prices higher. The day's economic news - a slight rise in the Chicago purchasing managers' index of local economic activity and a 1.4 per cent decline in May factory orders - was mixed, and had little impact upon a market that remains deeply concerned about the erratic progress of the economy. Some participants chose to stay on the sidelines, awaiting today's National Association of Purchasing Management's index, which should give a reading of nationwide business activity, and, more importantly, tomorrow's June employment report. Analysts are expecting the report to show a rise of between 100,000 and 150,000 in non-farm payrolls, which would be consistent with a below-par economic recovery. American Express firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 as investors seemed to welcome management changes instigated by the travel and financial services group's recently appointed chief executive, Mr Harvey Golub. Analysts said that the changes reinforced Mr Golub's hold on the company. Quantum Chemical soared Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 19 on news that the UK group Hanson is to buy the company for Dollars 3.2bn in a stock swap involving Hanson's American Depositary Shares. The news left the price of Hanson's ADS unchanged at Dollars 17 in volume of 2.7m shares. Gillette rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 55 after it launched a new version of its hugely successful 'Sensor' razor. Telmex, the big Mexican telecommunications group, dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 on fears that the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico may have been dealt a serious blow by the ruling of a US district judge that Nafta violates the National Environment Policy Act. Enron fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 afer the company agreed to contribute Dollars 250m over three years to a joint energy investment venture with the big Californian public pension fund Calpers. CompUSA fell Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/2 following a warning from the technology retailer that fourth-quarter net income would come in at the low end of market expectations. Canada TORONTO prices closed little changed in busy trading, as a late-session rally lifted the TSE-300 composite index out of negative territory. According to preliminary figures, it rose 3.14 points to close at 3,966.7, in turnover of 78.9m shares valued at CDollars 804. Northern Telecom continued its decline in heavy trading, following last Friday's forecast of disappointing results. It slipped to 31 3/4 on volume of 2.3 m shares, bringing its total decline this week to 13 3/8.</p>

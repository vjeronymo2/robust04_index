			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO have  agreed to meet again in Cairo on Friday [8 April] to try to  finalize an accord on launching Palestinian autonomy, chief  Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Thursday.    Palestinian and Israeli officials reached the decision over  the telephone on Thursday morning, Sha'th told AFP. The two  sides had agreed to reconvene on Sunday after adjourning  autonomy talks on Wednesday.    They will meet Friday on the Moslem traditional day of rest.    Sha'th had criticized Israeli negotiators for heading home  to  observe a Holocaust remembrance day on Thursday, and said it  would be difficult now to finalize an accord on launching  autonomy by an April 13 deadline.    Under the September accord the two signed in Washington,  Israel was to have begun withdrawing its troops from Gaza and  Jericho on December 13 and completed the move by April 13.    The first deadline was missed, but PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat  insisted in Jordan on Wednesday that the withdrawal take place  in a week's time.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Elf and Enterprise in Dollars 1.35bn agreement: French group moves to become leading player in North Sea oil production ELF Aquitaine, the French oil and chemicals group, confirmed yesterday that it would form a joint venture with Enterprise Oil, the UK oil exploration and production company, to buy Occidental Petroleum's North Sea assets for Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 799m). Elf will hold two-thirds of the joint company, Elf Enterprise Petroleum, and Enterprise a third. The agreement involves the transfer of part of Enterprise's stake in the large North Sea Nelson oilfield to the joint venture company. In return, Elf will reduce its 25 per cent stake in Enterprise to 10 per cent. The shares will be distributed via an issue of Pounds 438m of exchangeable bonds to finance the acquisition. The bonds are issued by Elf but convert into Enterprise shares. Further financing of Pounds 347m for the asset purchase will initially be provided by Elf. Enterprise will assume one-third of the burden when it becomes a shareholder in the new company. The Occidental interests bought by the new venture include 23.4 per cent of the Claymore field and 36.5 per cent of the Scapa field. The deal also includes 36.5 per cent of the Flotta oil pipeline and terminal in the Orkney Islands. In addition, the sale involves a 36.5 per cent interest in the Piper B, Saltire A and Chanter fields which are under development, as well as a wide spread of exploration acreage. The new venture will hold 19 per cent of the Nelson oilfield. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chief executive, said the company is gaining 'a broader, more balanced portfolio of assets with earlier production'. Financing details, Page 27</p>

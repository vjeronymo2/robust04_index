			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Tube extension set to be shelved THE PROPOSED extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands is set to join the lengthening list of casualties of the toughest public spending round since the early 1980s. Ministers at the Conservative conference said yesterday that the Treasury now looked certain to win its battle to have the project shelved, if not scrapped, in the wake of the collapse of the Canary Wharf development. Only an unconditional offer from the banks now administering the Docklands development to meet in full the Pounds 400m private sector contribution promised by Olympia &amp; York could rescue the project. A final decision to shelve the project, yielding a Pounds 1.5bn saving for the Treasury, could be made as early as next week at a meeting of the cabinet committee chaired by Lord Wakeham. As ministers acknowledged that the government was still struggling to meet the Pounds 244.5bn spending target agreed for next year, Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for the Citizen's Charter, announced a big extension of the market-testing of Whitehall services. In an effort to square the circle of tight spending constraints and improved public services, he said that the politics of the 'growth of government' were dead. Instead, he said, the improvement in the quality of public services offered by the charter would help 'end the false choice between low rates of taxation and higher standards of service'. Mr Waldegrave said that, as part of the drive for efficiency, more than Pounds 1bn-worth of services now delivered by civil servants in Whitehall would be market-tested this year by inviting private sector competition. The sharp increase from a figure of only Pounds 25m last year would mean that a whole range of professional services such as accountancy and information technology would join more traditional services such as security and catering in being exposed to private-sector disciplines. Mr Waldegrave's speech also followed predictions from senior ministers that the government may face a 'spring of discontent' from public sector unions next year in response to draconian measures to hold down the government's pay bill. The ministers said that the cabinet committee reviewing the allocation of next year's Pounds 244.5bn Whitehall budget would not set a formal pay 'norm' for the public sector. But most workers could expect increases of between zero and 3 per cent. Despite the proposed scrapping of the Jubilee line extension, Mr Waldegrave said that the government was aiming to protect as many as possible of those of its investment programmes than directly affected demand in the private sector - particularly the construction industry.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of interview with new Assembly President Dr. Nedeljko </F> Mihanovic by Aleksa Crnjakovic; place and date not given: "I Do  Not Crave Honor and Power"]    [Text] When you meet Academician Nedeljko Mihanovic  in the corridor of the Croatian parliament, you always have the  feeling that he is apologizing for being there. Although he  gives an impression of self-denial and modesty, Deputy Mihanovic  has always overcome a certain uneasiness just in advance of  public speeches in the chamber. As a rule these are not speeches  for the general public. They are full of associations, of  historical reminiscences, of metaphors, quotations, a teacher's  admonitions, and a poet's conceits. We stopped him in a  "hit-and-run attack" to check out the stories circulating in the  corridors of parliament that he will in fact become the  president of the House of Representatives, to the surprise of  many.    [Crnjakovic] If you are offered the post of president of the  parliament, will you accept it?    [Mihanovic] I am not giving any thought to that at all. I  have seen my name in the papers. I am not a man who craves pomp  and power; I want to remain neutral. But if that would help to  calm down the entire situation, to prevent a crisis from  occurring, I would accept. I look on that position with awe,  with great responsibility and to some extent with an inner fear  in the face of that challenge. If there is a need for my person  to fill a vacuum, I will always accept that burden for Croatia.  <H5>  Trust in Common Sense </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Is there good reason to fear a possible  parliamentary crisis?    [Mihanovic] I am convinced that there is not. I always  believe in a certain awareness of people who could cause some  possible trouble in the parliament. I believe that even Mesic  will not accept that, and he is saying that they are sticking to  the line of Croatian statehood, that they will not do anything  which could harm the Croatian state. Changing leaders is a  democratic proceeding. If they have left the party, they cannot  obstruct the parliament. I believe that common sense will  prevail with them. What must be done will be done according to  democratic procedure.    [Crnjakovic] What needs to be done?    [Mihanovic] To resolve the issue of the presidents of the  House of Representatives and the Chamber of Zupanijas, since by  the rules of the game the leading party has the right to those  posts.    [Crnjakovic] What if they do nevertheless remain in the way?    [Mihanovic] That would be very harmful for Croatia, since  the  parliament would not be able to enact laws, elections would have  to be called, which means paralysis for at least six to eight  months. Croatia would be marking time, it would be stymied, and  I believe that is not in anyone's interest. Less money, lower  output, a lower standard of living....    [Crnjakovic] Perhaps someone intends just that?    [Mihanovic] That would then be sabotage, destroying the  foundations of the young state, which is doing everything to get  in the flow of Europe and the world, to resolve the issue of its  occupied areas, which wants economic progress. Anyone who has  such intentions would be working against his own Croatian  people. I think that such an outlook will not prevail. I believe  in the unity of Croatian consciousness when it comes to the  interest of the Croatian state. I cannot understand anyone  sitting in the Croatian parliament being against the interest of  the Croatian people.  <H5>  Some People in the HDZ Have Sighed With Relief </H5>   [Crnjakovic] How do you evaluate the events related to  establishment of the new party by people from your own ranks?    [Mihanovic] I do not think it was on constitutional grounds.  Individuals felt that they had not been satisfied in their  claims and vanities. They thought that they did not have enough  power. Some perhaps thought that it was they who should be  conducting the policy of the Croatian state from the positions  they held. Why, then, did we elect a head of state?! With the  help of the other instruments of power, he is conducting the  policy of the state. A parallel policy cannot be conducted. Do  you happen to know who is the president of the parliament in  Germany? That post is important, but the president of the  parliament does not shape the policy of the state. Some people  have perhaps overstated the powers which they felt they should  have in the positions they held, and then they took action,  mistakenly judging that they could cause a breakdown. They  thought it was enough for one strong man to leave the HDZ and  the party would fall apart.    [Crnjakovic] What is the situation in the HDZ?    [Mihanovic] Very stable. There are no internal convulsions.  Some even sighed with relief that we no longer have the  tug-of-war between ultra-left and ultra-right, but are following  a middle and moderate line in creating the state of the Croatian  people. This is the only realistic program which will not take  us into the extreme blocs.    [Crnjakovic] What will happen if President Mesic does not  want to withdraw voluntarily?    [Mihanovic] The democratic procedure called for by the rules  will be invoked, no one will be "removed" illegally. I think  there will be no skirmish, since this will be done according to  procedure. I think that these people will not cause any  interference. The parliament will continue its work.  <H5>  Statements Harmful to Croatia </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Would it be less harmful to leave Mesic in  place  even though he belongs to another party?    [Mihanovic] You never know what kind of propaganda he might  deliver from that post as a member of another party, an  opposition party. You know that numerous foreign and domestic  delegations visit him. A case might arise when he made  propaganda harmful to Croatian state policy and harmful to the  legally elected government, but to the benefit of his own party.  The party which has the majority would not allow that in any  country. Let us be clear, I do not preclude the possibility of  his behaving correctly, but there are the rules of the game. In  addition, his statements of alleged concentration camps and  supposedly deliberate murders are harmful to Croatia. I am not  saying that this has not occurred, but war brings with it  horrible things which you cannot always control. In war  prisoners are taken, they have to be put somewhere, but when you  say "concentration camp," you automatically think of gas  chambers, torture and other horrors. We did not have  concentration camps. We did not kill people deliberately, we did  not throw them into any Jazovkas.    [Crnjakovic] Will the balloting for president of the  parliament be open or secret?    [Mihanovic] Why should it be secret? That is not necessary.  If anyone is against, why should he be afraid of declaring it  publicly? No one is going to discredit anyone in that way. I  hope that we will preserve the democratic and tolerant spirit in  the parliament.    [Crnjakovic] Does that exist now?    [Mihanovic] Yes. We can be satisfied with that. In this time  of war, when passions are additionally intensified, we are  behaving well. It is normal for there to be intolerant  individuals in all parties, but the parliament as a whole is  behaving in a civilized way. Perhaps at some points it might be  more constructive and not try to obstruct the government. Mr.  Valentic is committing his entire potential, intellectual and  otherwise, to improving Croatia as much as possible, and so are  his ministers. I was profoundly offended when Vladimir Bebic  said of Dr. Granic, deputy prime minister, that he was a war  criminal. That is horrible! And to say that of a man who by his  title and his spiritual makeup is a humanist! This was said from  the speaker's desk completely out of the blue and without  evidence! For me that was the most serious incident in the  parliament in these past four years.  <H5>  I Have Known Tudjman for a Long Time </H5>   [Crnjakovic] You are often defending the president of the  state. Are you defending him personally, or the dignity of the  office he holds?    [Mihanovic] It is not a question of any personality cult. I  have known the president of the republic for a long time, since  back in the 1960's when he worked in the Institute, when we  worked together on certain programs. Even then I was surprised  at the imaginativeness of the cultural policy he was pursuing.  That was very brave. The Croatian line always followed from his  conclusions, although it was not simple to pursue the Croatian  option at the Institute for the History of the Working Class  Movement. That was gratifying to all of us around him in the  Institute for Literature, since we all had a Croatian  orientation, we did not have a single party member among us. He  pursued a wise and moderate policy. Since that time I have  respected him as a sensible person, someone who always thinks  out his reasons and all the consequences of a particular move.  The HDZ Program was one of the clearest, that is why I committed  myself to him. I do not believe in the collective consciousness.  I believe that one man, if he heads a movement and a program,  can accomplish much historically. No one will be able to dispute  that Tudjman is the creator of the Croatian state. That is a  fact which cannot be denied. Let us be happy that we have  created the Croatian state. This is not an illusion, a  phantasmagoria, it is here and now. Everyone takes it into  account today. What its nature will be is now up to us. Italy  has been functioning for 40 years, and you see what has happened  there. Taking things all in all, I think that we have achieved  the maximum.</p>

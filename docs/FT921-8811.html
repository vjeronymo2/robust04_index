			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Chelsfield rekindles interest in the City - A look at the mystery property group's finances MR ELLIOTT Bernerd, head of the private Chelsfield group, is one of the best-known deal makers in the property industry. But since April 1990, when Chelsfield teamed up with P&amp;O to buy Laing Properties for Pounds 492m, he has been out of the public eye. Not for much longer, perhaps. Mr Bernerd says that he is poised to do a deal that 'will give us an important critical mass to move forward'. At the same time, the City's interest in Chelsfield's finances has been rekindled. P&amp;O's share price dropped on Wednesday on rumours that its joint venture with the company was in difficulties. Separately on Wednesday, the High Court gave Chelsfield 28 days to pay an outstanding sum of Pounds 2.9m, which should have been paid last October. The dispute concerns Bishops Move Group, a removal company that owns a 40,000 sq ft warehouse near Victoria. It says that Chelsfield had defaulted on its Pounds 3.6m purchase of the property, agreed in December 1990. Mr Bernerd said Chelsfield had not paid the money because it was pursuing legal action against the vendors concerning assurances allegedly given about the property. However, this is hotly denied by Bishops Move Group. P&amp;O's share price fell after it emerged that Chelsfield was attempting to raise Pounds 150m, in what the market assumed was an effort to shore up its balance sheet. However, Mr Bernerd later said the funds were required to fund the demerger of Pall Mall, Chelsfield's joint venture with P&amp;O that acquired the Laing portfolio. The fund-raising was not, in itself, surprising. The demerger of Pall Mall had been been expected for over six months. But the plans for Pall Mall, its structure and the relationship between P&amp;O and Chelsfield still cause considerable confusion in the City. 'Chelsfield has remained a complete mystery to people,' says one analyst who researches P&amp;O. It is perhaps an exaggeration to say that nothing is known about Mr Elliott Bernerd, who has an almost legendary reputation in the property industry. He started as an estate agent, joining forces in the early 1970s with Town &amp; City, which was later merged with Sir Jeffrey Sterling's company. In the 1980s, he developed Stockley Park, built up and sold his estate agency to Morgan Grenfell, and set up Chelsfield, which masterminded some high profile deals, such as the acquisition of the Wentworth golf club in 1989. But, like all private companies, financial details about Chelsfield are scarce. In the year to July 1990, the company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22.3m, down from Pounds 23.1m a year earlier. Its net assets at that date were Pounds 35.3m, down from Pounds 55.5m. Its gearing was 138 per cent. How far the picture has deteriorated is unclear. Even though Chelsfield has no development properties, its rental income does not cover its interest costs. One factor in its favour is that it has no City offices - the worst performing sector in the market. Pall Mall's position is also unclear. Even though P&amp;O and Chelsfield bought Laing at a 20 per cent discount to its net asset value many analysts thought they overpaid. That disquiet has intensified as property values in the UK, the US and Canada have plummeted. Analysts are concerned because Pall Mall is a highly-geared vehicle. Their back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that Pall Mall has debt of some Pounds 800m (Pounds 300m of which was injected at the time of the takeover) and assets which were worth roughly Pounds 1bn at the time of the takeover. Undoubtedly, those assets have fallen steeply in value. P&amp;O and Chelsfield wrote them down by 20 per cent to their acquisition cost six months of acquiring them. If they have fallen further, they may wipe out the Pounds 150m of equity in the company and some of the debt. The debt that would be affected is probably the Pounds 300m loan from Lloyds Bank that funded the takeover. This was a 'non-recourse' loan, meaning that the bank would have no claim over the parent company if the loan turned sour. Mr Bernerd is clear that Chelsfield would have no compunction about walking away from the Pall Mall debt if it could not be paid. However, he emphasises that there is 'absolutely no risk at all' that this will happen. Far from fretting about the ability to repay Lloyds, Mr Bernerd describes the demerger of Pall Mall as 'a prelude to a major move.' He explains that the delay in dismantling Pall Mall was due to tax complexities, 'heavy dialogue' about how the portfolio should be split and the need to raise funds. Mr Bernerd says his efforts to raise Pounds 150m should be successful in a matter of weeks. He is less forthcoming about how he expects to raise the remainder of the Pounds 250m that he has agreed to inject into Pall Mall to acquire his share of the Laing portfolio. He hints, however, that it is part of a larger deal. Mr Bernerd claims to be sanguine about his acquisition of Laing. But its long-term success cannot yet be judged as its depends, he implies, on his plans for a major corporate move. 'Watch this space,' he says.</p>

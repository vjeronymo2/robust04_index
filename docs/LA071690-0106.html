			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEFICIT HITS $168 BILLION;  </P> <P> DRASTIC CUTBACKS LOOM AS U.S. HIKES ITS '91 ESTIMATE;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE 1ST FORECAST WAS WAY OFF  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today dramatically boosted its official estimate of the  fiscal 1991 budget deficit to $168.8 billion, two-thirds higher than its  forecast just six months ago.  </P> <P> The increase could force automatic spending cuts of more than $100 billion if  Congress and the Administration fail to agree on a package of spending  reductions and tax increases.  </P> <P> Today's estimate did not include the costs of bailing out the savings and loan  industry. When those costs are included, the deficit for the fiscal year that  begins Oct. 1 climbs to $231.4 billion, the White House said in its official  mid-session review of the budget.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration had estimated the budget deficit at $100.5 billion when  the President's budget was released in January.  </P> <P> The new deficit estimate is also significantly higher than the $64-billion  deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.  </P> <P> If Congress is unable to reduce the deficit to within $10 billion of the  $64-billion target, automatic across-the-board spending cuts will take effect.  </P> <P> Along with its new deficit estimate, the Administration included dire warnings  of what could happen if the current budget negotiations between Congress and  the Administration fail and the across-the-board cuts are triggered.  </P> <P> White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman called across-the-board cuts of  more than $100 billion unprecedented in their magnitude and "highly disruptive"  to a host of government programs.  </P> <P> Darman said such a reduction would require a 38.4% cut in non-defense spending  and cuts of between 25.1% and 43.3% in military programs. Social Security and  some other entitlement programs are exempt from Gramm-Rudman cuts, forcing even  sharper reductions in other programs.  </P> <P> Darman said the Gramm-Rudman cuts would force major reductions in air traffic  control operations, increasing delays for air passengers by 400% to 600%. The  cuts also would require a 40% reduction in the Head Start program, affecting  200,000 4-year-olds, and curbs on other government programs ranging from  poultry and meat inspections to cleanup of Superfund toxic waste sites.  </P> <P> "If the summit negotiation fails, these effects are exactly what we will face  in the fall," Darman said at a news conference.  </P> <P> The Administration's new estimates make it highly likely that the Gramm-Rudman  law will have to be at least modified, given the size of the cuts needed to  reach the $64-billion target. The Administration and Congress have been  discussing spending cuts and tax increases in a range of between $50 billion  and $60 billion, about half of what would be needed with the new estimates.  </P> <P> By emphasizing a deficit figure that did not include the savings and loan  bailout, the Administration seemed to be laying the groundwork for removing  this giant expenditure from the Gramm-Rudman calculations, something that many  members of Congress have also proposed.  </P> <P> The Administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit on the  higher-than-expected savings and loan bailout, weaker economic growth and  higher interest rates.  </P></p>

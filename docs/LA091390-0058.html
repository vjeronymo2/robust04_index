			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON FIRE IS NEARLY CONQUERED, OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> The wind-whipped brush fire that burned more than 3,300 acres as it sped  through a rural canyon of luxury homes near Escondido this week was fully  encircled by firefighters Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> The California Department of Forestry expects the 150 remaining firefighters to  have the blaze extinguished by 8 a.m. today.  </P> <P> The fire began about noon Monday, damaged five homes, forced the evacuation of  more than 200 residents, and, for a time, threatened to leap Del Dios Highway  and attack the lakeside community of Del Dios.  </P> <P> "We got a line around the whole thing," CDF spokeswoman Audrey Hagen said  Wednesday evening. "We had a couple of hot spots around Del Dios Highway at  about 3:30 (p.m. Wednesday), but everything is looking good now."  </P> <P> She said one lane of Del Dios Highway was temporarily closed Wednesday to deal  with the spot fires, which were quickly extinguished.  </P> <P> Everyone evacuated has been allowed back home.  </P> <P> Officials are pinning the blame for the blaze on target shooters. Spent shell  casings were found at the fire's origin. On Tuesday, one CDF official  speculated that sparks from the muzzle of a high-velocity weapon could have  started the fire.  </P> <P> Seven firefighters suffered minor injuries: a broken ankle, a twisted knee, a  bee sting, cuts, bruises and a case of heat exhaustion.  </P> <P> A total damage figure has not yet been determined, but damage to homes alone is  estimated at $100,000, CDF spokeswoman Hagen said.  </P> <P> The cost of fighting the fire was $650,000 -- $150,000 for the air assault and  $500,000 for the ground crews and equipment, she added.  </P> <P> CDF officials said more than $20 million in homes, property, animals, sheds,  and other structures were spared by the work of firefighters and volunteers,  who attacked the blaze house to house.  </P> <P> Wednesday, air tankers continued to douse the area with fire retardant, and  helicopters made trips to nearby Lake Hodges reservoir, scooping hundreds of  gallons of water at a time to drop on the fire.  </P> <P> All but one of the homes affected by the fire had power restored by noon  Tuesday, said SDG&amp;E spokesman Fred Vaughn. Two poles, a power line and a  transmission pole were damaged in the fire, interrupting service to many homes  at about 2 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell, meanwhile, ran into snags Wednesday that kept it from fully  restoring phone service to the area.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, we still have 25 customers who are out of service," Pacific  Bell spokesman Tommy McNaghten said Wednesday afternoon. Temporary cable to be  laid today should solve the problem, he said.  </P> <P> McNaghten said customers still without phone service can make free local calls  and credit card or collect long-distance calls from a truck at the intersection  of Mt. Israel Road and Del Dios Highway. The truck will arrive at 6:30 a.m.  today.  </P></p>

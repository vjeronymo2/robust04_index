			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 -- For a week the  city of Cluj-Napoca (North-West of Romania, inhabited by a large  Hungarian minority) has been living in a state of tension  created by the conflict between the public authorities and the  local branch of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania  (UDMR).    The conflict, which is not something new, because such  situations arose several times in the capital of the historical  Romanian province of Transylvania, was sparkled by the intention  of the local authorities to authorize, at the request of the  Transylvanian History Museum, archaeological diggings in the  central square of the city where the monument to Hungarian King  of Romanian descent Matthias Corvinus is located. The local  branch of UDMR is accusing the City Council, and Mayor Gheorghe  Funar in the first place, of using the digs as a pretext to move  Corvinus's statue to another location.    "The archaeological diggings planned to start in the Union  Square of Cluj-Napoca are about 100 meters away from the statue  of King Matthias Corvinus," the city mayor Gheorghe Funar told  CRONICA ROMANA.    "The UDMR misleads its members, supporters, and the whole  world, pretending that the unearthings pursue to create a state  of conflict in the town," Gheorghe Funar also says. His opinion  is that the tension aroused in the past few days is  "artificially created, has a political connotation and was  generated by the UDMR's actions intended to prevent the  archaeological investigations in the Union Square." He specified  that the initiative comes from the History Museum of  Transylvania of Cluj Napoca, which has obtained the approval of  all the competent fora, and has allotted 10 million lei to the  project. The mayor himself suggested the local council to  approve another 30 million lei to sustain the project.    Despite assurances from local authorities that Matthias  Corvinus's statue will have nothing to suffer, "the UDMR  representatives said they would stage demonstrations and urge to  civic disobedience, and termed the matter a political issue,"  Gheorghe Funar said. Should any acts of civic disorder appear  in the town, Gheorghe Funar said he would be the advocate of  "firm enforcement of the law."    The daily ORA carries a commentary in its yesterday's issue  qualifying the case as part of "the Hungarian concerted strategy  aimed at having the Trianon Treaty canceled or revised." The  Treaty of Trianon permitted Transylvania to reunite with the  mother country after Habsburg and Hungarian occupation was  abolished. The article in question remarked that "the plan is  absolutely the same for all the countries having a Hungarian  minority," and that "from this point of view, UDMR is one of the  spearheads of this intelligent plan, obstinately followed by  Budapest."    The archaeological investigations due to start next week in  Cluj-Napoca intend to bring to light the forum of the ancient  city of Napoca, a Roman colony on the territory of ancient  Dacia, the cradle of the Romanian people and language. The city  of Napoca used to be the capital of the Roman Province of Dacia  Porolisensis, and Cluj-Napoca is celebrating this year 1870  years from its first documentary attestation.</p>

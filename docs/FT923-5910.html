			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Firm demand for Japan Highway issue A CDollars 300m Eurobond offering yesterday for Japan Highway, the Japanese government-backed agency, ended the recent dearth of fixed-rate Canadian paper. The deal met firm demand from Japanese accounts, as well as European investors in search of paper with coupons reflecting current interest rate levels. Older deals, with higher coupons, are now trading substantially above par, which discourages many investors. The deal was considered rather aggressively priced to yield 36 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond yield: similar AAA rated government-backed paper was trading as much as 10 basis points wider, although those issues are quoted at a premium. Lack of supply ensured firm demand, which withstood a declining Canadian government bond market. Poor swap opportunities are likely to continue to limit supply in the sector, although other Japanese utilities are eyeing the market. Yesterday's deal was said to have been swapped into fixed-rate yen, but lead manager IBJ International declined to comment. BLENHEIM Group, the organiser of trade exhibitions, has joined the growing list of UK companies seeking longer term financing in the US with a Dollars 75m private placement. Blenheim Holdings, the company's US subsidiary, placed the senior notes, which mature in 1999, mainly with US insurance companies. The money will be used to repay short-term borrowings. Several British companies, including Pilkington and United Newspapers, have tapped the US private placement market, where demand from yield-hungry US investors has allowed them to achieve attractive funding levels. Blenheim said the yield on its placement was 'not dissimilar' from these deals, suggesting it is paying about 1.5 percentage points above US Treasury bond yields. Barclays de Zoete Wedd was agent for the placing. Blenheim has net borrowings of Pounds 42m and Mr Neville Buch, executive chairman, said interest cover is between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Charges brought by SFO dismissed Three fraud charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office against a group of businessmen over the marketing of shares in Duralite Manufacturing Company of the US were dismissed by an Old Bailey judge yesterday. After 13 days of argument Mr Justice Colman threw out the charges against Mr Malcolm Johnson of Kitzbuhel, Austria, Mr Alex Dann of Kensington, London, and Mr Mungo Park of Earls Court, London. There was not sufficient evidence for a jury properly directed to convict on any of the three charges, he said. The three men had denied conspiring to contravene the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act by inducing prospective investors in Duralite with misleading or false promises and forecasts that Duralite had gold mining and gold producing assets of value commensurate with its share price. The three also pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to obtain by deception. The SFO is still considering whether to continue prosecuting the men on other charges.</p>

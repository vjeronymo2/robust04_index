			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina announced the Cuban Government will take several  steps to facilitate visits to the island by Cubans living  abroad. Robaina announced the decision during deliberations of  The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which began in Havana  on 22 April.    A conference spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that one such  measure will be to lift the five-year waiting period normally  required of people who legally left the island before they can  return to Cuba for a visit. Up to this time, anyone who left  Cuba for good had to wait five years before visiting the country  unless the purpose of their visit was humanitarian.    The requirement for emigrants traveling to Cuba to reserve  hotels during their stay, which they usually spend at relatives'  homes anyway, will also be removed. The spokesman indicated that  Cubans living abroad will also be allowed to study in Cuba but  will have to pay a tuition established for this purpose.  According to the source, the issue of a Cuban publication for  emigrants will also be considered.</p>

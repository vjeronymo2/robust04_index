			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Seoul seeks talks with Pyongyang South Korea yesterday proposed that talks with North Korea on mutual nuclear inspections be resumed next Tuesday, writes John Burton in Seoul. It is unclear, however, whether Pyongyang will accept the proposal since Seoul is suggesting that the talks should be held through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission. North Korea wants the talks conducted by special envoys who would also arrange a summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas.</p>

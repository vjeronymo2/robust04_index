			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Los Angeles earthquake cost put at Dollars 13bn-Dollars 20bn Last month's Los Angeles earthquake caused between Dollars 13bn and Dollars 20bn (Pounds 8.7bn-Pounds 13.4bn) in damage, California officials said, making it the second most expensive natural disaster in US history, Reuter reports from Sacramento. State officials also announced on Tuesday that the cost of the earthquake to federal, state and local taxpayers will be about Dollars 11.6bn. The damage estimate is the most detailed since the 6.8 magnitude quake rocked Los Angeles, killing 60 people, injuring 8,500 and destroying many homes and freeways. In the days after the quake, state officials had released a rough estimate of Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn in damage. They said preliminary estimate was based on earthquake models and actual damage was not quite as bad as had originally expected. However, Mr Dick Andrews, director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said the latest estimate could be revised upwards again if there was damage to sewer and water systems which had not been detected. The federal government's share of the costs was put at Dollars 9.5bn, the state's at Dollars 1.9bn and local government at Dollars 135m. President Bill Clinton has already asked Congress for Dollars 9.5bn in federal disaster relief funds. The total cost to taxpayers includes Dollars 1.45bn to rebuild highways, Dollars 4.2bn in clean-up costs and Dollars 1bn in disaster relief payments. Mr Andrews estimated that private insurance would cover about Dollars 2.5bn of the overall loss. The most costly US natural disaster was Hurricane Andrew, which caused Dollars 30bn in losses in southern Florida and Louisiana in 1992.</p>

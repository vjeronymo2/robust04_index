			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Sluggishness of developing regions seen as likely to continue THE developing economies of eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East contracted last year, and the decline is expected to continue this year in eastern Europe and the Middle East, according to the International Monetary Fund. Its World Economic Outlook suggests overall growth in gross domestic product in developing countries fell to 0.6 per cent last year, from 3.1 per cent in 1989. It is projected at 0.8 per cent this year, rising to 3.4 per cent next year. The IMF estimates the debt of all developing countries rose nearly 6 per cent in 1990 to Dollars 1,306bn. New borrowing of Dollars 50bn and valuation changes due to the dollar's fall (Dollars 51bn) more than offset the fall in debt (Dollars 29bn) due to various operations to reduce the debt of developing countries. The amount of debt owed by problem debtor countries to commercial banks is set to fall to Dollars 257bn in 1992, from Dollars 311bn in 1990, reflecting both debt reduction deals and net repayments. By 1992, the share of official debt to these countries will have grown to 52 per cent in 1992 from 47 per cent in 1990. Debt reduction operations will contribute to a big drop in debt-GDP ratios in problem debtor countries. Among 15 heavily indebted countries, this ratio will fall 7 1/2 percentage points to 30 per cent in 1992. Debt service ratios will show a temporary rise this year, however. The Middle East: Output is estimated to have shrunk by 1.5 per cent last year, reflecting the sharp contraction of the economies of Kuwait, Iraq and Jordan. Total regional output is estimated to decline by a further 3.3 per cent this year, before recovering in 1992 when 8.5 per cent growth is expected, mainly because of reconstruction in Kuwait and Iraq. The combined balance of payments surplus of the Middle East countries is estimated to have shifted from near balance in 1989 to a surplus of Dollars 14bn last year, mainly because of the rise in oil prices. It will shift dramatically to deficit of Dollars 50bn this year and Dollars 25bn next, mainly because of economic reconstruction costs. Latin America: Output declined by 1 per cent last year, compared with a modest 1.5 per cent rise the year before. Some of the decline was due to transitional economic adjustments, rather than destabilising macroeconomic policies - the primary factor in previous years. If significant delays or slippages in reform programmes are avoided, growth should resume this year, at about 1 per cent, and reach 3.3 per cent next year. Asia: Growth slipped to 5.3 per cent last year in Asian developing economies, from 5.5 per cent in 1989. It is expected to remain about 5 per cent this year and next - three percentage points below the average growth rate for 1983-89. The Gulf war cost the oil-importing debtor countries of the region almost  1/2 per cent of GDP last year, with the countries hurt by a loss of remittances. Africa: The rise in the price of oil and a drop in the price of other commodities depressed growth in Africa in 1990. Gross domestic product growth should be little changed at about 2 per cent this year but pick up to 4.8 per cent in 1992. Little progress, though, is seen at alleviating poverty, and GDP levels per capita are expected to remain at the level of 20 years ago.</p>

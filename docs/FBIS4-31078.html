			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Milica Knezevic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia's economic  recovery programme will be put to the acid test after July 24,  when the National Bank of Yugoslavia (central bank) stops  financing the state budget deficit. "The politicians have been  told clearly that the state's fiscal deficit will no longer be  made up from the central bank coffers. Let them take out loans  on the capital market," says Dragoslav Avramovic, central bank  governor and architect of the national economic stabilisation  programme.    Measures which the federal government began implementing on  January 24 have helped avert an economic and monetary collapse  in conditions of a tight international blockade of Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro). Avramovic explains that the programme began  with consolidating the national currency and should end with  balancing the budgetary revenues and outlays. Serbia's deficit  is down to 45 percent of the plan, and the federal deficit, to  75 percent.    Late last week, the Serbian Government said it had taken  measures to ensure the financing of the total public  expenditures from real sources, without incurring a budget  deficit. Similar measures are being planned by the Montenegrin  Government, according to competent authorities. The ball is now  in the court of the Federal Government, which should balance its  books by July 24, after which date all budgetary outlays will  have to be covered from real earnings. In case of need, the  state will be able to take out credits but only on the market,  through issuing debentures, central bank experts explain.    Avramovic said on Saturday he would resign as governor of  the  central bank the moment he had to print money without gold and  hard currency backing.    The new dinar, which has full gold and hard currency  backing,  was circulated on January 24 to replace the old dinar which had  been devalued out of existence by an annual inflation of 116  billion percent in 1993. Analysts say that, if he manages to  implement his plan and put an end to the practice of 50 years of  financing the budget deficit by printing money, Avramovic will  create conditions for a lasting elimination of the chief  generator of inflation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] The newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE NOVOSTI published an  interview with Crimean vice prime minister, Moscow economist  Yevgeniy Saburov, in which he, in particular, characterizes the  Crimean parliament. In his opinion, new voracious [holodni]  people have come to power. They are not guided by the interests  of voters, but by their own immediate interests. In Ye.  Saburov's opinion, the way out of the deadlock lies in  negotiations between the two sides that would rule out the use  of force. He sees the Crimea's future "first and foremost,  within Ukraine."</p>

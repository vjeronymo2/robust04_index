			<p>BFN     [Text] An official statement issued in Accra today says the  government considers as unfortunate the recent decision of the  New Patriotic Party, NPP, to pull out of the dialogue between  the government and the nonparliamentary opposition, in which the  NPP is involved. The statement said the NPP's decision was in a  letter addressed last week to the presidential adviser on  governmental affairs, to which a reply has been issued. It said  the government is still committed to dialogue as a means of  achieving national unity, stability, and reconciliation. It  will, therefore, be prepared to resume dialogue with the NPP  whenever wise counsel prevails. The statement stressed that it  is the hope of government that, for the sake of the stability  and peace of the nation and all Ghanaians, the NPP opposition  will renounce the politics of violence, abuse, and  confrontation, and genuinely create conditions conducive to  dialogue. This is because dialogue is an essential basis of  multiparty democracy and national development.    Meanwhile, the statement blamed the present development on  the activities of some elements within the NPP. It noted one of  the early signals as the ultimatum issued by the party last year  to break off the dialogue when representatives of both sides  were busy resolving certain technical matters. Besides, since  the first meeting took place, some leading figures of the NPP  have made inflammatory utterances contrary to the spirit of the  dialogue. They have also continued what the statement called  their media campaign of vilification and character assassination  against the government. It also noted that while the dialogue  was still on the NPP continued to pursue their plan to make the  country ungovernable, through street demonstrations and other  forms of confrontation.    It thus became obvious long ago that the NPP did not enter  the dialogue in good faith or with any serious commitment to  achieving any positive result, but just as a propaganda ploy.  The statement pointed out that the review of the electoral  system, which was the most important concern raised by the NPP  during the inaugural meeting of the dialogue, has already been  taken up by the National Electoral Commission, NEC. Also under  the auspices of NEC, a series of meetings have been held  involving all the political parties, with the active  participation of the international donors. Besides, a number of  important decisions have been taken which are binding on all  parties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- The Seventh Session of  the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC] yesterday adopted the "Foreign Trade Law of the People's  Republic of China." Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, answered reporters' questions in regard to  the law.    Reporter: What is the significance of the formal adoption of  the "Foreign Trade Law"?    Wu Yi: It is of epoch-making significance in the history of  our country's foreign economic relations and trade. It is a  good beginning of the legalization of our country's foreign  trade and is also an important step to link up with the world  economy.    Viewing the domestic situation, since the founding of New  China more than 40 years ago, we always depended mainly on  direct administrative means to govern foreign trade. It was an  unavoidable method in the initial phase of New China and during  the period of the enforcement of a planned economy. Meanwhile,  the scale of our country's foreign trade was quite limited at  that time, and so this was also an effective method. However,  after more than 10 years of reform and opening up, tremendous  changes have taken place in our foreign trade today. In 1993,  the total volume of our country's imports and exports reached  $195.72 billion, increasing by 575 times as compared with $340  million in 1949. Our country has established trade relations  with more than 180 countries and regions in the world. Reform  and opening up have altered the situation of monopolizing  foreign trade by less than 20 state-run foreign trade companies.  Now there are more than 7,000 enterprises in the whole country  which are authorized to engage in foreign trade. In addition,  there are over 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises. The total  number of enterprises which can directly engage in imports and  exports has reached some 180,000. It has become more and more  difficult to use administrative means to effectively regulate  economic activities of such a large scale. In the course of  reform and opening up, foreign trade departments, like other  economic departments, are faced with the situation of "becoming  stifled when as controls are tightened, and becoming disorderly  when controls are relaxed." Owing to the fact that there are  several government departments administering foreign trade with  diverse policies, commodity wars of various types emerged for a  time. Foreign trade, as an important economic department, must  be guided onto a legal track to achieve its smooth development.    Viewing the situation internationally, our country's economy  has become quite inseparable from the world as a result of our  country's opening up to the outside world. At present, foreign  trade accounts for 38 percent of the GNP. Further opening up to  the outside world will continuously strengthen our country's  link with the world economy. The most important part is that we  must follow international prctice in administering our country's  economy. In setting foreign trade policies, we must follow  international trade regulations universally accepted by various  countries, such as the stipulations of the GATT. Our country  applied for restoring China's position as a signatory of the  GATT as early as in 1986. However, the basic requirements of  GATT on the trade system of a contracting party include the  uniformity and openness of that trade system. Without a foreign  trade law, meeting these requirements is unthinkable.    Reporter: What things are provided for in the Foreign  Trade Law?    Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law will make adjustments on the  import and export of cargoes, technological imports and exports,  and international service trade in accordance with its  stipulations. The import and export of cargoes is a form of  traditional foreign trade, as well as the most important  component of foreign trade. Technological imports and exports  means the import and export of technologies, which has developed  and expanded in our country following the implementation of  reform and opening up. We have gained a lot of experience in  these two trade areas, and the Foreign Trade Law provides more  detailed stipulations about them. The international service  trade, however, is a new task for our country. It is also a  rather complex trade area which involves many trades and  departments, such as banking, insurance, transportation,  tourism, telecommunications, consultative services, and  contracts for projects. Each type of service has its unique  character. Therefore, the Foreign Trade Law only stipulates the  general principle one must abide by when conducting  international service trade.    Reporter: Would you please brief us on the main contents of  the Foreign Trade Law?    Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law is the basic law on foreign  trade. It mainly stipulates basic principles and policy and  prescribes the general framework of a management system for our  country's foreign trade. The Foreign Trade Law mainly  prescribes the following systems, which form the basic system  for foreign trade management: 1) The system of examining and  approving foreign trade enterprises. 2) Besides establishing  the principle of free imports and exports for the import and  export of cargoes and technologies, the law clearly stipulates  items which are banned or whose import is limited. The Foreign  Trade Law stipulates that quotas and permits be employed to  manage the limited import and export of cargoes and  technologies. The distribution of quotas will be based on the  principle of efficiency, fairness, openness, and fair  competition. 3) Regarding international service trade, the  Foreign Trade Law stipulates that our country shall gradually  open up its service trade markets in line with international  treaties and agreements to which it is a party or member, so  that other parties or members can enjoy market access  opportunities and national treatment. 4) The law establishes an  antidumping and antisubsidy system which also provides for  guarantee measures. The system will provide suitable relief to  relevant industries of our country which are harmed by unfair  trade practices in foreign countries, or to relevant industries  of our country which have difficulty undertaking international  businesses ventures which our country assumes. 5) The Foreign  Trade Law also stipulates various measures to promote foreign  trade development, including building import and export banks,  setting up foreign trade development funds and funds for  risk-taking, carrying out export tax reimbursement, and  encouraging the development of businesses providing foreign  trade consultative services.    Reporter: What are the main characteristics of the Foreign  Trade Law?    Wu Yi: The main characteristics of the Foreign Trade Law can  be summed up in two sentences: First, the law proceeds from the  national condition. Second, the law gets us close to  international practices. The building of the socialist market  economy is a progressive process which cannot be accomplished in  one step. We fully took into consideration China's special  national condition when we formulated the Foreign Trade Law.  Under the present situation where the enterprise operating  mechanism has not been fully transformed and where the mechanism  of self-restriction and self-supervision in enterprises is still  not perfect, entirely abandoning the system of foreign trade  enterprise approval will result in chaos in foreign trade  orders.    Cases in point are the raging of the "great  commodity war" several years ago, foreign countries' leveling  frequent dumping charges against China's export commodities in  recent years, and the recurrent problem of importing duplicate  equipment. Therefore, we still stipulate an approval system for  foreign trade enterprises in the Foreign Trade Law, despite the  fact that this system was questioned by GATT member nations.  Regarding commodity and technology imports, we proceed from the  reality that China is still a developing country. Therefore, we  stipulate that in order to establish or accelerate the pace of  the establishment of a specific Chinese industry, and to  safeguard China's international financial position and to ensure  China's international balance of payments, China may impose  restrictions on imports and exports when it deems necessary. In  consideration of the fact that China's service sector is still  undeveloped and that China lacks experience in international  services, we therefore stipulated in the Foreign Trade Law that  China will practice a principle of gradually opening its markets  according to signed international treaties and agreements,  instead of practicing a principle that allows the free import  and export of goods and technologies.    At the same time, the Foreign Trade Law fully shows China's  determination to bring China's economy in line with the world  economy. This can be seen in the following areas. First, the  Foreign Trade Law clearly stipulates in the general rules that  China practices a unified foreign trade system. Second, the  imposition of bans and restrictions on the import of goods and  technology will be based on the reasons and methods stipulated  in the Foreign Trade Law; the reasons stipulated in the Foreign  Trade Law are completely in accord with GATT. Third, on the  issue of providing appropriate protection for domestic  industries, the Foreign Trade Law did away with the  import-substitution and administrative examination and approval  system; instead, it adopted such international practices as  anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, and protection systems. Fourth, the  Foreign Trade Law did away with various subsidy systems for  foreign trade enterprises and clearly stipulated that foreign  trade enterprises must independently run their businesses and be  responsible for their own profits and losses. The state  encourages the development of foreign trade. It will work out  such internationally-practiced promotional measures as setting  up financial organizations with the specific purpose of  promoting the development of foreign trade, establishing foreign  trade development funds, foreign trade development risk funds,  and carrying out the reimbursement of export taxes.    Reporter: As a competent department for China's foreign  trade, what kind of steps will the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation take to ensure the full implementation of  the Foreign Trade Law?    Wu Yi: As a basic law, the Foreign Trade Law stipulated  China's basic policy, principles, and a major framework for the  management of foreign trade. To ensure the full implementation  of the Foreign Trade Law, it is necessary to formulate a large  number of supplementary administrative rules and laws.  Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation will step up drafting a number of administrative  rules and laws, including regulations on foreign trade  enterprise approval systems, foreign trade agency systems,  anti-dumping activities, anti-subsidy activities, protection  measures, import and export associations, and border trade  management.</p>

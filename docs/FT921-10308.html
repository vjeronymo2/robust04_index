			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Time Warner to acquire remaining stake in ATC TIME Warner, the entertain-ment and media group, yesterday announced plans to commit up to Dollars 1.6bn by 1995 to acquire the 18 per cent of its publicly quoted American Television and Communications (ATC) cable television subsidiary that it does not already own. ATC, which is the second biggest US cable television operator, recorded Dollars 120m net income in 1990, on revenues of Dollars 1.1bn. The complicated arrangement would assign to the holders of 19.7m outstanding ATC shares a series of Time Warner redeemable reset notes in exchange for their stock. The notes will not bear any interest until August 1995, at which point Time Warner will have the right to offer the noteholders either cash or a mixture of cash and other Time Warner debentures with a value of Dollars 82.50 a note. The total value of cash and/or debentures would thus be Dollars 1.6bn, which compares with the present Dollars 1.15bn market value of the 18 per cent of ATC equity listed on the over-the-counter market. On Wall Street, ATC's shares closed Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 58.</p>

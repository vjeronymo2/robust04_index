			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Low-cost endowment picture changes - Lautro's revision of rates to determine benefit illustrations looks set to hike premiums PREMIUMS on low-cost endowment policies could rise from November 1 when life companies will be required to switch to a new illustration basis. The premiums are determined by assuming an investment rate over the term of the contract, so that the premiums, less charges and mortality costs, accumulated at this assumed rate of return will be sufficient to repay the mortgage total. The higher the assumed rate of investment return, the lower the premium. However, if the life company does not achieve that return (and the higher the rate, the greater the chance of not achieving it) then the ultimate maturity value will fall short of the value of the mortgage and the housebuyer will have to make up the difference. However, unless this feature is pointed out to housebuyers, many would not appreciate the potential danger of underperformance on the maturity value and the financial consequences to them. One purpose of illustrating benefits is to indicate the downside as well as the upside in a life assurance contract. The basis under which life companies prepare benefit illustrations is determined by Lautro, the industry regulator. Under the present system, Lautro lays down the values of all the parameters used in the calculations - the investment returns, the mortality rates and the charges. Benefit illustrations currently have to be shown for two investment returns  -the objective being to indicate variation in benefits from different investment returns. The rates for life assurance contracts are based on net investment returns of 7 per cent and 10.5 per cent. Life companies can show benefits on other investment returns, provided they fall between the two rates. A common, but by no means universal, rate of return used to calculate low-cost endowment premiums is 7.5 per cent net. When this is shown alongside the present Lautro illustration basis - as shown in the table - the maturity shortfall at 7 per cent appears insignificant - if one can regard Pounds 3,600 as insignificant. But under the revised Lautro basis, the illustrations must be calculated on new rates of return - 5 per cent and 10 per cent net. Those figures highlight the effect of investment underperformance, as seen from the table. At 5 per cent, the maturity value would be just Pounds 34,400 - only 68.8 per cent of the mortgage amount. In this example, the houseowner would have to find Pounds 15,600 from other sources to pay off the mortgage. Of course, under modern low-cost endowment contracts, the premiums are not fixed throughout the term. The progress of the contract is checked periodically and if there is an investment shortfall the premiums are increased. Nevertheless, many housebuyers taking out low-cost endowments do not expect to pay higher premiums at a later date. Such a change invalidates any comparisons made with the costs of repayment mortgages. Life companies, particularly those currently assuming a rate higher than 7.5 per cent, are considering whether to calculate low-cost endowment premiums on a lower assumed investment return. The shortfall with the 5 per cent illustration would then not look so bad. The eventual maturity value on a low-cost endowment, for those contracts which are held to maturity, will depend on the actual investment return achieved by the life company over the term of the contract. Neither the officials at Lautro nor life company investment managers can predict what that return will be. What the new illustration basis does show, however, is that investment returns over the remaining years of this century and the early years of the next century are not expected to show the same high returns achieved in the 1980s, in spite of the UK equity market reaching new heights this year. It also shows investors the ultimate cost if the life company concerned fails to achieve the assumed investment and the likelihood of premiums being increased in the future. Hence, those housebuyers who still intend to, or are persuaded to, repay their mortgages through low-cost endowments should look carefully at the assumed investment return - it will be shown on the quotation - and the size of the shortfall shown on the 5 per cent illustration. Low-cost endowments could take an even harder knock sometime in 1994 when illustrations will have to be produced on an own charge basis, when the life company must use its own charges in calculating the benefits and not the standard Lautro charges. Periodic surveys of low-cost endowments in Money Management include illustrations on an own charge basis using the same rate of return. The latest survey revealed differences of one-third between the life companies with the lowest and highest charges.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Illustrative maturity values for low cost endowment policy                         Rate of return(net)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Old basis                  New basis           assumed return        7%           10.5%           5%          10%           7.5%   pounds46,300  pounds78,800  pounds34,400  pounds73,000  pounds50,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lautro/Standard Life.

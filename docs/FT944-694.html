			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Measure for measure: A new law on serving wine by the glass is about to come into force in the UK British Eurosceptics who sought refuge from Brussels legislation over a gin and tonic or a glass of wine will from the new year have to seek alternative solace. On January 1 measures that date back to 1990 will finally become law and a new metric quantity, 25ml or multiples, will become the norm for dispensing gin, rum, vodka and whisky instead of the quarter, fifth or sixth of a gill (a gill is a quarter of a pint). This much is straightforward. But when Brussels turns its attention to the dispensing of wine by the glass - an increasingly popular way of drinking good wine - restaurateurs, wine bar owners and customers may feel not only confused but that their individuality is being encroached upon. The same legislation will now dictate that wine by the glass can be served only in quantities of 125ml or 175ml, or multiples. More significantly, it specifies how these can be dispensed. In future, a restaurant or bar, no matter how smart, can serve a glass of wine, no matter how cheap or expensive, only into a lined glass, stamped by a government-approved body, or into a free-standing, government-approved measure known as an 'optic' that is then emptied into the restaurant's own glass. The restaurant industry is upset for two reasons. First, it has accommodated customers' orders for less but better wine over the past five years - demands induced by the recession, health concern, tougher drink-driving laws and wider appreciation of fine wine. Many restaurants now offer far more than just house wine by the glass and in glassware superior to the formerly ubiquitous spherical Paris goblet. Such gentility is now at an end. The Upstairs Bar at The Savoy will henceforth be dispensing glasses of chablis premier cru and Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc at Pounds 6 each into the Savoy's own glasses conspicuously marked with a government line and stamp on the side. Second, restaurateurs feel their attempts to discuss the legislation have met with an unenthusiastic response. Mr John Davy, who controls 50 wine bars around the City and sells 50,000 cases of wine a year, describes the legislation as 'ridiculous'. 'It's like trying to control the quantity of smoked salmon served on a plate in The Ritz. The legislation has nothing to do with quality - the overriding factor in the wine we buy and serve - and everything to do with quantity. In fact the new laws will hurt our customers, as until now my staff have been free-pouring 130ml of good wine for a small glass and 180ml into a large glass.' When it became obvious that this legislation would become law in August 1994, Mr Davy made various attempts to incorporate his company's etched logo on to the glass with the required line as the bottom of the logo. This, he felt, would at least detract from the ugliness of the lined glass. All aesthetic suggestions, however, have been rejected and Mr Davy has to buy an extra 1,000 dozen stamped wine glasses, with the stamping costing an extra 20p per glass. The Department of Trade and Industry, which will be supervising this legislation, says it is intended 'to bring us into line with the rest of Europe'. This does not seem to be borne out by the situation in Paris, where one leading restaurateur who has been serving exciting wines by the glass for the past 15 years reports that French law dictates only that the quantity of wine served by the glass be clearly stipulated. He serves 110ml of wine in a glass in one of his restaurants, 120ml in another and 80ml of sherry in both. But UK law enforcers have little faith in French measures, it appears. On a recent visit to Paris, one leading London chef/restaurateur, in anticipation of these new measures, went to Verrerie des Halles, the specialist supplier of glassware to French bars, restaurants and cafes, and bought a 25ml optic for his bar. This his staff now uses. But when he phoned the DTI to establish whether this would be acceptable after January 1, he was told he would have to have the optic checked, approved and stamped by his local standards officer. Reciprocity of liquid measures, the DTI added, would not be possible for at least two years. The DTI's defensiveness may have something to do with an imprecise knowledge of the world of wine. The new legislation will cover only table wines. Champagne, port and sherry are excluded, as are digestifs such as brandy and armagnac which can be free-poured. When I asked a DTI spokeswoman about Sauternes, the sweet wine of Bordeaux, she said that this was a digestif and so could be free-poured. When I pointed out that Sauternes is a sweet table wine, she replied that therefore it had to be served in measures of 125ml or 175ml. This is a bad precedent. Such a drink coming at the end of a meal should be sipped and served in measures no larger than 90ml or 100ml. Any visit to a restaurant from January 1 could now involve the following: an aperitif served from a 25ml optic, a glass of wine poured into a lined, stamped glass and a digestif free-poured from the bottle. As one restaurateur comments: 'It's confusing enough to turn anyone to drink.'</p>

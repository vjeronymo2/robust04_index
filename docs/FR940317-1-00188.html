			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 will assist brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in satisfying their obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and specifically under section 15(c)(2), by conditioning the underwriting and recommendation of municipal securities on the availability of current issuer information. By providing an efficient and timely means of access to disclosure, the proposed amendments will ensure that information will be available in the future regarding underwritten securities. As a result, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers will be better able to recommend municipal securities in the secondary market based on current issuer information. Fraud and manipulation in both the primary and secondary markets for municipal securities thus will be deterred. Furthermore, the availability of secondary market disclosure to all municipal securities market participants will assist investors in protecting themselves from misrepresentation or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'') <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with a primary offering of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more (``Offering'') <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository (``NRMSIR''). The prohibition would apply to underwriters that have committed contractually to act as an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective date of the rule amendment. This proposal responds, in part, to a suggestion in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  in which a broad spectrum of municipal securities market participants supported wider dissemination of issuer information and improved mechanisms for such dissemination, to assure that securities professionals have a sufficient factual basis on which to recommend secondary market transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Rule 15c2&hyph;12(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments also include an exemption for small and infrequent issuers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Section II.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Dec. 20, 1993) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Joint Statement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> '') at 2&hyph;3.

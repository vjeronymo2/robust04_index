The article says:    All manner of contradictions peculiar to the capitalist  system give rise to chaos and crisis in politics, the economy,  ideology and morality in those countries where capitalism has  been revived.    Such catastrophic situation in those countries is entirely  attributable to the reactionary nature of socio-economic reforms  that have brought the revival of capitalism.    Hence, the quicker the process of reform, the more serious  crisis and chaos.    The only way out of the crisis in the countries where  capitalism has been revived is to rebuild socialism.    Socialism is incomparably superior to capitalism.    Capitalism is an anti-popular society where exploitation of  man by man prevails and a tiny handful of exploiting class lord  it over, a corrupt society based on extreme egoism.    But, socialism is a genuine society for the people where the  popular masses are masters of everything and everything serves  them, a superior society based on collectivism.    If the basic principles of socialist construction had been  maintained and the advantages of the socialist system brought  into full play, frustration of socialism and revival of  capitalism would not have taken place at all in some countries.    Grudge against the revival of capitalism is swelling up and  aspiration for socialism growing strong among the people in  those countries who have realised it through bitter experiences.    The imperialists and reactionaries are making every  conceivable effort to check the revival of socialism.    This is a move to block the social progress of those  countries and put the peoples of those countries under the  permanent yoke of domination and subordination.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SYLMAR DELAYS GAMES IN WAKE OF PLAYER'S DEATH  </P> <P> Sylmar High has postponed two baseball games this week following the death of  senior outfielder Ryan Vela, who died in a car accident last Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Sylmar was scheduled to play Monroe on Monday and Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Valley Pac-8 Conference games have not been rescheduled, but the teams  could play as soon as Friday, according to Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella.  </P> <P> "I think the sooner we do things and get our mind off it, the better,"  Donatella said.  </P> <P> Donatella met with his players throughout the day Monday, starting with  sessions in the morning with school psychologists. The Los Angeles Unified  School District dispatched a support team to counsel players and students who  grieved Vela's loss.  </P> <P> After a brief team meeting in the afternoon, Donatella canceled practice.  </P> <P> "It's been pretty tough here," he said. "Everyone in the school is aware of  what happened. I'm pretty much in the same boat as they are as far as grieving.  </P> <P> "I was in shock Saturday and then met with his parents. That was one of the  toughest days in my life."  </P> <P> Vela, 17, was killed at 1:45 a.m. Saturday after the car in which he was a  passenger was struck by a Los Angeles police car, according to police. Teammate  Pete Amador, 18, suffered a fractured left scapula and Jose Gomez, 18, suffered  head injuries, police said.  </P> <P> The driver of the car, a 17-year-old Sylmar boy, was arrested on suspicion of  felony manslaughter and was released to his parents, according to police.  </P> <P> Vela had batted .450 and scored seven runs through the team's first eight  games.  </P></p>

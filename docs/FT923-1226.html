			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian telephone utility rises 14% on strong sales SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, raised operating profits by 14 per cent to L689.7bn (Dollars 554m) in the first half of this year, due partly to a 12 per cent rise in sales to L10,601bn. The company warned that Italy's slowing economic growth could hit earnings and turnover this year. However, Mr Ernesto Pascale, chairman, 'promises to maintain profitability at all events,' by maintaining productivity improvements and investment spending. The growth in calls had been particularly strong on long-distance traffic, while SIP's highly profitable mobile communications activities continued their surge, with a 59 per cent jump in subscribers. Subscriber growth for all telephone services, which increased by 3.3 per cent in the first half, was maintaining 1991 levels. SIP said that forecasts for this year's earnings would be complicated by the effect of the government's budgetary plans, which involve higher taxation and a possible freeze on tariffs. Elsag Bailey, the stock market-listed automation equipment subsidiary of the state-owned Finmeccanica group, raised operating profits by 20 per cent to L48bn in the first half of this year. The company predicts a year-end turnover figure of around L1,400bn, which would be 11 per cent up on last year's L1,258bn.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Farmers seek to save wages board FARMERS and their employees are fighting to save the Agricultural Wages Board, the only remaining statutory body to set minimum pay rates for low-paid workers. Their campaign has persuaded Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, to extend the consultation period about the future of the board until November. The deadline had been September. Mrs Shephard, as employment secretary this year guided legislation through parliament to scrap wages councils next month. The councils set minimum rates for 2.5m private-sector workers. But the legislation does not cover the board, which is governed by agricultural rather than employment regulations. Farmers and farm workers believe the board is still relevant in an industry where it is estimated that workers earn 76 per cent of the average male wage and craftworkers have a minimum rate of Pounds 159 for a 39-hour week. Many employers pay above minimum rates, but many farm workers nevertheless claim income support. Mr Paul Redgate, a national officer of the TGWU general union, which absorbed the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers in 1982, said free collective bargaining worked where there was a number of employees, but most farms employed very few workers. 'It is difficult to take industrial action against your boss who is probably working alongside you,' he said. Mr Oliver Walston, who employs four men on his 2,000-acre farm in Cambridgeshire and who is active in the National Farmers Union, said 'embarrassment' was a polite way of describing the anguish he would feel if he had to negotiate with people he knew well.</p>

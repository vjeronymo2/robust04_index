			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F> Yermakov and Igor Shchogolev]    [Text] Paris June 8 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev today signed a package of agreements with the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  It includes a declaration on cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the OECD and an agreement between the Russian  Government and the OECD on the organisation's privileges and  immunities in the Russian Federation.    The documents were also signed by OECD Secretary-General  Jean-Claude Paye and chairman of the OECD council session,  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of Ireland Dick Spring.    The declaration on cooperation envisages, among other  things,  that Russia will now enjoy the status of observer in various  OECD bodies, that it will get access to information possessed by  the organisation. The OECD will draw up surveys of the economic  situation in Russia, will make recommendations for the  implementation of economic reforms, and will assess their  effectiveness. The second document signed today lays down the  terms for the work of OECD experts in Russia.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ACTON OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH REMOVING SIGNS  </P> <P> Unlike Zorro or the Lone Ranger, the vigilantes of Acton do not wear masks.  </P> <P> And prosecutors say there is little doubt that Charles Brink and Joel Levy,  members of the Town Council in this unincorporated mountain community southwest  of Palmdale, were behind a campaign in which hundreds of real estate and  developers' signs were torn down between May and September.  </P> <P> On Tuesday prosecutors filed charges of felony conspiracy to commit theft and  vandalism, felony grand theft, misdemeanor vandalism and misdemeanor petty  theft against Brink and Levy in the alleged sign caper.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Tuesday, Brink said: "People have a right to enforce  the law. If a vigilante enforces the law, they have a right to do it. . . . We  have the support of the people in Acton and of the county code."  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles County district attorney's office disagrees.  </P> <P> The complaint filed in Lancaster Superior Court alleges that Brink and Levy  stole or vandalized seven signs worth $3,500, some of which were legally posted  "open house" signs on private property.  </P> <P> Brink said he tore down the signs because he thought they were illegally posted  and a blight on the rural community, which has a population of 10,000. Levy  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> During meetings of the nine-member elected council on which he and Levy serve,  Brink allegedly boasted about tearing down more than 300 signs, according to  court records and prosecutors.  </P> <P> The Town Council is an advisory group to the county but is not a government  agency.  </P> <P> Prosecutors estimate that total losses to developers, real estate agents and  private homeowners exceed $30,000.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to have these two gentlemen accept responsibility for their  behavior," said Deputy Dist. Atty Pamela Rhodes. "Our concern is that public  leaders are taking a position that they are above the law. And they are not."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said it was unusual to have to press such charges against members  of an elected body.  </P> <P> Even in the cases where county sign ordinances were violated, Rhodes said,  Brink and Levy should have contacted county officials rather than trespassing  on private property and stealing or destroying signs.  </P> <P> Brink, who said he and Levy were planning to surrender today to authorities in  Lancaster, said he tore down only illegal signs that he believed were on public  property. He said most developers have cooperated with his efforts.  </P> <P> "Of the 300 signs I've removed, only one that I can think of was on private  property, in which case that was trespassing and a mistake," he said.  </P> <P> Brink asserted that the prosecution was politically motivated and that Mark  Lebens, a manager with Woodgate Real Estate Corp. in Palmdale, was behind the  effort to have criminal charges filed.  </P> <P> Lebens, who was among those who complained to the Sheriff's Department about  the vandalism, said of Brink: "I think his position with the Town Council has  gone to his head."  </P> <P> Although Lebens acknowledged that one billboard-type sign near the Antelope  Valley Freeway that was defaced had been posted illegally, he said the other  signs were legal.  </P></p>

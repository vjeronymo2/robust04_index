			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Regional issues get support As world leaders prepare to discuss global environmental problems at the Earth Summit in Rio, the UK government has been told by its Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (Acost) to focus environmental research more on local and regional issues. An Acost review of UK environmental research programmes concludes that the concentration of funds on global issues such as climate change 'could starve initiatives in other areas'. Acost recommends 'a move over time to greater focus on local and regional issues, many of which are pressing problems (for instance, waste management and land remediation)'. It points out that huge sums will be spent tackling local pollution over the next decade - for example Pounds 28bn by the UK water industry - and says 'research could produce cheaper or better ways of improving these local and regional environmental problems'. Total public spending on environmental research is Pounds 200m a year on a narrow definition - and as much as Pounds 400m a year on a very wide definition. The lower figure would represent 5 per cent of total government R&amp;D, a similar level to other industrialised countries. The biggest single area of spending is the physics of the global atmosphere, which consumes about Pounds 55m a year. Total spending on water pollution, including oceans and seas, lakes and rivers, amounts to Pounds 40m. At present much environmental research focuses on the scientific processes that determine the system being studied. As these become better understood, Acost says, the emphasis should switch to investigating the specific impact of changes on the environment and remedial measures that can be taken to combat undesirable changes. The report was written by an Acost committee chaired by Robert May, professor of zoology at Oxford University. Environmental Research Programmes, an Acost Report. HMSO. Pounds 11.95.</p>

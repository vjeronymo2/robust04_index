			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by South African President Nelson Mandela at the </F> WEF southern Africa summit in Cape Town, South Africa, on 9  June; issued on 9 June on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] Your Excellencies;    President Sam Nujoma of Namibia; President Robert Mugabe  of Zimbabwe; President Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania; visiting  cabinet ministers; business leaders, and fellow South Africans    Allow me to express my gratitude to the organisers of the  World Economic Forum [WEF] for this timely august summit of  southern African leaders and world business. It is particularly  significant for us that this summit should take place in South  Africa, and Cape Town in particular, so soon after the  epoch-making changes that have taken place.    That we can meet at this level, at the southern tip of the  continent, is tribute to a mission fulfilled. We once more  express our profound gratitude to your excellencies, the  business leaders and the world at large for the generous  solidarity you extended to us during the dark days of apartheid.    The rebirth that we celebrate in South Africa is indeed a  rebirth of the region and the continent. This is our collective  achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to  exploit our great potential and, indeed, to boldly cross the  threshold to a new and great era. At last, Africa in general and  southern Africa in particular, can build a new all-inclusive  partnership based on freedom, democracy and social justice.    For us in South Africa, this is a time of great joy. Joy at  the rediscovery, as a united people, of our common humanity, our  common interests and our common destiny.    Ours is a delicate transition. But we are confident that we  have entered it with a new national spirit. The first democratic  elections which we have just conducted and the atmosphere of  peace that has prevailed in this period inspires us with  confidence that we shall succeed in our endeavours.    Lest we forget: the transformation we are living through is  the result of years of intensive and protracted struggle. It is  a result of difficult and sometimes harrowing negotiations. A  process that ultimately resulted in the meeting of minds among  the major political players.    We are heartened by the progress already made by the  government of national unity in reaching consensus on the most  important challenges facing the nation.    Differences do remain. But they manifest themselves within  the context of non-racial democracy. There is a spirit abroad to  ensure that we achieve the common objectives that we have set  ourselves, primarily to build a better life for all our people  and ensure peace, stability and economic growth. The  constitutional assembly will soon sit to draft a new  constitution for the country. And we are confident that the  spirit of consensus-seeking which characterised the multi-party  negotiations will display itself fully in this regard.    Quite certainly, transitions everywhere do breed  uncertainty.  And South Africa is no exception. In particular, we experienced  significant outflows of capital, and we still experience caution  among domestic and foreign investors. But the tide is turning,  occasioned by the manifest display of a national togetherness  that South Africa has hitherto never experienced.    We face a long and hard road to address the havoc wrought by  decades of apartheid. The challenge to ensure social justice and  stability is as urgent as it is crucial.    Put in brief, this means building a people-centred and  caring society. It requires that we use all our resources and  skills to broaden the base of the economy and ensure that it  serves all the people.    It demands that we enlarge the pool of skills and unleash  the  energies of the people, as a whole, to contribute to the twin  processes of nation-building and economic development.    It also entails addressing the disparities in residential  infrastructure, income distribution, provision of health  facilities and educational opportunities.    The government of national unity is of the unanimous view  that all this needs to be done and done urgently. But also that  the reconstruction and development targets that we set ourselves  should not upset macro-economic balances and undermine fiscal  discipline.    All of us recognise that peace and stability are crucial for  economic growth and development. We are determined to ensure  that all South Africans, including those who fear democracy, can  rest assured in the knowledge that change is in their interest  too.    This challenge is as much a South African one as it applies  to the region as a whole. Now that we have redeemed our pledge  with destiny, the people of southern Africa can start in earnest  to build a peaceful and developing sub-continent. We have to  urgently resolve the problems of conflict in parts of the  region, whilst we undo the effects of apartheid destabilisation.    Now we can together address the legacy of colonial under-  development and imbalances within and among countries of the  region. We can together galvanise the human and material  resources that the region commands, to serve the people. We can  together develop the physical infrastructure necessary for  development across all countries.    For these goals to be achieved, we need to start setting out  the integrated strategies required. This also means urgently  addressing the merging patterns that would, in the long run, not  benefit the region.    The lop-sided development bequeathed us by our colonial past  has resulted in the relative under-development of many countries  of the region. Related to this is the danger of unhealthy  migration of capital as well as skilled personnel to areas with  developed infrastructure. It is to the overall advantage of the  region that this trend is arrested and reversed. More  accurately, it needs to be obviated through strategies for  regional economic integration.    In the more distant future, our common objective is the  realisation of the Treaty of Abudja, the creation of an African  common market. In the near future, we are faced with the task of  ensuring that the programmes of both the SADC [Southern African  Development Community] and Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and  Southern Africa] are realised in the new political and social  context. With regional integration will emerge a mutually  beneficial arrangement regarding movement of goods, capital and  labour.    Such regional integration will need to address the broad  task  of reconstruction and development in the entire region.    We will venture to say, that modern economic planning  dictates that inter-national co-operation requires more that  just agreements on macro-economic imperatives and broad  development projects. For, impacting on these factors is the  basic question on how the partners jointly and severally create  an economic environment which attracts investments and benefits  ordinary people.    This means jointly grappling with issues such as:    Delivery of employment, shelter, nutrition, health,  education  and training for some 100-million people on a sustainable basis;  prioritising the areas, within our own countries, most in  need, and doing it in such a way that we stimulate sustainable  growth and development; seeking and finding the balance  between our noble goals and the resource opportunities and  constraints; avoiding economic and financial arrangements,  including the debt-trap, which can only have the effect of  eroding our countries' sovereignty.    We who are only starting to take the first steps out of the  mire of racial subjugation, are well aware that the experience  countries of the region have gathered will stand us in good  stead. We can only benefit from the new relationship that is  emerging.    As we take our rightful place among nations of Africa, South  Africa commits itself to join our neighbours in rising to the  mammoth challenge presented by a growing affliction in many  parts of the world known as "Afro-pessimism" -- loss of  confidence in our continent's capacity to overcome  under-development and declining standards.    It is a task which we are called upon to undertake with a  singleness of purpose and with confidence, remembering that the  thriving countries of Asia, the socalled Asian Tigers were only  20 years ago written off as hopeless basket cases. This can only  be achieved if there is purposeful interaction among our  countries.    Democratic South Africa enters this new partnership as one  player amongst many. We harbour no desire to be the dominant  partner, for the region and South Africa itself would lose in  the long run. We entertain no illusion of becoming the regional  benefactor because such capacity we do not possess.    Rather, we seek to join governments of the region in taking  up the cudgels on behalf of all the peoples. We seek to join  them in attracting significant investment flows and in reaching  beneficial trade agreements. Along with countries of the region  we are determined to ensure that the goods mined, harvested and  manufactured in the region become internationally competitive.  We are committed to strengthen regional institutions such as the  SADC and Comesa and at the same time strengthen bilateral  relations with each of our neighbours.    This we resolved to do both as a government and in  partnership with various institutions of civil society such as  business houses, trade unions, as well as educational, health  and other bodies.    We are confident that South Africa will soon achieve the  rates of growth necessary for us to meet our objectives. The  last two quarters have demonstrated that GDP [gross domestic  product] growth is on the upswing. This will be of benefit not  only to South Africa's people but will help the movement towards  greater southern African prosperity.    The path that South Africa has traversed might be unique in  many respects. But, to the extent that we have based ourselves  on the experiences of southern Africa and Africa as a whole, it  is a common achievement and common heritage.    One month into post-colonial Africa, in the true sense of  the  word, we are confident that regional and continental efforts  will ensure that the injunction -- God bless Africa -- finds  full expression in our prosperity.</p>

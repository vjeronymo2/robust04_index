			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces took  control Sunday of the riverbank where the Moslem town of Gorazde  is located, and Serb tanks rolled into the southern part of  town, the United Nations said.    UN spokesman Dacre Halloway said the Serb forces took over  the bank after crossing the Drina river, which had been the  frontline between the two warring parties. He said there was  sniper fire outside the office of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees.    Serb forces have been attacking the Gorazde enclave for the  past two weeks.</p>

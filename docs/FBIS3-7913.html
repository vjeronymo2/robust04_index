			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Attila Kert and Kata Peli Nagy] </F>   [Excerpts] [Peli Nagy] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  wants society's trust and support to build a better Hungary;  this is how Gyula Horn, party chairman, closed the party  congress. The vast majority of delegates accepted the party's  list without changes. The first person on the list is Party  Chairman Gyula Horn followed by Sandor Nagy, chairman of the  MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], and  Laszlo Bekesi, responsible for the party's economic policy.    On the list containing 174 names, 11 people represent trade  unions, eight are members of the Left-Wing Youth Association,  and three represent the National Federation of Pensioners.  According to the decision of the party's executive, only those  who conclude a political agreement with the party can run in the  colors and with the support of the MSZP. The point of this is  that later, if a person happens to leave the party's  parliamentary group, he or she will also have to resign his or  her mandate.    Matyas Szueroes, deputy speaker of the National Assembly,  decided to keep his place on the national list. [passage  omitted]    In the political debate Bekesi sharply criticized the  present  government's ideas regarding bank privatization and its  overspending from the budget. He blamed the government for  sacrificing agriculture and for carrying out privatization on  ideological grounds. At the moment, the foreign debt amounts to  $24.5 billion and the internal debt is 3 trillion forints.  According to Bekesi, the increase of real wages this year and  next year cannot be expected.    Talking about the internal arguments of the party, Bekesi  said if the MSZP would win the elections or would come second,  it would not be able to avoid governing and preparations should  be made for a social-liberal coalition now.    [Kert] The MSZP would not join a future government at any  price, Horn said. The Socialists' condition is that the future  coalition partners agree on the necessity of a social pact. In  the interest of easing the economic crisis they should be  willing to continue, what is more, to speed up compensation  process, to create a venture-friendly environment and to support  agriculture with encouraging credit and trade policies. If we  could not fulfill our promises we would step aside, Horn said in  ending his closing speech.</p>

The minister of state for cabinet affairs told KUNA that a  meeting was held today in the presence of all the ministers,  during which the ministers studied the comprehensive speech that  was delivered by the heir apparent and the prime minister to the  Kuwaiti people last Monday [4 April], particularly the paragraph  pertaining to the need for a government reshuffle in harmony  with the requirements of the coming phase.    Al-Dakhil announced that the ministers agreed to give the  heir apparent an opportunity to carry out the required  reshuffle.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Coal cost forecast 'revised upwards' AN assessment of possible production costs at 27 British Coal pits was revised upwards by more than 15 per cent following a government request, according to the company that provided it. The John T Boyd consultancy reassessed its estimate of average potential costs at these pits after being requested by its client, the Department of Energy, to 'adopt a more middle-of-the-road approach'. This resulted in a figure for potential coal production costs of Pounds 1.33 per gigajoule - the unit of energy from coal - appearing in the company's unpublished April 1992 report. This figure was up from Pounds 1.15 projected in an original draft dated December 1991. Disclosure of the department's request, in written evidence from Boyd to the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee, is likely to rekindle debate over the coal industry's potential competitiveness. British Coal has tentatively agreed contracts with the two main electricity generators in England and Wales by which it would sell coal at Pounds 1.50 per gigajoule. In its evidence, Boyd indicates that its Pounds 1.15 estimate was 'based on a relatively unconstrained approach', assuming 'freedom to manage the mines on a commercial basis'. It continues: 'Considering the sweeping industrial and regulatory changes incorporated into our estimate of potential cost, the Department of Energy requested that we adopt a more middle-of--the-road approach which assumed existing regulations (within the context of prevailing industrial practices) were gradually modernised. 'This approach was used in our April 1992 report and produced the Pounds 1.33/GJ average cost at 100 per cent achievement-level conclusion.'</p>

Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali recently chaired  a  limited cabinet meeting to discuss the summit, the normal  transfer of the UMA chairmanship from Tunisia to Algeria, and a  follow-up of the implementation of the agreements and  achievements made during the period of Tunisia's chairmanship  throughout 1993.    Although the date of the sixth Maghreb summit is only five  days away, the fear of the summit being postponed for the fourth  time still exists.    Observers have confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is  feared that a number of the UMA leaders may not attend the  summit. So far there has been no support, at least not from  Morocco and Libya, for the holding of the summit.    Diplomatic observers have expressed fears that a further  postponement of the sixth Maghreb summit might open the way for  interpretations and claims as a result of which the UMA's  activities might be suspended.    The summit has already been postponed three times. [passage  omitted]</p>

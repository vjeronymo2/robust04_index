			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi  Province is starting its second World Bank-funded red soil  transformation project.    The six-year project will cost a total of 538.84 million  yuan, including 40 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans.    The program aims to transform 15,394 hectares of red-soil  land, with 12,300 hectares of land to be opened up for planting  fruit trees and creating grassland.    On the rest of the land, about 230,000 lean-meat pigs and  1,000 dairy cows will be raised.    The program also includes reconstruction of a 100,000-ton  fodder factory and a silk textile plant.    The program is strong on ecological development, with a  focus  on integration of farming, animal husbandry and fruit tree  cultivation.    It will also rationally allocate resources to infrastructure  construction and to setting up a social service network.    The program encourages farmers to go to the mountains to  open  up red soil land with contracted targets.</p>

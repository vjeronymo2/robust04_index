			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Property developers go to town in Jakarta: But their enthusiasm has led to a glut in the luxury market In the matter of a few years the shanty towns in centre of Jakarta have been replaced by high-rise office blocks, luxury apartments and five-star hotels, and rice paddies in the greater Jakarta area have been replaced with industrial estates and satellite towns. The property sector has been one of the fastest growing in the country, with most of the larger Indonesian conglomerates capitalising on their land assets and jumping on the bandwagon for real-estate development. So enthusiastic are property developers in Indonesia that they are now hoping to convince the government to approve a project involving the complete clean-up and rebuilding of Jakarta's 32km-long waterfront. In the first six months of this year, BKPM, Indonesia's Investment Co-ordinating Board, approved about Dollars 2.5bn worth of domestic investment projects in the construction, hotel and restaurant, housing and office sectors, which made up 16 per cent of total domestic investment approvals to July 15. Most of these projects are in and around Jakarta. However, oversupply is setting in and Jakarta's property market looks likely to experience some hard times. 'A massive glut could occur in 1996 for office space and it could take three or four years to clear,' said a Jakarta-based broker. Office rents have already been lowered and some landlords are hoping to pre-empt any difficulties by offering existing tenants cheap rentals in an attempt to lure them into leasing more space. Meanwhile, after the building sprees of previous years, industrial estates are finding it difficult to stir up interest in their lots. The estates were hit by a drop in foreign investment last year and some brokers point out that many are suffering setbacks because they are unable to guarantee a steady supply of electricity. Rentals and sales of residential apartments are also slumping. An excess of supply in the luxury residential apartment market has caused the overall average occupancy rate in Jakarta to fall to 81 per cent in June from 91 per cent at the beginning of the year. This has been made worse by developers' unwillingness to reduce rental rates and the fact that 'luxury' is not always an accurate description. With the outlook for luxury apartments looking bleak, the Indonesian government is considering opening the market to individual foreign buyers. To date, foreigners have only been allowed to rent property in Indonesia. Property consultants say they expect new legislation on this within the next six months. 'A lot of developers see that if foreigners were to buy houses then demand for their property would really pick up,' said Mr Craig Williams, director of PT Procon Indah, a property consultancy that works in association with Jones Lang Wootton. However, foreigners are unlikely to buy what Indonesians will not. In its most recent survey of the Jakarta property market, PT Procon Indah noted that developers often do not meet construction schedules, workmanship is of poor quality, and materials and fittings are inadequate. Other consultants also point out that safety standards are practically non-existent. Meanwhile, government officials complain of a continuing shortage in housing. Policy dictates that for every luxury house a developer builds, it must also construct three middle-income houses and six low-income houses. But that regulation is ignored. Middle income housing which caters to people earning between Dollars 1,500 and Dollars 3,000 a month, is the only sector offering significant growth prospects, even though Indonesia's middle class is not as huge a pool of buyers as it could be. The problem lies mainly in financing house purchases. There are no long-term interest rates in Indonesia which discourages banks from making long-term loans. The result is that most buyers of middle-income houses are speculators and this is 'a class which is traditionally not as stable as first-time buyers', a Jakarta-based broker said. Property development has been opened to full foreign ownership with the most recent deregulation package that loosened restrictions on foreign investment. Most foreign developers, however, prefer to enter the market in a joint venture with an Indonesian company. Laws governing land titles in Indonesia are complex, with the purchase of land not necessarily confering the right to ownership. The process of acquiring land can become a messy affair and stories abound of shanty-town dwellers who have been forcibly removed and inadequately compensated for their land. Despite the prospects, developers have commissioned a study that attempts to convince Jakarta's authorities to develop the city's waterfront into a new city centre, complete with office towers and residential housing. At present this neglected district of Jakarta is not a pretty sight. Untreated sewage pours out into an already polluted, black and oily sea, shanty towns with little or no sewage facilities perch on the coastline, prostitutes solicit on grubby beaches at night and the area suffers from a chronic shortage of drinking water. The project, if approved, would cost about Dollars 20bn and would involve all the existing big waterfront developers, including Dharmala Intiland, a listed property developer. If it is approved, it is difficult to see where financing for the development would come from. Development banks are expected to make some contribution but state-owned banks have been told to stop financing property development projects, although it is not clear whether this is being enforced. As one property analyst says, 'developers are incredibly ambitious but their expectations are not always realistic'.</p>

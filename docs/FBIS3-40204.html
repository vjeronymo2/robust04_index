			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Ao Teng [0277 7506] and </F> New China News Agency reporter Qu Zhenye [4234 2182 2814]:  "Electricity from the Northwest: A Report on Power-Industry  Construction in Nei Monggol"]    [Text] Nei Monggol's electric power industry is developing  rapidly, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Northeast China  regions are continuously obtaining electricity for lighting and  heat from Nei Monggol.  <H3>  Power Shortages: An Opportunity for Electric Power  Development in the West </H3>   China's power shortages have continued for many years, and  in  particular, since a new round of rapid economic development  began, the sluggishness of the electric power industry has  become increasingly serious.    When the state announced the policy decision that the  country's energy development strategy should shift toward the  West, the party committee and government of the Nei Monggol  Autonomous Region wasted no time in setting the guidelines of  making coal-fired power production the pace-setter and having  the power industry stimulate both coal industry development and  the comprehensive development of the economy. Nei Monggol has  proved coal resources of 217.4 billion tons, and its long-term  reserves may exceed 1.2 trillion tons. In both these respects,  it is second in the country. It has 15 coal fields with reserves  of more than 5 billion tons; the Ordos coal field has coal  reserves equivalent to 10 percent of the national total and is  the largest of the world's seven major coal fields. Nei Monggol  has abundant water resources: the Yellow River, the Ergun River,  Daihai Lake and Huangqihai Lake are all within its boundaries.  The Yellow River flows through the large Wuhai, Dongsheng, and  Junggar coal fields. There are 17 locations that are suitable  for the construction of power plants with capacities of 1  million kW or more, with a total potential capacity of 35.47  million kW. Nei Monggol's territory spans the "three northern"  regions; it is near industrially developed regions that are  relatively resource-poor, and electric power markets in such  areas as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and  Heilongjiang offer extensive prospects.    The question of whether to ship coal or transmit energy has  been aggravated by the contradiction between rail transport and  haulage capacity. But the problem is becoming better understood  and views are maturing. In large-scale development of the  electric power industry, the changeover to local resource  conversion and from hauled coal to transmitted electricity will  both decrease the pressure on the railroads and realize the  objectives of a short construction cycle, low costs, and good  benefits.    Party secretary of the autonomous region Wang Qun [3769  5028]  has repeatedly emphasized that "If the development of the energy  industry can be done rapidly, it should not be done slowly, and  if it can be done at a run it should not be done at a walk. We  must make electric power lead the way, replace coal with  electricity, have the coal industry stimulate the power  industry, export more electric power outside the province, and  convert resource advantages into economic advantages." As a  result, the silent expanses of Mongolia have become the scene of  bustling activity in the construction of an electric power base.    Between 1988 and 1992, the region expended a total of 3.389  billion yuan to fund electric power construction. It installed  1.5098 million kW of new generating capacity, representing an  average increase of 30 percent a year. Its total installed  generating capacity has reached 4.103 million kW, and it has  built 793 km of 220-kV transmission lines. In the western zone,  the framework of a superhigh-voltage grid running eastward from  Wulashan to Datong has been built, and power lines have been  connected to the North China power grid and have been put into  operation. In five years, a total of 81.787 billion kWh of  electricity has been produced, yielding a profits tax of more  than 1.6 billion yuan.    Major electric power construction projects spread like  wildfire, and "sun cities" sprang up across the land. In the  course of five years, three 100,000-kW generating sets were  added at Baotou, and the installed capacity at the Fengzhen  power plant in the floodplain of the Yinma River reached 600,000  kW. The construction of the first stage of the Junggar power  plant, with two 100,000-kW generating sets, has been completed.  Work on the expansion of facilities at Hohhot, Yuanbaoshan,  Tongliao, and Huiliuhe and on new construction projects at  Haibowan, Yimin, Huolinhe, Youzhong, and Dalad has been whipped  up to a superhigh pace. Magnificent blueprints for 17 large  power plants with capacities of 100,000 kW or more have been  issued.    In the first six months of this year, Nei Monggol's electric  power industry has experienced four gratifying events: a total  output of 567.5 billion kWh and the transmission of 954 million  kWh of electricity to North China, representing increases of  13.8 and 17.04 percent respectively over last year; payment of  255 million yuan in profits taxes, up 14.14 percent from the  previous year; 80-percent implementation of 2.5 billion yuan in  investment funds; and the signing of 13 equipment delivery  contracts, representing a total of 4.6 million kW of capacity.  <H3>  Benefitting From Policies, and Using Others' Funds for Power  Production </H3>   Under a planned economy, the electric power industry  receives  centralized state investments for construction, prices are  specified centrally by the state, and output, distribution and  sales are controlled by government departments. As a result,  very large investments are inherently unmanageable, the prices  charged for electricity do not reflect production costs, the  enterprises take on increasing debt, and investment capabilities  are, in essence, lost. Nei Monggol's economic strength was  limited, and even in the best years, the local financial  departments could only squeeze out 30 or 40 million yuan in  funds for electric power.    In 1988, the leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power  Management Office signed an eight-year funding and production  agreement with the government of the autonomous region. This  broke the stereotype of having exclusive government control of  power production and began a new practice of independent  operations, "having those who pay the money produce the power  and receive the benefits," with unified creditor's rights. The  contract specified that the profits paid annually to the finance  organs would be entirely returned in the form of investments in  electric power construction; it instituted new prices for new  power generating facilities and new heat supply facilities; and  those who used external funding for power production were not  only to receive favorable consideration in state policies, but  in addition would be given special consideration in taxation,  land use, and the like. When this policy was announced,  investors appeared in droves. In the last several years, they  have established reliable investment partnership ties with a  multitude of domestic financial groups and enterprises, as well  as more than 10 countries and regions.    The leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power Management  Office further liberated its thinking by expanding funding  channels. Cause for encouragement is the fact that this April,  leaders from Beijing City and the Ministry of Electric Power  personally visited Nei Monggol to discuss arrangements for the  provision of electricity to the capital. For many years Beijing  has been short of electric power, and power cutoffs and cutbacks  are a frequent occurrence. This fact not only imposed serious  constraints on Beijing's economic development and caused great  inconvenience to the masses, but was also inconsistent with  Beijing's status as the capital. On 23 April, the three parties  signed a joint power generation agreement, whose first stage is  about to begin. According to the agreement, by 1995 Beijing will  have made contributions totaling 1.55 billion yuan, the  installed generating capacity in Nei Monggol's western power  grid will have increased from 1.835 million kW to 4 million kW,  and the amount of electricity that it supplies to Beijing will  have increased from 1.1 to 1.5 million kW, so that Beijing will  no longer experience power shutoffs. The second stage will begin  in 1996, and by the end of the Ninth 5-Year Plan, the installed  capacity of Nei Monggol's western power grid will reach 12  million kW, enabling it to supply 5 million kW of electricity  per year to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region.  <H5>  Will Electric Power Become the West's "Radiant Center"? </H5>   China's electric power industry bears a heavy burden and has  a long road to travel. This year, the Nei Monggol Autonomous  Region party committee repeatedly emphasized the guiding ideas  in accelerating power industry development. The Nei Monggol  Electric Power Management Office drafted objectives and measures  for the period through the end of the century in order to make  electric power construction the "radiant center" that will bring  prosperity to the western region.    -- Make reform increasingly thorough, transform the  mechanism, move toward markets, strengthen management, stabilize  existing power generating facilities, implement capital  construction investments of 1.83 billion yuan, commission  374,000 kW of generating capacity, and carry on effective  preparatory work for new power plant construction.    -- Make thorough use of advantages in resources, location,  and policy, develop funding channels, attract large amounts of  domestic and foreign construction investment.    -- Jointly with large domestic power production groups, use  such flexible and diverse forms as equipment investment  partnerships to obtain domestically produced equipment.  Concurrently, appoint experts to be responsible for obtaining  equipment from the west and from Russia. Implement mutual  guarantees for coal supply, power production, and transport,  unite with organizations that use electricity to produce steel  and aluminum, and assure that materials are delivered on time.    The objectives are as follows: add 4.5 million kW of new  generating capacity in the region by the end of the Eighth  5-Year Plan, with the total installed capacity reaching 8.25  million kW, and deliver 1.5 million kW of electricity to North  China and 2.3 million kW to Northeast China; by the year 2000,  bring the total installed generating capacity in the region to  21.369 million kW and deliver 5 million kW to North China and  6.5 million kW to Northeast China.    A Japanese economist exclaimed in amazement that China is  implementing a "concentric circle" strategy in its energy  economy. As he expressed it, the Ordos is the inner circle,  which will be the first to produce an effect and also the pivot  which will receive the benefits first. The second circle, which  radiates outward for 200 km, will constitute Nei Monggol's  central economic region. Finally, using the world's most  advanced technology, electric power will be transmitted outward  over a radius of 1000 km. These radiating circles will thus  encompass the central region, representing a third of China's  area. Thus the radiating segments of circles or "gradient  circles" produced by the relatively developed coastal regions  will advance circle by circle into the interior, and the  resource-rich great northwestern region will radiate its  powerful electricity outwards in expanding circles. Ultimately,  when the two sets of radiating circles coalesce into a network,  the differences between northern and southern China and between  eastern and western China will shrink rapidly.</p>

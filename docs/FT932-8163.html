			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The mystery of a shrinking dole queue in a sluggish market: How the official unemployment count has defied contradictory evidence FOR TWO consecutive months the official count of unemployment in the UK has fallen. The trouble is, however, no one really believes the figures. Even the government greeted the news for February and March with caution, while Department of Employment statisticians confessed to being perplexed by the sudden change in the trend. Unless today's figures for April show another fall in the jobless total  - the consensus forecast is for a small rise - there will be claims that the figures for February and March were 'fiddled'. The Unemployment Unit, a research and lobbying organisation, has put forward the theory that in order to meet performance targets for job placement and reduce new claims, the Employment Service made an exceptional effort towards the end of the financial year to shift people off the official count. The Employment Service has been operating under performance targets for several years. In the last financial year, in the face of a very weak jobs market, it was asked to place 1.42m people from the register into jobs - compared with a target of 1.23m in 1991-92 - and to reject more than 500,000 applications for benefit - about 10 per cent of the total. Commenting on the performance Mr Peter Warburton, economist at the Robert Fleming merchant bank, said: 'It appears that the Department of Employment found itself well short of its targets at the end of December and was forced to make a special effort in the final quarter to catch up.' Potential entrants to the register faced a stiffer test and existing claimants were given priority in job placement over other job-seekers. The Department of Employment says it has found no evidence of a sudden switch of activity at Jobcentres. But changes to the claimant count in the past decade have made it much easier to shift people off the unemployment register. The Labour party has pointed out a big increase in the numbers on sickness and invalidity benefit since the mid 1980s. In a Commons written answer this month the government said that while unemployment fell a seasonally adjusted 51,500 in February and March, those on sickness benefit increased by 13,000, and on invalidity benefit by 26,000. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, has produced letters from people saying that, although they are not ill, they have been encouraged by the employment department to sign on for sickness benefit on the grounds that they will get benefit more quickly. Mr Dobson said: 'We have also received letters saying that Jobcentres are reserving large numbers of vacancies for those who are registered unemployed. This means that groups such as married women who may be unemployed but aren't counted in the figures are stopped from applying for jobs.' Some economists have argued that the falls in unemployment simply reflect a rise in economic activity - the efficiency of the labour market means that Instead of lagging behind the recovery, it reacts more swiftly to changes in the economy. Few are happy with this view. There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that, far from falling in February and March, unemployment was still on the increase. The evidence includes: No significant change in the stock of unfilled vacancies. Continued falls in manufacturing employment. Continued falls in average weekly hours worked, albeit marginal. Industrial-sector predictions. The Engineering Employers' Federation has forecast that a further 99,000 jobs will be lost in its sector this year while the construction industry is forecasting a further 50,000 job losses. No increase in overtime - overtime hours worked fell in February. It is highly unusual for unemployment to start falling so early in a recovery. Mr Paul Gregg of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said there could be little doubt that there was 'a bit of reclassification going on'. But he added it might also be the case that, while the total amount of employment was not actually increasing, the employment service had become more efficient at placing people. Little can be done to check the validity of the official figures until June, when the first-quarter labour-force survey - which asks people whether they have looked for a job at any time in the previous four weeks - is published. If people have been pushed off the register even though they are still unemployed, they will show up in the labour-force survey.</p>

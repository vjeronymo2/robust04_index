			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Academic allies under different flags: War and Peace (The end of 'Us and Them') - Peter Aspden finds that war studies and peace studies are not that far apart On his first day as professor of war studies at King's College, London, Lawrence Freedman barely had time to think about his forthcoming duties; it was the day Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Eight years later, misfortune began to look like carelessness when, on the opening day of the college's new centre for defence studies, Iraq invaded Kuwait. 'I suppose it was apt,' notes Freedman dryly. He talks of invasion dispassionately, as befits one who spends his time studying the intricacies and nuances of warfare in all its grizzliest manifestations, from the fall of Periclean Athens to the latest Bosnian Serb incursion. Meanwhile, Paul Rogers of the University of Bradford covers much of the same territory: how wars are started, how they might be resolved, how they can be avoided in the first place; the only difference is that he is a professor of peace studies. The two men would appear to be on opposite sides of the most ancient human dialectic of them all; both are keen to underplay their differences and stress a common approach. Their differences might have been more apparent at the beginning of the 1980s, when Rogers' department was under attack from the right for its trenchant criticism of the nuclear arms build-up. But then came the end of the cold war and the mutation of the bipolar balance of terror into a series of vicious and complicated struggles all round the globe. Suddenly, the 'Us and Them' model of international relations looked, to western eyes at least, hopelessly crude and irrelevant. And Freedman and Rogers have found themselves converging on each other's territory. Having said all that, Rogers is keen to emphasise his adherence to the values of the Quakers who helped establish his department in the early 1970s as a forum for the study and promotion of peace. Borrowing from Sir Isaiah Berlin's distinction between two definitions of liberty, a distinction is made between negative peace - the absence of war - and positive peace - the establishment of socio-economic conditions under which a peaceful society can flourish. The latter area gives the department its broad scope. Rogers gives as an example of barriers to peace the under-investment in the former Soviet Union by western powers, and in the Middle East by the oil-rich Gulf states. 'It is a failure to look in the long term which is the root cause of so many troubles.' Freedman, on the opposite side of the coin, would no doubt see the 'obstacles to positive peace' as 'potential threats to security'; it is, I suggest, the same area of study viewed from a different perspective. 'I suppose it is a case of us looking at the dark side, almost looking for situations which are about to break down. But we obviously are not looking to promote war. If you work at the Institute of Tropical Diseases, it doesn't mean you want to help spread them,' he answers. 'Put it this way - I was very pleased to have appointed an expert in Yugoslavia in 1990, firstly because he was very good and secondly because you could see what was going to happen there a mile off.' I mention that his appointments to the department could be seen as a kind of curse, which he finds a compelling idea. 'Well, at the moment, I am looking for a specialist in northern Africa.' Rogers agrees with Freedman's prognosis, applying his own perspective: 'You have all the conditions there which impede any prospect of real peace: huge unemployment and disempowerment, a very autocratic government and a host of fundamentalist groups looking for support.' One difference between the two departments is that Bradford has a strong training element - students are taught how to keep the peace. Conflict resolution is also an important research theme. James Smith, a lecturer who has spent three years in each institution, recently spent some time with United Nations troops in Croatia, discovering the daily difficulties they faced. 'Their phone lines are cut up to 50 times a day, some of them end up clearing the same mine up to a dozen times. It is very demoralising for them,' he says. I ask Freedman if he ever feels like he is training his students for war. 'We cannot teach people how to fight wars, we are not a training organisation at all. We believe in the good old liberal academic values, reason and freedom. As Hedley Bull said, good scholarship is subversive of all causes.' But are there not unbearable tensions when students from certain countries are put together? 'It can be difficult, but we don't ask people to change their allegiances or views. We hope they come to accept that it is good to converse in neutral territory.' I put it to Rogers that both he and Freedman shared a fundamentally pessimistic view of the world, one which cannot see the cycle of war and peace in human affairs ever reaching an end. He demurs: 'If we had been having this conversation 12 years ago, we would have been talking about mutually assured destruction. The end of the cold war has provided us with a window of opportunity, but it must be exploited.' Both men are scornful of the 'end of history' thesis which sees the fall of the Berlin Wall as signalling the triumph of the west. Malcolm Dando, a lecturer at Bradford, provides his own epitaph for the Dr Strangelove era: 'I don't think we won - I think we all got through by the skin of our teeth.' In the meantime, the two departments continue to talk to each other, to try and make sense of what has replaced the rabid intensity of the cold war years. The two institutions have even set up an annual football match. Bradford recently won 2-1. 'The referee was our mediation specialist,' says Rogers.</p>

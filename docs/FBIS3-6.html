			<p>SUMMARY                           Using his decree power to reorganize the media bureaucracy,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has consolidated his control over  the broadcast media and attenuated the influence of the other  branches of government and the cabinet.  At the same time he has  taken the first step in what is likely to be a far reaching, if  reversible, reduction of the state's role in television by giving  a private television company access to Russia's 4th television  channel.  The reorganization appears to signal that longtime  close Yeltsin adviser Mikhail Poltoranin, who once shaped  Yeltsin's media policy, no longer enjoys the President's  confidence in this area.                         END SUMMARY      In a series of edicts dating from 5 December, Yeltsin has  effected a complete restructuring of state media structures and  shuffled key media personnel consolidating his authority over  state television, expanding private access to television  broadcasting, and creating a potentially powerful new media  arbitration court (see box 1).   Begin Box 1   Yeltsin Decrees Changes in Media Structures      In a series of edicts issued from 5 December to 4 January,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin reorganized state television,  created a new media oversight body, and made major changes in key  media posts:   --A 5 December edict "On the Directors of VGTRK [the All-Russian  State Television and Radio Company--RTV]" reappointed Oleg  Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko as chairman and general director  respectively of RTV (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva  Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993).     --A 22 December edict "On Improving State Management in the Mass  Information Sphere" abolished the Ministry of the Press and  Information and the Federal Information Center (FIC), created the  Russian Federation Committee for the Press and the Federal  Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and  appointed Boris Mironov to head the former and Aleksandr Yakovlev  the latter (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993).     --A second 22 December edict "On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian  State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and  the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company"  consolidated state control over the the national television  broadcast infrastructure (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993).     --A third 22 December edict "On Utilizing Moscow Television's  Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network" granted  an independent television production company, NTV, access to  Russia's 4th channel (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993).     --A 29 December edict "On the Court of Appeals for Information  Disputes Under the President of the Russian Federation" which is  linked explicitly to articles 29 and 80 of the new constitution  granting citizens the right to "freedom of mass information" and  making the president the guarantor of that freedom created a new  arbitration body under the president to resolve disputes over  television coverage and access (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January).     --A 4 January edict officially relieved Mikhail Poltoranin of his  duties as head of the FIC (ITAR-TASS, 4 January).   End Box 1      President's Role Strengthened      Several aspects of the reorganization strengthen the president's  powers over the broadcast media.  The new television and radio  service under Yakovlev will be subordinate to the president,  while the edict appointing Poptsov to head RTV extends Yeltsin's  appointment powers to an area once held by the Supreme Soviet  Presidium.  The creation of 'Efir' consolidates state control  over the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential  appointee, and the new information appeals court gives the  president a potentially great advantage over the other branches  of government in determining the political slant and content of  television programming.      Profile Lowered      By giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub-  cabinet rank and moving out Mikhail Poltoranin and Vladimir  Shumeyko, two favorite targets of his opponents, Yeltsin appears  to be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the  front lines of the political struggle.  Poltoranin, as chief of  the now defunct Federal Information Center (FIC), and Shumeyko,  as head of the now abolished Ministry of the Press and  Information both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads  of the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status.      New Bodies' Powers      The reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the  preeminent role in regulating broadcast media, eliminating  overlapping responsibilities that existed under the former  structures.  From the FIC the broadcast service inherits the  functions of "coordinating" state policy for television and  radio, assisting in the provision of "objective" information to  domestic and international audiences on Russian political and  economic issues, and participating in the process of drafting  legislation on the broadcast media.  From the Press and  Information Ministry the service inherits responsibilities for  implementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and  for television and radio licensing and registration.  The service  also has authority to administer government financing and  subsidies for national and regional television (Rossiyskiye  Vesti, 24 December 1993) but its authority has been severely  circumscribed by the Ministry of Finance (see box 2).  The 22  December edict names the Committee on the Press the legal  successor to both the Ministry of Press and Information and the  FIC but does not elaborate its functions in detail.  It  presumably will assume the FIC and press ministry functions that  relate specifically to the press.  The edict does explicitly  establish that the committee will administer government financing  and subsidies, formerly a prerogative of the press ministry.   Begin Box 2      Finance Ministry Cuts Television Budget      On 1 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that acting Finance  Minister Sergey Dubinin had recently "notified representatives of  Ostankino and Russian Television . . . of a 50 percent cut in  financing."   The decision, if not amended, could have a  devastating impact on both the television companies and the  Ministry of Communications which broadcasts the television  signals and depends heavily on state television for its own  revenues.  Russian Television General Director Anatoliy Lysenko  predicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns  and lead to the "loss of the broadcasting network on a large  territory of Russia" (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 January).  It is  not clear if the ministry's decision to slash funding is a first  step in a policy of reducing state ownership, as Yakovlev and  others have advocated, or if state television simply served as a  convenient target of opportunity in the finance ministry's  struggle to control the money supply.   End Box 2      Poltoranin Routed      Aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that Poltoranin,  once the most influential figure in the Yeltsin administration in  shaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands  of his rival for influence Shumeyko.  According to Yuriy Baturin,  Yeltsin's security adviser and a co-drafter of the existing law  on the mass media, Yeltsin, Shumeyko, and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the 22 December edict  "On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere"  (Izvestiya, 29 December 1993).  That edict provided for separate  commissions to liquidate the Press Ministry and the FIC but  appointed Shumeyko to head both.  Poltoranin also appears to have  lost a battle over the edict granting NTV access to channel 4, a  move which he reportedly opposed.  Despite his removal as FIC  head, Poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy-  -possibly even in opposition to Yeltsin--as head of the Committee  on Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma (ITAR-  TASS; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 19 January).  But, for the first time  since before Yeltsin was elected president, (See Note 1)  Poltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the  administration's media policy or to advise the president in an  official capacity.  (Note 1) With the exception of a brief hiatus from 25 November  1992 when he stepped down as Minister of the Press and  Information to 25 December 1992 when he was appointed head of the  newly created Federal Information Center.  Poltoranin was  appointed Minister of the Press and Information 10 July 1990 by  the RSFSR Supreme Soviet.      Yakovlev's Vision for Television      Yeltsin's appointment of "the father of glasnost" and former  close Gorbachev adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to head the new  broadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions  regarding the broadcast media.  Yakovlev once served as the head  of the CPSU Central Committee's propaganda department and yet has  been credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to  liberalize the Soviet media.  Although he has a reputation as a  reformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of Russia  or unrestricted freedom for the media.  In an Izvestiya interview  (24 December) following his appointment, Yakovlev stated that he  would refrain from "influencing" subject matter but rather play a  "strategic" role as Ostankino chairman.  At the same time,  however, he expressed hope that the company will be able to  fulfill its role in society "without succumbing to extremes" and  on another occasion he spoke of increasing "the share of Russian  programs" as a "counterweight" to foreign productions, and  criticized excessive sex and violence--generally attributed to  foreign influence--on television (RRIA, 2 February).  He has also  apparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on  Ostankino in which Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey  Filatov will "explain" presidential edicts (Mayak Radio, 31  January).     Yakovlev's appointment may signal future reductions in the  state's role in television.  He has asserted that there "must be  one state television company" which would operate without paid  advertising instead of the four companies (See Note 2) that exist  now (RIA, 2 February).  This goal appears to go hand-in-hand with  the recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding (see  box 2) and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the state's  difficulty financing state television at current levels.  Realization of Yakovlev's goal of having one non-commercial state  television company could also provide a financial shot in the arm  to non-state television since it would become the only vehicle  for television advertising.  (Note 2) The four are Ostankino, RTV, Channel 4, and the St.  Petersburg Channel.      Yakovlev's Deputy      Valentin Lazutkin, a longtime television professional who appears  to share Yakovlev's views on reducing the state's role in  television has been appointed as Yakovlev's deputy.  With  Yakovlev taking a "strategic" approach to his chairmanship,  Lazutkin, who has spent nearly 30 years in television, and served  as first deputy chairman at Ostankino until his recent promotion  will presumably run day-to-day operations at Ostankino.  Asked in  a recent interview published in Izvestiya, (21 January) about his  opinion on the recent change in leadership, he expressed the  "hope" that "we need not fear that Ostankino's airspace will be  turned into the political property of a particular party, which  happened under the former chairman."  He also noted that he was  "untroubled" by the recent decision to grant the private  production company NTV access to the fourth channel (discussed  below), though he did criticize the fact that access to the  channel was not granted on a "competitive" basis.  And finally,  discussing his concept of the future of state-run television,  Lazutkin said there "should be one powerful Russian company which  is . . . part of the state structure" and he advocated  transforming Ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences  (including Russian-speaking viewers in the CIS).      NTV Gains Broadcast Access      In what may be the first step towards realizing Yakovlev's vision  of decreasing the number of state television companies, Yeltsin  granted television broadcasting rights on channel 4 to an  independent company, NTV.  The 22 December edict "On Using Moscow  Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination  Network" states that NTV will receive 58 hours of weekly  broadcast time as an "experiment" aimed at "developing non-state  television."  NTV has been broadcasting a nightly news program,  Segodnya, and a weekly newsmagazine, RItogi, to viewers of the St.  Petersburg channel, which has a potential audience of about 70  million viewers, and will continue to do so.  The significance of  the edict for NTV does not appear to be that it increases  potential audience size since the two channels have significant  audience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence  from St. Petersburg Television.     Most importantly the NTV edict affirms Yeltsin's support for the  idea of independent television following an apparent tug-of-war  within the administration.  Yeltsin first issued the edict on 22  November but suspended it the next day (ITAR-TASS, 22 November  1993; 23 November 1993).  On 22 December Yeltsin reissued the  edict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked  the government with reviewing the issue of "state participation"  in the ranks of the founders, making this text even more  privatization-oriented than the original.      Control of TV Infrastructure      In the reorganization, Yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will  retain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure, at least for  the present.  The edict of 22 December "On Setting Up the 'Efir'  Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding  Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting  Company" created the Efir holding company, whose assets include  much of the state's broadcasting infrastructure.  Efir will be  partially privatized, with employees receiving some shares, but  the edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a  controlling interest for three years.  The edict does not  specify, however, what the state will do with its controlling  interest after three years.  The edict appointed Lazutkin to  serve as chairman of Efir's board of directors.  Baturin  criticized the creation of Efir (and the reorganization in  general) which he claims "increases the state's control over the  mass media" and even "to a certain extent threatens freedom of  the press" (RIzvestiya, 29 December 1993).  Noting that "all  central television channels are broadcast" through Efir, Baturin  asserted that independent television companies will "remain non-  state only in formal terms."      Control over RTV      The reorganization also serves notice that the other major  national television company, RTV, will remain under Yeltsin's and  Yakovlev's control.  Control of the company had been a prolonged  point of contention between the President and the former Supreme  Soviet.  In a demonstration of his authority over RTV, Yeltsin  re-appointed the current chairman and general director, Oleg  Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko, by the edict of 5 December.  Formerly, according to Russian Television's Statute, the right of  appointment to these posts was held by the Supreme Soviet  Presidium (Sobrianiye Aktov Pravitelsta RSFSR, No 6, 1991).      Poltoranin Admirer To Head Press Body      The 22 December edict reorganizing the media structures appointed  Boris Mironov, former head of the Rossiya Publishing House and  apparent close friend and admirer of Poltoranin as chairman of  the new Committee on the Press.  According to a profile of  Mironov from Obshchaya Gazeta, Mironov had previously worked for  Komsomolskaya Pravda and with Poltoranin when the latter served  at Pravda.  Mironov reportedly also served for "several days" as  chief editor of Rossiyskaya Gazeta but was removed prior to or  shortly after publication of the paper's inaugural issue in  November 1990 (Obshchaya Gazeta, 14-20 January; Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 6 November 1993).  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta's  current chief editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, Mironov was removed  "on the personal orders" of then Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman  Ruslan Khasbulatov.      New Media Watchdog Created      Yeltsin's establishment of the Court of Appeals for Information  Disputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt  the new parliament from "interfering" in media policy as did its  predecessor (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January).  The court is a  successor to the Information Arbitration Court that was created  during the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair  media coverage with largely the same membership, including  chairman Anatoliy Vengerov.  During the campaign, Vengerov and  the court demonstrated a degree of independence from Yeltsin by  ruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was  permissible, explicitly opposing Yeltsin's stated position that  sought to prohibit such campaigning (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993;  Izvestiya, 27 November 1993).  The court's powers include the  authority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime  among parliamentary factions.  It is also charged with ensuring  "objectivity and authenticity" in news reporting and the  "principle of pluralism" in radio and television programming, and  may issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media  law, a power it inherited from the defunct Ministry of the Press  and Information.  Despite the court's record of independent  action, the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating  that it "is not part of the system" of Russian Federation federal  courts, and the new body's statute gives the president the power  to appoint and fire its members (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February).      Prospects      Yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of Russian media structures  that seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing  direct control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while  maintaining presidential control over the main facilities of  state television and the process of media oversight.  The new  parliament may challenge Yeltsin for control of at least some  media--there is already talk among deputies of reasserting  control over Rossiyskaya Gazeta which the dissolved Supreme  Soviet controlled (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 5 January).  Yeltsin is  likely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his  enhanced constitutional authority to do so.  He may also  calculate that more western-style media independence is the best  way of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays  out of his opponents' grasp.  At the same time economic reality  as manifest by the recent one-day widespread broadcast blackout  and the Finance Ministry's decision to cut television funding by  50 percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting  more and more air time to independent television companies as he  has done with NTV and channel 4.

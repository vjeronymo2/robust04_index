			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKID ROW SUMMIT CALLED LIKELY TO RESULT IN EASED POLICE POLICY  </P> <P> As police and the mayor's staff prepare for a summit today on controversial new  methods to clean up Skid Row, sources close to the issue say the city will  attempt to ease the LAPD's hard-line policy slightly, while still backing the  thrust of the new strategy of confining transients to specific street corners.  </P> <P> City officials including Mayor Tom Bradley have consistently said the police  actions are in keeping with city policies, but privately some of these  officials say that some police activities may be too restrictive.  </P> <P> Since mid-January, police have been rousting the homeless from doorways,  breaking up sidewalk gatherings and reportedly marching the street people to  missions that are already filled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matter of Personalities  </P> <P> Some sources say the meeting may well focus on the personalities of the  controversy as much as the policies themselves.  </P> <P> At the center of the debate is LAPD Central Division Capt. Jerry Conner, who  spearheaded the recent police effort, and Skid Row activist Alice Callaghan,  who has led the opposition.  </P> <P> Conner, known among admirers and critics alike as "Cowboy," is recognized as a  tough, strong-willed cop unafraid to make controversial decisions. Callaghan, a  veteran street organizer, is dedicated to defending Skid Row as the community  of last resort for the poor and routinely takes her case against the police to  senior city officials.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of human dynamics here," said one city official, adding that  "much of this is a personal matter (and) I hope they get to it."  </P> <P> The meeting is closed to the public and special-interest groups, but is still  being closely followed by homeless activists and area merchants who have been  actively lobbying participants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protests Planned  </P> <P> Some activists have told city officials that they intend to begin a series of  sit-ins and other civil disobedience to protest the police crackdown.  </P> <P> At least one City Council member has also joined the dispute. Robin Kramer, an  aide to Councilman Richard Alatorre, said the councilman's office has asked to  be informed of the meeting's outcome.  </P> <P> Kramer said the "behind-closed-doors meeting . . . is probably a good place to  start" for a solution to Skid Row's problems. "We will follow things up if  legislative action seems appropriate," she said.  </P> <P> Area businessmen, who prodded the police into action earlier this year, said  they are pleased with the results of the crackdown, but are not convinced that  the methods are entirely proper.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Are Concerned  </P> <P> Charles Woo, president of the Central City East Assn., said the policy of  concentrating the homeless at the shelters may need some fine-tuning. "It  sounds logical . . . but I'm not sure it will (continue to) work smoothly."  </P> <P> Central City East officials and homeless service providers alike said that the  city meeting should have included members of the community.  </P></p>

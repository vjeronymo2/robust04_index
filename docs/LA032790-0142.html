			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO REALLY WON?;  </P> <P> OSCARS: ACADEMY VOTERS SPLIT THEIR BALLOTS, BUT THEY FAIL TO DO JUSTICE. THEY  OVERLOOKED THE DIRECTORS OF 'DAISY' AND 'GLORY' -- AND THOSE FILMS WON A  COMBINED SEVEN OSCARS.  </P> <P> When they decided to move the Oscar show back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,  we knew tickets would be tight; we didn't think they'd forget to invite the  year's best directors.  </P> <P> Where were Bruce Beresford and Ed Zwick? Where was Spike Lee? Beresford and  Zwick, who were not nominated for best director, had their names mentioned in  more "thank you" speeches than God, Michael Ovitz and best-director winner  Oliver Stone combined, and their movies -- "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Glory" --  carted off a total of seven awards. And Lee cast a shadow over the stage  without even being asked to come on down.  </P> <P> So much for the auteur theory.  </P> <P> In the end, "Driving Miss Daisy" was the evening's biggest winner, with four  Oscars, including the one for best picture. But it will be a year with  asterisks all over it in the record book.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone won as best director for a movie, "Born on the Fourth of July,"  that collected only one other award, for editing. "Driving Miss Daisy" won as  best picture, making it the first film since the 1932 "Grand Hotel" to win best  picture without even earning a nomination for its director. It was a night when  an animated film swept the music awards, winning for its score and its calypso  centerpiece, "Under the Sea." It was also a year when an industry audience rose  to give a relatively unknown foreign actor -- Daniel Day-Lewis -- a standing  ovation, proving to some cynics that -- on this occasion at least -- they know  a little something about acting.  </P> <P> The 62nd Oscar show was what it was billed to be, a wide-open race. Stone's  "Born on the Fourth of July" was the only film given a chance at a sweep, and  it got swept instead. It went two for eight.  </P> <P> Still, the outcome was in doubt right to the end. "Driving Miss Daisy" had a  3-1 edge on "Born" in their four previous head-to-head categories, but because  best pictures and best directors are usually paired in the voting, no one would  have been surprised to hear "Born" pulled out of the last envelope.  </P> <P> The uncertainty of this year's results may have made for livelier office pools  and Oscar parties, and after years of boring one-picture sweeps, it's  encouraging to know the voters can split their ballots. But what did the split  mean? With a clear choice between a film that was full of warm intentions and  gentle performances -- "Driving Miss Daisy" -- and one that had the anger of a  decade crammed into little more than two hours -- "Born on the Fourth of July"  -- the voters teetered back and forth then settled on the gentle number.  </P> <P> The academy blew its opportunity for a compromise when it failed to nominate  for either best picture or best director Ed Zwick's fine Civil War epic  "Glory," probably the most Oscar-like film released during the whole year. What  held it back? The performance of Matthew Broderick? Zwick's TV background,  which had some people calling "Glory" "eighteensixtysomething"?  </P> <P> We'll never know, but when it came time to cast their final ballots, the  general membership was definitely in a "Glory" mood. It won in three of the  categories for which it was nominated.  </P> <P> Beresford's absence from the formal program was certainly noted. Billy Crystal,  calling "Driving Miss Daisy" the "movie which apparently directed itself," made  the first reference during his opening monologue, then the parade of "Driving  Miss Daisy" winners further drove home the point. Four times, the academy's  live orchestra broke into that catchy "Miss Daisy" theme while winners worked  their way to the podium to thank -- among others, but never forgetting -- their  Australian director Beresford.  </P> <P> G'day mate.  </P> <P> If "Driving Miss Daisy" was the best film of the year -- if it was just one of  the five best -- Beresford should have had a formal invitation.  </P> <P> The academy didn't make a statement this year, it surrendered to the times.  During the Reaganized '80s, while only one irreverent political film (Stone's  "Platoon") was making it to the winner's circle, Hollywood and the academy were  tamed by supply-side economics and the irreversible thawing of the Cold War.  The victory by "Driving Miss Daisy" -- at both the box office and in the Oscar  contest -- suggests that gentle we go into the '90s, as well.  </P> <P> If the country was in an introspective mood, Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing"  would have at least been in contention.  </P> <P> Lee was there, as a nominee for best original screenplay, but it proved just  one more disappointment for supporters of the year's most critically-acclaimed  film. Several people mentioned the film's Oscar snub during arrival interviews  on local TV, and Kim Basinger -- in what qualifies as a tense moment in the era  of the 45-second clock -- chided the academy for overlooking the film that told  "the greatest truth of all."  </P> <P> If Lee was the victim of a backlash, so might Stone have been. Late-in-the-race  assaults by right-wing political pundit Patrick Buchanan -- along with nay  saying critics who repeated Buchanan's charges that Stone and co-screenwriter  Ron Kovic had revamped history to suit their own political agenda -- didn't  help. Similar criticisms leveled against Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" are  thought by many to have buried that movie with the academy's documentary  nominations committee.  </P> <P> Stone said Monday afternoon that the press had blithely accepted Buchanan's  charges without giving him or Kovic a chance to respond. "I have not been  contacted by anyone about playing 'fast and loose' with the facts," Stone said.  "I always said these were composite characters . . . This has been an attack on  (Kovic) that was inspired by the right wing."  </P> <P> The feature documentary Oscar to the makers of "Common Threads: Stories from  the Quilt" may ease some of the pressure on the academy's documentary  nominations committee. The group was excoriated by critics this year for  omitting "Roger &amp; Me" from the final ballot. Last year, the group was  excoriated for overlooking Erroll Morris' "The Thin Blue Line." In both  instances, committee members defended themselves by saying there were five  better candidates than either "The Thin Blue Line" or "Michael &amp; Me."  </P> <P> That argument doesn't stand up to the scrutiny of the nominees. There was not a  better documentary in 1988 than "The Thin Blue Line," and "Roger &amp; Me" --  whatever its maker's lapses -- is certainly better than most of this year's  choices. But it isn't better than the actual winner. "Common Threads," made by  the producers of the Oscar-winning "The Times of Harvey Milk," took five names  from the AIDS quilt and examined the impact of the lives and deaths of those  people on loved ones left behind. It was exceptionally well-made and almost  overwhelming in its indictments of the plague's myths and the federal  government's lethargic response to it.  </P> <P> Still, if the academy is serious about maintaining an image of integrity in its  nominations process, it must overhaul its documentary committee format and put  the fate of documentary filmmakers in the hands of their peers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> RECIPES WITH A HISTORY OF PLEASING;  </P> <P> 'CENTENNIAL COOKBOOK' SERVES UP OLD-TIME DISHES  </P> <P> Traditional American food is experiencing a renaissance, which makes the Orange  County Pioneer Council's "Centennial Cookbook, 1889-1989" a work of special  interest.  </P> <P> Recipes that might have been disregarded when nouvelle, "trendy" food dominated  the scene receive the attention they deserve in its pages. They are old-time  dishes from area pioneers, compiled along with segments of oral history by the  Orange County Pioneer Council. The book was printed at the Friis-Pioneer Press  in Santa Ana and celebrates the county's centennial year.  </P> <P> Scattered throughout are recipes with titles that indicate strong family ties,  among them mom's applesauce cake, my Grandmother Steffen's persimmon pudding,  Grandmother Yost's sour cream-raisin pie, Grandma Ross' Lemon Cream Pie, mama's  Boston brown bread and Great-Grandfather Lunt's spoon bread.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oldies but Goodies  </P> <P> A chile sauce originated with a woman born in Santa Ana in 1893. A bride who  arrived in California in 1885 handed down a recipe for rock cookies, and a  family of El Toro pioneers passed a recipe for pickled green beans from one  generation to the next. A recipe for strawberry mousse was found in "Aunt Lois'  old recipe book," and a golden loaf cake appeared in a cookbook dated Santa  Ana, 1885.  </P> <P> The contributor's name and the pioneer family represented accompany each  recipe, along with remembrances of times almost forgotten.  </P> <P> "There was no refrigeration in those days. Only ice boxes and no ice man.  People would go to town to get ice," reads an entry attributed to Irvin Clarke  Chapman.  </P> <P> Insight into the way people once ate is provided by such statements as these:  </P> <P> "Mrs. Dowling had a garden and the family had lots of fruits and vegetables in  their diet. Breakfast, however, was always steak, gravy and bread or waffles or  pancakes." -- Marquita Salveson Dowling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Living on Vegetables  </P> <P> "We used to practically live on vegetables and then have meat maybe two or  three times a week. I remember mama would send us to the store for ground steak  for dinner. She would give us a quarter to buy it." -- Jo Sawdey Taylor.  </P> <P> "The only two kinds of ready-made cereal were shredded wheat and corn flakes.  All those other things that fill the shelves down there in the store nowadays  were never thought of, which was a darn good thing. Mostly, we cooked cereals.  Mom would make corn meal the night before and let it solidify. The next morning  she would slice it and fry it for breakfast." -- Claire Sharpless Marks.  </P> <P> Other passages recount the roles played by family members in Orange County  history. Photographs of early homes were also gathered for the book.  </P> <P> The recipes remain in their original state, which means such essentials as pan  sizes and baking times and temperatures are sometimes omitted. But most of the  recipes are quite workable. And the four chosen to accompany this story not  only worked but disappeared rapidly when they were set out for tasting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Procedure  </P> <P> Grandma Ross' Lemon Cream Pie, provided by Elsa Wilson Edwards, includes an  unusual procedure for making a meringue that, according to the recipe, "will  not weep."  </P> <P> Esther Ridgway Cramer of La Habra contributed an old family recipe for holiday  cookies, Leutwiler Leckerlis. According to Cramer, Jacob Leutwiler was an early  Swiss settler who came to La Habra before 1900. Cramer's mother, Ida, moved to  La Habra in 1912 with the John Leutwiler family. "John helped found the first  bank in La Habra and became La Habra's first photographer," Cramer said.  </P> <P> The Leutwiler Leckerlis are rock hard when first baked and require a month of  storage to mellow. The softening procedure can be hastened by adding an apple  wedge to the airtight storage container.  </P> <P> Mother's Date and Nut Cookies were contributed by Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Brewster  Parker of San Diego. The cookies are firm when first baked but then soften and  become chewy, revealing the rich taste of the dates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cookhouse Recipe  </P> <P> Crazy Cake no doubt got its name because it includes neither eggs nor butter  nor milk, yet is moist and full of good chocolate flavor. According to  Charlotte Moulton Mathis of Hollister, the recipe "came from a cook in the old  Moulton Ranch cookhouse." Mathis' father, Lewis Fenno Moulton, purchased Rancho  Niguel, an old Spanish land grant that came to be known as the Moulton Ranch,  in the 1890s.  </P> <P> The centennial cookbook can be ordered by mail. The price is $12.50, which  includes $2.50 to cover postage and handling. Make checks out to the Orange  County Pioneer Council and send them to OCPC, c/o Shirley Parker, 400 Vista  Parada, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660.  </P> <P> Here are the pioneer recipes, slightly edited to amplify the instructions.  </P> <P> GRANDMA ROSS' LEMON CREAM PIE  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 5 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 cups milk  </P> <P> 3 egg yolks  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  </P> <P> 1/3 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 (9-inch) baked pie shell  </P> <P> Meringue  </P> <P> Mix sugar, cornstarch, salt and milk in saucepan.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: DnB plans to set up life insurance group Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, yesterday announced plans for a life insurance company to become operational in 1995. Norwegian commercial banks were given the green light by the Storting (parliament) in the spring of 1992 to establish insurance companies providing they are granted a concession from the finance ministry. DnB said it hoped to submit an application for such a concession within the next week. The bank also disclosed that it would cancel a co-operation agreement made in 1993 with Vital, the Norwegian life insurance group, in which DnB sells life insurance products through its bank distribution network. DnB said it intended to sell life insurance products to companies and private individuals and the new company would be one of Norway's most cost-effective - enabling it to offer competitive products. The bank declined to reveal the size of the life insurance company.</p>

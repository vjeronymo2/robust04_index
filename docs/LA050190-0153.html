			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOTIVE;  </P> <P> IRVINE'S NEW MAZDA RETAILER WILL BE COUNTY'S 2ND FOREIGN-OWNED DEALER  </P> <P> Tustin Acura, which opened its doors in March, 1986, has been in the unique  position of being the only foreign-owned new car dealership in the county. Its  parent is the Dah Chong Hong Trading Corp. of Hong Kong, which owns a stable of  about 30 auto dealerships in the United States, mainly on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Now, in what appears to be a sign of the times, a $2.2-million Mazda dealership  being built at the Irvine Auto Center and scheduled to open in July will become  the second auto retailer in the county that is wholly owned by a foreign  corporation.  </P> <P> Its parent, Indomobil America, is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia.  </P> <P> An Indomobil spokesman declined to comment on the firm's plans for investing  here, saying the timing wasn't right.  </P> <P> But other dealers and several auto marketing specialists said that with car  sales down and most dealers struggling to maintain what they have, there is  little domestic money available for starting a business or expanding existing  dealer networks. This is especially true in an area like Orange County, where  land costs are so high.  </P> <P> And that opens the area to overseas investors, who see less domestic  competition for franchises.  </P> <P> Campbell Automotive Group in Irvine, which now owns seven dealerships and two  auto body repair shops in Orange and Riverside counties, saw the handwriting on  the wall in 1988, when it sold a 50% interest to a British firm, Lex Service  PLC, to raise money for expansion. Since then, the company has acquired two new  dealerships and is about to open a third -- the county's first Saturn  dealership -- thanks in large part to the cash infusion from Lex.  </P></p>

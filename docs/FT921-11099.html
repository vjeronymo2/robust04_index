			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 6m retail schemes for Higgs and Hill HIGGS AND HILL WESTERN has been awarded design and build contracts worth a total of more than Pounds 6m for Tesco and Gateway Stores in Bristol and Kingsbridge. The contract for the Tesco superstore was placed by Carter Commercial Developments on behalf of Tesco. The superstore will have a sales area of around 32,000 sq ft together with a petrol station and car parking. It forms the first stage in the development of shopping and leisure facilities in the Bradley Stoke district. The building, which will also have an upper floor of over 5,000 sq ft to accommodate offices and other facilities, is of steel-framed construction with brick cladding and feature arches. Major items of plant will be positioned on the roof but concealed by pitched roofs around the perimeter of the building. The project is to be completed within a 44-week programme to allow Tesco to open for trading in autumn 1992. The company has also been awarded a design and build contract by Gateway Foodmarkets for a 2,500 sq ft store in Kingsbridge, Devon. The store, which has been designed to a low profile because of planning requirements in the residential area, will be steel-framed with a facing brick exterior and a pitched roof clad with metal sheeting. External works will include landscaping, car parking and a secure service yard. The architect for the project is Tektus Architects and the consulting engineer for the retail outlet's structure is the firm of YRM Anthony Hunt Associates.</p>

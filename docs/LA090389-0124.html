			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST HOLLYWOOD RENT FEE INCREASE IS BLOCKED;  </P> <P> LANDLORDS WIN RESTRAINING ORDER ON CITY'S DOUBLING OF REGISTRATION CHARGE  </P> <P> In an unexpected legal action, West Hollywood's largest landlord group this  week obtained a temporary restraining order blocking the city from collecting  $900,000 from landlords by doubling a fee used to fund its Rent Stabilization  Commission.  </P> <P> West Hollywood Concerned Citizens, which represents about 1,000 landlords  citywide, argued in Santa Monica Superior Court on Wednesday that the city  violated its own Municipal Code when it approved a rental registration fee  increase July 17, and that the increase infringes upon landlords' rights to a  fair economic return on their investments, a basic principle of state rent  control law.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Weisberg issued the order and set  a court hearing date for Sept. 13. West Hollywood, complying with the court  order, ceased accepting landlords' payments of the fee increase Thursday, but  is not required to return payments made before that time.  </P> <P> Grafton Tanquary, leader of the landlord group, accused the city of ignoring  landlords' concerns over this issue and called the fee increase "illegal and  grossly unfair."  </P> <P> "When you talk to people and you say, 'Listen, we're opposed to this, we don't  think it's fair, or honest, or legal,' and they ignore you, what are we going  to do?" Tanquary said. "Our only recourse is to the courts."  </P> <P> City officials dismissed the landlords' suit.  </P> <P> "I think that all the arguments totally lack merit," said Assistant City Atty.  Carol M. Lynch.  </P> <P> The landlords' attorney, Craig Mordoh of Santa Monica, "totally misunderstood  the ordinances that were adopted," Lynch said, adding that she was surprised  and disappointed that the issue had gone to court.  </P> <P> The dispute stems from West Hollywood's decision in July to double an annual  rent registration fee from $48 to $96 per unit. Since the city's rent control  law was passed in 1985, the $48 fee has been assessed each September to  landlords, who then could pass the expense to renters at $4 per month.  </P> <P> Under the new system, the city will still bill landlords for the entire fee but  prohibits the additional $48 from being passed to tenants in the city's 18,000  rental units.  </P> <P> City officials authorized the fee hike to fund the Rent Stabilization  Department, which last year relied on the city's general fund for 51% of its  budget.  </P></p>

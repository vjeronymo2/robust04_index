			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: German states announce compromise on Maastricht LEADERS of Germany's 16 federal states yesterday claimed to have broken the deadlock in their negotiations with the government over ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. A compromise agreed with constitutional experts from the main political parties would provide the states with a significant increase in their power to control any future transfer of sovereignty to Brussels. However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night refused to give the deal his final blessing, pending close analysis by the government's own legal advisers. He is also conscious of deep anxiety amongst his own foreign policy advisers, and in the German Foreign Ministry, that the agreement could severely limit the government's room for manoeuvre in future EC negotiations. Key to the agreement is a new clause in the German constitution, to replace the existing clause on German reunification, made redundant by the events of the past two years. The text worked out by the constitutional experts, and due to be presented to the full constitutional committee of the two houses of parliament today, includes a formal commitment to the goal of European union. That is defined as based on democracy, the rule of law, and the social and federal principles underlying the German constitution - as well as the principle of subsidiarity. The Bundesrat - the upper house of the German parliament in which the 16 states are directly represented - will in future have an effective veto on any further transfer of sovereignty which is not seen in Germany as matching those preconditions. That would almost certainly mean an insistence that any future EC reforms must include very substantial strengthening in the powers of the European parliament, in order to ensure democratic control. The key point still at issue between the German government and the states is the question of involvement in on-going EC decision-making. They agree that the states can in future nominate an alternative representative in EC negotiations for matters which are their exclusive responsibility. A new form of words requires the government 'to take substantial account of the opinion of the Bundesrat' if EC negotiations affect the interests of the states. That suggests that not only exclusive interests of the states would be involved, but also for example EC budget negotiations, which affect them indirectly. The interests of the central government are supposed to be protected by the proviso that its responsibility as sole representative of the entire country must still be preserved. Mr Hans Eichel, the prime minister of Hesse, said last night that the compromise represented the furthest the states were prepared to move in restricting their involvement in EC negotiations. Mr Max Streibl, the conservative prime minister of Bavaria, went further in warning that if the government did not agree, the issue was one on which he was prepared to vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty. However, Mr Friedrich Bohl, the minister of state in Mr Kohl's office, said that the government could not agree until the entire text had been exhaustively investigated by constitutional advisers.</p>

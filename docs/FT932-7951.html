			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: W Africans hurt by EC beef policy EC SUBSIDIES for beef exports to West Africa are destroying the livelihood of 4m pastoralists who rely wholly on cattle-rearing in the semi-arid Sahel region south of the Sahara, according to the British charity Christian Aid. With other European aid agencies, Christian Aid has launched a campaign for the abolition of these subsidies. Since 1984, EC beef exports to West Africa have increased seven-fold, subsidised to the tune of Pounds 280m by European tax-payers. Local beef prices have collapsed. The low-quality, subsidised EC beef sells at half the price of locally produced meat. Sahelian farmers are finding that no-one is prepared to buy their herds. EC beef dumping is not only threatening the survival of Sahelian communities, it also undermines aid from the EC itself to support livestock production in the Sahel. Hundreds of millions of Ecus from the European Development Fund have been spent on building refrigerated abattoirs in Burkina Faso, on improving cattle breeds in Mali, Gambia and Senegal, and on promoting disease control in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. An EC council of ministers meeting is expected to discuss the issue at the end of the month. Christian Aid argues that to stop the export of subsidised beef to West Africa would not seriously damage farmers in Europe. Less than 0.5 per cent of total EC beef production of 8.7m tonnes in 1991 was exported to the region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime  minister, has said that he does not believe it is politically  right for him to meet in Brussels the former deputies of the  Democracy Party [DEP] that has been banned by the  Constitutional Court. He added: I prefer to meet them in Turkey  regarding an issue that concerns Turkey. Yasar Kefeli from the  Turkish Radio and Television team in Brussels reports the  following:    [Begin Kefeli recording] Karayalcin replied to reporters'  questions aboard the plane on his way to Brussels. In reply to  a question on what his stand would be in the event the former  DEP deputies who are in Brussels requested to meet with him,  Karayalcin said: I do not feel the need to discuss the DEP  issue with others. I, on principle, am ready to meet with  everyone who expresses a wish to meet with me. I, however, do  not believe that this is right from the political viewpoint. I  am the Turkish deputy prime minister. I am ready to meet with  anyone to discuss any issue in Turkey.    In reply to another question on whether this statement could  be interpreted as a refusal to meet the former DEP deputies in  Brussels, Karayalcin said: Such a meeting is not in my program,  nor is it in my thoughts. I would prefer to meet in Turkey with  DEP or other deputies to discuss issues concerning Turkey.    Karayalcin stated that discussions by the Council of Europe  Parliamentary Assembly concerning Turkey might also be discussed  during his contacts in Brussels.    In reply to a question on the European Union [EU] membership  of the Greek Cypriot sector and Malta and Turkey's stand on the  issue, Karayalcin said that Turkey has established its relations  with the EU much earlier and that it has priority regarding its  membership application. He added: In my capacity as the deputy  prime minister of my country I do not think it is appropriate to  discuss Turkey's application together with the other issues.  Turkey's application should be discussed as a separate issue  carrying its own weight. Karayalcin noted that the EU wish for a  peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem on the one hand and its  view of the Greek Cypriot administration as a separate state on  the other might raise the timetable issue put forward by certain  sectors in Cyprus and added: This is totally wrong from the  viewpoint of Turkey's security and peace in eastern  Mediterranean. I think that this is a great obstacle for the EU.    Karayalcin will meet with Philippe Busquin, president of the  Francophone Socialist Party, in Brussels this afternoon. He  will later meet with Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback.  Karayalcin will meet with EU Commission President Jacques  Delors, Commission Deputy President Sir Leon Britten, and  Belgian Vice Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet tomorrow. [end  recording]</p>

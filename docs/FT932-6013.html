			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / EC finds evidence on market access elusive JAPANESE authorities have put off providing the European Commission with information on the government's recent procurement record despite persistent requests, a Commission official said yesterday. The Commission has given Japan a list of 20 product sectors where it would like to see greater Japanese government procurement from EC companies in the light of its Y10,700bn (Pounds 64bn) economic stimulus package announced last summer. The sectors include motor vehicles, telecommunications, computers, transport equipment and aerospace equipment. 'We don't want to just hear that there has been a new stimulus package, like a fireworks festival, without knowing what the result is,' a Commission official said. 'We are asking the Japanese authorities to reveal (that) information,' the official said. 'Otherwise it becomes void of meaning.' In January Japan reluctantly agreed to an EC proposal to monitor EC-Japan trade to analyse the factors affecting the comparative performance of EC products on the Japanese market. The aim was to conduct a joint analysis of EC companies' performance in Japanese markets to determine what problems they faced and what could be done to deal with those problems. The EC proposal came amid mounting concern about Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC which increased 14 per cent in 1992 to a record Dollars 31.2bn and was at first hailed as a more rigorous EC approach to trade with Japan. Although the Commission has taken pains to stress that the analysis was to be a co-operative effort, the business of an EC-Japan working group was hampered from the start by disputes over the proper statistics to use to monitor trade between the two sides. At high-level consultations which followed in April, Mr Horst Krenzler, director-general for external economic relations at the EC Commission, made clear the EC expects substantial progress in the analysis, including the effects ot the economic stimulation package on imports, by the time of the EC-Japan summit in July. An official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for European matters, denied that the failure to provide information was deliberate. 'We are aware that the EC is interested in such information but we have not been asked officially to provide information on specific government purchases,' he said.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Quake turns Californian dream into a nightmare The 'California dream' has turned into a nightmare for many residents of earthquake-stricken Los Angeles. Monday's pre-dawn quake and the hundreds of aftershocks that continue to rock the region have destroyed more than homes and structures. For some, they have wiped out hope. About 20,000 people in and around the city are estimated to have slept out of doors on Tuesday night. Scores of dazed, frightened residents of Northridge, at the epicentre of the quake, were yesterday fleeing the area after spending two nights without electricity and water. Their destinations did not seem to matter. 'I've just got to get out of here,' said a man hauling a mattress on to the back of a pick-up truck. Furniture and possessions were strewn across the pavement in front of the building where he and his family had lived. The death toll rose to 45 after two more victims were found, crushed to death in their bed in a home in Santa Monica. About 4,800 people were reported to have been injured. Flat dwellers seemed to have taken the brunt of the earthquake's deadly toll. The Meadows Apartments in Northridge, where 16 people were crushed to death, had become a grisly attraction. Dozens of similar buildings in surrounding areas were also seriously damaged. Tilted at precarious angles, broken open by the quake's jolt, they threatened to collapse with the next strong aftershock. Incongruous signs - Now Renting and For Lease - still fluttered outside, even as residents struggled to gather their belongings into cars, trailers and rented vans. Removal vans were everywhere, double parked on residential streets, blocking traffic. Gas leaks remained a fear. Several residential streets in Northridge were cordoned off by police on Tuesday. Evacuated residents left signs - 'gas leak' - and personal messages telling where they had gone. Dense smoke blackened the sky a few miles east, providing pungent evidence of the danger. Whole streets of shops were boarded up with plywood. 'Open soon. Big sale,' was scrawled on one. A hardware store did a brisk trade, evidence that some, at least, were determined to put the pieces back together themselves. The half-demolished Pacific Contractors School for builders offered little encouragement to those who sought professional assistance. At the Northridge Fashion Mall, a large shopping centre, people gathered to gaze at the collapsed multi-storey car park and a Bullocks department store that appeared to be a write-off. National Guardsmen were stationed outside, not, they said, to prevent looting but to ensure nobody went too close to the damaged buildings. Santa Monica was hard hit as was Simi Valley, the site of the notorious first trial of the policemen who beat black motorist Rodney King. The officers' acquittal sparked riots in Los Angeles. In Studio City, north of Hollywood, homes were destroyed and hundreds of businesses wrecked. Elsewhere garden walls collapsed, leaving rubble across the street. It is a small inconvenience, perhaps, but one that deprived people of privacy as they camped out in their gardens. Robbed of control over their lives, people seemed to take out their frustrations on the streets. At traffic lights, blacked-out by power cuts, drivers played a deadly game of 'chicken', with predictable results. Los Angeles commuters were trapped for hours in massive traffic jams yesterday morning as the ravaged city struggled to return to some semblance of normality. For most this was the first day back at work since the earthquake. For residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, to the north of Los Angeles, a one-hour commute turned into a three or even four-hour nightmare. With the main freeway linking the suburban region to the city closed by earthquake damage, they were forced on to an alternative route, only to have that partially closed by rock slides following another strong aftershock. Traffic started to back up as early as 4.30am, according to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), and by 8.30am many who had started their journeys in the dark were still on the road. Although seven highways have been closed by earthquake damage, most freeway overpasses showed no signs of structural damage. But all would have to be inspected, officials said, raising the prospect of further problems. The CHP urged travellers to avoid visiting southern California. 'If you don't know your way around, you will find yourself in trouble. Even for people who do know the area, driving is a trying experience,' an official said. Damage to the region's water supply systems was one of the most worrying problems, officials said. Close to 100,000 homes and businesses were without running water. The Department of Water and Power said three aqueducts had been ruptured and two pumping plants damaged. There were also many broken water mains.</p>

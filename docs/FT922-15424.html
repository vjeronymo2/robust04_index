			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / O&amp;Y to seek Tube discussion OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the property developer, expects to hold talks with the government after the general election about financing the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee line Underground extension to London's Docklands. The company yesterday failed to make its first contribution of Pounds 40m to the project as originally scheduled. It is engaged in talks with its banks about the restructuring of worldwide debt estimated at more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.56bn). Under an initial agreement reached with the government and London Regional transport in November 1989, a further contribution from O&amp;Y was due by this time next year, with the balance of Pounds 300m expected on completion of the Tube extention in 1996. Bankers say they are reluctant to put up the Pounds 400m originally promised by O&amp;Y as its contribution to the Jubilee building costs. But they fear that the value of Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new development of offices, to which they have lent Pounds 700m, will be impaired if the extension is not built. One possibility being mooted is that O&amp;Y and its banks would contribute some funds to the line, although probably not the full Pounds 400m. This would put the onus on the future UK government to decide by how much to increase its own financing of the project. The Department of Tranpsort and the Labour party are holding back from making any firm commitments to the financial future of the extention while O&amp;Y fails to meet its own financial commitments. O&amp;Y's financial difficulties are being watched closely by several local and international construction companies which have put in bids for contracts worth up to Pounds 1.5bn linked to the building of the extention.</p>

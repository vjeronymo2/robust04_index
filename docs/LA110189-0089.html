Assets, deposits and some liabilities of the two thrifts were  transferred to new federal mutual institutions. The troubled thrifts have been  operating under the supervision of regulators. The RTC, a new agency formed to  mop up the nation's savings and loan mess, took the moves as part of its effort  to ready the institutions for sale.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher left here this afternoon for Egypt, winding  up his visit to Syria in a shuttle diplomacy to expedite the  peace process.    Christopher, who arrived here from Tel Aviv earlier today,  held talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on ways of  bringing closer the viewpoints of Syria and Israel to narrow  their differences over restoring Syria's Golan Heights.    Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and U.S. Middle East  peace coordinator Dennis Ross attended the talks.    Diplomatic sources here said that Christopher is shuttling  between Israel and Syria to seek common ground and help iron out  hurdles still on the way to peace.    The sources said that the talks Christopher had in Tel Aviv  Tuesday [17 May] and in Damascus today have not made tangible  headway in bringing their differences closer.    Christopher, who did not give a press briefing on his talks,  was seen off by al-Shar' at the airport.    Syria's presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh [name as  received] said after Christopher's departure that "the  differences remained wide."    "The president reiterated Syria's position and its adherence  to the basis of the peace process in accordance with U.N.  Security Council resolutions which call on Israel to fully  withdraw" from territories occupied in 1967," Kourieh said.  [quotation marks as received]</p>

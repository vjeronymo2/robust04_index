			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Heather Tyrrell, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Office is planning to evacuate around  150 Britons from the capital of war-ravaged Yemen on a civilian  airliner tomorrow -- if fighting allows.    The final go-ahead for a British Airways [BA] plane will be  based on a "minute-by-minute" assessment of the safety by  British diplomatic staff in the capital Sanaa, said a Foreign  Office spokesman.    If it is not deemed safe, military planes will be sent in  later to evacuate them, he said.    Around 700 Britons remain in the Arab country, five days  into  the civil war, and around 150 of them want to leave, he said.    Some 100 Britons have already left the country -- many  helped  by the French navy or the U.S. airforce to the safety of  Djibouti or Riyadh, where they have caught flights home to the  UK.    Scores arrived back today and spoke of land and air battles  between Marxists in the south and the conservative and tribal  North, which have included Scud missile attacks.    One evacuee told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony and  saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the airport  and it was at that point that I thought: `This is it.'"    Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the  airport and there were bullets flying all over the place."    A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are hoping to get a  British Airways [BA] flight in tomorrow but we will not know  until hours before -- we will do a minute-by-minute assessment  from our Embassy. It is our hope and our intention to try and  get one. If that fails, we will have to revert to a military  option." Hercules transport planes from RAF Lyneham are  available if necessary.    The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but  attacks  seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses,  schools and restaurants in the city are open.    A BA spokesman has said that the airline has a plane on  stand-by and is waiting for the go-ahead from the Foreign Office.    "We would need assurances from the Foreign Office that it is  safe to fly in and fly out," he said.    The flight would pick up the remaining Britons who wanted to  leave, and the 14-member crew of a British Airways DC-10 who  flew into Sanaa last Tuesday [3 May].    Evacuee Wendy Carlick, 38, of Wickham Market, Suffolk, was  critical of the lack of a British evacuation when she flew into  Heathrow today, leaving her husband Brian, 44, behind in Yemen.    She was accepted on one of four U.S. military flights from  Sanaa to Saudi Arabia, after spending two nights in the basement  of the home of her husband's boss at the communications firm  Cable and Wireless. She was joined by evacuee Mrs. Kim Lee, of  Plymouth, Devon, and her two children Andrew, four, and Thomas,  seven today, the family of her husband's work colleague.    "The British Embassy has not done a thing to help us. Kim's  husband David took it upon himself to do something and said if  there's going to be an evacuation, we should try and get on it,"  said Mrs. Carlick.    "If the United States could do it, why couldn't the British?  Even if there was not going to be any more danger, there has  been enough. Their feeling was `Let's wait and see for 24  hours.' Our feeling was: `Get out as soon as you can while the  runway is still OK.'"    She was among the last 10 to be accepted on the flight, she  said.    The first they had known about the civil war was at dawn on  Thursday, she said.    "Three jets came over extremely low and dropped three bombs.  We heard the jets, the bombs and immediately the anti-aircraft  missiles going off. We were terrified. Me and my husband  crawled along the floor and hid under the stairs. We live  opposite a military base so the bullets were very close. They  went on for half an hour. We decided to go to our general  manager's house who had a big basement and for two days we made  home there." Sanaa now had no power, water or petrol, she said.    At home now with her daughter Tammy, 18, and son Matthew,  16,  Mrs. Carlick said: "I am relieved to be here but still very,  very anxious."</p>

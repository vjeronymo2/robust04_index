Vladimir Nicu,  PCNM chairman, said that "PCNM is a political party of Romanians  from territories east to Prut and of Christian Orthodox spirit  of this suffering land." The party enters the electoral battle  to liquidate in law and in fact the consequences of  Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with "the sacred goal to reintegrate the  Romanian nation," said Nicu. Referring to the Congress of  Moldovan Civic Alliance, PCNM representatives stated that the  congress was held from Moldovan Government's initiative. They  called it "an insult to the Romanian's dignity, tricolor, hymn  and blazon." "These insults were made in the present of  President Mircea Snegur, Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Premier  Andrei Sangheli, and they applauded at them," said Nicu. He  asked rhetorically "what sort of common house is Moldova if PCNM  representatives were not allowed to take part in the congress?"  PCNM representatives called the movement "Pro Moldova" a  subdivision of "Moldovans' Alliance" in Dniester organized by  KGB and Maracuta. PCNM declared itself a nationalist party,  saying that "it would be better for Moldova to be a Romanian  province than a Russian colony." "Our chances in elections are  little, but we shall prepare ourselves for the next elections,"  said Nicu. He added that "if we obtain the majority of seats in  future Parliament, the next day we leave for Bucharest where we  shall decide the fate of Moldova, together with the Romanian  Parliament."</p>

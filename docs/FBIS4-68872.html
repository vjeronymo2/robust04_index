			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Restrictions on Sale of Foreign </F> Currency to Population Lifted"]    [Text] The republic government has issued a directive to  remove restrictions on sales of foreign currency to physical  persons. As is known, until now banks could sell up to $2,000 a  year in hard currency only to persons traveling outside the  republics on business, on tours, or on a visa, which created  favorable conditions for the "black market" to flourish.    As an AZER-TADZH correspondent was told in the Cabinet of  Ministers, the decision is aimed at strengthening control over  cash in circulation and complete legalization of manat buying  and selling for foreign currency.    There are currently more than 80 banks that perform these  operations. In order to avoid the outflow of foreign currency  from the republic, documents are in the works that would  regulate it being taken outside Azerbaijan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By A. R. Wilkie] </F>   [Text] Imagine a world where all outsiders are enemies;  where not even your closest colleagues are above suspicion,  where all telephone calls are assumed to be bugged; where even  trivial internal documents must be burnt in the presence of  witnesses. Living with suspicion is the fate of many who work  for intelligence organisations all over the world. China too  has specialist organisations which carry out intelligence and  counter-intelligence operations, the most important of which is  the Ministry of State Security. But the police, even down to  the lowly beat officer, also live in a John Le Carre world of  spy-counter-spy.    Skim the pages of the POLICE OFFICE WORK HANDBOOK, published  for internal circulation only by the Police Officers Education  Publishing House. The handbook opens with some general words of  warning for police officers meeting foreign visitors. "Be  friendly, warm and polite, at the same time raise vigilance and  act according to the principle of `treating insiders and  outsiders differently' in order to protect against any attempt  to gather intelligence." Much of the handbook deals with  practical hints, such as how to deal with superior officers on  the telephone (never hang up first) and how to handle the messy  paperwork required to send a detainee to a labour camp.    But at least 20 pages are devoted to secrecy. Police  officers are instructed "never to sell secret documents to scrap  paper merchants, never use them as wrapping paper, and never use  them as wallpaper". Secret documents must never be sent through  the mail or carried when shopping or visiting restaurants. Even  after secret documents have passed their expiry date, the  information in them remains secret. If the documents are  clogging up the shelves, permission must be sought to burn them,  but only in the presence of two police officers.    What are these secrets that must be so fiercely protected?  Some have to do with arrangements for the protection of top  leaders or visiting dignitaries. But political dissent and the  fight against it is at the top of the list. "Anything that  creates difficulties for quelling or handling riots, chaos,  disturbances, protests and sudden incidents" is a state secret.  Top secret -- to be kept under wraps for at least 30 years --  includes "information held by the police on spying, rebellions,  hijackings, plots, treachery, intelligence about serious cases  of smuggling, investigations or charges against the police,  details of surveillance operations, investigations and plans to  solve crimes, plans for cracking down, and any knowledge that if  it became known might cause serious losses to the unity of the  country, political stability, the unity of nationalities,  foreign relations and economic interests". Statistics concerning  "counter-revolutionary incidents" are considered "highly  confidential". Officially, they should be kept secret for at  least 20 years, as should "plans for quelling or dealing with  local protests, disturbances and other sudden incidents which  have a big impact on social order". "Captured reactionary  leaflets" are state secrets, and so are information about police  who break the law and "political accidents". Inexplicably, the  number of overseas Chinese permanently resident in China is also  a state secret. There are other categories of secret that are  so secret they cannot be named in a handbook that is only  semi-secret, such as any sensitive information about leaders and  their families.    Documents which contain secrets must be printed only by  approved specialist printers who have been vetted. If this is  not possible, the printing must take place in a workshop which  stands on its own and where privacy is guaranteed. The number  of copies cannot exceed the number ordered, and any spoiled  copies or scraps of waste must be carefully destroyed.    When there is to be a meeting at which secrets may be  discussed, all arrangements "from decorating the room to  purchasing necessary items to the preparation of the teapot and  cups" must be made by police officers. Such meetings must never  be held in hotels which receive foreign guests. After the  meeting, a search of the room must be carried out to make sure  no state secrets have been slipped between the cushions or been  idly doodled on the table top.    The reason for this obsession with secets, the handbook  explains, is that just about everybody is out to get them.  "With increased reform and opening to the world, there are more  routes for exchanges with the world on wider subjects. Foreign  intelligence organisations and other personnel from abroad are  trying every other way to gather intelligence. In the past few  years, the central government's secret documents have been  copied by people at foreign organisations stationed in China...  People come to China in all sorts of guises, including  businessmen, journalists, academics, to do spying... There are  also some people in China who have ulterior motives and sell the  top secrets of the party and government."    Spies, the handbook explains, try to intercept police  information as it is communicated internally, in particular by  listening in on telephone calls. Deleted material can be  salvaged from computer disks. Fax machines and computer modems  can be easily bugged with simple equipment. Imported fax  machines and computers, the handbook warns, should be treated  with particular care, since bugs may have been planted in them  at the time of manufacture. Any imported electronic equipment  must therefore be inspected for security before it can be  installed.    There is no doubt that China, like all countries, is spied  on  by foreign governments. But Beijing's concern about espionage  seems unusually intense and wide-ranging. The only hard  evidence for foreign intelligence gathering cited in the  handbook is the publication abroad of excerpts from Chinese  newspapers and magazines and transcripts of radio broadcasts,  all or most of which are already openly available.    Perhaps the greatest worry for the police are the highly  organised and well-funded dissident groups now active in China.  Rightly or wrongly, the authorities believe these dissident  groups are supported and encouraged by prodemocracy groups  abroad. Increasingly, modern dissidents carry beepers and use  fax machines, spreading the word electronically.    Nor can the police force be fully confident of everyone in  its own ranks. Dissidents say that while the police have  infiltrated their organisations, they, in return, have also  infiltrated the police. Dissent is a crime, so the police --  like almost everything else -- has become politicised. And the  price to be paid for engaging in politics in China is paranoia.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks  Dialogue    2. Brotherhood Calls For Boycotting Serbian Supporters    3. Islamists To Run University Professors' Club Elections    4. Writer Advocates Mediation Between Police, Islamists    5. Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence    6. Birth Control Seen as Conspiracy Against Muslim Nation    7. Ennahda Leader Interviewed on Tunisian Situation,  Prospects  <H5>  ASYUT GROUP ESCALATES OPERATIONS, SUHAJ GROUP SEEKS DIALOGUE </H5>   A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi  on  pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed  responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin  'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his  bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said  this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human  right violations in prisons."    The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in  Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people",  originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a  seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the  Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to  solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms,  renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to  contain the crisis."    The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut  has  discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who  cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective  revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic  Group," the report says.  <H5>  BROTHERHOOD CALLS FOR BOYCOTTING SERBIAN SUPPORTERS </H5>   An unattributed 100-word report on page 7 notes that "the  Muslim Brotherhood has called on all Muslims to declare a  political and economic boycott of the states that support the  Serbian aggression against the Bosnian Muslims." The  Brotherhood suggests that specialized institutions be set up in  individual states to "supervise the boycott measures."    The report adds that the Brotherhood blames the major states  and the United Nations for Serbian crimes and condemns the  "failure and capitulation of the officials in the Arab and  Muslim worlds in their stance on the Serbian aggression."    ISLAMISTS TO RUN UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS' CLUB ELECTIONS    A 150-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad on pages 1 and 7  says that "current Islamic representatives" will hold elections  this month to select members of the professors' clubs at the  universities of Cairo and al-Zaqaziq.    WRITER ADVOCATES MEDIATION BETWEEN POLICE, ISLAMISTS    In a 1,200-word article on page 9, Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh  expresses surprise at the "persisting bloodshed and series of  mutual executions between police and Islamic groups." He  regrets the absence of "serious and sincere attempts" to end  this situation, since the victims are always the sons of the  Egyptian nation.    He notes that security campaigns will not succeed in  overcoming extremism, since prevailing conditions provide  adequate soil for the growth of more violence. He argues that  the only approach guaranteed to put an end to this bloodshed is  mediation by Muslim scholars to reconcile the two sides.   <H5>    GOVERNMENT POLICIES SEEN AS CAUSE FOR VIOLENCE </H5>   In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues  that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling  regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says  that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists  and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which,  protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and  remains unaccountable.    Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media  campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist  phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this  campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the  Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government  to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the  truth is that these groups are against the government, not the  people; they are working to overthrow the regime.    The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong  evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing  society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide  society and make violence the only effective approach.    Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are  subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that  draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our  original values are buried inside us." He adds that the  policies of the present regime are merely fulfilling the terms  of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form of  financial and political support.    Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest  and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid  further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the  people instead of the West.  <H5>  BIRTH CONTROL SEEN AS CONSPIRACY AGAINST MUSLIM NATION </H5>   In a 4,000-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary  General 'Adil Husayn writes about the UN population conference  recently held in Cairo. Citing the Koranic verse "there is no  moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependenth on God,"  he says the old Western call to curb the population increase in  order to save limited resources runs counter to God's promise to  provide all creatures with their needs.    Showing how the world population balance shifted in favor of  the "oppressed world" in the 1950's, he argues that this shift  is part of "the heavenly arrangements that herald the  approaching triumph of the faithful." The pharaohs and tyrants  of this age reject this and seek to change it as much as they  can. He notes that "they are plotting to annihilate mankind on  our continents, with the Islamic nation heading their targets,  of course."    Husayn contends that birth control in the Arab and Muslim  world is unjustified, since Arab and Muslim populations are not  large enough to exploit the abundant natural and financial  resources.    He believes that the people should stand up to the "official  media" to prove that increasing our birth rate is "a blessing  that warrants no regret or apology." He expects the population  policy to be completely different "when patriotic Islamists"  rule the country.  <H5>  ENNAHDA LEADER INTERVIEWED ON SITUATION, PROSPECTS </H5>   In a 1,500-word interview with Ennahda leader Rached  Ghannouchi in Tunis by Lutfi Bin-Ramadan, published on page 8,  Ghannouchi relates how the government, fearing the Islamic  movement's success in the 1989 elections, set out to uproot  Islamists in collaboration with the communists and all  anti-Muslim currents. Describing the situation in the wake of  recent elections, Ghannouchi says that "it is a battle between a  corrupt, totalitarian dictatorship and a civilian society with  all its Islamic, secular, and patriotic categories that struggle  for their public and private political and religious freedoms."  He expects these "farcical elections to inspire a national  front involving all the factors of the civilian society to fight  dictatorship until the people's will is liberated."    Arguing that the people's boycott of the elections indicates  a public rejection of the ideas and personalities imposed on  them, Ghannoouchi says that "the apparent state of peace is  merely the lull that precedes the storm." Although the regime  has exploited world conditions that are going against Islam and  the Islamic movement, the liberal and democratic powers inside  and outside the country realize that the battle against  fundamentalism is only a pretext for the regime's suppression of  public and individual freedoms. It is opening the door to  corrupt currents, he says.    Touching on the situation in Algeria, Ghannouchi notes that  Algeria enjoys a distinctive status in the Arab Maghreb. He  believes that the situation in Algeria is ready for an  inevitable change and that "the Islamists are coming under the  leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front." Because of its  fragility, Tunisia will be the most affected by what happens in  Algeria, he adds.    Ghannoouchi wishes the Tunisian regime had been as flexible,  prudent, and clever as the Jordanian or Moroccan regimes in  dealing with the inevitably escalating Islamic current. "It  could have achieved a degree of openness and freedom of change,  cleared the political climate, and engaged in a serious dialogue  with all the cultural and social powers to develop a coexistence  formula," he says. However, he finds it unlikely the regime  will take such a rational course.</p>

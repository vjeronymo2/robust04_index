			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT: 'PLANET IN TROUBLE' AND U.S. AID  </P> <P> Worldwatch Institute's 1989 State of the World report recites the latest in the  by now familiar saga of disappearing forests and spreading deserts ("Planet in  Trouble," editorial, Feb. 21). Regrettably, projects which the United States  funded in the name of development have often made things worse. We should  insist that our aid contributes to environmental preservation, not destruction.  </P> <P> It would be easy, and wrong, to blame Third-World poor people for increased  desertification. In poor regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America people  desperate to feed themselves and their children have cleared forests,  overgrazed pastures and depleted topsoils. They do not see that they have any  choice but to exploit these resources to the fullest in order to survive. We in  the developed world do have a choice. As pointed out last year in Food Monitor,  poor agricultural practices are often instigated by development institutions  (supported by our tax dollars).  </P> <P> To end this misuse of our aid money, Congress should adopt the Global Poverty  Reduction Act, which states that all development activities included in a  global plan for poverty reduction be "consistent with maintaining and restoring  the renewable natural resource base. Primary emphasis should be on small-scale  affordable, resource conserving, low-risk local projects using appropriate  technologies (including traditional agricultural methods) suited to local  environmental, resource and climactic conditions and featuring close  consultation with local people at all stages of project design and  implementation."  </P> <P> Environmental protection should be written into our foreign aid law, and our  aid agency should be held to account for carrying it out.  </P> <P> ALAN W.

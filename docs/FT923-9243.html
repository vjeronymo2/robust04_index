			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Observer: Chorus of approval The latest rendition of New York, New York, comes from an unlikely chorus. Commonwealth finance ministers are breaking with tradition and holding their annual September meeting in the Big Apple. Traditionally, the ministers assemble in a member country for their get-together, which precedes the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. Last year, Kuala Lumpur did the honours because the IMF met in Bangkok. The year before, Trinidad did its bit. This year, however, not only did no Commonwealth country volunteer to host the meeting, but the mother of parliaments is not even taking the event very seriously. The UK will be represented by a junior Treasury minister rather than the chancellor. Some unkind souls have suggested that ministers opted for New York because the cheap dollar and a less than rigorous agenda would enable them to catch up on their shopping and the latest Broadway shows. But the Commonwealth Secretariat begs to differ. It says New York is an ideal venue because it is an important global financial centre and a large part of the ministers' discussions this year will be about encouraging non-government finance into developing countries. Sounds a limp sort of excuse.</p>

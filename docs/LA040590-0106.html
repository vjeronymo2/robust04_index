			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> LAWSON APPEARS TO BE UNSHAKEN BY SHAKY START TO 1990  </P> <P> The 1990 season has gotten off to a shaky start for Eddie Lawson, the four-time  world motorcycle road racing champion.  </P> <P> On Feb. 28, Lawson was standing in the garage of his year-old $1-million home  in the highlands above Upland when the earth started shaking.  </P> <P> "I ran outside to the driveway and watched the house rock and roll," Lawson  recalled. "I had the radio on and when I heard an announcer say that the  epicenter was three miles north of Upland, I said to myself, 'Hey, that's right  where I am.' "  </P> <P> The quake shattered the Italian marble floor in his home's entryway, knocked  plaster and pictures off the walls and did about $20,000 worth of damage.  </P> <P> "It shook it up pretty good, but the house didn't fall down, which is  something," he said.  </P> <P> Then last Sunday, on a 140-m.p.h. left-handed curve on the Suzuka track in  Japan, Lawson was racing for second place in the 1990 season opener when the  rear wheel of his Yamaha was nipped by a Honda ridden by Mike Doohan of  Australia. The high-speed impact on the fourth lap sent both riders sprawling.  Neither was seriously injured, but it knocked them both out of the 22-lap race.  </P> <P> Doohan was Lawson's house guest last year at this time and is one of the  California rider's best friends.  </P> <P> "It was one of those unfortunate things that happens sometimes in racing,"  Lawson said. "Mike apparently lost his brakes and couldn't stop when we were  going through the corner. He sure didn't want it to happen, but it did. I was  setting up Kevin Schwantz to move into second place when suddenly I was down.  </P> <P> "It's going to make it tough to defend my championship, not scoring any points  at all and having Wayne (Rainey) getting 20 and the other Wayne (Gardner)  getting 17," Lawson said. "You can't count on the other guys dropping out, and  it's tough to pick up points one at a time, but I won't quit trying."  </P> <P> Lawson, 31, won his fourth world championship last year, riding a Honda, when  he overcame an early lead by Rainey, a Yamaha team rider from Downey. During  the off-season, Lawson quit Honda to join Rainey on Kenny Roberts' Marlboro  team.  </P> <P> Rainey won the Japanese Grand Prix by three seconds, after having led by more  than 10 seconds. Gardner, the 1987 champion from Australia, finished second on  a Honda, with Schwantz, a Suzuki rider from Houston, third.  </P> <P> "I slowed down a little after I saw Eddie's bike laying in the grass," Rainey  said. "I didn't know what happened. I thought maybe he'd slid out on a slick  spot, so I got a little cautious and made sure I finished. I knew where he went  down was a heck of a place to crash, and I didn't want any part of it."  </P> <P> This weekend, Rainey, Lawson and the rest of the world road racing circus will  be at the 2.196-mile Laguna Seca Raceway, near Monterey, for the second round  of the 16-country championship season.  </P> <P> Rainey won last year's Laguna Seca race with a wire-to-wire performance that  was marred by a postrace accident involving former U.S. champion Bubba Shobert  of Carmel Valley and Australian Kevin Magee.  </P> <P> Shobert was riding beside Lawson after the race ended when Magee stopped in the  middle of the track and was hit by Shobert. The crash sent Shobert to the  hospital with head injuries from which he is still recovering. Magee had a  broken ankle.  </P> <P> "I'd rather win Laguna Seca again than any other race during the year," Rainey  said. "All my friends will be there, and it's the only race in America, so it's  doubly important for me."  </P> <P> Lawson, who won at Laguna Seca in 1988 and finished third last year, is also  looking forward to returning there.  </P> <P> "I like the track," he said. "I've always ridden well there, and I'm anxious to  see how my ankle will hold up Sunday."  </P> <P> Lawson's ankle was twisted and bruised in the fall in Japan.  </P> <P> Neither Lawson nor Rainey sees any problems with the world's No. 1 and No. 2  riders being teammates. Both, in fact, say they welcome the unusual partnership  put together by Roberts, a former world champion from Modesto.  </P> <P> "Wayne and I go back a long way," Lawson said. "We were teammates when we were  dirt trackers here in the States, and we both rode for Kawasaki in the early  '80s. We always got along real good. Of course, once the race starts, it's  every man for himself."  </P> <P> The two test together and race together, but between races they take different  paths. Once the season reaches Europe next month, Rainey and his wife will  remain there. Lawson will fly back and forth to Southern California whenever  the testing schedule permits.  </P> <P> "We really enjoy living and traveling around Europe," Rainey said. "We love to  browse around and enjoy the food in different countries. It's a great  opportunity and we're taking advantage of it."  </P> <P> Lawson has other ideas.  </P> <P> "I don't enjoy Europe except when I'm racing," he said. "My idea of taking some  time off is to come home and head out to Lake Havasu (where he owns a resort  home) or enjoy my new place in Upland. I can't wait to get home as often as I  can."  </P> <P> The toughest part for Lawson in making the switch from Honda to Yamaha was  leaving Erv Kamemoto, his former team owner and bike tuner from San Jose.  </P> <P> "Erv and I had a good rapport and I would like to have kept working with him,  but things just didn't work out with Honda," Lawson said. "I feel much better  being back with Yamaha again."  </P> <P> Lawson won the 1984, '86 and '88 world championships riding a Yamaha.  </P> <P> Practice and qualifying for the Budweiser U.S. International Grand Prix, which  includes 250cc and sidecar races as well as the 500cc main event, will be held  Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> SPRINTS &amp; MIDGETS -- United States Auto Club full midgets and three-quarter  midgets will share the billing Friday night at Ascot Park. The bigger cars will  run a qualifying program for the opening of their Saturday night ESPN TV series  and the TQs will run a complete show.  </P> <P> On Saturday, in addition to the midget races -- featuring defending western  states champion Robby Flock, 1990 leader Sleepy Tripp and former national  champions Rich Vogler and Kevin Olson -- on the quarter-mile track, there will  be a complete California Racing Assn. sprint car program on the half-mile oval.  </P> <P> The midget races will start at 6 p.m., with the show airing on ESPN at 7. The  sprint cars will start at 8:30.  </P> <P> INDY CARS -- The 1990 PPG Indy Car World Series will have a new look when the  season opens Sunday with the Autoworks 200 at Phoenix International Raceway.

Press will try for two in a row Saturday night when  the Southwest Tour visits the high banks of Mesa Marin Raceway for the  Bakersfield 100.

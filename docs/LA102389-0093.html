			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FINAL DISASTER WE MUST AVERT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: IN OUR PURSUIT OF "PROGRESS" WE ARE ATTACKING THE FRAGILE ENVELOPE  OF AIR, WATER AND EARTH THAT SUSTAINS LIFE. SURELY NATURE WILL EXACT A FEARFUL  REVENGE.  </P> <P> Many years ago, as a third-year student at Harvard Law School, I was selected  to become a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. That spring,  on a visit to Harvard, the justice met with me and asked when I intended to  come to Washington.  </P> <P> "As soon as school ends," I replied.  </P> <P> "Take some time off for a vacation first," he advised.  </P> <P> "I don't need a vacation," I answered, whereupon the diminutive Frankfurter  wheeled toward me and pointing an admonishing finger, sternly rejoined: "Young  man! There's one thing I want you to remember for the rest of your career --  the laws of physiology are inexorable." I took the vacation.  </P> <P> Tuesday's earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area is but another reminder of  the truism that nature pursues its own remorseless course, is ignored or defied  only at the peril of human existence. The damage to the Bay Area is reversible;  structures will be rebuilt and life will continue. But history teaches that  this is not always the case: Pompeii still lies buried beneath ancient lava  flows; the dinosaurs will never return.  </P> <P> We live at a time when human defiance of nature is unparalleled in scope and  ferocity. And surely nature will exact a fearful revenge. In our obsessive  pursuit of "progress" -- the accumulation of wealth -- we are attacking the  fragile envelope of air, water and earth that sustains life. We call this the  "problem of the environment." But the problem is not with the environment, but  with the systematic, willful, devastating defiance of the human race.  </P> <P> We continue to pump man-made poisons into the air and water; unleash the  chemicals that slowly dissolve the life-protecting layer of ozone guarding us  from the sun; heap up the blanket of gases that are transforming the climate of  the Earth and endangering the intricately woven chain of life. Much of this  damage is already irreversible. Thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, have  already been condemned to a premature death -- from man-caused cancers or heart  attacks or respiratory diseases. And this reality is only the first, faint and  distant warning of calamities yet to come, calamities that only immediate,  drastic and costly action can avert.  </P> <P> We all know this to be true. Still we persist. We are in the grips of a malady  as old as the race -- the wishful thinking, the barely conscious  self-deception, that disaster will somehow be averted, that it can't really  happen to us, that some kind of magic (in our time known as technology) will  find a way to turn back the steadily mounting tides.  </P> <P> "Nature," it has been written, "is the great democrat." Surely this is true of  the vengeance that our ravaging of the Earth is bringing upon us. Even the  wealthiest and most powerful cannot purchase escape from life-threatening air,  poisoned water, the warming of the globe. The truth is that there is no more  time. We have already exceeded the limits that nature can bear.  </P> <P> There's no question that to save ourselves, we must take action immediately  that will reduce our standard of existence, change the course of development.  Perhaps faced with so stark an unavoidable a choice -- once we admit that is  the choice -- science will find other means of enhancing our material  existence. And, perhaps not. But one thing is certain. Such alternatives will  be found only when the crisis is actually upon us. We are too choked with  arrogance and gifted with self-deception to forgo present satisfaction for the  sake of the future -- even the future survival of our own descendants. This  incapacity is not a peculiarly modern affliction. History is littered with the  wreckage of past empires that overreached themselves and tumbled into the abyss  of memory.  </P> <P> Yet, always before, as civilizations dissolve, others succeeded. Now we  confront not so trivial a displacement, but the potential devastation of the  entire planet. An Earth can have no successors. An overstatement? Perhaps. But  a mounting possibility. Although some, indeterminate damage has already been  done, it is not too late -- probably -- to avert far larger catastrophe. The  nations of the world, the leaders among the nations, could meet to declare a  global emergency and take those severe actions that might arrest the process of  destruction.  </P> <P> We can do this. But I have little confidence that we will do so. Only a  swelling clamor, a demand, from the threatened people of the Earth can stir the  powerful of enterprise and government to action.  </P> <P> The time for analysis is past. If we fail now, we will have made a prophet of  T.S. Eliot when he wrote: "This is the way the world ends. . . . Not with a  bang, but a whimper."  </P> <P> And we will have deserved such an ending.  </P></p>

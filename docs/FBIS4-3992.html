			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter: "China's Card Toward U.S. </F> `Human Rights'" -- first three paragraphs are editor's note;  numbering as published]    [Text] Each year, China's departments related to national  defense and state security call a symposium on "reviewing the  state security situation" to analyze the long-range effects of  the world situation on China and the Asian region. The  participants include experts from the Ministry of National  Defense, the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, the Ministry of State Security, and research institutes  specialized in studies of strategy and world issues.    Toward the end of last year, the Ministry of Defense called  meetings in this category on two occasions, with topics  including Sino-U.S. relations, the security of the Nansha  [Spratly] Islands, the election of the new Russian parliament,  and measures for the security of various peripheral countries in  the Asia-Pacific Region.    Based on the discussions at these meetings, this journal has  sorted out an article on Sino-U.S. relations for our readers'  reference.    Since last May, when U.S. President Clinton announced the  extension of MFN status to China for the 1993-94 fiscal year,  Sino-U.S. economic exchanges have deepened and expanded further,  with a rapid increase in U.S. investment in China. At the same  time, U.S. media has given voluminous coverage to "China's  miraculous economic growth," which created a positive climate of  opinion for the Clinton administration to review its China  policy in a comprehensive way and to improve Sino-U.S.  relations. However, since the beginning of the third  quarter, some troubles have surfaced in Sino-U.S. relations.  For example: The U.S. implementation of "Category II trade  sanctions" under the pretext of China's having sold M-11  guided-missile technology to Pakistan, the "Yinhe" incident, and  the continued U.S. sales of advanced weapons and equipment to  Taiwan.  <H5>  The United States Tries Hard To Mend Its Relations With China </H5>   Reviewing Sino-U.S. relations over the past six months or  so,  it is not difficult to see that the United States has been  getting impatient with waitng for China to make corresponding  concessions in such arenas as human rights and weapon  proliferation. In addition, an all-encompassing and consistent  China policy on the part of the Clinton administration, as well  as a continuous guiding principle in this arena, are not on the  horizon. Thus, it has been impossible to effectively control  the escalation of friction between the two sides, resulting in  greater turbulence in the unstable bilateral relations.    However, the United States has misgivings over the growing  tension in Sino-U.S. relations. This being the case, the  Clinton administration has taken a series of initiatives. For  example, Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national  security affairs, submitted a comprehensive policy document to  Clinton in mid-September last year, in which he proposed mending  U.S. relations with China.    In Seattle, the Chinese and U.S. heads of state finally  accomplished their first meeting since February 1989.  <H5>  "Economic Security Equates With National Security" </H5>   The factor prompting the United States to readjust its China  policy lies primarily in the fact that focus of U.S. diplomatic  strategy has shifted to the economy. While summarizing the six  key points in U.S. diplomatic strategy, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher said: "Economic security equates with  national security," while stressing that the economy is primary  among all diplomatic focal points, and emphasizing the  importance to U.S. economic revival of U.S. participation and  leadership in Asia-Pacific economic operation. He believed that  "no other area in the world is more important than the East  Asian and Pacific region." In recent years, bilateral trade  between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has  increased, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1 percent.  In 1993, the volume of trade between the United States and the  Asia-Pacific region was $344.05 billion, accounting for 52  percent of U.S. general export volume.    Over the past two years, China's economy has enjoyed a high  growth rate, and has become a focus in the world, forcing the  United States to renew its understanding of China, and to show  concern for the ever-expanding U.S. economic interests in China.  At present, the volume of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade approaches  $70 billion. China is an important market for U.S. commercial  aircraft, electronic equipment, and farm produce. In these  three areas alone, 63,000 job opportunities have been created  for the United States.    U.S. Businessmen Urge the U.S. Government To Revise  Its China Policy In the fourth annual survey of the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, 98 percent of those polled believed the  prospects for investment in mainland China to be "favorable" or  "very favorable." At the same time, 78 percent of U.S.  companies believed that the disputes over MFN status would  jeopardize their commercial activities in China. So we can see  that with the expansion of U.S. investment interests in China,  U.S. businessmen are urging the government to re-examine  Sino-U.S. relations so as to ensure comprehensive U.S.  participation in China's economic development.    Apart from economic considerations, the United States also  is  calling for China's cooperation in handling global and regional  security. In actual fact, because China is one of the countries  having mastery of guided missiles and nuclear technology, the  United States will have to rely on China in its  "non-proliferation diplomacy." In particular, viewed from the  angle of Asia-Pacific regional security, China has played a  vitally important role in the UN peace-keeping plan in Cambodia,  easing the tense situation and realizing a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula, and promoting the building of a multilateral security  mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region. At at time when the  United States is attempting to "take an active part and play a  leading role" in the Asia-Pacific region, it would be  impractical to reject China's participation and support.    Based on the new principle that "Sino-U.S. relations are one  of the most important bilateral relationships in the world," the  United States has started to establish new focuses in its China  policy, namely: 1) To take the initiative into its own hand to  restore high-level dialogues in various arenas; 2) To take a  practical attitude toward the existence of China as a political  and military power, and establish "normal military relations"  with China, which are not aimed at any third country, but are  conducive to world peace and stability, especially in the  Asia-Pacific region, as well as regional security; and 3) In  areas where the differences between the two sides are  comparatively great, for example, the human rights issue, the  United States also has stated that it will not proceed from U.S.  value concepts in "doing business with China," but will "reflect  the commitments made by various countries according to the UN  Charter," which shows that from now on, the United States will  exert influence on China by relying more heavily on  "international criteria."  <H5>  The United States Is Worried About the Shaping of the </H5> Sino-Russian Alliance    Since July last year, the new trends in Russia's foreign  policy have placed a renewed stress on the maintenance of the  traditional national interests and sphere of influence. What  worries the United States is that this change in Russia's  foreign policy has taken place under conditions of a malignant  growth of nationalism in Russia. At the same time, the United  States has renewed its worries about the shaping of a  Russia-China alliance, and was anxious about Russian Defense  Minister Grachev's China visit. That being the case, while  thinking of readjusting its policy toward Russia, the United  States acknowledged: "The importance of China has been  neglected over the past few years," and hoped that China would  become a "friend" of the United States through so-called  "contact strategy."    To summarize, China's rapid economic development and growing  comprehensive national strength, the integration of economic  interests between China and the United States, and the concerns  over Russia are the basic considerations pushing the Clinton  administration to establish the axes of its policy toward China.  Since President Clinton approved the "Action Memorandum" set out  by the National Security Council in mid-September last year,  quite a few high-ranking U.S. officials have visited China, one  after another. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President  Clinton met in Seattle in late November last year; in mid-March  this year, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited  China. All this shows that progress has been made recently in  Sino-U.S. relations.    Nevertheless, the improvement in bilateral relations is  confined to elevating the levels of contact and expanding the  areas, pending satisfactory solutions to substantial issues.  During his recent China visit, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher was somewhat relaxed about the linking of MFN status  with human rights conditions; this brought about a silver lining  to the cloud hanging over China's MFN status. However, a  solution to this issue once and for all continues to call for  the two sides' joint efforts. The ups and downs in Sino-U.S.  relations in recent years were related to the readjustment in  U.S. strategic focuses; now that the United States has seen the  importance of the Asia-Pacific region, and has a renewed  understanding of China's role, the Clinton administration has  been active toward China, resulting in a change in Sino-U.S.  relations. In view of this, it is advisable for China to have a  comprehensive, long-range strategy toward the United States, as  well as short-range measures for individual specific issues. To  achieve this end, we make the following suggestions:  <H5>  Revise the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques </H5>   I. It is necessary to strive for the revision of the  communiques on bilateral relations.    The three existing communiques on Sino-U.S. relations were  signed against the backdrop of the Cold War. The 1982 "17  August" Communique already has stood for 12 years, and many of  its contents cannot reflect the new foundation and realities in  Sino-U.S. relations. The problems surfacing in Sino-U.S.  relations in recent years increasingly have revealed the  fragility of bilateral relations founded on ideology. Today, it  is imperative to find a new supporting point. It seems  inevitable that economic cooperation will be the new tie in  relations between the two countries. However, this point  has never been touched on in the three past communiques. This  being the case, a mechanism to standardize disputes is not on  the horizon. For example, this important principle in handling  issues involving economic relations and trade, as well as  political matters, should be written into the new communique.    II. The issue of human rights.    The human rights issue will remain a thorny one in Sino-U.S  relations from now on, and this has a bearing on the MFN status  after 1994. To handle this issue, China may take the following  measures:    1. To adopt a tough stance, fighting tit for tat: China  should adhere to the principle of separating trade and political  issues, while opposing the addition of human rights conditions  to the MFN status. China should do more work in the U.S.  Congress, in the U.S. Government, and among the U.S. public so  as to win the support of more people.    At the same time, China should take full advantage of the  media to indicate the serious human rights issues in the United  States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry should collect materials  about human rights conditions in the United States: racial  discrimination, violence, and murder, for example. These should  be published each year, while a list of Chinese citizens  suffering from violence and unfair treatment in the United  States should be submitted to the U.S. side.    2. To agree to discuss the human rights issue, though it  should not be linked to the MFN status.    We may take into consideration making the international  discussion of the human rights issue regular and institutional.  Discussions can be conducted between governments, as well as  scholars. The issues of human rights in China, as well as in  the United States, can be discussed. According to a U.S. State  Department official, this the minimum requirement of the U.S.  side on the "human rights" conditions, the fulfillment of which  will somewhat help the extension of the MFN status.  <H5>  Releasing Counterrevolutionaries </H5>   3. According to the revised penal code, some imprisoned  counterrevolutionaries should be released in all at once. At  present, the definition of "counterrevolutionary crime" is  comparatively vague in China's current penal code, and it would  be very difficult for the code to be compare with foreign penal  codes, and to be understood and accepted in the world, so the  code's revision seems imperative. Furthermore, this practice  will enable China to have a law by which to abide when dealing  with issues in this category, as well as sufficient legal  grounds to deal with U.S. "human rights diplomacy," in contrast  to the practice of releasing one or two political prisoners each  year when the United States is set to discuss the extension of  China's MFN status.    4. Further relax restrictions on emigrants: The United  States regards freedom of emigration as one of the basic human  rights. Although China has relaxed its emigration policy on  several occasions, it is still impossible for Chinese citizens  to leave the country freely. "Human rights" issues are derived  from such conditions, which then are linked to the issue of the  "imprisonment of political offenders," and used to deal with  China. In Clinton's order to extend MFN status to China last  year, he continued including freedom of emigration as a  prerequisite, while requiring China to "permit Chinese citizens  to emigrate overseas for political or religious reasons, without  any restriction." This being the case, we suggest that the  departments concerned further relax restrictions on citizens'  crossing the border, so that legitimate emigrants many enjoy  full freedom, and the United States' additional human rights  condition thus lose its "legal grounds."    5. Further reveal the truth concerning U.S. exports of  prison-produced products: Many states in the United States have  prison factories, and the law permits the export of their  products. The United States, however, is making a great fuss  over products turned out by Chinese prisoners. China has failed  to fully expose this unreasonable behavior, and seems to be very  passive. China also should investigate and publish the  conditions under which U.S. prison products are exported.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Bad debt relief From 1 April traders will be able to claim relief on any debt which has been written off after six months, which is changed from a year. The intention is to provide an immediate boost to businesses' cash flow estimated at Pounds 150m in 1993-94. The reduction in the waiting period should mean that relief is available swiftly on all bad debts, said Customs and Excise.</p>

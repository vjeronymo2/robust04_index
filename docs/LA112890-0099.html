			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO EXPLORE ENLARGING THE CITY  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council decided Tuesday to explore forming a larger city to  govern more of the Ojai Valley.  </P> <P> The council will advertise for a consultant and appoint a citizens committee to  study possible city boundaries, public opinion and the legal and financial  issues involved.  </P> <P> A public forum will be held on Dec. 18 to invite suggestions for the study.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Loebl, who opposed the county's attempt to form a valleywide  city in 1981, requested the study in September.  </P> <P> Greater control of the valley could ward off urban growth and offer a wider tax  base to provide more services, he said.  </P> <P> Ojai, population 7,501, is the only municipality in the 10-mile-long valley,  where another 25,600 people live in the communities of Meiners Oaks, Mira  Monte, Oak View, Casitas Springs and the upper Ojai Valley.  </P> <P> The unincorporated area is growing twice as fast as Ojai. Since 1984, Ventura  County has issued about 1,015 building permits in the valley, whereas the city  has issued 130.  </P> <P> While some rural residents support annexation or incorporation, others fear  that higher taxes or building restrictions could result from municipal  government.

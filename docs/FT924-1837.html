			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Power company joins meter venture SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric, the electricity company, is entering the market for 'intelligent' electricity metering systems through a joint venture with an electronics company. Hydro-Electric says the joint venture will enable it to 'accelerate and guide' the development of intelligent metering systems and win a share of the English market. It is forming a 50-50 joint venture company named Remote Metering Systems (RMS) with Verran Electronics of Basingstoke, Hants, and investing an initial Pounds 1m in shares and loan notes, with Pounds 2m to follow later. Intelligent electricity metering systems will allow electricity suppliers to read meters hundreds of miles away, with information transmitted along electricity lines. The system can also transmit information from the company to the consumer, in particular details about tariffs. Intelligent metering will become increasingly necessary as customers become free to choose their power supplier. It is the first electricity company to announce a joint venture with a company in remote metering. Verran was founded in 1988 and now has a turnover of Pounds 3m. Southern Electric, Page 24</p>

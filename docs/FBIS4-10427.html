			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 7 Apr (PL) -- Cuba reduced state subsidies  to the agricultural sector by 50 percent from January to March  this year, union leader Pedro Ross announced today when he read  the decisions recently made by the Cuban Government.    The country spent 2.700 billion pesos, equal to the dollar,  to subsidize this field in the sugar cane and non-sugar cane  sectors that underwent transformations at the end of 1993, when  state farms where converted to cooperatives.    During a news conference, the secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation maintained that in the past quarter the  tobacco sector surpassed its production goal in the manufacture  of tobacco for export by 125 percent. Meanwhile, tourism grew  by 30 percent.    Regarding the parliamentary debate on the reorganization of  internal finances announced for 1 May, he indicated that the  measures to be taken will be political and not technocratic.    Ross said that these decisions cannot be made behind the  workers' backs given their affect on millions of people and the  benefits and sacrifices that almost the entire nation will have  to make.    He indicated that a great deal of suggestions were made  during the more than 80,000 meetings recently held throughout  the nation and in which more than 3 million workers participated.    Ross admitted there were different points of view and  different criteria for some issues, but everything was taken  into consideration during the labor union debates, called  parliaments in the workplace.    The workers' meetings began to show results, according to  Ross, when decisions were applied on efficient productivity and  savings that have immediate effects on the economy.    For Ross, this is part of a group of measures implemented in  the past months, such as the turnover of thousands of hectares  of state-owned lands to workers for the organization of Basic  Productive Cooperation Units.    The creation of such units was of the greatest political and  social scope as it changes production and distribution  relationships established since the triumph of the Revolution in  1959 and which have benefited more than 1.1 million workers, he  added.</p>

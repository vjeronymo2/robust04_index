			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (21): Small UK businesses suffer Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry are sorting their way through a mound of suggestions on how to reduce business payment delays. As well as its own ideas, which include a statutory right to interest, the government requested other comments, provoking vigorous response from the 60,000-member Federation of Small Business (FSB). Dr Bernard Juby, the FSB's trade and industry spokesman - dismissing the idea of a right to levy interest charges because 'nobody has bothered to think through how to enforce it' - cites a string of alternatives. One of the main problems facing a small firm in collecting money owed by a large company is the risk of alienating that customer, particularly if the business involved represents a big share of the seller's turnover. Several of Dr Juby's proposals give buyers an incentive to improve payment performance in rather than granting individual suppliers rights that they may be reluctant to enforce. He advocates stronger legal underpinning of terms of trade, such as a regulation that, unless specified otherwise, payment is due within 30 days. Another option is to make access to the courts easier, perhaps by increasing the size of debt a small claims court will consider. Firms sometimes lose out if a customer goes out of business before paying for goods he has received. At present such goods may be seized by the liquidator and sold (as part of a going concern or in an attempt to raise funds to pay creditors). Dr Juby believes suppliers should have a right to reclaim such unpaid goods. But many of those suffering from late payments contribute to their problems, by failing to sort out the payment details beforehand. 'Small businesses are their own worst enemies. They are so pleased to get the order that they don't bother to ask about the nitty gritty,' Dr Juby says. Small business make up a large chunk of the trading community: 97 per cent of Britain's businesses employ fewer than 20 people, 91 per cent employ less than 10 people and 61 per cent have one or two staff. With such limited resources many lack the time or money to bring legal action to collect money owed them. And although right to interest on overdue payments exists if specified in the original sale contract or awarded in court, it can be difficult and expensive to collect the money.</p>

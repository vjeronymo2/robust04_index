			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Continuing its coverage of the Winter Games in Olympics Today (6.00), BBC2 expects to be showing aspects of the men's luge (ie toboganning), the women's 500m speed skating, and the men's Nordic ski-ing in which there is a good chance, it seems, of 16-year-old Toni Nieminen from Finland taking the gold. BBC2 devotes nearly four hours to a live broadcast of Don Giovanni from Covent Garden. Johannes Schaaf's new production is conducted by Bernard Haitink in the presence of the Queen. Thomas Allen sings Giovanni with Claudio Desderi as Leporello, Carol Vaness as Donna Anna and Hans Peter Blochwitz as Don Ottavio (6.50). A new American comedy series, Evening Shade, is launched on Channel 4 with a special 60-minute episode. Burt Reynolds plays Wood Newton, a former pro-footballer who returns to his home town to coach the local team. He won the 1991 Emmy for Best Comedy Actor in this, his first sitcom (8.30). ITV's light drama, El CID, set on the 'Costa del Crime', will cause exclamations of amazement when it is repeated in 2002 because of the quality of its cast, tonight John Bird, Tony Haygarth, Denis Lawson and more (9.00).</p>

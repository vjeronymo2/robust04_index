			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: 'Foul play' to stress delay of Channel Tunnel opening Sir, Appeals to financial editors for fair play face an uncertain fate, but the treatment last week of the Channel Tunnel opening date casts real doubt on the 'rules' by which financial editors like to tell us the game should be played. Companies are exhorted to keep information flowing through the financial columns to investors and shareholders in the eminently justifiable interest of a fair market. In October 1987, Eurotunnel issued a prospectus based on an opening date of May 15 1993. With early tunnelling well behind schedule, Eurotunnel as client conceded June 15 1993 to TML, the turnkey contractor. This remained the best estimate until early 1992 and is still the target date in the only programme to which TML has bound itself. As everyone knows, TML made up the time lost in early tunnelling and finished a few days early in June 1991. Sadly, TML's fitting out of the tunnels and terminals under a fixed price contract has not gone well. As a result, by early 1992 it was apparent that June 1993 could not be met. Accordingly, a Eurotunnel press release on February 10 1992 said: 'The tunnel should be able to open at the end of summer 1993', and our preliminary annual report on April 24 this year said: 'Eurotunnel remains confident that the system can be opened for commercial services no later than the fourth quarter of 1993. . .' During the summer we have used 'autumn 1993' in conversations with journalists and in brochures, even in paid advertisements in the Financial Times and elsewhere. We have also used 'fourth quarter 1993' in many briefings. We have met every possible demand from any financial editor for up-to-date clarity. Hence you must surely agree that when we sharpen our 'fourth quarter 1993' into 'December 15 1993', it was foul play to place almost universal emphasis on news of six or seven months of delay in your reporting of our half-year statement ('Eurotunnel shares hit by delay warning', October 6). The FT started with 'the announcement of a seven month delay'. The Telegraph, Express, Independent and some TV reports were similar; The Times' headline was 'tunnel will open six months late'. If editors campaign for up-to-date information, editors have a responsibility to keep pace with it and not - in haste or malice - dig out long-superseded information for use without any qualifying description. As I write, our share price has recovered a third of the 60p or so it lost early this week. Were some sellers misled by the media?

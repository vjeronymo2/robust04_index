			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: US legal system not consulted by 40% of low earners - Legal briefs Each year roughly half of low and moderate income households in the US face a legal problem but most of them do not consult a lawyer or turn to the civil justice system. According to the National Law Journal, a US legal magazine, a survey commissioned by the American Bar Association discovered that more than 40 per cent of households in both income groups attempted to resolve problems on their own, while 38 per cent of the low-income households did nothing at all. Asked why they took no action, respondents said they 'thought nothing could be done'. The most common reason given by respondents for not consulting a lawyer or using the civil justice system was they 'did not think it would help'. In 71 per cent of cases where a legal need was identified by low-income households and 61 per cent in middle-income households, the civil justice system had not been involved. Most common legal problems were debt and consumer issues; housing; personal injury; and family and domestic relations. Mr R William, ABA president, said the inability to resolve such problems simply because Americans did not have access to appropriate help was 'a national tragedy'.</p>

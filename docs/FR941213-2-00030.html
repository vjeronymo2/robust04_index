It is essential that the research be conducted at a public, urban teaching hospital affiliated with a comprehensive medical school and research center with an active electron beam program and documentable experience in operating a functional machine. In recent years, the practice of handling medical infectious waste by incineration or autoclaving has resulted in public controversies in terms of environmental and public health issues. Irradiation of medical infectious waste by electrons might provide an environmentally safe and publically acceptable method for disposing of this waste. Applications should also address: (a) Monitoring and validating the treatment efficacy; (b) pre-irradiation processing of waste, and (c) economic feasibility of this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are encouraged to submit a brief preapplication, in accordance with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2), which consists of two to three pages of narrative describing research objectives and methods of accomplishment. The preapplications will be reviewed relative to the scope and research needs for the commercial exploitation of electron irradiation technology for medical waste disposal. Preapplications referencing program Notice 95&hyph;08 should be received by January 1, 1995, and sent to Dr. Matesh N. Varma, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301)903&hyph;3209. Telephone and telefax numbers are required to be a part of the preapplication. A response to the preapplications discussing potential relevance of a formal application will be communicated by January 15, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Formal applications submitted in response to this notice must be received by 4:30 p.m., E.S.T., March 8, 1995, to be accepted for a May review and to permit timely consideration for award in Fiscal Year 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Formal applications referencing Program Notice 95&hyph;08 should be forwarded to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, (GTN), Washington, D.C. 20585.

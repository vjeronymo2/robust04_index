			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Northern Ireland bucks downward trend in demand DEMAND fell across all parts of the UK except Northern Ireland over the past four months, according to the latest regional trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies Limited. The biggest falls in demand occurred in the south-west and the Yorkshire and Humberside areas. Only the east Midlands, East Anglia and Northern Ireland reported a small rise in output. The outlook is brightest in the north of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where orders and output are expected to stabilise in the months ahead. The figures show the difference between those companies reporting an increase in orders over the four months to July and those reporting a decrease. The resulting percentage point balance gives a good indication of the trend in orders. North of England New orders balance: - 1 Conditions are slightly more optimistic than elsewhere in the country. Although home and export orders were flat over the past four months, both are now expected to increase. The decline in output and employment slowed while business confidence continued to increase. The proportion of firms working below capacity was lower than elsewhere in the UK. Yorkshire and Humberside: New orders balance: - 29 A sharp decline in demand for intermediate products - particularly chemicals and metals - affected the region badly. Yorkshire and Humberside was among the regions most disappointed by the volume of orders received over the past four months compared with expectations in April. Business confidence has fallen sharply and demand and output are expected to remain flat over the next four months. East Midlands: New orders balance: - 6 Fared better than other regions over the past four months, with a small increase in output, resulting in a slowdown in the rate of job losses. However, business optimism has fallen sharply and uncertainty over demand is constraining many firms from investing more. East Anglia: New orders balance: - 7 One of the few regions to report a small rise in output over the past four months, but that rise is now expected to be reversed. Although optimism about exports has stabilised, general business confidence has fallen. London and south-east: New orders balance: - 19 Demand for domestic goods fell over the past four months, but held up for exports. The decline in output accelerated and the proportion of companies working below capacity was one of the highest in the country. Redundancies have slowed slightly. South-west: New orders balance: - 33 Exports failed to live up to April's expectations with the result that demand and business confidence fell sharply over the past four months. The proportion of firms working below capacity is now higher than in any other region, and that has led to heavy job losses. Investment intentions weakened slightly. West Midlands: New orders balance: - 19 One of four regions where employment is falling the fastest. However, the fall in output was no longer steeper than that elsewhere in the country. Business confidence was unchanged and a small rise in production is expected. Investment plans indicate a fall in spending on buildings, but spending on plant and machinery should now stabilise. North-west: New orders balance: - 16 In spite of a fall in orders and optimism over the past four months, export and total orders are expected to increase. Job losses are still heavy and show little sign of easing off. Investment is expected to decline at a faster rate. Wales: New orders balance: - 2 Export demand remained buoyant and the outlook is brighter than elsewhere. Output levels have remained stable since the beginning of the year - although sales fell slightly over the past four months. Overseas sales and home orders are expected to rise, so total orders and output levels may increase. Scotland: New orders balance: - 14 Along with the north of England, Scotland continues to be least badly affected by the recession. Business optimism has been maintained in spite of a continuing decline in orders and output. Both are expected to fall again in the next four months. However, export orders - which showed a small increase over the past four months - are expected to rise again. Capacity utilisation remains low and the outlook for investment in buildings, plant and machinery is poor. Northern Ireland: New orders balance: +31 The outlook in Northern Ireland is rosier than anywhere else in the UK. Orders rose for the first time for two years because of stronger domestic demand. Business confidence grew as companies increased production levels in response to rising demand over the past four months. Investment intentions have risen and firms now expect to spend more on plant and machinery in the next 12 months.</p>

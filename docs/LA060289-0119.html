			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY 3-A BASEBALL FINAL;  </P> <P> CHO'S 2-OUT SINGLE IN EIGHTH GIVES FRANKLIN A 3-2 WIN  </P> <P> Hyung Cho's run-scoring single with two out in the bottom of the eighth inning  gave Franklin a 3-2 victory over Bell in the City 3-A baseball championship  game Thursday night at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> It was the first City baseball title for Franklin (18-4), which had tied the  score, 2-2, with two unearned runs in the sixth inning.  </P> <P> Errors also played a part in Franklin's run in the eighth, when Bell's second  baseman, Adolfo Estrada, muffed Andy Aguilar's grounder with two out. Aguilar  advanced to second on the play as Estrada's throw went past Carlos Rodriguez at  first base.  </P> <P> Cho, Franklin's designated hitter who was hitless in three previous at-bats,  then lined the game-winning hit over Rodriguez.  </P> <P> "I was looking for a fastball down and in and that is what I got," Cho said. "I  was frustrated after blowing the first (three) opportunities."  </P> <P> Bell (30-6) was in control early, scoring one run in the second inning and  another in the fourth. The first run scored when Noe Landeros singled in  Rodriguez from second base.  </P> <P> Bell's second run came with the help of two errors. Javier Lopez stole second  after reaching base on an error by shortstop Chad Infranca. Lopez then came all  the way home when Estrada grounded to the shortstop, whose throw got by  Aguilar, the first baseman.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bell starting pitcher John Rogers gave up only one hit through the  first five innings and faced only one jam, a two-out bases-loaded situation in  the third.  </P> <P> But in the sixth, Franklin starting pitcher Sergio Galvez reached base on an  error by shortstop Rene Lopez and moved to second on Infranca's single. Galvez  scored one out later when he stole third and came home as the throw got by the  third baseman.  </P> <P> Aguilar followed with a single to right, scoring Infranca with Franklin's  second run.  </P> <P> Galvez gave up only two hits and one earned run in six innings. Phil Arreola,  who relieved Galvez in the seventh, was credited with the victory. He struck  out four and gave up only one hit.  </P> <P> "The first four innings were very sloppy for us," Franklin Coach Rick Campbell  said. "Galvez has carried us many times all year, and he came through today."  </P> <P> Bell, which was playing in its third consecutive City championship game, ended  the season 30-6.  </P></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Palestinian negotiators angered by expulsions: Israeli action jeopardises resumption of Middle East peace talks ANGRY Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories yesterday suspended plans to travel to Washington for next week's scheduled resumption of Middle East peace talks in protest over Israel's decision to deport 12 Palestinian activists. The US was quick to condemn the Israeli action. 'We have urged Israel at the highest levels to reconsider and rescind its decision,' said Mr Richard Boucher, a State Department official. 'We believe deportations are a form of retaliation and are not a remedy, nor are they a deterrent to violence.' In Jerusalem, Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, said US pressure would not persuade Israel to go back on its decision , while Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the premier, played down criticism of the deportations. 'I think everyone in the world understands that Israel is doing these things only when things reach a boiling point,' he said. In Jerusalem, a meeting of top Palestinian negotiators, led by Mr Faisal Husseini, stopped short of breaking off the Middle East peace talks, leaving a final decision to the exiled PLO leadership meeting last night in Tunis. Mr Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the PLO's chief spokesman, said in Tunis the talks could be in jeopardy unless the US and UN acted to force Israel to rescind the deportations. But later Mr Bassam Abu Sharif, an aide to PLO leader Yassir Arafat, said he believed the Palestinians would finally agree to attend. Palestinian delegates at yesterday's meeting in Jerusalem, the principal Palestinian representatives to the talks, were less sanguine. They said there was a growing feeling that a recent series of actions by the Israelis, culminating in the deportations, made their continued participation in the Mr Sari Nusseibeh, the delegation's chief strategist, said: 'The feeling was that we can't go on with this decision in the background.' Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian segment of the joint Jordanian-Palestinian team, said: 'We cannot negotiate while such conditions prevail.' The Palestinian delegation desperately wants some early tangible return from the peace process - such as a freeze on further settlements - to show the talks are worth pursuing. Two rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid and Washington have yielded nothing, in Palestinian eyes. US officials sought yesterday to persuade Palestinians that abandoning the talks would play into the hands of the hardline Israeli government. A Palestinian was killed and two Israeli soldiers were wounded in an armed clash in the occupied West Bank yesterday. The incident came after the bodies of three suspected Arab informers, apparently killed by Palestinian militants, were found in the occupied territories.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Sanchez de Lozada last night confirmed the  police action against the main group of hunger strikers, and  warned that the government will no longer negotiate with the COB  [Bolivian Labor Federation] if pressure measures continue.    During a phone conversation with the HATA news agency,  Sanchez de Lozada said the government is determined not to  negotiate under any form of pressure. We can immediately hold  negotiations as proposed by COB leaders but without pressure. He  said this shortly after police forces entered COB's La Paz  headquarters and took to the police clinic -- other report  mentions the (Dengel) clinic, which we will confirm in the next  few minutes -- the six hunger strikers, including the three La  Paz teachers led by Wilma Plata.    Sanchez de Lozada said: We adopted this decision because we  cannot let them die. This is an intolerable situation and we  have the mission to preserve the life and health of the  citizens, in keeping with the Constitution.    He said the police action was carried out against the hunger  strikers at COB headquarters because they were facing the most  critical situation. He added that the government will take a  firm stand tonight and will not allow the COB and peasant  federation to carry out the roadblocks scheduled to begin on 28  April.    Sanchez de Lozada said: We will not tolerate any roadblocks.  We will take firm and responsible actions. He urged workers  leaders to give up their intransigent attitude and hold  negotiations.    During a news conference in La Paz at 2330 last night, the  government confirmed the police operation and issued a  communique, the main topics of which are:    1) The six hunger strikers were taken to a local clinic  following a judge's order. This measure was adopted to protect  their lives.    2) The government as always is willing to continue holding  negotiations with the COB in an atmosphere of mutual  understanding. To this end all forms of pressure must be lifted.    During the news conference, Social Communications Minister  Ernesto Machicado, Justice Minister Rene Blattman, and Labor  Minister Reynaldo Peters pointed out that government officials  only seek to preserve the citizens' lives and [words indistinct]  in Bolivian territory.    Blattman said: The government has termed it absolutely  necessary to protect the human being, the health and security of  people. We took action in the face of a true emergency situation.    Peters stressed the need to lift all forms of pressure to  allow negotiations between the COB and the government. We think  COB leaders must reflect and bear in mind higher interests. We  can create true conditions for peace in Bolivia only under  democracy and with lives placed at the interest of the Republic.    He said the government has no official information on a  Catholic Church initiative in the situation.    As for the 27 people arrested during the violent  demonstration staged on 22 April, the ministers said they will  be placed at the disposal of the court on charges of aggression  and robbery.    The ministers stated that this is not a form of pressure. It  was adopted to preserve people's security and prevent attacks  against their property.    They regretted the COB's demand to release them because a  crime must be punished in compliance with the law. They  concluded by saying the government is firmly determined to  guarantee social peace.</p>

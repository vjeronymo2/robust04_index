			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gilts may be boring, but they have an edge INDEX-LINKED gilts are often dismissed by stock market professionals as unexciting investments. But those planning for their retirement should find a niche for them in their portfolios. The capital value of such a gilt will be repaid on maturity in line with the increase in the Retail Price Index over the lifetime of the bond. The coupon, initially set at either 2 or 2.5 per cent of the original face value is also increased in line with inflation. At the moment, the trading price of index-linked gilts lags behind their repayment price, and as a result the real yield on offer is around 4 per cent, provided you hold the bond till maturity and assuming inflation averages 5 per cent. That is a very respectable return by historical standards. Most personal pensions are invested in equity-based funds, on the grounds that equities are the best vehicle for long-term growth. The real returns from shares are good but variable. Figures from Barclays de Zoete Wedd show that the real return on equities between 1968 and 1990 was just 4.2 per cent a year, although it was as much as 14.1 per cent between 1974 and 1990. But the BZW figures only show the returns available if you match the index. Most fund managers do not do so. Take for comparison, the BZW figures for the ten years to end 1990, which show growth with income reinvested of 395 per cent. The average UK equity general unit trust rose by 365 per cent over the same period, on an offer-to-bid basis. On an annual basis, that means the return was around 1 per cent lower than provided by the index. The average UK balanced trust underperformed by around 2 per cent a year. Assume, for argument's sake, that a conventional personal pension will underperform the index by 1.5 per cent a year. Then for an equity-based personal pension to beat an index-linked gilt, where the real return is effectively guaranteed, equities need to produce a real return of 5.5 per cent a year. The startling result from the BZW figures is that in 13 of the 26 20-year periods since the Second World War (1945-65, 1946-66 etc) equities have failed to produce a real return of more than 5.5 per cent. Those figures make index-linked gilts look a better bet. Some managers will allow you to set up your own personal plan, saving on commissions and financial adviser's fees. You can invest in index-linked gilts directly and as with a conventional personal pension, such investment will be tax deductible and gains within the fund will be tax-free. Index-linked gilts are not the perfect answer for everybody, or for all your long-term savings. But investing in index-linked for your retirement would save you from several worries: your pension fund is guaranteed to outpace inflation, you cannot be let down by a poorly performing fund, you cannot suffer from a plunge in the stock market, your credit risk - the government - is unimpeachable.</p>

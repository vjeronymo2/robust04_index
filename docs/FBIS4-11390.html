			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Noelia Villalba in Yataity del </F> Norte, San Pedro Department]    [Text] Yesterday during a meeting in Yataity del Norte,  peasant leaders from the entire country decided to join a  nationwide strike scheduled for 2 May. The peasants will  reportedly stage marches and block roads throughout the interior  of the country.    During their six-hour meeting, about 20 peasant leaders from  all the national peasant organizations decided to join a general  strike called by the United Workers Trade Union, the Paraguayan  Confederation of Workers, and the National Workers Federation  for 2 May.    Peasants from the interior of the country will join the  general strike to express their rejection of the government's  neoliberal policy, their repudiation of corruption and social  injustices, and their support for peasant demands.    The peasants will express their solidarity with a great  rally  sponsored by the National Peasant Organization (ONAC). The  rally will be staged at the Heroes Square in the town of Coronel  Oviedo. The peasants will march from Heroes Square to the  international highway intersection at Coronel Oviedo where they  will decide whether to block the crossroads there.    Other roads in various parts of the country will also be  blocked. The Coordinating Board of Landless People [Coordinacion  de Sin Tierras] will block roads in the towns of Union, Maria  Auxiliadora, and Sanguina Cue. The peasants organizations in  San Pedro will block traffic in Tacuara. The Paraguayan Peasant  Movement branch in Limoy will block the "superhighway" at 10  points. The Chaco Communities Coordinating Board [Coordinacion  Intercomunitaria del Chaco] will block traffic on the Transchaco  Highway. Local peasant organizations will stage another rally  at the 234 Square in Curuguaty.    After long discussions, the peasant commission that is  participating in negotiations with the Social Development  Council decided to walk out because problems are not being  solved. Estanislao Martinez, a peasants coordinator, explained:  "We walked out of the negotiations with the government because  the government officials asked us not to implement any pressure  measures and because the government refused to respond to our  petition for compensation for the bad quality seeds distributed  among peasants." Another point raised by the peasants to support  their walk out from the negotiations involved the incorrect  management of 3.8 billion guaranies that Paraguayan Cotton  Chamber made available to the Ministry of Agriculture and  Livestock to resolve peasants problems.    Finally, it was decided to ask the appropriate government  officials to clearly determine how Esteban Balbuena, the  National Peasant Federation (FNC) Environment and Ecology  secretary, died. Balbuena was found dead on 19 April in Itapua  Department. He was in a pickup truck with a bullet lodged in  his body.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Channel tunnel losses set at Pounds 12m BICC yesterday became the first British contractor to announce provisions to cover potential losses on the Channel tunnel project which has risen in cost since 1987 from Pounds 4.7bn (Dollars 8.27bn) to more than Pounds 8bn. The group said it had made a provision of Pounds 12m against work already completed. The amounts were, however, covered by claims against Eurotunnel. Contractors are claiming more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices to cover the increased costs of building, whether completed or still outstanding. They say costs have risen because of design changes introduced by Eurotunnel. Mr Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, yesterday described talks between the contractors and Eurotunnel as 'frosty'. Contractors say that by mid-summer they will have insufficient cash flow to carry on with construction. Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French companies contracted to design and build the project, has threatened to halt work unless it is paid sufficient to cover at least the cost of the works. BICC's provision is in line with its 10 per cent stake in TML which made a total provision of Pounds 115m in its accounts for last year to cover work so far. Other British members of the consortium - Costain, Wimpey, Tarmac and Taylor Woodrow - are expected to reveal similar provisions in their annual results in the next few weeks. None of the five French construction companies in TML has identified provisions for tunnel losses. However, Bouygues, Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, Spie Batignolles, SGE and SAE, have privately indicated to stockbroking analysts that they have provided for between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m each for last year.

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Beirut church bomb kills 10 Ten Lebanese Christians were killed and at least 60 wounded yesterday when a bomb exploded during Mass at the Sayyidet Al Najat Maronite church at Zouk, north of Beirut. It was the second bomb to be aimed at Lebanese Christians in the past two months. In December, a car bomb exploded outside the Phalange party headquarters, killing three and injuring more than 130. Witnesses said dozens of people were taking Communion when the 82mm mortar bombs exploded. They had been placed by the first row of pews. The priest, Father Antoine Sfeir, was seriously wounded in the blast. No group claimed to have carried out yesterday's attack and Beirut was rife with speculation over what the perpetrators' motive may have been. Many Lebanese linked the killing to the massacre at Hebron in the West Bank on Friday, when 43 Palestinians were gunned down by a Jewish settler while praying at a mosque. A former prime minister, Mr Salem Al Hoss, said: 'The link with the Hebron tragedy is suspect, yet inevitable. It is beyond me why anyone would respond this way.' However, Mr Michel Samaha, Lebanese minister of information, suggested that the bomb might have been an act of protest against Pope John Paul's proposed visit to Lebanon at the end of May. 'It could be aimed against the pope's visit, and we hope it was not carried out by those who were against this visit,' Mr Samaha said. He also pointed his finger at Israel, saying it was an attempt to divert international attention from the Hebron massacre. Several of Lebanon's Moslem fundamentalist groups have condemned the pope's plans to visit the Middle East, which will include stops in Lebanon and Israel. But a diplomat in Beirut said it was more likely that the bomb was the result of a dispute among the Lebanese Christians themselves. The pope, speaking in St. Peter's Square in Rome yesterday, denounced the bombing. Referring to Lebanon's 17-year civil war, between 1975 and 1992, he said: 'That country has already suffered too much.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the bombing as an 'outrage' and said the extremists who committed the act were promoting division and war. Meanwhile, in south Lebanon, clashes between the Israeli army and its south Lebanon army allies, and pro-Iranian and Palestinian resistance, erupted intermittently throughout the day. The SLA said it had killed four guerrillas. One SLA militia man was seriously wounded, and died in an Israeli hospital.</p>

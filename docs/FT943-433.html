			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Leading Article: An end to the rail strike Strikes are a no-win proposition in any industry. Once begun, however, the rule for ending them is that everyone must emerge a winner. Yesterday's welcome end to the rail signalworkers' dispute was no exception, with the three main players all claiming victory. In truth, the battle has cost both union and management dear. And the government for its part has no cause for self-congratulation. For the chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British Rail's track and signalling operations, the deal agreed with the signalworkers' union in the early hours of yesterday morning was a 'victory for commonsense'. For Mr Jimmy Knapp, union leader for the striking signalworkers, it was his members' persistence that had won the day. The package, like the dispute itself, is complicated enough for each claim to have some merit. In the long term, Railtrack has won most, perhaps, in achieving the much-needed reform of signalworkers' pay and conditions. The workers are receiving less in return than the RMT first demanded, but can claim to have delivered, by striking, an 8 per cent rise in average earnings, if only for the current year. Whatever the immediate tally of gains and losses, the entire industry will suffer the effects of the dispute for years to come. Customers have had four months to discover alternatives to rail transport; demand may never fully recover. Less appetising That, and the Pounds 200m losses suffered by the rail operating companies, will make rail franchises a considerably less appetising prospect for private investors than previously hoped. Clearly, things could have been worse. Had the dispute continued into next week, striking signalworkers stood to lose valuable pension rights from October 1 onwards. As far as Railtrack is concerned, restructuring of working practice has always been an essential first step in building a modern and profitable national rail network. Disputes about implementation had already been simmering for seven years: allowing them to boil over later, when privatisation was already in full swing, would doubtless have been even more damaging. Yet things could also have gone far better, had it not been for the government's ill-judged interventions. In fact, the dispute could have ended in early June, when both sides agreed a package, which Railtrack was subsequently forced to retract. A private company would always have chosen an early end to the dispute, offering larger pay increases and recouping the extra cost with further efficiency gains once employees were back at work. British Rail had not been able to do this. Allowing BR's successor to strike such a deal at the beginning of the summer would have vividly made the government's own case for rail privatisation. Problem-laden But rather than using it as a test of its rail privatisation plans, the government instead chose to view the affair as a test of its problem-laden approach to constraining public sector pay. The government claims that the agreed package for the signalworkers conforms to the two central requirements which that policy imposes. The 3.7 per cent addition to Railtrack's paybill pays for itself in efficiency gains, while the basic 2.5 per cent pay increase is well within standards set earlier in the year by pay rises in the rest of British Rail and elsewhere in the public sector. Deals which appeared to deliver much larger 'headline' pay increases to individual workers could not be accepted by the government for fear of the lessons which other public sector workers might draw. But this merely shows how difficult it is for the government to combine its desire to broaden the scope for a more flexible approach to individual public sector pay agreements with the blunt instrument of its three-year freeze on public sector pay bills overall. Holding down public sector labour costs is central to the chancellor's medium-term fiscal strategy. The post mortems on this sorry dispute will drag on. But the chancellor has not been helped by being involved, even if indirectly, in a needlessly drawn-out and unpopular strike.</p>

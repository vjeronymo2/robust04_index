			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): Technology on the march - The progress made by electronic brokerage To the untrained eye the change is indiscernible, but in dealing rooms across the world, electronic brokerage is slowly becoming part of the foreign exchange landscape. The fondly nurtured stereotype of brokers, resplendent in loud braces, bawling down telephones as they barrel vast sums of money around the world is not under serious threat. But the trading desks of large banks are increasingly acquiring automated dealing systems which simulate the services offered by traditional voice brokers. It is early days yet, and the market share of electronic brokerage is still very small. It also remains to be seen whether there is space in the market for the existing three operators. But there is a clear sense of technology on the march, with no compelling reason why the broking community should prove immune to change. The most significant recent development was the launch last September of the Electronic Broking Service (EBS), a system backed by 13 leading banks in foreign exchange. This followed on the earlier launch of two other electronic broking systems: Dow Jones Telerate launched the Minex system in April 1993, and the launch in May 1992 by Reuters of the 2000-2 dealing system. EBS's origins were essentially defensive, with the banks anxious to prevent Reuters assuming such a dominant market position that it would be able to influence the way in which the market functions. It already had a strong hold on the foreign exchange markets with about 50 per cent of global foreign exchange turnover transacted through its main dealing systems, Reuters 2000-1 and Reuters Monitor. Although EBS was essentially set up in opposition to Reuters, the real competition lies with the voice broking community. Brokerage still plays an important part in currency dealing. At the time EBS was conceived, and electronic brokerage is too immature for these figures to have changed substantially, roughly 60 per cent of deals in the currency market were done by traders in two banks - or counterparties - who call each other up directly. The remainder were done by brokers who bring together buyers and sellers. Figures released by EBS suggest it is making solid progress. It is now starting to achieve consistently more than 2,000 trades a day. For the week ended May 6, most trades (59 per cent) were in the Dollars /DM cross, with other good performers being DM/Swiss franc and DM/French franc. The number of users has also increased to 188 bank branches in 18 cities. Since January, 48 new counterparties have been added, and only 10 of these are branches of the 13 EBS partnership banks. EBS is keen to resist the idea that it exists only because it can attract captive business from its shareholders. It notes that partner banks now represent less than 50 per cent of total users on the system. Reuters, meanwhile, announced recently that it had passed the 5,000 matches/day mark on the 2000-2 system. It is found in about 550 bank branches, and Portugal will soon become the 22nd country where 2000-2 systems are used. Minex has a strong position in Asia and claims to transact 6 per cent of the daily broker turnover in dollar/yen in Tokyo. The voice broking community claims that the influence of electronic broking has so far been negligible. Indeed, one leading broker says that in the case of the D-Mark/franc pair, 'we have found since they established themselves, our turnover has gone up as well'. He concedes that the effect would be different in a more established currency pair, such as dollar/D-Mark. Although electronic brokerage systems claim that they can cut brokerage costs, brokers argue that currency dealers are more concerned with generating turnover than controlling overheads. Brokers also believe the human factor should not be underestimated. 'A computer can't take you out for a drink after work,' quips one. Some critics have wondered whether bank dealers would use EBS were it not for the fact that they have a stake in the system. Users, however, are adamant this is not the case. Tim Broome, assistant director at Barclays global foreign exchange, comments: 'EBS on our dealing floor currently stands on its own merits.' Mr Bartko is confident that EBS is succeeding in terms of the key criterion that determines the success of a broker: the liquidity it generates. This, in turn, is a function of having prices to quote, to a critical mass of counterparties. He argues that EBS has generated liquidity which people are prepared to pay to have access to. This is particularly so in the dollar/D-Mark, D-Mark/Swiss Franc and D-Mark/French franc crosses. EBS has been less successful in generating liquidity in the other five currency pairs it offers. Mr Bartko says he is at a loss to explain why some currency pairs have succeeded better than others. Traders are generally quite complimentary about EBS, with two caveats. First, younger traders tend to be more receptive to the new technology than older ones. Indeed, many in the market cite the cultural challenge of asking people to change deep-seated work habits as the most serious challenge facing electronic broking. Second, EBS is used more in quiet markets. In heavy trading, the inclination is still to revert to habit and trade on established systems, or with voice brokers. One early division between EBS and Reuters is that the former, understandably given its backers, has a dominant position among the large banks in the interbank market, while Reuters has a strong position among their counterparties, especially the retail market banks. 'They have got the market-makers and we have got the hitters,' says Bob Etherington, international marketing manager at Reuters. Naturally enough, both EBS and Reuters claim that they are making inroads on the other's market. Certainly, there are examples of banks who use more than one of the electronic systems.</p>

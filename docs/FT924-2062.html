			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Saab sucks it to 'em Tossing modesty to the winds, Swedish car maker Saab is claiming that its latest cars are so environmentally 'correct' that the exhaust gases going out can be cleaner than the air going in. It says that this result was achieved during tests conducted in the City of London by the government's Warren Springs environmental research laboratory. The electronic exhaust technology used in the latest Saab cars produced fewer smog-causing nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons than was found in the air monitored at the engine intake. But before the green lobby starts gratefully to disband it should realise that the war is by no means won. Saab is not to start marketing its new cars as environmental vacuum cleaners, because, of course, all is not as wonderful as it sounds. Since fewer than a tenth of vehicles in the UK are fitted with catalytic converters, the car in front of the Saab would more than likely have been cheerfully belching the nasty stuff directly into the Swedish car's engine. So, puffed with pride though Saab may be, it is still only converting the very dirty to the merely dirty.</p>

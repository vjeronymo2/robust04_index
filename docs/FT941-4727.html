			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Search for peace faces long hard haul: Early hopes for an Ulster settlement are bogged down in political diversions British and Irish ministers will meet in London today anxious to demonstrate publicly that there will be no slacking in the search for peace in Northern Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they may face a long hard haul. The window of opportunity, opened with December's historic Downing Street declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace have become bogged down in political diversions which threaten to derail the two governments' initiative. For London and Dublin, the challenge is to keep the show on the road, to build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two governments and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be sidetracked by sub-plots. It is not going to be easy. The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the province's political parties to compromise. On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the province's main political parties - headed by the Ulster Unionists (mindful of the need to protect their flank against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionists) - are already adopting a markedly more aggressive tone in discussing the prospects for a settlement. It is the season for retreating into entrenched positions. London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute awareness of the Ulster calendar'. In addition, the lengthening silence from Sinn Fein is increasingly being seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to the declaration. A surprise acceptance has not been completely ruled out and any positive initiative by republican leaders could produce another twist in the political game now being played out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein which will enable any significant headway to be made this side of Euro-polling day on June 9. Not surprisingly, both governments are accordingly playing down expectations for today's session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on strand two of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the north. This, by common consent, is the most difficult - or as one participant puts it, the most intellectually challenging - circle the talks process will have to square. As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will cause all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly do the same again in the future.' Today's meeting will take stock of the position, in effect already done at last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on the way ahead. But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made, making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering momentum. Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare which surrounded the Downing Street declaration. But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever, the intervening two months has done nothing to undermine the quiet determination in London and Dublin to finish what they started in September.</p>

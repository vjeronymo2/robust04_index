			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq talks failure boosts oil OIL PRICES got a boost yesterday after talks in New York between the United Nations and Iraq on the sale of up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil failed. Brent Blend for November delivery was 13 cents higher in London at Dollars 17.24 a barrel. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, a director at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, said the Iraqi decision to call off the talks 'removed a bearish cloud' from the markets and was likely to 'eliminate caution from the bulls'. The prospect of Iraq's early re-entry into international oil markets has been a factor behind recent low oil prices. It has also unsettled the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last week said it would call an emergency meeting if Iraq's talks with the UN were successful. The Iraqi decision was conveyed during a meeting between Mr Mohamed al-Sahaf, the foreign minister, and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general. Officials said the Iraqis were evidently not interested in the one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil, the amount set in a Security Council resolution two years ago and the subject of exhaustive negotiations. Their aim now was the total lifting of sanctions in return for their compliance with all the conditions set by the council in its ceasefire resolution.</p>

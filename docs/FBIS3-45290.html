He Zhiqiang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor, addressed the meeting.    He Zhiqiang first briefed the meeting participants on the  progress in the three reforms in the province. He said:  According to the plan formulated by the central party  authorities and the State Council, personnel departments and  bureaus at all levels, in close cooperation with departments  concerned, have done a great deal of work in regard to  organizational reform, the reform to introduce the civil service  system, and the reform of the wage and salary system. These  reforms have now been started in this province. So far the  number of provincial-level organizations has been reduced from  78 to 54, a decrease of 30 percent; the number of organs that  form the provincial government has been reduced from 46 to 36;  some government organs have been turned into business entities;  and remarkable results have been scored.    He Zhiqiang demanded that the three reforms be carried on  steadily and properly. He said: As far as organizational  reform is concerned, the general target is that reform of party  and government organs at all levels should be accomplished in  the first half of this year; as for the organizational reform  for prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party  committees, pilot projects will be conducted in the first half  of this year, and the reform will be gradually expanded on a  larger scale in the second half of the year and be completed in  the first half of next year; the organizational reform at the  county level will be widely launched after the Spring Festival,  and will be accomplished in the first half of next year; while  the organizational reform at the township and town level will be  carried out according to documents issued by the provincial  party committee. Wherever it is possible to speed up the  reform, the authorities concerned should try to accomplish it  ahead of schedule.    With regard to the civil service system, the operation  should  be carried out in accordance with the central party authorities  and the State Council's plan concerning the civil service system  and the provincial authorities' proposal on specific, relevant  arrangements. In the process of implementation, for those parts  of the civil service-related reform which cannot go on without  organizational reform, pilot projects must be launched before  the reform proper is fully started. All executive organs that  have completed the three fixing procedures [fixing of the  organizational structure, post- specific duties and functions,  and staff size] must promptly introduce some practices of the  civil service system, such as establishment of posts, the  personnel transition process, personnel appointments, and  assignment of positions to ensure that the new system will soon  operate along the new track. The province must strive to finish  establishing the civil service system in three years.    With regard to reform of the wage and salary system, He  Zhiqiang said: The current wage and salary system reform is to  meet the needs of the market economy structure and is for the  purpose of deepening the reform of the personnel system. Every  effort has been made to ensure that consideration is given to  every aspect of the interests of professional and technical  personnel, retired personnel, persons with honorary posts,  demobilized servicemen, those who are laid off in the wake of  the organizational reform, and grassroots staff. All localities  must follow nationwide standardized regulations governing the  wage and salary system, pay policy, and the pay scale. No  locality may arbitrarily change the practices under any pretext  of special local needs. It is required that all localities  shall carry out the package reform strictly according to the  policy. Specific remaining problems will be cautiously dealt  with after investigations and study.    In order to accomplish the three reforms, He Zhiqiang urged  party committees and governments at all levels to set great  store by and intensify leadership, personnel departments at all  levels to do a meticulous job in implementing the operation, and  departments concerned to give strong support to them, to  cooperate closely with them, and to work hard on their part to  accomplish the reforms.    During yesterday's meeting, provincial personnel department  director Li Mingyou delivered a report entitled: Advance Our  Province's Personnel Work to a New Stage With the Three Reforms  as the Key Links.</p>

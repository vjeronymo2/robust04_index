			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: The purest painter of them all - William Packer admires the later work of Pierre Bonnard Pierre Bonnard, with a handful of his more-or-less contemporaries - Matisse and Picasso of course, Beckmann, Mondrian and one or two others  - is one of the truly great painters of the 20th century. What makes him remarkable within this elite is his quality as the purest painter of them all. That is not to say that he was not an exquisite draughtsman, but even in this respect we find him suggesting, teasing the image out of a delicate flurry of marks, rather than fixing and delineating it in more conventional graphic fashion. If his drawing is so painterly, how much more so is his painting itself. For while with Picasso and Matisse, for example, we will always find a quality of drawing in the painting - that is to say in the linear statement of an image which only then is painted - with Bonnard the paint on the surface is the image, the image a confection of stroke against stroke, colour against colour, with whatever line there is growing from this process. The irony is that it was as a graphic artist that Bonnard first made his reputation in his Nabis youth in the 1890s. But here again it is in the broader disposition of pattern, tone or colour, mass against mass, flat on the surface, that we find the distinguishing character of the work. Even in the work of his old age, and especially in the domestic interiors and table-top still-lifes, with their frontal, horizontal and vertical emphases, and their exploitation of doors and windows, mirror frame and table edge, we may discover echoes of those same youthful, sophisticated graphic tricks. It is this work of his old age which provides the substance of the small, beautifully judged and visually ravishing exhibition that now fills the Hayward's upper galleries. Bonnard had been visiting and working in the south of France since the early years of the century. In the spring of 1926, at the age of 58, having decided at last to settle in the sun, he bought the Villa du Bosquet at le Cannet, a small resort close to Cannes on the Cote d'Azur. It was to be not just home and studio but the principal subject and stimulus of his work until his death, some 21 years later. He did not, of course, confine himself to working only from the house and its garden, but it is the intriguing premise of this exhibition to concentrate on what he did within that limitation. Nothing, however, is lost of the variety or scope of his work, for here along with the paintings of his wife, Marthe, taking yet another bath, or of the table laid for lunch, are broadest and most distant of landscapes, looking out high over the garden wall to the sea far below, and to the blue and purple mountains far beyond. And in between comes the middle view, up the steps to the terrace, down the garden path to the garden gate and over the wall to the neighbours' rooftops, fields and gardens. The birds feed along the path between the shrubs and bushes: the little dog skips across the grass. Inside the house, the tables seem to take us through the hours of the day and the seasons of the year. We tour the house, from dining-room to bathroom, to studio, to bedroom and back to dining-room - the house is not large. Marthe bathes again, sits working at the table, moves across the room, gets ready to go out. The painter looks at himself in the bedroom mirror. The sense of place is palpable, inescapeable. We feel we know exactly where we are, whether sitting at table, looking out of the window or through from one room to the next, catching just a glimpse of another figure here, a profile there, caught out of the corner of the eye. It is all done through the paint, shimmering and glowing on the surface of the canvas. We are not shown what is there exactly: nothing is described in simple terms, but rather hinted at, suggested by touch and colour, stroke against stroke. We are coaxed into a conspiracy of feeling by which we sense through our eyes, rather than merely see, just how the sunlight hangs in the air, and the shadows fall, and time passes, so softly. We may almost hear the bees hum, and the clock tick. 'Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died, young and fair . . .' Here is a great artist in his full maturity, catching sensation even as it fades. It is magical stuff, and poignant too, as is all great art, for it touches on our mortality. 'Dust hath closed Helen's eye . . .' Bonnard at le Bosquet: Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre SE1, until August 29, then on to Newcastle; National Touring Exhibition sponsored by British Telecom.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- An official of the  Mainland Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS) said today that talks between ARATs and the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) from Taiwan should keep off political  topics.    Tang Shubei, vice-president of ARATS, said that political  and  legal issues on which the two sides are unlikely to achieve  common ground should be excluded in talks between the two  non-governmental organizations.    "As non-governmental organizations, ARATS and SEF should not  be involved in political issues on which Taiwan and the mainland  can hardly have common ground," Tang said. "We hope that in  negotiations between the two sides, relevant departments in  Taiwan will return to the common ground that the two  organizations achieved during the Wang-Koo [Gu] meeting in  Singapore last year."    During recent talks between the two sides, some SEF  officials  put forward such political and legal issues as "legal  jurisdiction," which Tang said are not in accordance with the  Wang-Koo agreement.    The Wang-Koo meeting was a non-governmental, economic and  businesslike meeting, Tang said. The meeting has helped solve  many problems which cropped up during exchanges across the  Taiwan Straits and brought more contacts across the straits.    He said that ARATS has made continuous efforts following  that  meeting to implement the Wang-Koo agreement, and great progress  has been achieved with efforts from both sides.</p>

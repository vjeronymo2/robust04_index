			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ercros halts plan to close fertiliser units ERCROS, the Spanish chemical conglomerate controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office, has cancelled a plan to introduce large cuts in its Fesa-Enfersa fertiliser unit aimed at aiding the unit's disposal, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The decision to rescind the closure of five of the 12 fertiliser plants followed a judicial decision on Tuesday that rejected an attempt by the KIO's new management to bring fraud and gross negligence charges against its former senior executives in Spain. Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment arm which owns Ercros, did not explain its change of mind, but analysts saw it as a response to government pressure and to the growing protests that the cutbacks had provoked. Significantly, the decision to retain all the fertiliser units and to withdraw 1,900 redundancies - half the workforce - was announced by the employment minister to union leaders. The debt-laden fertiliser unit accounted for half of Ecros' losses of Pta16.4bn (Dollars 146.7m) in 1991, three times higher than forecast. Ercros was put into receivership last summer, and Torras had hoped to rescue it through the disposal of Fesa-Enfersa.</p>

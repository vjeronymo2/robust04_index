			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amounts not treated as paid or incurred <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not includible in carryover-allocation basis unless it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as paid or incurred under the method of accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by the taxpayer. For example, a cash method taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot include construction costs in carryover-allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis unless the costs have been paid, and an accrual method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer cannot include construction costs in carryover-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation basis unless they have been properly accrued. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section for a special rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fees <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A fee is includible in carryover-allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis only to the extent the requirements of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(2)(iii) of this section are met and_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The fee is reasonable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The taxpayer is legally obligated to pay the fee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The fee is capitalizable as part of the taxpayer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in land or depreciable property that is reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be part of the project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The fee is not paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) If the fee is paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related person, and the taxpayer uses the cash method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting, the taxpayer could properly accrue the fee under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accrual method of accounting (considering, for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules of section 461(h)). A person is a related person if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the person bears a relationship to the taxpayer specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), or if the person and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer are engaged in trades or businesses under common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control (within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 52).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasonably expected basis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Rules similar to the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in a project (land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and depreciable basis) as of the close of the second calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year following the calendar year of the allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The following examples illustrate the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . C, an accrual-method taxpayer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing credit agency, in September of 1993. As of that date, C has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not begun construction of the low-income housing building C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans to build. However, C has owned the land on which C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans to build the building since 1985. C's basis in the land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is $100,000. C reasonably expects that by the end of 1995,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C's basis in the project of which the building is to be a part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be $2,000,000. C also expects that because the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is located in a qualified census tract, C will be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase its basis in the project to $2,600,000. Before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close of 1993, C incurs $150,000 of costs for architects' fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and site preparation. C properly accrues these costs under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its method of accounting and capitalizes the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of carryover-allocation basis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . C's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100,000 basis in the land is includible in carryover-allocation basis even though C has owned the land since 1985.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The $150,000 of costs C has incurred for architects' fees and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site preparation are also includible in carryover-allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. The expected increase in basis due to the project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location in a qualified census tract is not taken into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in determining C's carryover-allocation basis. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C's carryover-allocation basis in the project of which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building is a part is $250,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of whether building is qualified <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . C's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected basis in the project at the close of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second calendar year following the calendar year of allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is $2,000,000. The expected increase in eligible basis due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project's location in a qualified census tract is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken into account in determining this amount. Because C's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover-allocation basis is more than 10 percent of C's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected basis in the project of which the building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a part, the building for which C received the carryover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation is a qualified building for purposes of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . D, an accrual-method taxpayer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a carryover allocation from Agency, the state housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit agency, on September 11, 1993. As of that date, D has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not begun construction of the low-income housing building D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans to build and D does not have basis in the land on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D plans to build the building. In 1993, D incurs some costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the planned building, including architects' fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, at the close of 1993, these costs do not exceed 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of whether building is qualified <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because D's carryover-allocation basis is not more than 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of D's reasonably expected basis in the project of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the building is a part, the building for which D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a carryover allocation is not a qualified building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) and paragraph (a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section. The carryover allocation to D is not valid, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is treated as if it had not been made.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verification of basis by Agency <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An Agency that makes a carryover allocation to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer must verify that, as of the close of the calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year of allocation, the taxpayer has incurred more than 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the reasonably expected basis in the project (land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and depreciable basis).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

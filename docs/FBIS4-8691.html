			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer by </F> Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not given: "Thurmer: We Have  Athenian Democracy Here"]    [Text] Is Prime Minister Peter Boross right in saying that  the country would come to grief by listening to Gyula Horn  [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP]? To what can  we attribute the Workers Party's increasing popularity? We  interviewed Gyula Thurmer on these issues among others.    [Pogonyi] Do you agree with Peter Boross who recently said  that the country would come to grief if it listened to Gyula  Horn, namely to his statement that the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] government has to be replaced?    [Thurmer] This poor country came to grief when it elected  the current government and when the parliamentary parties did  not force early elections in December 1993. If the country  listened to Boross, its days would be limited.    [Pogonyi] To remain with the prime minister's words, he said  that the elections would be decided between the MDF and the  MSZP, and that the liberal parties would be a "natural wastage."  In your view, what will be at stake at the elections?    [Thurmer] It is almost a fact that the Boross government  will fail at the elections. The real stake is whether the  consolidation of the capitalist system that was imported from  the West in 1990 will continue or Hungary will choose a way of  development in which the millions of workers also find their  place.    [Pogpnyi] In your view, what kind of system do we now have  in Hungary?    [Thurmer] This system mostly reminds me of the democracy of  Athens.    [Pogonyi] In what way?    [Thurmer] Five percent had a perfect and pleasant life while  95 percent of the population were slaves. We would like the  majority to feel good.    [Pogonyi] I think that you are not the only one who says  this. The question is which party the electors will believe.    [Thurmer] I feel that the Socialist Party has a better  chance to implement this policy and to achieve prosperity for  the majority. In my view, the liberal parties do not have enough  strength or consistency to deviate from the model of capitalist  consolidation. The liberals might not drop out but I am  convinced that they will not be the ones who determine the  country's future. All depends on how much courage the MSZP's  leadership has.    [Pogonyi] Courage for what?    [Thurmer] Today, one needs courage to govern the country and  to deviate from the current road. If the MSZP tries to find  allies from the right then it will sooner or later find itself  in conflict with ordinary people, many of whom will have voted  for them, and the party might even get into conflict with its  own members.    [Pogonyi] And if the MSZP seeks allies from the left?    [Thurmer] The Workers Party is the main candidate here. In  this case, the MSZP would have a bigger chance to successfully  solve society's problems.    [Pogonyi] Will the Workers Party have the necessary 5  percent to get into parliament? You recently predicted 7 to 8  percent for yourselves.    [Thurmer] According to the data of the National Electoral  Committee, some 1,800 individual parliamentary candidates have  been registered in the country. Taking an average of 1,000  nomination slips per candidate, this means some 1.8 million  slips. The Workers' Party candidates collected much more, a  multiple of a thousand nomination slips on average.    [Pogonyi] You now have 156 individual candidates, in 20  regional lists.    [Thurmer] This means that the Workers' Party collected some  7 to 9 percent of the nomination slips. We are happy that very  many young people gave us their nomination slips, and very many  people said that although they were afraid to do this, however,  they would certainly vote for us at the elections. If no  violent acts take place in the country and there is no rough and  obvious cheating at the elections then the Workers Party will be  in parliament.    [Pogonyi] Personally, to what do you attribute the Workers  Party's relative advancement? Is nostalgia for the former  regime so widespread?    [Thurmer] People are now judging on the basis of their own  experiences. Boross is saying it in vain that the economic  situation is better now than in 1989-1990. It is impossible to  explain it to 1 million unemployed people that, as a matter of  fact, they are living in prosperity. People with large  families, or others, especially the school leavers who are  without jobs, or the deceived teachers cannot be persuaded to  believe this. Everyone knows that the Workers Party is not  responsible for the past four years. If any consistent  opposition party existed in the past four years then that was  us. We did not make compromises or pacts, we do not have  headquarters affairs, and our deputies are not members of boards  of directors in banks. People can see this and they trust in  us. Within the party, we have seen an important change of  generations. I have had a look through the national lists of  parties. Well, none of them have a 23 years old laborer from  Csepel or 30 years old nuclear engineer from Paks. Apart from  the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] the parties are full  of elderly gentlemen -- although their number is increasing in  the Fidesz, too.    [Pogonyi] What is the opinion of the Workers Party on the  media's current situation? You have not yet said much about  this.    [Thurmer] We are in favor of the freedom of the press. We  have sympathy for the 129 dismissed radio journalists, and we  made this view public, but even the affected people did not  write about this. They have our sympathy, even though some of  the dismissed people have not had much sympathy for us in the  past four years. Today, a real freedom of the press does not  exist, therefore, it will be very difficult to neutralize four  years of brainwashing with tulips [symbol of the MDF] in the  remaining four weeks.</p>

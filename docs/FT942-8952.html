			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consultants are more than cost-cutters Sir, Your article, 'Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked' (April 26), and the Cabinet Office report which it cites, are incomplete and inaccurate regarding the contribution made by management consultancies to government. The quoted figure of Pounds 10m grossly understates the savings our members are in fact able to prove. Because the total savings are unknown, it cannot be assumed that they are negligible. Management consultancy is about creating wealth, encouraging best practice and transferring skills. It is not merely about cutting costs. The Cabinet Office report agrees that consultants make a significant contribution to achieving important government objectives. They also provide invaluable assistance in managing change programmes and other fundamental reforms. The report makes clear, however, that there is little attempt by government to track expenditure or to assess value for money with regard to consultancies, and it argues that more should be done in this respect. The MCA wholeheartedly agrees with this point. Much can be achieved through improved purchasing, greater accountability and follow-through to obtain better value for money. It would be a great shame if a report, which is intended to produce such changes, is used to pillory one of the most powerful forces stimulating such improvements.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K.B.: "Inflation Acceleration"] </F>   [Text] The average net salary in the enterprise sector was  4,312,100 zlotys in December. That figure is 15.6-percent  higher than in November. At the same time, according to the  Central Office of Statistics [GUS], the prices of consumer goods  and services rose by 5.6 percent; food prices increased by 8.9  percent. In all of 1993 (from December to December), net  salaries increased by 34.4 percent, whereas consumer prices rose  by 37.6 percent.    Comparison of the salary and price increases shows that in  all of 1993, real wages in the enterprise sector dropped by 3.2  percent. In the last three months (December to September) [as  published], net salaries in enterprises increased by 26.5  percent; at the same time, consumer prices rose by 11.9 percent.  Thus, in the last quarter, real wages in enterprises went up by  14.6 percent. This creates the very real danger of more rapid  inflation in the first few months of 1994.    GUS also reported on Monday [17 January] that there were  2,889,600 registered unemployed people in December, 1.5 percent  more than in November.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Clinton Is Losing </F> Confidence"]    [Text] We are one-third into 1994. This leaves eight  months for the dollar apologists to realize their bold forecasts  made at the beginning of the year: That the U.S. currency could  get up to 1.85 to 1.95 against the German mark [DM] in 1994. At  the moment there is not much indication of the greenback taking  that course. On the contrary: The U.S. central bank is forced  by Washington to protect the dollar from suffering any further  losses.    Initially everything seemed to work out as predicted for the  dollar. In Germany, interest rates are dropping, in the United  States they have been on their way up again since 4 February.  The U.S. economy is booming, while the German and Japanese  economies are going downhill. Both these developments should  have made international capital flow toward the dollar.    But instead, the U.S. currency is approaching another low  against the yen (lowest exchange rate so far: 100.35 yen), and  it has dropped to DM1.65.    The Clinton Administration will have to realize -- and this  might come as a key experience to President Clinton and Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- that markets do not go by the White  House's solemn promises. A declaration for a strong dollar,  like the one Bentsen made at the end of last week -- the  government is not planning to use the dollar/yen exchange rate  for reducing the huge foreign trade deficit with Japan -- is  being ignored by the markets. Thus, the Federal Bank in New  York, the executive authority of central bank policy, was asked  on Friday [29 April] to buy large amounts of dollars for foreign  currencies. "This is not part of our Japanese policy," a  high-ranking Fed representative commented somewhat  heavy-handedly. Washington does not want to make foreign trade  easier for the new Japanese Prime Minister Hata. Also, Japan  is doing everything it can to avoid this. Before the Hata  government was even fully in office, the Ministry for  International Trade and Industry rejected U.S. criticism of the  Japanese market being sealed off. A survey of foreign trade  barriers that was presented by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor in March, is "not supported by facts." It contains  "ambiguous arguments," and an "objective standard is not  perceptible."    That is food for the skeptical mood in the markets. The  Clinton Administration is finding it hard to appear credible  with its exchange rate policy. Of course, the U.S.  Administration would welcome a weaker dollar, especially with  regard to the export berserks, Germany and Japan, to reduce the  foreign trade deficit that soared to $116 billion in 1993. A  more expensive yen would be the best way to balance the huge  import surplus in trade with Japan, which went up to almost $60  billion in 1993. Since a more expensive yen and a more  expensive German mark would fit the foreign trade concept so  well, the Clinton Administration has a hard time appearing  credible in the markets and inspiring confidence.    But Clinton and Bentsen also fear that a weak dollar might  frighten off foreign investors. That is why they are trying to  smooth out fluctuations of the dollar exchange rate by  interventions to avoid disorderly conditions in the markets.    U.S. exchange-rate experts do not yet want to believe in a  new global speculation directed against the dollar. But: "The  Clinton Administration has lost confidence," Scott E. Pardee,  former foreign operations chief at the New York Fed and  currently working for Japanese broker Yamaichi, said. This has  contributed to the greenback losing 10 percent over the yen: At  the beginning of the year $1 bought 113 yen. In relation to the  German mark, the dollar lost 6.5 percent since the beginning of  January.    The dollar bulls have eight months left to realize their  1994  forecast. Will Clinton be able to help them, thus making U.S.  policy more credible?</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Azerbaijan oil deal is signed in face of Russian protests The largest deal between foreign oil companies and a former Soviet republic was signed yesterday in the Azerbaijani capital Baku - but the Russian foreign ministry immediately refused to recognise the Dollars 8bn agreement. The refusal, from Mr Grigory Karasin, chief spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, follows Moscow's stated intention to control and if necessary stop all oil and gas exploitation in the Caspian Sea unless it dictates the terms. Russia is demanding that the pipeline route should pass through its territory, giving it a stranglehold over energy exports from Azerbaijan. In fact, western consortium members favour upgrading the existing pipeline to Russia, given that an alternative route to Turkey would have to pass through Iran. However, the deal omitted agreement on a pipeline route to get the oil to hard-currency markets, although the contract calls for its construction within 4 1/2 years. Representatives from a consortium of 10 companies, led by British Petroleum, signed the 30-year contract with Azeri president Haydar Aliyev. The production-sharing deal was the culmination of three years of negotiations, variously described by Mr Aliyev as 'tense' and 'not easy at all'. The Russian deputy energy minister was present at the signing ceremony, which suggests a clash of interests between the Russian energy and foreign ministries. The consortium is likely to use oil swap deals with Russia or Iran to export the relatively small volumes of early oil production. That will begin within 18 months and build up to 80,000 barrels a day by 1997. The consortium plans to develop the fields in phases. The offshore fields contain potential reserves of about 3.8bn barrels of high-quality crude oil. Peak output could reach 700,000 barrels a day, a level that might 'reshape the pattern of trade in energy supplies', according to Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration. Azeri production is 160,000 b/d at present. Mr Browne said the risk that a long-term transport solution might prove elusive would be reduced by 'pacing investment according to the means of getting the oil out'. In addition to BP, consortium members include Amoco, Unocal, McDermott and Pennzoil, all of the US, Statoil of Norway, Ramco of the UK, Turkish Petroleum, Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, and Delta, a private Saudi company. Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, has a 20 per cent interest. The most recent member of the consortium is Lukoil, the Russian semi-private oil company which was given 10 per cent of the project from the Azeri government stake after strong pressure from Russia for its inclusion. However, it appears that that share - thought sufficient to satisfy Russian demands - is not enough for the Russian government to bless the venture. The deal must be ratified by the Azeri parliament - which has proved volatile when faced with decisions it judges to be against the national interest. A strong strain of opinion opposes the entry of western oil companies. Observer, Page 21</p>

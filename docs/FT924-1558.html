			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad blames slide on one-off factors THE FALL in profits last year at Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator, was 'a result of one-off factors' which would not be repeated, according to Mr Howard Klein, chairman. Owners Abroad, which yesterday announced a tie-up with Thomas Cook Group and its parent, LTU Group of Germany, reported pre-tax profits in the year to October 1992 down from Pounds 32m to Pounds 25m on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 772m. Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 12.6p to 8.6p but the company is increasing its total dividend from 3.2p to 3.5p via a final of 2.52p. Mr Klein said there was every reason to expect that Owners Abroad would resume profitability at a 'normal clip'. The past year had been unusual for a number of reasons. The group had misjudged the pricing in its first brochures for the 1992 summer holidays which came out before last Christmas. As Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook Group and Owners new partner, said: 'This last year they (Owners Abroad) did goof. People picked up the brochure in the shops and put it straight down again.' In addition, Owners put on extra capacity, not only to take advantage of the collapse of ILG in March last year but also because of a belief that recovery was on its way. Owners had tried to increase pricing and margins and lost out in the pre-Christmas period, Mr Klein said. On current trading, Mr Klein said that the demand for holidays was likely to be the same as this year or marginally down on this year. Bookings of Owners' holidays were up 18 per cent on the same time last year even though the industry as whole was still down. The company had also taken steps to cut the cost base by closing seven offices which would lead to cost savings of about Pounds 4.5m in 1993.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr </F> Frenkel, Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production  Output and Price Dynamics as of 22 March"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 15 to 22 March 1994 prices for consumer  goods  and services rose by 2.1 percent, including for foodstuffs--by  1.4 percent, nonfood items--by 2.8 percent, and for-fee services  for the population--by 3.5 percent. The highest rate of  increases in prices for goods and services was registered in the  Far Eastern and East Siberian economic regions (about 3  percent), and the lowest--in West Siberian and Central Chernozem  regions (1.3 percent).    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services were as  follows (as a percentage of the preceding observation date):                     03/05       03/15       03/22       Average daily price rise                                                         March       February   Consumer goods   101.7       102.4       102.1       0.27        0.34  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.5       101.7       101.4       0.22        0.32   nonfood items    101.5       103.1       102.8       0.32        0.34   for-fee          104.8       103.5       103.5       0.53        0.48  services for  the population       Over 22 days of March prices for goods and services  increased  by 6.3 percent (by 41.3 percent since the beginning of the  year), including those for foodstuffs--by 4.6 percent (38.6  percent), nonfood items--by 7.6 percent (33.1 percent), and  for-fee services for the population--by 12.3 percent (2.2-fold).    Assuming that the current pace of price rises remains the  same until the end of the month, the total rise in prices for  goods and service in March will be about 10 percent.    Foodstuffs. Over the period 15 to 22 March prices  in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 0.9  percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products are shown  below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date):                         Total           including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.4           101.5               100.9   including:   Meat and meat        100.8           101.1               99.8  products   Fish and fish        101.6           101.7               100.4  products   Milk and milk        102.4           102.5               101.6  products   Eggs                 100.1           100.1               100.7   Sugar                99.4            99.4                100.3   Bread and bakery     104.1           104.1  products   Cereals and          104.1           104.1               104.3  macaroni items   Vodka                99.2            99.2                99.6   Potatoes and         105.1           106.2               103.9  vegetables      In organized trade over the period 15 to 22 March vegetable  prices rose at an anticipatory rate: garlic--by 11 percent,  carrots and fresh cabbage--by 8 percent, and beets and  potatoes--by 4 percent. A high rate of prices increases remained  with respect to bread and bakery products, cereals, cheeses,  frozen fish, and salt (4-7 percent). There has been practically  no change over the week in prices for meat, vegetable oil,  sugar, eggs, and vodka.    Since the beginning of the month vegetable prices have gone  up by 17 percent, bread and bakery products--by 13 percent, milk  products--by 9 percent, and meat and meat products--by 4 percent.    Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in  nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh  produce: prices for fresh cabbage, onions, and carrots went up  by 6-9 percent. Prices for meat and milk products remained  practically unchanged. Since the beginning of the month  vegetable prices have increased by 13 percent, milk products--5  percent, and meat--3 percent.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs  increased over the week by 1.5 percent and as of 22 March  amounted to 43,700 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis.  The price differential between monitored cities measured a  factor of 3.9. In terms of the cost of consumer basket Moscow  and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 36th among 132 monitored  cities (R47,700 and R47,600 on a monthly basis).    Nonfood items. Prices for basic medicines  increased over the week by 5 percent; those for light industry  products--by 2-3 percent, and tobacco items--by 1.4 percent.    Since the beginning of the month prices for medicines have  increased by 14 percent; garments, knitwear, and fabrics--by 7-9  percent; footwear--by 5 percent; and tobacco items--by 3.5  percent.    For-fee services for the population. The trend of  anticipatory rate increases with respect to for-fee services  continued over the period under review. The cost of city bus  fares increased by 10.9 percent. In Astrakhan, Novgorod, Ukhta,  and Moscow they jumped over the week by a factor of two to 2.5.  The cost of some categories of consumer and municipal services  went up by 2-6 percent. There was a considerable increase in the  cost of municipal services in Yakutsk, where apartment rents  increased 1.5-fold, electric and gas rates--threefold, and hot  water rates--more than fivefold.    Since the beginning of the month the greatest rate increases  have been registered with respect to municipal housing and hot  water (1.7-fold) and city bus fares (by 22 percent). Fees for  certain categories of health care services and visits to  sanitariums and resorts increased by 7-10 percent.    Industrial production. Over 20 days of March 1994,  of 163 most important categories of products counted in periodic  reports, the average daily production,    as compared to the corresponding period of 1993:    --increased with respect to 13 items, (including city  telephone cables, polypropylene, potassium fertilizer,  asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, cotton fabrics, school  notebooks, pencils, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese,  and facial soap), or 8 percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 145 items, or 89 percent of the  total number;    as compared to the corresponding period of February 1994:    --increased with respect to 59 items, (including automotive  gasoline, diesel fuel, pig iron, steel, finished rolled metal,  coking coal, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizer, calcinated soda,  synthetic ammonia, polystyrene, processing control panels,  traveling electric cranes, passenger railcars, excavators,  automobiles, buses, tractors, lumber, cardboard, roof slate,  high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipes and couplers,  decorative ceramic tile, video tape recorders, knitting  machines, motorcycles, linen fabrics and sack cloth, raincoats,  suits, footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta  cheese, and canned milk products), or 36 percent of the total  number;    --decreased with respect to 99 items, or 61 percent of the  total number;    Based on the dynamics of the production of most important  varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that the average  daily production in industry over the elapsed period of March  1994 amounted to 73 percent of that for the corresponding period  of March last year.    The output of the main categories of industrial products  over  20 days of March 1994 is characterized by the following data:                               Produced over     As % of the corresponding period                             20 days of        (in terms of average daily                             March 1994        production) of                                                March 1993       February 1994   Electric power--billion    54.4              94               92  kw-hr   Oil, including gas         15.7              82               98  condensate, million  tonnes   Natural gas, billion       36.4              99.0             99.0  cubic meters   Coal, million tonnes       14.9              85               91   Steel, million tonnes      2.4               73               104   Finished rolled ferrous    1.9               82               107  metals, including  destined for export,  million tonnes   Steel pipe, thousand       174               49               86  tonnes   Large electric             112               14               77  machinery, units   Metal-cutting machine      263               29               79  tools, units   Passenger cars, thousand   47.0              88               113  units   Tractors, thousand units   1.1               15               130    Chemical filament and      10.4              49               99.0  fiber, thousand tonnes   Mineral fertilizer         386               77               110  (recalculated as  100-percent nutrient),  thousand tonnes   Automotive tires for       1.1               50               86  agricultural vehicles,  motorcycles, and  motorollers, million  units   Commercial timber,         3.8               60               97  million cubic meters  solid wood   Lumber, thousand cubic     568               67               104  meters   Paper, thousand tonnes     114               63               89   Cement, million tonnes     1.6               68               92   Roof slate, million        75.3              35               111  standard tiles   Construction brick,        403               70               95  million units of  standard brick   Soft roofing and           16.3              47               91  insulation materials,  million square meters   Fabrics, total, million    131               80               86  square meters   Hosiery, million pairs     18.1              65               87   Knitwear, million units    10.0              67               87   Footwear, million pairs    2.9               42               106   Television sets,           136               71               89  thousand units   Radio receiving devices,   41.1              29               69  thousand units   Refrigerators and          127               71               79  freezers, thousand units    Electric vacuum            50.6              29               100.2  cleaners, thousand units    Washing machines,          92.3              47               85  thousand units   Meat, including            84.0              67               101  subproducts, category I,  total, thousand tonnes   Whole-milk products,       343               83               100.4  recalculated as milk,  total, thousand tonnes   Butter, total, thousand    15.4              63               117  tonnes   Granulated sugar,          43.9              32               82  including quantities  produced from  customer-supplied  material, thousand  tonnes      Over the elapsed period of March 1994 there was no  production  of gantry cranes with lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes,  grain-and flax-harvesting combines, and electric locomotives.    Progress in Defense Industry Conversion. In 1993  conversion measures were being implemented at 716 enterprises of  the Russian Federation defense complex, which comprises 98  percent of all enterprises with defense contracts.    Production cutbacks were typical in 1993 both for industry  as  a whole and for enterprises undergoing conversion, as may be  seen from the following data:                            1993 as % of 1992                           Volume of           including:                          production                          (contracts,                          services), total                                               military         civilian   Industry--total         83.8                71.2             84.1   including enterprises   86.0                77.9             90.2  undergoing conversion       Under the influence of conversion processes, the share of  military products in total output dropped from 52 percent in  1990 to 31 percent in 1993. The change in the structure of  output and number of employees engaged in this production may be  seen from the following data (in percentages):                            1990          1991          1992          1993   Volume of production    100           100           100           100  (contracts, services)  (in 1993  prices)--total   including   military items          52            45            34            31   civilian items          48            55            66            69   average number of       100           100           100           100  personnel engaged in  industrial production  on payroll--total   including those  engaged in production  of:   military items          52            46            38            33   civilian items          48            54            62            67      Wages at enterprises undergoing conversion were lower than  in  industry overall and in 1993 amounted on average to R44,000 per  month (in industry--R66,000 per month, including in machine  building--R47,000). In 1993, 165,000 persons quit their jobs at  enterprises undergoing conversion. The number of personnel  engaged in industrial production at enterprises undergoing  conversion fell over the year by 12 percent, which is somewhat  higher than in machine-building (by 10 percent), and twice as  high as industry as a whole.    As in the rest of industry, the financial situation of  enterprises undergoing conversion in 1993 was typically  unstable. The amount of money owed by consumers for products  purchased from these enterprises reached R1.2 trillion; of that,  more than half was owed to them by the state. In turn, past due  payments owed by enterprises undergoing conversion to suppliers  for raw materials, parts, and components amounted to R854  billion.    There were no substantial changes in the structure of  financing of conversion measures in 1993. The share of money  provided from the federal budget amounted to, according to data  supplied by enterprises undergoing conversion, 21 percent of all  expenditures, as compared to 24 percent in 1992. The share of  outside sources of money in conversion financing has increased  (from 41 percent to 44 percent). This is mostly bank loans; the  share of money received from foreign investors is extremely  small (0.3 percent of all means received from outside sources).  The share of self-financing of conversion measures in 1993  remained at the 1992 level and amounted on average over the year  to 18 percent, although in the first quarter of 1993 it reached  29 percent.    In 1993 the destination of 18 percent of the output produced  by enterprises undergoing conversion was outside Russia;  military equipment and arms accounted for one-third of this  output.    Operation of Urban Electric Transportation. In the  Russian Federation, 113 cities have electric urban passenger  transport; of them, 27 have only streetcars; 43--only trolley  buses; and 43 have both. Six cities have subways.    The production base of urban electric transport and the  passenger volume they carry are characterized by the following  data:                                1992             1993             1993 as % of                                                                1992   Operating length of         3.3              3.3              100  streetcar tracks,  thousand kilometers   trolley bus lines,          4.79             4.84             101  thousand kilometers   subway, kilometers          367.0            372.6            102   Rolling stock as of the  end of the year, thousand  units   --streetcars                14.3             13.9             97   --trolley buses             13.9             13.8             99.5   --subway cars               5.5              5.6              101   Number of runs completed,  millions   --streetcars                36.7             36.1             98   --trolley buses             56.4             56.7             101   --subway trains             4.6              4.7              101   passengers carried by       20,257           21,439           106  urban electric  transport--total, million  persons   including:   --by streetcar              8,071            8,125            100.7   --by trolley bus            8,619            9,102            106   --by subway                 3,567            4,212            118      In 1993, 13.9 km of streetcar track (one-way) were put into  operation (one-third less than in 1992) and 103 km of trolley  bus lines (2.1 times more). Additions to trolley bus lines were  made in 17 cities, including Orenburg (21 km), St. Petersburg  (14.0 km), Kemerovo (13.0 km), Kazan (12.8 km), Irkutsk (10.7  km), and Perm (9.8 km); to streetcar tracks--in eight cities,  including Vladivostok (5.5 km), Prokopyevsk (3.8 km), and  Chelyabinsk (2.2 km).    The operating length of subway track increased in 1993 by  5.6  km, which is 1.5 times less than in 1992. New segments were put  into operation on the Samara (3 km) and Nizhniy Novgorod (2.6  km) subways.    In 1993 urban electric transport enterprises received 498  streetcars and 1,341 trolley buses, which is somewhat higher  than 1992 deliveries. At the same time, the wear and tear on  rolling stock remains high. Currently more 10 percent of all  trolley buses and streetcars in Russia have exceeded the term of  their useful life.    In Kaliningrad, 71 percent of streetcars have been in  service  for 15 or more years; in Volgograd, Samara, Vladikavkaz, and  Izhevsk--more than 50 percent; and in Ulyanovsk, Pyatigorsk,  Salavat, Yekaterinburg, and Komsomolsk-na-Amure--more than 40  percent.    In Leninsk-Kuznetsk more than 50 percent of trolley buses  have exceeded their normal service term; in Arkhangelsk,  Yoshkar-Ola, Novocheboksarsk, Astrakhan, Balakovo, Nalchik,  Rostov-na-Donu, Taganrog, Sterlitamak, Kurgan, Berezniki,  Abakan, Bratsk, Chita, and Kaliningrad--more than 20 percent.    In the subways rolling stock inventory, 32 percent of cars  have been in service between 15 and 25 years, and 13 percent of  cars--for more than 25 years. There are 247 cars (6 percent) in  Moscow subway that have served their useful life (more than 30  years).    As a result, the main cause of off-line idling of rolling  stock are technical malfunctions.    In 1993 on average 28.6 percent of trolley buses a day were  not in use, of which 18.5 percent were under repair or awaiting  repair; with respect to streetcars these figures amounted to  26.9 percent and 20.5 percent respectively; and subways--24  percent and 10 percent.    More than 30 percent of trolley buses a day on average were  not in use due to repairs or the need for such in Volgograd,  Maykop, Cherkessk, Vladikavkaz, Volgodonsk, Berezniki, and  Novokuznetsk, and more than one-quarter in Smolensk, Tula,  Rybinsk, Voronezh, Astrakhan, Krasnodar, Izhevsk, Chita, and  Kaliningrad. For the same reason more than half of all  streetcars were idle in Cherepovets and Astrakhan; more than 40  percent--in Pyatigorsk, Vladikavkaz, Nizhniy Tagil, and  Kaliningrad; and 25-35 percent--in Ivanovo, Moscow, Smolensk,  Yaroslavl, Volgograd, Samara, Zlatoust, and Magnitogorsk,  Barnaul, Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, Ulan-Ude,  Krasnoyarsk.    Over the year, there were 104,100 incidents of trolley buses  and 166,500 incidents of streetcars returning from their route  ahead of schedule due to technical malfunction.    The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock  results in the cancellation of scheduled runs and schedules not  being followed. In 1993, 3.4 million (5.6 percent) of scheduled  trolley bus and 2.5 million (9.4 percent) streetcars runs were  not accomplished.    In a number of cities the frequency of runs of ground  passenger electric transport was reduced considerably. The  number of completed trolley bus runs in Barnaul dropped by 36  percent as compared to 1992; in Sterlitamak--by 31 percent; in  Leninsk-Kuznetsk and Novokuznetsk--by 21 percent and 23 percent,  respectively; in Makhachkala--by 19 percent; in Shakhty--by 14  percent; and in Moscow, Cherkessk, Novorossiysk, and  Stavropol--by 8-10 percent; of streetcar runs--in Ust-Ilimsk--by  43 percent, Shakhty--by 40 percent, Tver, Karpinsk, Biysk,  Novokuznetsk--by 22-30 percent, Astrakhan--by 15 percent,  Ufa--by 11 percent, and Tomsk--by 10 percent.    Despite considerable rate increases for urban electric  transport fares (in December 1993 as compared to December 1992  the cost of fares on streetcars and trolley buses increased by a  factor of almost 15), passenger transportation by ground  electric transport remains a money-loser. In 1993 in Russia as a  whole operating expenses with respect to trolley buses exceeded  revenue by R56.5 billion (1.7-fold), and streetcars--by R67.7  billion (1.9-fold).    In most cities less than 10 percent of expenditures for  maintenance and operation of streetcar and trolley bus transport  is covered by sales of fare passes.    As a whole in all subways of the Russian Federation in 1993  revenues from transporting paying passengers covered only 29  percent of expenses; in Yekaterinburg this share amounted to 3  percent, Samara--5 percent, Nizhniy Novgorod--14 percent,  Moscow--28 percent, St. Petersburg--34 percent, and  Novosibirsk--59 percent.    Oil and Gas Industry Operations in Tyumen Oblast.  In 1993 Tyumen Oblast accounted for 67 percent of all Russian  oil production, including gas condensate, and for 91 percent of  natural gas.    The decline of oil production in the oblast continued in  1993, and for the first time since production of gas began at  Tyumen deposits, production of gas decreased as compared to the  preceding year. The main indicators characterizing the work of  Tyumen Oblast oil and gas industry are shown in the following  table:                       1990       1992       1993       1992 as %   1993 as %                                                      of 1991     of 1992   Oil production,    365        270        236        84          87  including gas  condensate,  million tonnes   Natural gas        574        582        563        100.4       97  production,  billion cubic  meters   Wells available  for exploitation  wells as of the  end of the year:    --oil              62.6       69.7       71.7       104         103   including          7.5        16.8       15.8       159         94  nonoperating  wells, thousand  units   --gas              2.6        3.2        3.3        106         106   including          155        174        180        118         103  nonoperating  wells, units   New wells put in  operation:   --oil, thousand    9.1        5.7        5.5        75          97  units   --gas, units       147        51         118        86          2.3 times    Volume of          24.9       15.4       13.7       71          89  development  drilling for gas  and oil, million  meters   Average daily  production rate:    --oil wells,       19.2       14.3       12.6       88          88  tonnes   --gas wells        722        667        620        96          93  (Russian  Joint-Stock  Society  Gazprom),  thousand cubic  meters      In 1993 enterprises of the Russian Ministry of Fuel and  Energy system in Tyumen Oblast produced 227 million tonnes of  oil, including gas condensate, or 14 percent less than in 1992,  and 562 billion cubic meters of gas (3 percent less). Oil  production by joint and small enterprises amounted to 7.5  million tonnes, which is 1.7 times more than in 1992, and by  Russian Committee for Mineral Resources enterprises--1.5 million  tonnes (a 2.1-fold increase).    Oil production through application of modern methods of  increasing the output of oil beds increased by 14 percent, and  its share in the total volume of oil production--from 9 percent  in 1992 to 12 percent in 1993.    The trend toward an increase in the nonoperating stock of  oil  wells has been halted. While as of 1 January 1992 it accounted  for 15.8 percent of all operating well stock, and on 1 January  1993--24.1 percent; as of January 1994, 22 percent of wells were  not operational. At the same time, this figure is considerably  higher than the all-Russia average (15 percent). In 1993, 7,600  previously idle oil wells were restored to operation, including  436 wells with the participation of foreign companies on a  contract basis, which is 1.7 times and 2.2 times more,  respectively, than in 1992.    The decline in production of fuel in the oblast as a whole  is  the result of depletion of major deposits and the lack of money  to invest in the development of the fuel industry.    As compared to 1990, the average daily production rate of  oil  wells declined by one-third. The rate of water encroachment of  the pool increased from 75 percent to 80 percent. As a result,  the energy-intensiveness of oil production in the oblast almost  doubled.    A similar situation is beginning to develop in the gas  industry, where the average daily production rate of wells over  the indicated period declined by 14 percent.    The situation with respect to utilization of associated  petroleum gas in not improving. In 1993, 23 percent of gas  produced at oil fields was burned in flares (21 percent in 1990).    The volume of capital investment in the oblast's fuel  industry from all sources of financing is continuously  declining; in 1993 alone in the oil industry it dropped as  compared to the preceding year by 46 percent, and in the gas  industry--by 29 percent.    Lack of money for investment is to a considerable extent a  result of consumer insolvency. As of 1 February 1994, Tyumen  Oblast oil industry enterprises were owed R4.3 trillion, and gas  industry enterprises--R0.5 trillion.    In 1993 Tyumen Oblast industrial enterprises earned $2.8  billion--mainly from exports, which equals 22 percent of all  Russian industry's foreign currency earnings. Over the year $1.2  billion was used for imports. Among products imported were  83,000 tonnes of steel pipe, 88,300 tonnes of liquid-carrying  pipe, 3,000 vacuum and air pumps, and other equipment. The  amount of money remaining in enterprises' foreign currency  accounts amounted as of 1 January 1994 to $1.5 billion.    In January-February of this year, oil production, including  gas condensate, amounted to 33.9 million tonnes, or 13 percent  less than over the corresponding period of last year; and  natural gas--99.5 billion cubic meters, which corresponds to the  level of January-February of 1993.    Foreign Investment. According the Russian  Goskomstat data, foreign investment in the economy of the  Russian Federation in 1993 amounted to $2.9 billion. Of that,  $2.6 billion (89.7 percent of all investment) was direct  investment (which gives the investor the right to participate in  managing the enterprise).    The most significant investment was in the following  economic  sectors:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |$ million

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> SPOT DRUG TESTS OF BUS DRIVERS BLOCKED  </P> <P> An Oakland judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering AC Transit to delay  tests and come back to court when it could prove its bus drivers were using  drugs and causing accidents.  </P> <P> Saying he had concerns about personal privacy, Alameda County Superior Court  Judge Michael Ballachey harshly criticized what he called the government's  infringement on an employee's privacy rights. Ballachey issued a preliminary  injunction against drug testing at the request of the transit employees' union.  Drug tests at other Bay Area transit agencies have been halted so far by 15-day  temporary restraining orders.  </P></p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Political solution fades away for Kurds: The birth of an independent Kurdistan would be very bloody LAST weekend's deaths in south-eastern Turkey after clashes between Kurdish nationalists and Turkish soldiers look ominously like Turkish Kurdistan's equivalent of the Boston Tea Party or the Dublin Easter Uprising of 1916. The PKK Workers Party of Kurdistan seems to have been planning a widespread popular revolt timed to coincide with the Kurdish spring festival of Newroz, the Iranian and Kurdish new year, For the coalition government of Mr Suleyman Demirel, which includes Kurdish social democrats such as the foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, things could hardly have turned out worse. The government had been saying Newroz was a legitimate public holiday, but that it should be celebrated peacefully. Now the government is faces international censure for the deaths, while being criticised at home for being too soft. The uprising began on Friday morning as the festival was getting underway in in Cizre, a town close to the Syrian border. Two pro-government village guards, both ethnic Kurds and from a notable local clan, were found hanging from lamp-posts in the main street with their mouths stuffed with money. They had rejected warnings from other Kurds and refused to join the PKK. Demonstrations followed and violence quickly erupted. After such a start, it was perhaps inevitable - with the east full of military reinforcements and tempers raging on both sides - that guns would come out and lives would be lost. It now looks very much as if a political solution to Turkey's problems with the Kurds may be lost for ever. Government estimates put the number Kurds at around 8m out of Turkey's population of 58m. The Kurds themselves claim to be 20m. Outside observers general concur at about 12m. Rapid population growth has led to an influx of Kurdish migrants into big cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. For decades, Turkey has lived with the fiction that Kurds did not exist and there was no such thing as the Kurdish language. The aim was to assimilate the Kurdish minority into the Turkish mainstream. That goal became more difficult after 1975 as economic development brought a professional middle class of lawyers, engineers, and teachers to the south-east who were attracted by Kurdish nationalism. These political stirrings mostly began inside mainstream Turkish political movements, but they were viewed with deep suspicion by the Turkish military who remain convinced that violence is often effective in solving political and cultural disputes. A crackdown on all shades of Kurdish opinion seems to be the main reason why in the early 1980s, a hardline Kurdish nationalist movement relying on a military arm similar to the IRA displaced half a dozen older and less violent Kurdish nationalist movements. The PKK fed off central government repression. In 1984 it launched a guerrilla war. It has also succeeded in getting the population of the south-east united behind it. The PKK is realistic about its prospects of ever detaching Kurdistan from Turkey: Instead it has several times offered to negotiate on a federal solution. The idea is anathema to Turkish hardliners, who believe any concession to Kurdish nationalism could lead to the collapse of the entire country. The hardliners have lost a good deal of ground in recent years because the Kurdish problem, has become so visible. The language is no longer forbidden. Kurdish music was legalised in Turkey last year. There are now two Kurdish-language newspapers. If an independent Kurdistan is being born, its birth will be long, painful, and very bloody.</p>

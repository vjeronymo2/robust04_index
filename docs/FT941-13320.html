			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tiny steps forward Lonrho still looks a sorry sight even after Mr Dieter Bock's revamp. The dividend is not covered by earnings from continuing operations. Cash generation from continuing operations of Pounds 126m is barely sufficient to pay the company's interest, dividend and tax bill, even before it begins to consider its dwindling capital expenditure. Nor is Lonrho making much of a return from its vaunted core businesses. Hotel assets have been written down to Pounds 621m, but even so the operating return is only 3 per cent. Only in general trading, whatever that is supposed to mean, is the return a respectable 21 per cent. Mr Bock deserves credit for increasing the transparency of Lonrho's accounts, initiating disposals and restructuring the board. Yet the task of turning the company round remains gargantuan. Though Lonrho expects to squeeze more cash out of working capital this year, more disposals may be needed just to keep gearing around its present level of 31 per cent. Without disposals there can certainly be no question of acquisitions. Perhaps that is why Mr Tiny Rowland is also anxious to portray Lonrho as a company whose business is trading assets. Lonrho's fascination with Hongkong Land's stake in Trafalgar House is also instructive. That gave the Hong Kong group management control after paying for a stake of only 25 per cent. There is an obvious parallel with Mr Bock's small stake in Lonrho. Mr Rowland said yesterday that Lonrho had considered applying the principle to a stake in Ladbroke when its shares were at their nadir. In theory that might have been a cheap way for the new Lonrho to spread its wings. But the Keswick family which is behind Hongkong Land has the unstinting support of the Hongkong Bank group and a record in managing public companies which Mr Bock cannot yet boast.</p>

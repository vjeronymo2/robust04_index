			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Bosnia's president spurns Serb calls for direct talks: Local leaders prevent UN from evacuating refugees MR Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday rejected Serb calls for direct talks between the country's three warring parties, aimed at reaching a compromise on a peace plan negotiated by international mediators. The face-to-face talks between Moslems, Serbs and Croats were proposed by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, after his self-styled Serb parliament had rejected a map drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, UN and EC negotiators, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. While admitting he had hoped the parliament's declaration would be 'a little less tough and more positive towards the plan,' Mr Karadzic denied it had been entirely turned down. 'We accept the positive achievement of the Vance-Owen plan so far and we expect to correct the maps through direct talks face-to-face with the sides to the conflict,' he said in an interview with Reuter TV. Mr Izetbegovic, however, told reporters in Sarajevo yesterday that Mr Karadzic was up to his usual 'games and tricks', and that he was confident the international community would see through them. 'It is a rejection (of the plan) and nothing less,' he said. After reluctantly signing the peace plan himself last month, Mr Izetbegovic had made it clear he would withdraw his signature unless the Bosnian Serbs endorsed the Vance-Owen plan unchanged. Meanwhile, a ceasefire agreed a week ago broke down at the weekend, leaving at least seven dead and 28 wounded in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. Fighting was also reported around the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Lieutenant-General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, called on Bosnian Serbs to stop besieging the town and to respect the ceasefire. Local Moslem leaders yesterday refused to allow a UN aid convoy to evacuate refugees from Srebrenica. Moslem leaders have indicated they believe such evacuation would contribute to the Serbs' policy of expelling Moslems from areas which Serbs want to claim as their own. Eight trucks, which delivered 75 tonnes of food to the stricken town which is within range of Serb gun positions, left empty. Hardline members of the Bosnian Serb parliament forced through a declaration on Saturday which made clear that the Vance-Owen map, which would reduce the territory allocated to the Serbs from the 70 per cent of the total surface of Bosnia which they occupy now to 43 per cent, was 'unacceptable'. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also said in Vancouver at the weekend that he thought there was still a possibility the peace plan could be adjusted to meet Serb concerns. Describing the Bosnian Serb decision as 'regrettable', he nevertheless believed they had left the door open and that efforts should continue to try to persuade them it was in their and the world's interest 'to bring this slaughter' to an end. 'We're not ready to give up,' Mr Christopher said. The tone of his remarks was noticeably more conciliatory than his previous statements about punitive sanctions against the Serbs, probably in deference to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who was attending a summit with US President Bill Clinton in Vancouver.</p>

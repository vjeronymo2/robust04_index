			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Intel declines sharply after court ruling Wall Street US SHARE prices retreated yesterday, bringing the main indices down from the record highs achieved at the end of last week, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.62 easier at 3,466.99, but off the day's low. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.49 to 447.45, while the American SE composite lost 1.66 at 418.26. New York SE volume was 245m shares and declines led rises by 1,166 to 754. The Nasdaq composite finished 3.75 off at 663.03 after a steep fall in Intel shares. Prices opened weaker, which did not surprise analysts. The Dow had advanced to a record close on Friday, but the gains were primarily a result of trading related to the monthly expiration of options contracts. Analysts noted that it is quite common for stocks to reverse direction on a Monday morning after an options-expiration rally in the previous session. Although first-quarter corporate earnings continued to pour in, affecting a number of issues, the spotlight was focused yesterday on technology stocks after a landmark court ruling by a federal judge on Friday. The judge's decision to set aside the verdict reached last year in a copyright dispute between Advanced Micro Devices and Intel means AMD can now begin manufacturing a clone of Intel's top-selling 486 microprocessor chip while the two companies await a new trial. News of the judgment sparked heavy and at times frantic trading in both issues. AMD jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 27 7/8 in volume of 5.4m shares, while Intel, traded on the Nasdaq electronic market, plunged Dollars 12 1/4 to Dollars 97 3/4 in volume of 17.7m shares. The 486 chip that AMD will begin cloning accounted for a substantial portion of Intel's Dollars 2bn of first-quarter revenues. A number of other technology issues declined in sympathy with Intel. Texas Instruments lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 1/4 . Chrysler dipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42 in volume of 3.4m shares in spite of news of first-quarter profits that exceeded market expectations. Analysts put the decline down to profit-taking. Leading airline issues weakened after Northwest Airlines fired the latest salvo in the fierce domestic price-cutting war when it dropped fares on some domestic and selected trans-Atlantic routes by as much as 35 per cent. UAL fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 141 7/8 , AMR Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 5/8 and Delta Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 . Chase Manhattan shed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 after the banking group said it planned to raise Dollars 750m through a stock offering. Canada TORONTO gained further ground in another record volume as the smaller oil and gas issues, along with diamond miners, continued to attract wide interest and were traded in heavy turnover. The TSE 300 index ended 11.4 higher at 3,663.2 and rises outpaced falls by 384 to 316 after volume of 90.7m shares valued at CDollars 601m. Monday's volume included two large blocks in American Eagle Petroleum totalling about 12m shares. Abitibi-Price, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 14 5/8 , reported reduced losses from continuing operations in the first quarter and said it is considering selling additional non-core assets.</p>

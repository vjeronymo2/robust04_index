			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Jail break did not breach ceasefire The government dismissed fears from rightwing Tory MPs and some unionists that the failed attempt by IRA prisoners to shoot their way out of Whitemoor jail in Cambridgeshire on Friday night would affect the peace process. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said that the attempted breakout broke the ceasefire and showed that the IRA had not changed its spots. However, Downing Street said that the attempted jail break did not breach the ceasefire and would have no effect on the search for a permanent peace.</p>

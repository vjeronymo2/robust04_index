			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--Even though Jordan supports economic  integration among Arab states, no concrete steps have been taken  to form an economic alliance grouping the Kingdom with Syria and  Lebanon, informed sources said Friday.    "Economic integration is a Jordanian requirement, but the  Kingdom will not enter into economic or political groupings  before preparing solid foundations for them first," said a  source close to the government and the Royal court.    Agence France Press reported Thursday that Jordan, Syria and  Lebanon had been discussing the formation of an economic  cooperation council similar to the now defunct Arab Cooperation  Council (ACC) which grouped Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq. The  ACC, which reportedly antagonised some Gulf states, collapsed  immediately after the eruption of the Gulf crisis in 1990.    The agency quoted unidentified political sources in Jordan  as  saying the proposed alliance would aim at "countering the  repercussions of the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement" on  the economies of the three countries.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) signed an  economic agreement with Israel in Paris in April and the deal  was ill-received by Syria and Lebanon and invited the  condemnation of some economic experts in Jordan.    Jordan's past experiences with regional alliances rendered  it  cautious when discussing the formation of such groupings, the  source said. The source said the formation of the council was  floated by Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz who was  briefed by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri on  discussions the latter held on the issue with Jordanian  parliamentarians during his visit here last month.    But the discussion with Mr. Birri did not go beyond the  expression of some Jordanian parliamentarians of their belief in  the viability of economic cooperation with Lebanon, sources said.    Other informed sources said Syria had floated the issue with  the Kingdom recently, but Jordan reiterated its position that  solid groundwork had to be carried out before translating such  ideas into reality.    "How could you have economic integration with Syria which  does not have an ambassador in Jordan yet and where Jordanian  television transmission is jammed?" the source said.    "Syria still has strong ties with allies who would not  support such a project," said the source in reference to Gulf  states which worked against the Arab Cooperation Council.    "But since the intention is there, technical committees  could  start working to discuss practical steps for realising the  grouping," said the source, pointing out that Jordan believes in  joint Arab action not only on the economic arena but also on the  security and political ones.    The source said that economic integration with Syria and  Lebanon would be governed by regional and international politics  and Jordan is aware of the limit to which Arab-Arab relations  could go.    Jordan and Syria took large steps towards economic  integration in the late 1970s but the Kingdom was then punished  by neighbouring countries which stopped their aid to the Kingdom  in anger, the source said.    "Neither Jordan nor Syria believe in taking short cuts" in  implementing projects of such magnitude, added the source.    The joint Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee will hold talks  on economic cooperation in Amman on Monday. In addition to  Syrian Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' will attend the meeting in what was seen as an  indication of the political significance that the talks would  have.    Sources said it is possible that ways of dealing with the  economic impact of the PLO-Israel deal on the two countries  could be discussed during the meeting, but they will not amount  to discussing the formation of an economic alliance.</p>

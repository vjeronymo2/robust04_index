			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Summer sales push down RPI Heavy discounting in the summer sales led to record price falls for household goods, clothing and footwear, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The retail prices index fell to 144.0 last month, down 0.5 per cent from June, with January 1987 taken as 100. This surprised City analysts, who had predicted a 0.2 per cent fall during the month. Measured on a yearly basis underlying retail price inflation - which excludes mortgage interest payments - was running at 2.2 per cent in July, compared with the previous July, down from 2.4 per cent in June. The CSO said a significant reason for the fall was heavy high street discounting, which affected most consumer goods and may have been particularly exaggerated in the statistics by the timing of the summer sales. Although the sharpest annual price decreases in last year's summer sales occurred in June, this year the sharpest decreases were in July. Thus although the price fall in July was bigger than that last July, adding June and July together showed that the scale of the price fall for the two months this year was the same as in June and July last year. City analysts yesterday pointed out that the fact that the price falls were spread across a number of sectors suggested that inflation pressures remained very subdued. Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global markets said that 'all of the good news' in the figures was in the core rate. ' 'Funnies' are not the cause of the drop in inflation,' he added. Household goods fell 1.7 per cent month-on-month, largely due to sharp reductions in most furniture, furnishing and electrical appliances. The CSO said this was the biggest monthly July reduction since statistically equivalent records started in 1956. Compared with last July, the price of household goods was 0.2 per cent lower. Clothing saw the steepest July fall since the series started in 1914. The clothing and footwear index fell 4.2 per cent compared with June. Leisure goods also saw the largest monthly fall since its series started in 1987. The CSO said a reason for this fall was monthly reductions in audio-visual equipment, tapes, discs, toys and sports goods. The price cuts by the Telegraph and Times newspapers accounted for about a quarter of the overall monthly price change in the leisure goods series. In the motoring sector prices fell 0.3 per cent in July, compared with June.</p>

The publication of this notice is intended to comply with Title 16, Section 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes (16 O.S. 20) which, in part, declares Federal agencies that publish notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  concerning their promulgation of powers of attorney, to be exempt from the statutory requirement of having to record such powers of attorney in every county in which the agencies wish to effect the conveyance or release of interests in land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Purusant to Section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), as amended by Section 212 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), the FDIC is empowered to act as conservator or receiver of any state or federally chartered depository institution which it insures. Furthermore, under Section 11A of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821a), as enacted under Section 215 of FIRREA, the FDIC is also appointed to manage the FSLIC Resolution Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon appointment as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC by operation of law becomes successor in title to the assets of the depository institutions on behalf of which it is appointed. As a Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, the FDIC became successor in title to both the corporate assets formerly owned by the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), as well as to the assets of the depository institutions for which the FSLIC was appointed receiver prior to January 1, 1989. In addition, pursuant to Section 13(c) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)), the FDIC also acquires legal title in its corporate capacity to assets acquired in furtherance of providing monetary assistance to prevent the closing of insured depository institutions or to expedite the acquisition by assuming depository institutions of assets and liabilities from closed depository institutions of which the FDIC is receiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to facilitate the conservation and liquidation of assets held by the FDIC in its aforementioned capacities, the FDIC has provided powers of attorney to selected employees of its Southwest Service Center Office.

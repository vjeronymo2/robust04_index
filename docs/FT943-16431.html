			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: China sets out car industry vision - Three to four 'internationally competitive' manufacturers planned by 2010 China plans to establish three to four 'internationally competitive' vehicle makers by 2010 and to encourage private purchases that would make cars a 'part of Chinese family life'. Under the new policy announced yesterday, China emphasised its determination to build an industry in which the development of large-scale manufacturers would be encouraged in a now fragmented industry. 'The immediate target is to allow, within this century, two to three auto-manufacturing groups to grow into large corporations with considerable capacity, (including) six to seven manufacturers who would become the backbone of the industry,' the policy stated. It added that, by 2010, three to four 'internationally competitive' vehicle makers should emerge as part of a policy that would 'link the strong with the strong'. Foreign manufacturers yet to secure a foothold are relieved that the policy will offer fresh opportunities after the present freeze on new entrants expires in 1996. Foreign involvement is welcomed, but foreign ownership in joint ventures will not be allowed to exceed 50 per cent and manufacturers are to be limited to two joint ventures. The policy document, prepared by the state planning commission and approved by the state council, or cabinet, is clearly aimed at rationalising China's chaotic vehicle manufacturing sector. The new policy says significant tax advantages will accrue to big-volume producers as part of efforts to provide inexpensive vehicles, including motorcycles, to a mass market. Imports of vehicles and components will be discouraged. China plans annual production of 3m motor vehicles by the year 2000. In 1993, it produced 1.31m, including 300,000 cars.</p>

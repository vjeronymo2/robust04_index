			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cowie buoyed by fleet leasing STRONG GROWTH in fleet leasing helped T Cowie, the motor group, to increase pre-tax profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 24.3m last year. The rise, from Pounds 18.2m, was ahead of expectations and the share price gained 14p to 211p. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said the group aimed to double its dealership network and to increase its leasing fleet from 60,000 to 100,000 vehicles - probably in that order. Cowie retains a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys following the failure of its Pounds 32m hostile bid in September. The holding has been written down to 60p a share. Group turnover of Pounds 605.9m (Pounds 564.9m) was pushed ahead by Royscot, the contract hire business acquired from Royal Bank of Scotland late in 1991. Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie Interleasing, said economies of scale and correct gauging of residual values lay behind the divisional profit rise to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 11m) on turnover of Pounds 245m (Pounds 208.8m). The motor dealing division suffered a squeeze on margins that reduced profits to Pounds 5.48m (Pounds 6.6m) on flat sales of Pounds 316.3m. Sir Tom Cowie, chairman, said Black Wednesday had induced a state of 'hysteria' in the used car market. In October and November, monthly price falls amounted to about Pounds 300 per vehicle. The good news was that things had improved since December because of the underlying shortage of quality used cars. Profits rose to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.23m) in the London Grey-Green bus and coach operation. Bus and coach distribution increased profits to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 835,000). Net debt fell from Pounds 355m to Pounds 309m, gearing of 306 per cent. Mr Hodgson said this should seen against an 'income stream of Pounds 460m going into 1993'. Interest costs were flat at Pounds 36.2m, but a Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m gain from reduced rates was expected this year. Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 13.31p (11.11p). A final dividend of 4.25p makes a total of 6.25p (4.875). COMMENT Cowie took a bow for being the first motor trader to restore pre-tax profits to somewhere near the 1988 peak of Pounds 25.8m. This year it is forecast to set a new record of Pounds 28m-Pounds 30m. But that may turn out to be an academic figure if it fulfils predictions and makes a significant acquisition in the meantime. The Henlys experience has left it reluctant to mount another hostile bid. With its share price shooting up by nearly 100p since September, it will be keen to use its paper either directly or indirectly. It may, for instance, go for the motor business of a conglomerate or a bank and make use of a vendor share placing. A prospective p/e of little more than 12 puts it at a discount to the market. The debt risk associated with Cowie is much diminished and it remains worth holding for its prospects both of further profits recovery and of growth by acquisition.</p>

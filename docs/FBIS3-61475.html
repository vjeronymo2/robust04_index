Poloskov, </F> NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791.75.03-52]    [Abstract] A combination of stringent requirements imposed  on the welded joint quality, a wide range of welded materials  and product types, and diverse welding condition in erection  practices necessitated optimization of the types of  semiautomatic welding machines and their unification. To this  end, the association carried out a systemic analysis of domestic  and foreign semiautomatic welding machines and a structural  analysis of their principal functional systems. The study  revealed that today's industry needs could be met by four types  of semiautomatic welding machines for steel and aluminum sheet  joints (using wires). A modified design of pipe welding heads on  the basis of the ODA 46-72 base prototype, the SA-616 pipe  welding head, the SA-577 automatic welding machine for welding  pipes into tube plates, the Kama-1 chamber head for the SA-621  machine, and the self-propelled SA-615 welding head designed on  the basis of modular components are described in detail. All  designs employ the building block principle with the following  components: welding wire feed mechanism for all standard sizes;  three types of control equipment; and five types of wedding  heads with four types of welding wire with a single central  brake; in addition, replaceable and fast wearing parts, e.g.,  feed rollers, guides, current leads, etc., are also unified in  the mechanisms and burners. It is noted that the possibilities  of unifications have not been fully exhausted. Figures 5.</p>

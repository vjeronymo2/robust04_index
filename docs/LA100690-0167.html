			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY ADOPTED THE BARD, NOW FORSAKES HIM  </P> <P> The Grove Shakespeare Festival approached the City Council of Garden Grove for  assistance out of desperation, a desperation to fulfill a commitment made by  the trustees and volunteers of the Grove Shakespeare Festival to the people of  Garden Grove -- and their representatives, the City Council.  </P> <P> It is important to remember that this theater began as a civic operation: The  city established the theater, hired the original staff, appointed the trustees  and built the complex. Why? As a promotional effort for the revitalization of  central Garden Grove, to help change the image from "Garbage Grove."  Additionally, by improving the quality of life in this city, business might be  attracted and people would move back to the center of town. There was not a  band of wild and crazy "arts types" demanding that Shakespeare be given a home.  There was instead a city manager with vision and a council willing to fund and  support the effort, a council that approved a specific plan for revitalization.  </P> <P> There was a master plan for the Main Street area where boutiques, movie  theaters, the Mills House Art Gallery, additional restaurants and shops were to  be developed to bring people to this area. But what exists today? While many  people have moved back to this area of town, and the civic center complex has  been completed, the Acacia restaurant, built in the early '80s, is sitting  vacant and vandalized, the Mills House Gallery does not exist and has been  replaced by another generic meeting center, the vacant lots that were cleared  years ago sit vacant! The shops and boutiques designed to generate evening  activity in the area do not exist. Expecting the theater to survive without an  adequate restaurant for patrons is naive. How is the theater supposed to  attract a larger audience to support itself when the city has failed to live up  to its original plan?  </P> <P> How has the theater fared over 12 seasons without anything else to attract  audiences? Actually, quite well. In fact, you might say that the theater is the  only part of the plan that worked. During the 1980-81 fiscal year, the city  contributed about $124,000 in operational expenses to the theater board. By  1985, (the amount) dropped to $67,356, and this year the council has  contributed less than $30,000 or 5% of total operational monies. Not only has  the theater received less fiscal support, it has eliminated such city services  as daily maintenance, vehicle usage, printing, insurance (a $20,000 expense  alone) and city staffing. Quite a bargain considering the national publicity  and good will received by the city over the past 12 years.  </P> <P> It is astonishing to me that Councilmen (Raymond T.) Littrell, (Robert F.)  Dinsen and (J. Tilman) Williams cannot admit the great service done by this  board of trustees. These people, and William Shakespeare, should have a statue  erected in their honor for their diligence, hard work and service to community.  Instead, they are made to grovel before a few self-righteous politicians who  have created a circus of ill will by denouncing the board's efforts. These  trustees are appointed by the City Council of Garden Grove. Yet speaking before  Littrell, Dinsen and Williams, the council majority, is tantamount to being  pilloried. Trustees who have lived in this city for years and have given both  time and money to the theater are treated with appalling disrespect and  suspicion by these men -- men who asked these people to serve as "trustees" for  the public good.  </P> <P> I would like to remind these councilmen that they built this theater and asked  these people to breathe life into it. Do they not have a responsibility to help  in maintaining its operations? Why have they not embraced their own blue-ribbon  committee recommendations? Instead, they have let their prejudice against  Shakespeare boil over into every public debate. I remind these men that  American culture is a rich tapestry forged by an immigrant nation. I also would  remind them that our language is English, and the greatest spokesman for the  English language is William Shakespeare.  </P> <P> THOMAS F. BRADAC  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P> <P> Thomas F. Bradac is the producing artistic director of the Grove Shakespeare  Festival.  </P> <P> </P></p>

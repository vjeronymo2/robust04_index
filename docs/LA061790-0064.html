			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SMUGGLERS DODGE MIDEAST TROUBLES;  </P> <P> BLACK MARKET: MULE TRAINS PROVIDE BADLY NEEDED GOODS AND KEEP SHAKY ECONOMY  GOING. RISKY TREK RUNS THE BORDERS WHERE LEBANON, SYRIA AND ISRAEL INTERSECT.  </P> <P> On most nights, the Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King clamber along  the rocky smugglers' trail in the foothills of Mt. Hermon between Lebanon,  Syria and Israel.  </P> <P> Carrying American cigarettes, Scotch whiskey and electrical appliances for  Syria on their backs, they run the gantlet of Syrian and Israeli soldiers dug  in along a front that threads across the snow-capped, 9,200-foot mountain.  </P> <P> On the return leg, they carry diesel fuel from Iran and other goods that are  prized in lawless Lebanon, where civil war began in 1975, and central authority  collapsed long ago.  </P> <P> The Nightingale, the Flying Carpet and the King are mules specially trained for  the six-hour trek on and around Mt. Hermon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria  and Israel intersect.  </P> <P> Because of their special skills, each mule is worth about $3,000, twice the  average for a pack animal in southeast Lebanon. Those skills include  recognizing and running from anyone in military uniform and leading pack trains  of up to 100 mules.  </P> <P> "It's a no-man's-land out there," said Adnan Daher, a 16-year-old smuggler.  "The Israelis are on a hill to the west, the Syrians on a hill to the east, and  Lebanon behind us."  </P> <P> No accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available, but diplomats in  Syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  </P> <P> Shebaa, a predominantly Sunni Muslim town in the Israeli-occupied sector of  south Lebanon, has been a smugglers' haven for decades. The men of Shebaa have  traditionally defied authority.  </P> <P> About 5,000 of Shebaa's original population of 200,000 still live there, said  Mohammed Zoheiri, a sprightly man of 90 who has been mukhtar, or mayor, for 45  years.  </P> <P> The others went to Beirut, other parts of Lebanon or the oil-rich Persian Gulf  states because "work opportunities are scarce here," Zoheiri said while sipping  tea with visitors.  </P> <P> He said the "mulers" as he calls them, "have known no other way of making a  living. They were born on mule back."  </P> <P> Some of his 40 grandsons are muleteers, as his father was, Zoheiri said. "It's  Shebaa's profession."  </P> <P> Over the border in Syria is Sirghaya, the nerve center of Syrian smugglers,  where half the 15,000 people live off the contraband business.  </P> <P> "They'd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop us," said a  merchant in nearby Madaya, the main outlet for the smuggled goods. He was  unwrapping high-heeled Italian shoes that had just crossed the frontier.  </P> <P> Although it costs money in lost tax revenue, diplomats say, the illegal trade  also helps the troubled Syrian economy.  </P> <P> A recent report by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said: "The off-the-books  economy is both a sore point and a salvation. The black market provides badly  needed goods and in many ways keeps the economy going."  </P> <P> Because of the steady flow of contraband, the planners of Syria's socialist  economy do not have to divert precious foreign exchange for imports. President  Hafez Assad's government generally turns a blind eye as long as the trade keeps  to border towns.  </P> <P> Diplomats in Damascus said there is also a sizable illicit trade in goods from  Israel through the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon.  </P> <P> Iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are particularly prized in  Syria. The U.S. Embassy report said Syrian construction workers "would be out  of jobs but for smuggled building materials."  </P> <P> Daher, the 16-year-old smuggler from Shebaa, said after a recent nocturnal  expedition: "We provide whatever our Syrian partners demand."  </P> <P> He said the Shebaa men hand over their loads to Syrian mule trains.  </P> <P> Each mule carries about 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds. Each smuggler owns two  mules and clears about $100 a week, four times the average wage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "Syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow melts," said a  smuggler who identified himself only as Ahmed. "We move to another unloading  spot close to the Israeli-controlled hill. The Syrians don't go there."  </P> <P> A few days earlier, a Syrian customs patrol fired on a pack train from Shebaa  and killed a mule, but the smugglers escaped with the rest of their animals.  </P> <P> Shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules, said Amin, a 51-year-old who has been  in the trade since boyhood.  </P> <P> "It's a dangerous profession, but Shebaa's smugglers rarely get killed," he  said. "We know our way and the lead mules are well-trained."  </P> <P> Most Shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land mines, he said.  </P> <P> Amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule, which should be  "big, strong, healthy and smart."  </P> <P> A mule chosen as a leader is kept in an "isolated, dark stable without food or  water for two days," he said.  </P> <P> "Then a man, who shouldn't be a smuggler because the mule would get used to his  smell, goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the mule with a stick," Amin  said. "A smuggler goes in after him and gives the mule food and water." He said  the "soldier" fires a rifle near the mule during the beating. "The 'soldier'  becomes the mule's enemy," he explained, "and the animal tries to escape the  minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired. At this point, the mule becomes  eligible to lead a caravan."  </P></p>

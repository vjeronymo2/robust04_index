			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Inquiry attacks role of BBC governors AN UNOFFICIAL commission of inquiry into the future of the BBC yesterday criticised the role of the BBC governors. The commission, chaired by Mr Wilf Stevenson, director of the British Film Institute, also expressed concern about the BBC's policy of producer choice, which gives producers the right to buy in services from outside the corporation. The commission expressed 'serious worries' that the policy would favour outsiders bidding at marginal cost over insiders shouldering BBC overheads, leading to 'a running-down of the BBC'. The inquiry said it had heard no adequate defence of the role of the BBC governors, which caused confusion because they were in effect a second layer of management. It 'found little confidence in their representativeness, openness or independence from government'. The report is to be submitted to the Department of National Heritage in response to the green paper on the future of the BBC. The total number of BBC employees in the corporation's top two pay grades has risen over the past three years while more than 3,000 staff jobs have been lost, according to BBC figures. In 1990 there were 1,363 people in the top two grades. By March that had risen to 1,424.</p>

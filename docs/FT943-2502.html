			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Observer: Haitian overture Intervention in Haiti? Been there, done that. President Clinton has asked Poland to send along a few armed policemen to help winkle out Port au Prince's finest. Trouble is, they've been there before. And it was trouble, too. Today the Polish cabinet considers Clinton's invitation, aware that a previous Polish intervention - as part of an 1802 Napoleonic task force, whose mission was to defeat a slave rising led by Francois Toussaint L'Ouverture - ended in tears. Many of the 6,000 Polish troops who passed through the island died of yellow fever; still others decided the slaves had a point, and joined forces. Around 500 settled for good, and Polish surnames and Slavic complexions are sprinkled across some Haitian villages, where catholicism remains strong. Ethnographers say some Polish curses remain in use, while several hymn tunes are recognisably Polish in origin. A mere 500 returned from the Caribbean in the aftermath of a tragic episode, which taught Poles that the alliance with Napoleon - designed to win them their freedom - could lead to quite the opposite for others. President Lech Walesa, keen to join Nato, backs Clinton's request and is urging the government to follow suit, no doubt in the belief that this time the Poles will be on the side of the angels. Or at least quickly return home.</p>

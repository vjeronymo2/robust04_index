			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Provision of CDollars 200m at chartered bank NATIONAL Bank of Canada, the country's sixth largest chartered bank, says its loans to Olympia &amp; York Developments and group affiliates totalled CDollars 473m (USDollars 394.1m) at April 30, writes Robert Gibbens. The bank has made a CDollars 200m special provision for fiscal 1992 to cover possible losses. It has also classified CDollars 210m of O&amp;Y loans as non-performing. The bank said the exposure included loans to O&amp;Y group affiliates such as Gulf Canada Resources and Abitibi-Price, as well as loans made earlier this year for work at Canary Wharf. The impact of the O&amp;Y provision, and strong competition in domestic markets, brought a 41 per cent fall in earnings for the second quarter ended April 30 and a 25 per cent decline in the first half of fiscal 1992. Second-quarter profit was CDollars 29.8m, or 16 cents a share, against CDollars 50.3m, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. First-half profit was CDollars 79.6m, or 48 cents a share, against CDollars 105.6m, or 69 cents, a year earlier.</p>

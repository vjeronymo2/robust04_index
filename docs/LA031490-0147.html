			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ACCUSED MORTICIAN WANTS OWN LAWYER  </P> <P> The arraignment of a Pasadena funeral home worker charged with fatally  poisoning a rival mortician with oleander leaves was delayed Tuesday and an  April 6 hearing set on his request to be represented by a private attorney  rather than the county public defender.  </P> <P> David Wayne Sconce, 33, originally asked that Roger John Diamond, of Santa  Monica, serve as his court-appointed lawyer.  </P> <P> He argued that Diamond, who represented him in a related criminal proceeding  last year, is familiar with the case.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Barry B. Klopfer appointed Deputy Public Defender Susan Tandy  Olson instead, prompting an appeal by Diamond. It is scheduled to be heard by  Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch.  </P> <P> Sconce faces the death penalty and is indigent.  </P> <P> Sconce is charged with murdering Timothy R. Waters, 24, a Burbank mortician, to  keep him from exposing activities at the Lamb Funeral Home where Sconce worked.  Waters died in his mother's home in Ventura County, so Sconce is being tried  here.  </P> <P> Sconce is serving a five-year prison term after pleading guilty last year to  the mingling of human remains, the theft of body parts and the removal of gold  teeth from cadavers at the funeral home.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IFP Chairman Frank Mdlalose an ANC Deputy </F> Secretary General Jacob Zuma by SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe  in the Durban studio -- live]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Tonight we welcome you from our studios  in Durban, where we've had a historic meeting between the leader  of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  and the president of the ANC [African National Congress], Dr.  Nelson Mandela. All sorts of agreements have been reached,  which are said to be provisional, still going to be checked with  their principals. [passage omitted] It was said throughout the  day that the two leaders were smiling and holding each other's  hand as if promising South Africa something that they could be  proud of -- smiling about. I'm being joined now in the studio by  Mr. Jacob Zuma, Deputy Secretary General of the ANC, and the  national chairman of the IFP, Dr. Mdlalose. Gentlemen, good  evening and welcome. The progress -- what sort progress are we  talking about here if you look at this statement, Dr. Mdlalose?    [Mdlalose] Well, I think there's progress. First, I think  the spirit in which the leaders discussed, the spirit in which  the delegations intermingled and discussed was very, very  promising; it was really good. And when we came to the actual  substance of things that we went into, there was no skirting of  issues. Issues were dealt with straight on, and people spoke  honestly, and they spoke from their hearts but through their  brains. They were not emotional; they were being realistic.  And I think a lot of progress came out.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, how would you describe the kind of  progress we are talking about here, constructive or satisfactory?    [Zuma] I think it was both, more constructive in a sense  because both delegations approached the matters in a very  serious manner with all the determination to find a solution.  And I think that issues were discussed very frankly, and I  think both delegations realized the responsibility that the two  organizations have in connection with trying to solve the  problems of the country, trying to deal with matters of  violence, and I think what has been reflected in the statement  as the kind of understanding in a joint statement actually  reflects I think in a very exceptional manner a kind  of....[pauses] The two delegations sat down and said we need to  find a solution. A kind of a delegation that said we are not  sitting here now to find a solution now, we said we are making a  solid foundation so that this meeting is not going to be a  one-off meeting, is actually the beginning of a process that is  going to move now and, if needed, to go beyond the 27th of  April. I thought that was quite a realistic approach that both  delegations realized and indeed were determined to continue as  much as possible -- in search for the solution.    [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, let us now leave out the diplomatic  issues and tell South Africans the real story. When you say you  are out to promote conditions in which people of South Africa as  a whole could exercise their democratic right and to make  political choices in accordance with their beliefs and  consciousness, what exactly do you mean? You're saying the ANC  can put up boards and advertise in Ulundi, open an office there.  Can the ANC also reciprocate in the same way? What exactly do  you mean?    [Mdlalose] But that's exactly what we mean, Lesley. We mean  that people should be free to give their own philosophies to the  public. People should be free to advocate for participation in  elections if they want to and to promote their own philosophies.  But equally, we think people must be free to be able to say why  they may not be wanting to participate if they do not want to  participate. That freedom should be there for everybody and  they should be able to say it whether at Ulundi, or around Shell  House, or wherever, without any fear.    [Mashokwe] Are you saying to your followers out there that  they must from tomorrow allow the ANC in your areas and in the  same vein the ANC remove their no-go areas wherever they may be?    [Mdlalose] Our party has been saying that all the time, and  we want to redouble our efforts to let the people know that is  what we stand for.    [Mashokwe] No-go areas, Mr. Zuma, within the ANC?    [Zuma] What we've been saying Lesley, is that in the period  running up to where we are, we've had a situation where  perceptions have been created that if political players are  saying we are not participating in the elections, it means that  those who are participating must be stopped from doing so, and  those who are not participating must also not be given a chance  to canvas their own views among the people on the reasons why  they are not participating. What this meeting has said --  which I think is important -- it has underlined an important  principle of democracy that people have a right to choose  whether to participate or not to participate. But those who are  participating don't have a right to prevent others to choose not  to participate. And we are saying the question of no-go areas  therefore must go. People must be able to reach any part of  this country, in this province, and promote any of these two  views, that we see as opposing views. And this is what we've  said. We've said it doesn't necessarily mean that people must  slaughter one another simply because they've got two political  different views. And I think it is an important kind of an  achievement that we made in this meeting.    [Mashokwe] But what the leaders say and what happens at the  ground are two different things. You've been professing freedom  of political expression on both sides, yet on the ground IFP  supporters will not allow ANC supporters to politic in their  areas and vice versa. How do you get the message down to the  ground.    [Mdlalose] Well, as we've said earlier, we are going to  redouble our efforts to get to the ground. We are preaching  even as I'm talking to you now, preaching through the TV that  people are watching. They have to be tolerant one to the other.  Whether you belong to ANC, IFP, Azapo [Azanian People's  Organization], PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], whatever, you must  be able to listen to the other man and say he's entitled to  explain his views to everybody around here. That is the message  we're carrying on to the people wherever we are going to be.    [Mashokwe] It is evident that there are still differences on  constitutional matters between the two parties here. There was  talk about possible intervention by the international  constitutional experts. What exactly gives? How are you going  to unbundle this mess?    [Mdlalose] Thank you for asking that. First of all, we have  discussed this and we've thought of an option that is before us  -- to consult with international organizations and get them  perhaps to help us to see through this impasse which we've  reached. We have not reached unanimity on that point. The ANC  people are going to discuss it among themselves. We'll also  discuss it more fully among ourselves and be able next time we  meet to come up with definite ideas about how we must approach  this subject.    [Mashokwe] On that question of calling in international  experts, Mr. Zuma?    [Zuma] We've certainly agreed that we need to take these two  points to our principals: one, the issue that is being raised of  the involvement of the international community at two levels.  One level is at the level of violence -- in other words, to  seek to reach the international community, an organization with  the expertise of conflict resolution as well as the aspect of  the deadlock on constitutional matters. And we've said we will  take these matters to our principals to be considered and come  back after that consideration to say how our principals look at  those matters, and equally the IFP has felt, as a result of that  kind of a discussion, there could be a provisional registration  of the IFP in terms of the Electoral Act so that if agreement is  reached, they are in a position to find it to participate. I  think all of that indicates or gives you the chemistry of the  discussions today that we were able to reach that point and have  this kind of particular aspect to be referred to our principals.    [Mashokwe] I want to come back to this issue of provisional  registration later after the break, but for now, how binding  would the views of the experts be? In mediation I would imagine  that if you say yes, this is what the expert say then it is  binding on both of you. Have you reached that stage when you  will say what the experts say binds both of you?    [Mdlalose] Actually we've reached that point. We've said  there will be no point in approaching international experts if  at the end of the day when they have given us their point of  view we would say but I didn't accept that. We would be able to  accept their point of view.    [Zuma] Definitely. That is what we discussed, and that's  what we came to understand.    [Mashokwe] And Mr. Zuma, Mr. Mdlalose, I have to go back to  an ad break, I'll be back just after this. Don't go away.  [commercial break]    Gentlemen, let's talk about this issue of provisional  registration of the IFP. Time is against you, 4 March is the  deadline again. Will it be possible for you to have registered  by then, or do you depend on the outcome of mediation?    [Mdlalose] Well, the issue of provisional registration is to  be discussed by the IFP's central committee. If we decide we  should make provisional registration, we will do so. That of  course must clearly be understood not to mean commitment to  taking part in the elections. It means commitment to saying, we  put our name there, and if at the end of the road we decide we  are going to go in for elections, we are clear that we go in for  elections. But later on if we find that there is no way we can  undertake to do elections, then we don't.    [Mashokwe] It seems to water down this whole historic  agreement, as it were. It will look like you are saying, we may  come in, we may not. What would push you to come in?    [Mdlalose] But we have been very clear about that. We have  said it so many, many times, that there are a number of things  that we have placed before the government and we have placed  before the African National Congress, and when those things are  undertaken we march on to elections. Before they are  undertaken, we have got problems.    [Mashokwe] Is this not a new ball game now from the one  that....    [Mdlalose, interrupting] A new ball game?    [Mashokwe] Yes, are we talking about new things in this one?    [Mdlalose] Oh no, come, we placed our ideas and our  suggestions before the government and before the ANC a long time  ago, and we consolidated them on 19 December 1993. We put them  in black and white in what we call the Yellow Paper. Everybody  knows about that. A new ball game? That's surprising!    [Mashokwe] I am trying to understand one little thing. What  are your non-negotiables as the IFP?    [Mdlalose] We have put those papers to the whole world. We  are saying, so far as the constitution is concerned the  provinces must have powers, and those powers must be unfettered,  and they should be able to be exercised by those provinces even  in the future, not to be removed so easily by the central  government without the proper acceptance by the provinces  themselves, and by all the structures of government. Secondly,  we are saying in order that those functions may be exercised the  provinces must have power to have money, to collect money, that  is, the fiscal powers of the provinces must be enhanced.  Thirdly, we are saying the provinces as such must be able to  have their own constitution, and to have a constitution, of  course, in line with the general constitution of the whole  country, but they must be able to make up their own  constitutions and put them before everybody.    [Mashokwe] But have these things not been addressed by these  concessions?    [Mdlalose] No, no. No, no. They have not been sufficiently  addressed.    [Mashokwe] The ANC, why don't you give the IFP what they  want  so that we march on to elections come 27 April? Is it difficult?    [Zuma] Leslie, I don't think it is a question of giving the  IFP want they want, it's a question of negotiating. I think we  have been involved in negotiations for quite a long time,  including the very package that the ANC has announced in the  recent past, which is again an indication of how flexible the  ANC can be. And I think the very fact that we had a meeting  today is an indication that all of us are keen to discuss and  find one another in the process. I think what is critical in  negotiations is a spirit of being ready to give as well as take,  and I think this is what we are doing, and this is what we would  like all parties to be able to do, and I think we have done  that, and I think we are in the process of perhaps even looking  at the responses that the IFP is making to our package that we  have come up with.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, Dr. Mdlalose says here and now that  those concessions do not meet with their demands, therefore the  two of you are not finding each other yet. What else do you  have to do? Do you know what you have to do in order to meet  their demands? Are you prepared to do that?    [Zuma] I think what we are prepared to do is to debate the  issues. I am not certain whether we have had enough time with  the IFP to sit down and look even at what the IFP says, it  doesn't mean anything, because if we debated the matters we  might actually emerge with a position where we could be even  much closer. I think it is a question of us looking at this  package, and looking at the criticism that the IFP is leveling  against the package, and arguing back, because we do not believe  if one has heard some noises, that all the objections that the  IFP is making are not debatable. We think they are still  debatable, and I am sure they would feel the same.    [Mashokwe] I see that you know in your h?ad, but could I  just  go back to Mr. Zuma? You've had a chance with the 19 December  -- the Yellow Paper that is being stated here. Have you  addressed their concerns? Are going to be addressing these  concerns at all?    [Zuma] We have, we have addressed the concerns, and this is  what we are saying -- negotiations, ever since they began more  than two years ago, the business has been to address the  concerns of other parties, and I think it goes on. And I think  even the fact that today we have come to discuss some  possibility of the international kind of people participating,  as well as even the IFP saying -- we could register after  consulting with our principal on the provisional basis -- is an  indication of the process. I think the process is on.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mdlalose?    [Mdlalose] Well, I agree entirely with what Jacob is saying.  The issue is this -- it's not just a matter of yes, no, to an  issue. It's an issue of, what does this involve? How far can  this be taken? Take for example the issue of powers, powers for  the provinces. It isn't just one power. There are several  powers that are mentioned, and then, when you consider those  powers in a sense you say how much of that power to be taken by  the province or by the state will do, as we would prefer to say?  Now then, you've discussed that and somebody might say, all  right, that power may be given but it should be in the context  that the national government will have a say over what you have  got. Then we have to negotiate that.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, it's almost like somebody who is  watching could say the IFP has an attitude of -- if you don't  give us what we want, we don't take part in the elections. Is  that true?    [Mdlalose] Well, that would be a wrong interpretation.    [Mashokwe] What is the right one?    [Mdlalose] We are saying, for the sake of South Africa, and  that must be importantly understood. For the sake of South  Africa, the constitution is best when it has this, that, or the  other feature. We have already, in fact, considered many things  even though we would not have liked to have considered those  issues, but we have considered them in a spirit of understanding  and reaching some consensus. So we see these powers have got to  come up and we have mentioned them, and then of course the other  party will say -- no, yes, you can have that, but not that far,  then they well know we can't. We must have it at least thus  far. So that there is negotiation. Negotiation is not just a  matter of saying A or B.    [Mashokwe] OK, I hear that it sounds very reasonable, but in  actual fact here we have....    [Mdlalose, interrupting] It is in fact, it is in fact  reasonable...    [Mashokwe, continuing] I say it sounds reasonable, but out  there the reality is that -- the chief minister said he does not  recognize the authority of the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council]. Now, the text here says: The responsibility for peace  and the end of violence rests with the government. Again  shifting the goal posts, shifting the blame to the government.  Are you not as leaders supposed to be taking this  responsibility on your shoulders and saying to your supporters:  Stop it?    [Mdlalose] But I don't think you have read that statement  correctly. We have said it clearly that there is a  responsibility on our part to redouble our efforts, those are  the words we have said. It means we go on to our  constituencies, we go on to the people on the ground, we go on  to the structures of our parties, we meet ever so often with our  branches and let them know that they must tolerate one another.  We take part in the peace committee structures. There is a  regional Dispute Resolution Committee, there are also the local  dispute resolution committees. For example here in Natal we  have got six centers that are actually manned by various people.  Since certain instances some of our members don't turn up, in  certain instances some of the ANC members do not turn up. So we  have got to get to our people and say: Look, turn up. And that  is not government, it's our parties. We are going to press them  to go and take part in these dispute resolution committees...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK....    [Mdlalose, continuing] ...and then we say the government  might as well do its part. We are not saying that's only the  government.    [Mashokwe] Let me hear it from the ANC. Are you also  redoubling your efforts, redoubling the issue of no revenge  killings? How do you interpret it?    [Zuma] Definitely, that's what we are saying. There are  efforts which have been undertaken by both organizations,  because it doesn't necessarily mean nothing has happened between  the two organizations in an attempt to stamp out violence. We  are saying we are going to redouble that effort. in other  words, as two organizations we want to ensure that the peace  structures that we are party to, and every other thing,  including new initiatives, we are going to do everything we can.  But we are then saying, there is a voice that comes from the  government if there is a kind of violence. They will say this  is between the IFP and the ANC, let them sort it out. We are  saying, while we have got the responsibility to deal with the  matters that we have just spelt out, the government at the end  has the responsibility to ensure that there is law and order in  this country, not to pass the buck and say -- violence is there,  we can't do anything about it, it is a matter between the IFP  and the ANC.    [Mashokwe] Okay, I have to ask again on this issue of  provisional registration. Will this influence in any way your  relationship with the other members of the Freedom Alliance?    [Mdlalose] Well, it may. We are working as a party to make  decisions on our own as a party, but naturally we communicate  our ideas to our partners in the Freedom Alliance.    [Mashokwe] Do you think they will be disappointed with your  move?    [Mdlalose] I won't talk on their behalf, they are big enough  to make those decisions.    [Mashokwe] Let us try and get to the root of this. You have  moved from an alliance that said it will not take part before A,  B, C, and Z, etc. You've taken a stand now -- provisional  registration. Is that not in the same tone. It seems to me  it's not in the same tone with your friends in the Freedom  Alliance.    [Mdlalose] The first thing to recognize is the we have not  decided on having those provisional registrations done yet. We  are going to refer them to our Central Committee -- we have said  that before. There has not been a decision as yet, but we are  an independent party. If we think that is the right thing to be  done, that will be so, then we'll inform the other parties. We  have power to make our decisions; they also have power to make  their own decisions.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, let me go back to you. The issue of the  ANC and socio-economic reconstruction development. Are we in a  situation now where we could say you are going to be able to  pursue this, say within the Natal region?    [Zuma] Certainly, that is our aim. That is what we would  like to do. All that we are doing, basically we would like to  have peace and stability. We don't think it is a good thing  that our people should be killing one another, because if  there's violence there is no peace and stability, then you  cannot address the question of reconstruction and development.  That has to take place within the context and environment that  is conducive. If there is violence, there is destruction of  property, burning of houses, etc.; then you cannot have that  kind of situation. That is why the issue of stopping violence  is a cardinal question that here, particularly Natal, we've got  to work so closely all of us to ensure that we succeed.    [Mashokwe] OK, let us look at the new task group. In the  past when the leaders had met they have come up with meeting --  with task groups or committees. How effective is this one going  to be which is charged with bringing back peace in this area [as  heard]? How are you going to go about it practically on the  ground?    [Zuma] We believe that in order to follow up the decisions  taken today and the discussions and other agreements reached  before, we do need the task force that is going to ensure that  the kind of double efforts that we are talking about are  actually put in place. It has to meet and plan as to how do we  in practice take these decisions and implement them and ensure  that decisions, like the two leaders visiting various areas, are  undertaken. I think we, by the task force, we are trying to  ensure that our decisions don't suffer delay in implementation  -- and also which implementation -- that they should be  implemented quickly and effectively.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose?    [Mdlalose] And that also there should be facilitation of the  national peace structures at local levels.    [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this. It would  appear you have avoided in this statement here the issue of the  king and the monarchy. What is the agreement there, because  they live close to the hearts of....    [Mdlalose, interrupting] We discussed the issue of the king  and we have not included it in our statement. It's a lot of  concern and there are a lot of sensitivities about that. But we  went into that and we did not feel it was our duty really to  make pronouncements on that issue.    [Mashokwe] But it is an issue that South Africans would want  to know about. Mr. Zuma, is it not important to tell us what  you discussed at least?    [Zuma] The issue was discussed as Dr. Mdlalose says we will  not necessarily put it in a statement, but there was an  indication from the ANC's position for an example that the ANC  recognizes and respects the king, and I think you should be  aware that in the ANC's position the respect of the traditional  leadership has been pronounced. Even the interim constitution  that is there does provide this, and we believe that in the  provincial constitution which will deal with the peculiarities  of Natal as Natal, that issue will certainly be accommodated.  But we did not necessarily discuss it with an aim to conclude  the issue, because we know the issue is under discussion.  That's why we thought it was not necessary to put it in the  statement here.    [Mashokwe] Does provisional constitutions [as heard] make  enough room for the kingdom of Zululand in your view, Dr.  Mdlalose?    [Mdlalose] Provincial constitutions?    [Mashokwe] Yes, the ones that have been agreed upon.    [Mdlalose] Well, from the point of view of IFP we have  provision for the position of the king.    [Mashokwe] Are you satisfied with those pronouncements that  the ANC has come up with in that regard?    [Mdlalose] There is a lot still to be discussed. I mean,  the ANC have made their comments about it, but there is nothing  that's finalized, as Mr. Zuma said.    [Mashokwe] Gentlemen, I have to ask you this in conclusion.  Which of you believe that there is a need for a Zulu volkstaat  [homeland]? Do you believe there is a need, Mr. Zuma?    [Mdlalose] A Zulu volkstaat? We have not spoken about a Zulu  volkstaat [laughter from Zuma]. And that is not equivalent to a  Zulu kingdom.    [Mashokwe] OK, let me get this quickly, you're left with 10  seconds.    [Zuma] No, but the Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there.  It is not a question of debate about it. I think what is being  debated is the role and the place of it constitutionally. I  don't think there's anyone who debates or disputes the fact of  the Zulu kingdom.    [Mdlalose] The Zulu kingdom is there. It has been there for  centuries. And no one is going to abolish that.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Mdlalose, Mr. Zuma, thank you for talking to  us. That was Newsline from Durban and thank you for watching,  good night.</p>

The IMF's figures show that the investments  of the large U.S. investment firms in the portfolios of the  developing nations rose from $1.5 billion to $120 billion during  the last five years. Furthermore, Morocco has greatly benefited  from the interest of private investors, and has come to be  called "the EC's Mexico."    In an IMF study dealing with the flow of investments to 46  developing nations over the course of five years, it was  reported that this flow of investments was accompanied by a boom  in direct foreign investments, and that, after the value of  investments had totalled $25 billion, they came to total of $50  billion, according to an IMF newsletter that is published from  time to time and that was published in Washington last Wednesday.    Analysts working for the IMF make a connection between the  big influx of foreign investments and the economic reforms  adopted by a large number of the developing nations which have  strengthened the economies of these nations, and the fact that  about 40 percent of the economic growth experienced by the world  at the present time is taking place in the developing nations,  since a large number of the industrial nations themselves are  drowning in the swamp of an economic recession.    Guy Pfeifermann, a high-level economics expert in the IMF,  points out that "investors who are looking for investment  opportunities are closely examining and scrutinizing these  markets, and this is something that is only natural."    Most of the increase in private investments is attributable  to domestic sources, but the huge increase in direct foreign  investments in the developing nations, in Pfeifermann's opinion,  represents a "historic turning point" in which investors are  showing that they have complete confidence in the economies of  the developing nations, and this is a confidence which did not  exist five years ago.    Pfeifermann also calls our attention to the fact that the  investment portfolios in the developing nations, during the last  two years, have experienced a vertical upswing. This fact is  closely related to the attractive investment climate that exists  in a large number of the developing nations, and is closely  related to the lowering of U.S. interest rates and decisions by  the large U.S. investment firms to diversify their investment  portfolios.    The IMF's figures indicate that these firms' investments in  the portfolios of the developing nations have increased from  $1.5 billion to $120 billion during the last five years.  However, in view of the fact that these investments constitute  only 0.5 percent of their total investment portfolios, observers  find no reason to worry about whether or not these investments  will continue.    The big surge in private investments appeared mostly in East  Asia and Latin America. The flow of investments to the nations  of North Africa and the Middle East remained average or below  average in relation to the 46 nations covered by the IMF study,  but there was a great discrepancy in the amount of the  investments that flowed into each of these countries (in North  Africa and the Middle East).    Morocco benefited greatly from interest on the part of the  private investors. It has recently experienced great improvement  in this regard and has become, or almost become, "the EEC's  Mexico," because clothes-producing firms have set up plants in  Morocco in order to export their products to the EEC, according  to Pfeifermann.    Lebanon has stood out among the other nations, and the IMF  believes that the beginnings of prosperity exist there.    Pfeifermann points out that a recently-published government  report indicates that the rate of economic growth in Lebanon  surpassed 7 percent last year. He says: "There is no doubt that  Lebanon is once again having an economic boom after its civil  war came to an end. One positive sign is that a number of  Lebanese companies have asked the IMF for financial aid of the  type that the IMF usually provides."    But Egypt, on the other hand, earned no praise from the  analysts working for the IMF. Robert Miller, one of the chief  analysts who contributed to the study, says that "Egypt was far  less promising than the other nations in the area because of the  enormous number of state-owned establishments, which are moving  only very slowly in the direction of privatization."    Miller is worried about the negative effect that political  problems in Egypt are having on the investment climate there.    Those participating in the study say that the Middle East,  as  a whole, has been hurt by the world's falling oil prices.    The study was confined to 46 nations, chiefly because the  information utilized was not available in the case of the other  developing nations. The study analyzes in detail the situation  in five Middle Eastern and North African nations, which are  Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Turkey. One of the criteria  used by the study to evaluate the capability of any of the  economies to attract foreign investments was that of comparing  these investments to the GNP.    In Egypt, private investments were 7.8 percent of the GNP in  1992. This is a low percentage in comparison with the  percentages in Thailand (32 percent) and Korea (25 percent). The  rate of private investments in Tunisia was 10.7 percent of the  GNP, and in Turkey this figure was 11.7 percent. The average  rate for the 46 nations covered by the study was 13.2 percent.    Taking the above-mentioned into consideration, Morocco's  rate  of private investments to its GNP was 13.4 percent (that is,  above average). Perhaps Iran's good performance, which was  accompanied by a noticeable increase in public investments, was  in response to the reforms that in 1992 appeared to evidence  considerable success. But it is also possible that this good  performance is attributable to false information or statistics,  according to officials in the IMF.    The study draws attention to the influx of private  investments in a number of nations in the Middle East or nations  adjacent to it. The performance of the Turkish stock market was  the strongest performance shown by any of the young markets  during the last few years. But this stock market has lost 60  percent of its value in U.S. dollars during the last few months,  a fact that indicates that its performance has been similar to  that of a great many of the young markets in that it is  capricious and not subject to controls.</p>

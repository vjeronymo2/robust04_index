			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NOTES ON ACTING, AND GARDEN AND ANIMAL EVENTS;  </P> <P> CHILD ACTORS  </P> <P> ANYONE WHO HAS watched a child play dress-up or ham it up for grandparents will  attest to the fact that every kid has a certain amount of acting ability.  Impromptu melodramas with friends or parts in the school play are usually  sufficient outlets for this urge to act. But for more serious youngsters,  theater workshops can help develop talent. Several Southern California theaters  offer acting classes in summer workshops and in sessions that meet after school  or on weekends.  </P> <P> Because most entering students are without experience, directors of acting  workshops generally request an interview with the child and the parent. "We are  looking for enthusiasm," says Cheryl Moffatt, director of young people's  programs at the Santa Monica Playhouse, adding, "enthusiasm by the child -- not  the parent."  </P> <P> Programs usually include basic acting, improvisation and dance/movement. Some  schools offer electives such as musical theater, makeup and combat (fencing).  </P> <P> These are not classes for children whose parents want them to be the next child  star. "We are not in the business of grinding out professional actors," says  Kris Hagen, community services manager for the South Coast Repertory Young  Conservatory. "We help children develop their creative abilities by  experimenting, using their bodies, voices and emotions. These talents enrich  them no matter what field of work they choose later in life."  </P> <P>  Acting classes and theater workshops are offered at Santa Monica Playhouse in  Santa Monica (age 6 to 16, and 13 to 18); Pasadena Playhouse Young Actors  School in Pasadena (7 to 18); Orange County Children's Theatre in Fountain  Valley (7 to 18); South Coast Repertory Young Conservatory in Costa Mesa(8 to  17), and La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla (8 to 18).  </P></p>

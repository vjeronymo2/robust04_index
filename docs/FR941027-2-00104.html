The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Rules 131 and 154 allow stop and stop limit orders <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  in selected derivative securities to be elected by a quotation, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  provided the prior approval of a Floor Official is obtained. Absent this provision, such orders could only be elected when a transaction in the security occurred at or through the stop price, notwithstanding the fact that the quoted market had moved through the stop price as a result of trading in the underlying security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Stop sell orders generally are entered in a stock whose price has increased substantially to protect the investor's profits should the stock price decline. Similarly, stop buy orders generally are entered by investors with short positions to limit losses should the stock price increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A stop or stop limit order in a derivative security is elected,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> becomes a market or limit order, respectively, when the quoted market for the derivative security reaches the appropriate stop or stop limit price. Once elected, the specialist treats the orders like any other market or limit order. The specialist must execute the market order at the next best market price, and must execute the limit order at the limit price or hold the order on his limit order book until the limit price is available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c)(v), provisions regarding the election of stop and stop limit orders are only applicable to such derivative securities as are designated by the Exchange as eligible for this treatment. Currently, only index warrants have been so designated. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange had previously designated Americus Trust Units, PRIMEs, and SCOREs as eligible as well, but all such securities have since expired and are no longer traded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 290673 (April 10, 1991), 56 FR 15652 (April 17, 1994) (File No. SR-Amex-90-31). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Exchange now designates, pursuant to Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c), Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  as eligible for stop and stop limit orders to be elected by quotation. These derivative equity securities can be expected to fluctuate in price based on changes in an underlying stock index, and are therefore appropriately designated as eligible for election of stop and stop limit orders by quotation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The product, known as a ``SPDR,'' is a Portfolio Depositary Receipt (``PDR'') based upon the Standard &amp; Poor's (``S&amp;P'') 500 Stock Index. The Commission approved the listing and trading of SPDRs in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31591 (December 11, 1992), 57 FR 60253 (December 18, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

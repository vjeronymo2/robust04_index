			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES FOR CAFE IN SUIT OVER BREAST-FEEDING  </P> <P> A Beverly Hills restaurant did not violate a woman's civil rights when a  hostess asked her to either breast-feed her child discreetly, or do so in the  restroom, a Los Angeles judge has ruled.  </P> <P> In a suit filed five years ago against Cafe Rodeo, Nicole Kaufman alleged she  was not given the option of discreetly breast-feeding her infant at her table.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Richard Wells ruled Wednesday in favor of the restaurant,  which maintained that it had done so.  </P> <P> "The restaurant's policy -- a continuing policy -- is that if a woman goes into  the restaurant and she is breast-feeding but is discreet about it, we have no  problem," Aaron Shelden, the attorney representing the restaurant, said  Thursday. He added that the ruling was a vindication of the restaurant's  position.  </P> <P> Attorney Gloria Allred, representing Kaufman, a graphics artist, blasted the  court's decision as "anti-mother and anti-child."  </P> <P> At a press conference Thursday to announce plans to appeal Wells' decision,  Allred said she will seek a broader ruling to prohibit all restaurants from  "banning" breast-feeding mothers from their dining rooms.  </P> <P> "Breast-feeding is not a crime," the attorney said. "Is the restaurant going to  argue next that there should be separate lunch counters for breast-feeding  mothers and infants, such as blacks were subjected to in the South in the '50s?  </P> <P> ". . . Breast-feeding mothers and their babies should not have to be banned to  Devil's Island, or to a restroom, because they have chosen the most important  form of bonding that can exist between a mother and child."  </P> <P> Allred contended that the trial evidence -- including testimony of a woman who  stated that two years ago she also was banned to the Cafe Rodeo's restroom to  breast-feed her child -- demonstrated that, in reality, the restaurant had a  policy limiting breast-feeding to the women's restroom.  </P> <P> The witness, Bonnie Shuster, told reporters at Thursday's press conference that  her breast was "completely covered" by a large shirt at the restaurant when she  was asked to go to the ladies' room.  </P> <P> "So why should the court believe . . . the restaurant?" she asked.  </P> <P> Acknowledging the conflicting evidence, Wells noted in his ruling that the  burden of proof rested with the plaintiff.  </P> <P> But he was apparently unswayed by evidence presented by the plaintiff's  lawyers.  </P> <P> In his decision, Wells said that even if the restaurant employee failed to give  Kaufman the option of breast-feeding discreetly, "such failure was an oversight  and did not constitute discrimination" under the law.  </P> <P> The judge added that, even if, as Shuster testified, she was not allowed to  discreetly breast-feed at the table, "this might constitute a single violation"  but "does not establish a pattern. . . ."  </P> <P> Several Los Angeles-area restaurateurs told The Times earlier this week that  they have no objection to women breast-feeding in their establishments.  </P> <P> Shelden insisted that his clients, the owners and management of Cafe Rodeo, do  not object either.  </P> <P> "I believe this whole thing has just been blown all out of proportion," the  lawyer said.  </P></p>

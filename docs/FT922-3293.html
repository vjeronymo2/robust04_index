			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Limited Scottish growth predicted SCOTLAND is likely to have relatively low rates of economic growth over the next four years as North Sea oil output declines and the defence equipment industry contracts. This is the conclusion of a study of the Scottish economy by Mackay Consultants, economic consultants based in northern Scotland. The study says Scotland's gross domestic product fell last year in real terms by 1.8 per cent to Pounds 44.4bn, which includes Pounds 5bn from Scotland's share of UK oil and gas production. If offshore oil and gas production is excluded from Scotland's GDP, as it is in official figures, the study's GDP estimates are roughly in line with those of the government. Excluding oil and gas, Mackay expects Scotland's GDP to grow by 0.7 per cent in real terms this year, 2.4 per cent next year, 2.6 per cent in 1994 and 2.3 per cent in 1995. If falling output of oil and gas is included, the expected growth in real terms is 0.6 per cent this year, 1.8 per cent next year, 2.2 per cent in 1994 and 1.8 per cent in 1995. The consultants say their growth forecasts for Scotland are below most forecasts for the UK economy over the same period. They say offshore oil output will fall by 6.7 per cent over the 1991-95 period and spending on defence by 12 per cent.

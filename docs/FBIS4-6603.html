			<p>BFN     [Text] Initial capital investments of newly-registered  domestic stock entities rose to P14.44 billion [Philippine  pesos] in 1993 or 70 percent compared with P8.51 billion the  previous year, data from the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) show.    This developed as a 14 percent increase in registrants was  posted at 20,572 last year compared with 18,072 in 1992.    The finance sector led the upsurge with capital investments  amounting to P7.99 billion, or 55 percent of the total. The  manufacturing sector registered second, with P1.86 billion in  investments.    Wholesale and retail trade, community, social, and personal  services sectors followed closely with investments totalling  P1.67 billion and P920.7 million, respectively.    The highest monthly figure was posted in January at P3.26  billion, with P2.94 billion going to the financing insurance,  real estate, and business service sector alone.    However, it plunged 83 percent to P558.9 million in February  due to a corresponding sudden drop in investments in the finance  sector to only P199.4 million.    Capital inflows remained stable for the months of March to  June with a slight decrease in July where the year's lowest  investment was listed at P781 million. From there, it gained an  upward trend and peaked during the month of October with P1.86  billion due to improvements in the power situation during the  last quarter of 1993. However, this did not compare with  January's record-breaking performance.    Despite the severe power crisis that crippled some  manufacturing industries early last year, the sector posted  investments totalling P1.86 billion -- the second highest among  the major industries.    The agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sector remained at  the tail-end of the investments race with only P179.5 million.  This can be attributed to institutional problems like the lack  of farm-to-market roads and inefficient irrigation systems.    Likewise, the electricity, gas, and water sector registered  a  modest performance with total fresh capital of P211 million, the  second lowest among the industries.    To encourage private participation in the power industry,  President Ramos issued Executive Order 215 which allowed the  entry of the private sector into build-operate-transfer (BOT)  contracts, and the streamlining of the approval process and  regulatory framework of independent power producers (IPP).    Furthermore, efforts to revive the mining and quarrying  sector went under way with the Senate's endorsement of the  excise tax reduction scheme to make the industry more attractive  to private capitalists.    Meanwhile, additional investments in existing domestic stock  corporations and partnerships declined last year by 17.24  percent to P26.30 million from P31.78 million in 1992.  Likewise, a slight dip in the number of firms was experienced  with 1,057 firms reinvesting in the country -- only three firms  short of 1992 levels.    Capital inflows dropped from P2.64 million in December 1992  to P0.89 million in the first month of 1993 with 71 firms  putting in additional investments.    A better business climate was experienced during the second  half of 1993 with reinvestments climbing from P1.89 million in  June to an all-time high of P5.29 million in September. This  development was, likewise, attributed to the improved power  situation.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: The Glass blew in - Ballet At her best, and it is a very good best, Siobhan Davies creates structures, movement-installations, through which she guides us with unerring sensitivity. We learn, without consciously doing so, certain physical laws about these locations, are shown incidents that are insidiously revealing, and we understand the mysterious boundaries and horizons of this world. This has seemed to me a constant of Davies' truest work ever since that long-ago Pilot with which she first told us of her talent. Now on a small regional tour - I saw a performance at Worthing's Connaght Theatre on Tuesday night - Davies' Dance Company is presenting her two newest pieces: last season's Wanting to tell Stories and The Glass blew in, made this year. Both show their choreographer at her best, and her troupe - Amanda Britton, Sasha Roubichek, Deborah Saxon, Paul Douglas, Sean Feldman, Jeremy James - as a grandly gifted ensemble. The Glass blew in takes place inside a low perspex boundary, which is a frame for the dance - any activity outside it acquiring a somehow disquieting quality. The key to the piece is Gavin Bryars' Three elegies for nine clarinets, a work whose luscious sonorities are a tribute to the clarinettist Roger Heaton. Heaton is soloist with a multi-track recording of himself playing bass and contra-bass clarinets. The ear is ravished - tone and texture are dark, rich, Brahmsian - and Davies' has made dances that look comparably dark and almost voluptuous in means. The movement coheres or fragments, reflects off itself as ideas return or are mirrored from one performer to another. Effects are beautifully judged - how satisfying each dance-phrase seems - and beautifully brought off by Davies' artists. Wanting to tell stories is no less rewarding, and secure - it is tempting to write 'self-contained' - in structure. Two vast steely grilles by David Buckland hang over the stage, and move to define areas (and no-go areas, too). Telling stories allusively, hinting at incident and relationships, is the declared theme. Characters - and we sense identities through the movement - are confronted and briefly explored. The piece is more febrile, more urban in its energies, than Davies usually allows, and I think it slightly too long - the fault of Kevin Volans' gritty score, well brought off by its four players. But the dance grips the attention in its drive, in its sharp demotic accents: gesture is quick, bold  -and how odd to see the flash of a waltz-step. It is given with absolute conviction by its cast. In these latest pieces, as in last year's exquisite White Bird Featherless, we see the maturity of a rare, perceptive creator. Siobhan Davies' dance is refined, sometimes oblique, always penetrating. And subtly, grippingly, hers is a theatre of the human heart as well as of movement. The Siobhan Davies Dance Company appears at the Crucible, Sheffield, on May 19; at Towngate Theatre, Basildon, on May 23.</p>

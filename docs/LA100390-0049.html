			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN OKD TO MAKE DEVELOPMENT HELP PAY WAY  </P> <P> Hoping to find a way to make development "pay for itself," the San Diego City  Council will make builders begin paying a new fee to finance roads, libraries  and other public facilities needed because of their projects.  </P> <P> In what has become an almost annual legislative exercise to grapple with one of  the thorniest issues in San Diego politics, the council narrowly passed a plan  late Monday night that establishes so-called "citywide impact fees" designed to  recover part of the costs of streets, parks, fire and police stations and other  public facilities necessitated by growth.  </P> <P> A watered-down version of a tougher proposal debated last summer, the  growth-control program also promotes efforts to improve air quality and  encourages the preservation of hillsides and wetlands as open space.  </P> <P> But the council disappointed some environmentalists, and Mayor Maureen  O'Connor, by rejecting the boldest component of the growth proposal: a  controversial plan to limit future development by linking building permits to  strict standards for traffic congestion.  </P> <P> "No question, I would have liked it stronger, but the votes weren't there,"  O'Connor said of the plan, approved by a 5-3 vote. "It would have been an  extremely strong program if we'd gotten the transportation (limits). But we got  75% of what I wanted."  </P> <P> Business leaders, who had warned that some of the stringent restrictions  originally proposed would worsen the problems posed by the nationwide economic  downturn, also were generally pleased with the compromise. In recognition of  economic conditions, the council agreed to phase in the impact fees --  estimated to raise more than $850 million during the next two decades -- over  three years.  </P> <P> "They generally went in the direction we had asked," said Wayne Raffesberger,  executive director of San Diegans Inc., a downtown business group. "It's a  good, balanced plan I think most people can live with."  </P> <P> Slow-growth activist Peter Navarro called the fees only a "modest and partial  solution to San Diego's pressing growth problems."  </P> <P> Unlike existing fees charged to developers and home buyers to help finance the  schools, parks and branch libraries in their particular neighborhood, the new  assessments are designed to collect revenue needed for facilities such as  police stations, a central library and open space that serve the entire city.  </P> <P> Monday night's five-hour debate followed the now-familiar script from San  Diego's earlier growth battles, with some environmentalists pressing for  tougher growth controls than those being debated as developers and business  leaders issued doomsday warnings about the measures under consideration.  </P> <P> If some of the strictest proposals were adopted, opponents cautioned, tens of  thousands of jobs would be lost, housing costs would soar, retailers ranging  from supermarkets to gas stations would abandon the city for surrounding  communities, and residential and industrial development would be severely  curtailed, thereby reducing the fees' estimated revenue. Over the next month, a  council committee will consider exempting certain businesses from the fees,  which will begin being assessed in 60 days.  </P> <P> But environmentalists said failure to toughen existing growth standards would  worsen air quality and traffic problems while delaying an inevitable request  for the additional funds needed for public facilities.  </P> <P> "You have a real simple choice: Is the money going to come from developers or  taxpayers?" said Richard Carson, economic adviser to the slow-growth group  Prevent Los Angelization Now.  </P> <P> Under the three-year phase-in for the new fees, the charges will be discounted  75% the first year, 50% the second year and 25% the third year.  </P> <P> That discount schedule, supporters said, would help to soften the fees' impact  on developers at a time when the nation's economy appears to be entering a  recession. But Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer complained that it could prompt a  spurt in "helter-skelter, willy-nilly" development as builders rushed to take  advantage of the discounts.  </P> <P> During the first year, the new fees, which will be imposed both on residential  and commercial development, are estimated at about $1,100 for single-family  homes and 95 cents per square foot for industrial projects, according to city  planners. Because those dollar amounts represent the 75% discount, the full  fees -- which, in the absence of future council action would be imposed in late  1993 -- equal about $4,400 and $3.90 per square foot, respectively.  </P> <P> With the nation's economy already acting as a brake on development, the  additional burden of the new fees, Councilman Ron Roberts argued, could further  drive up housing expenses and discourage businesses from expanding.  </P> <P> "I'll bet there's not another city in the country discussing increasing  development fees at this point," said Roberts, who was joined by Councilmen Bob  Filner and Bruce Henderson in opposing the plan. With Councilman Wes Pratt  absent due to illness, the plan's backers included O'Connor, Wolfsheimer, John  Hartley, Linda Bernhardt and Judy McCarty.  </P> <P> The rejected proposal to link building permits to traffic levels drew strong  condemnation from developers and council members alike, who argued that it  would perpetuate the city's dependence on automobiles while doing little or  nothing to improve air quality.  </P></p>

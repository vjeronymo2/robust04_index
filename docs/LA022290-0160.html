			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> CLOSED ROAD TAKES TOLL ON BUSINESS  </P> <P> The warm sun and clear, blue sky lulled Jim Nudo to a near-doze as he sat on a  bench in front of his surf shop Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I might as well go to sleep," he said bitterly, staring at the deserted street  in front of him. "Nobody will be coming here, anyway."  </P> <P> The closure of El Camino Real, now 3 weeks old, has been an inconvenience for  drivers. But for merchants along the main streets that lead to El Camino Real,  the closure is becoming an economic disaster.  </P> <P> The coastal highway was shut down Feb. 5, when geologists found that the cliffs  over El Camino Real were riddled with crevices and threatening to tumble. So  far, city officials say their best guess is that the highway will be closed for  up to two months, while work crews try to stabilize the bluffs.  </P> <P> Not only has the closure isolated a handful of stores near the barricaded road,  but the traffic jam it created down the road -- near the Avenida Pico  interchange -- is driving customers from stores there.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like South Coast Plaza at Christmastime," said Sid Beaty, store  director of Ralphs Grocery Co. "It takes a considerable amount of time to get  in and out of the parking lot. Our sales have definitely been hit in a negative  way."  </P> <P> Both Nudo and Beaty were among the merchants invited to City Hall on Wednesday  to discuss problems caused by the closure, but nothing was resolved.  </P> <P> To Nudo, a barricaded El Camino Real means that thousands of cars that used to  pass by every day are now taking their business elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We're in limbo here," said Nudo, owner of the Herbie Fletcher Surf Shop on  North El Camino Real. "People are avoiding this end of town, and the business  is really hurting."  </P> <P> Nudo, who has owned the shop for 10 years, estimated that receipts have  plummeted 80% since the closure.  </P> <P> "We expected a lot of business to come in over the three-day weekend, but it  didn't happen," he said. "I don't know what we'll do if this goes on for  months."  </P> <P> Walk-in business has slowed to a standstill for Margaret Cortens, who owns  Capistrano Realty across the street from the surf shop.  </P> <P> "We've been heavily impacted," she said Monday. "Our business deals with a lot  of walk-ins. We haven't had any come in today."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the other end of Avenida Pico near the Interstate 5 interchange,  vendors are complaining about too much traffic.  </P> <P> The city was already in the middle of a $352,000 project to widen freeway ramps  when they were forced to close El Camino Real.  </P> <P> The construction and the extra traffic created by drivers trying to find  alternative north-south routes have combined to create a traffic nightmare in  the area.  </P> <P> Instead of trying to brave the traffic jams, merchants say, people are just  staying away.  </P> <P> "I think business has been a lot slower" since the closure, said Jill Gordon,  assistant manager at Aaron Brothers Art Marts. "I know that our customers are  coming in frustrated and so are the employees -- everybody's frustrated." FRANK  MESSINA  </P></p>

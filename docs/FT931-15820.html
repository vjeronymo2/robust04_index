			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Judicial choices criticised SENIOR judicial appointments last year did little to alter the image of the judiciary as unrepresentative of society and dominated by white, middle-aged Oxbridge-educated men, according to a Labour MP. An analysis of last year's senior judicial appointments by Mr Stephen Byers, MP for Wallsend and chairman of Labour's home affairs committee, found that 86 per cent of those appointed who were educated in the UK had attended either Oxford or Cambridge universities and that more than 80 per cent had attended private schools. No women were appointed to the House of Lords or the Appeal Court last year. Only two women were appointed to the High Court bench. All those appointed were white with an average age of 52, although Mr Justice Hirst was promoted to the Court of Appeal at the age of 67. Mr Byers said the findings were 'depressing and disappointing' and showed that senior members of the judiciary continued to be drawn from a very narrow social and educational background. He accused Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, of demonstrating complacency in refusing to consider changes to the present appointments system. He called for the establishment of an independent judicial appointments commission, for vacancies to be advertised, for applications to be invited and for selection criteria to be published.</p>

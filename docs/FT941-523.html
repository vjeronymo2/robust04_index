			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Swiss inflation falls to 1.3%: Economic watch Inflation in Switzerland fell to an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in March, its lowest level since June 1987. Many economists believe the rate will sink below 1 per cent in the next couple of months, down from an annualised peak of 6.6 per cent in June 1991. An excessively loose monetary policy in the late 1980s forced the central bank to push up short-term interest rates to over 9 per cent by early 1992, provoking indexed rent and public service price rises. The indexing is now working in reverse. The consumer price index was unchanged in March from February. The Federal Statistics Office said domestically produced goods were 0.1 per cent dearer and imported goods 0.2 per cent cheaper. Denmark's current account surplus rose to DKr34.7bn (Pounds 3.63bn) in 1993 from DKr28.8bn in 1992. New orders in Germany's engineering and plant construction sector were unchanged in February compared with a year earlier, with a 6 per cent decline in domestic orders offset by a 6 per cent increase in foreign orders. French industrialists surveyed by the national statistics office, Insee, during March said activity had picked up sharply in recent months and they were 'resolutely optimistic' on the outlook for production.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee pact talks fail TALKS ON an international coffee agreement with market support measures collapsed yesterday evening in London. 'There is no more time and no more space to reach a compromise,' said Mr Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of the International Coffee Organisation committee which had been specially set up to look for any areas of agreement between producers and consumers. Yesterday was the deadline set by delegates to negotiate an agreement to replace the current pact, which expires at the end of September. The full ICO Council was meeting late into last night. However, Mr Lopez said it was unlikely that the council would be making any decisions last night on the ICO's future, but it would decide to reconvene soon. Options before it include the establishment of a purely administrative agreement such as is run by the International Sugar Organisation. World coffee markets have already discounted the latest talks, which were not expected to succeed. London robusta prices closed higher yesterday just before the news, and New York arabicas were up by well over 1 cent a lb in early trading. However, prices are less than half the 120 cents a lb of July 1989, when the ICO export quota system collapsed. Producers are estimated to have lost more than Dollars 10bn in revenues since then. Mr Valdemar Leao, from the Brazilian delegation, said that producers had got as close as they could to the consumer position. However, he complained: 'They did not move. In the last 12 months the only items we have agreed were when we agreed with the consumers. The pace of the negotiations was impossible. We have agreed on three articles and we need agreement on 71.' At the end of the last talks in February Brazil, the largest producer, obliquely blamed the US, the biggest consumer, for the deadlock. In the ensuing weeks producers have lobbied the new US administration intensively. Early yesterday evening the consumers would make no comment on the collapse until they had agreed a common position. But one producer delegate said that the consumers had played their hand very badly. 'They were playing for an extension - they are rather shocked that they did not get it.' Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said the attitude of consuming countries towards commodity agreements as a form of aid for developing countries had changed. But he predicted a backlash. 'The US will be surprised at the amount of flak it has to take over this,' he said.</p>

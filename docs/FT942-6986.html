			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Smoother ride for wheelchairs Staircases are a big problem for people in wheelchairs and spiral staircases present a particular challenge. TGR of Bologna in Italy has developed its advanced Explorer chair to allow users to tackle complicated stairways - especially in offices and public buildings - without any help. It works through a combination of wheels and crawler tracks, with the seat balancing automatically to produce a level posture even when ascending or descending. Powered by batteries and controlled by sensors, the Explorer (costing Pounds 12,000) is easily operated by a joystick. 'It makes a tremendous difference to the disabled,' says Howard Daly, head of Wheelchair Corporation, distributor for the UK and parts of continental Europe. Mouth control and voice activation features are also being developed. Wheelchair Corporation: UK, 081-9545848.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ashtead advances to Pounds 7m as prices and demand rise Shares in Ashtead Group rose 21p to 383p yesterday after the plant and machinery rental company said it had defied the recession with a sharp increase in full year profits. Rising prices and buoyant demand for hire equipment helped the company lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 7m for the year to April 30 on turnover of Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 33.9m). Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said the group was reaping the benefits of heavy investment in the UK rental business, which totalled Pounds 13m during the year to take spending since 1990 to Pounds 40.7m. 'These results are reward for the policy of investing during a recession in people, plant and facilities. The downturn has also given us opportunities by crushing so many competitors,' he said. Since the depths of the recession, which reduced the value of the hire equipment industry from an estimated Pounds 750m to Pounds 450m, Ashtead claimed it had doubled its market share to 8 per cent and was well-placed to expand further. Expansion plans centre on A-Plant, the UK hire division, which dominated the improved group performance by contributing operating profits of Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 2.71m) on turnover ahead 28 per cent at Pounds 34.4m. Mr Lewis said the group hoped to double its presence across the country to about 150 outlets through acquisitions and by opening greenfield sites. He also predicted accelerated growth in the US, where the Sunbelt Rentals subsidiary saw operating profits rise fivefold to Pounds 809,000. Ashtead Technology, the offshore services division, reported a more modest 6.5 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 792,000. But Mr Lewis said it was a creditable result given the slowdown in North Sea oil and gas production and the decision to close its sales business to concentrate solely on rental operations. Earnings per share more than doubled to 20.8p (9.4p) and a final dividend of 4.2p is recommended, making a total of 5.5p (4.538p). COMMENT Ashtead has set itself tough targets. The company aims to return to the halcyon pre-recession days when operating margins exceeded 30 per cent. It could do it. The construction industry is showing signs of an upturn; first quarter sales are up 55 per cent and operating margins have risen to 16.9 per cent. With contributions likely from new acquisitions and Pounds 5.6m of net cash left after last year's rights issue, the company looks set fair. Profits this year are expected to reach Pounds 10.5m, which makes the shares worth considering on a forward multiple of 14.5.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps Bullough recover to Pounds 7m Bullough, the diversified engineering and office products group, yesterday forecast a return to the 'blue sky' of high margin profits as the benefits of tight cost controls and restructuring produced a sharp increase in the interim pre-tax figure. The group saw first half profits leap from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 7.13m for the six months to April 30, even though turnover declined from Pounds 133.4m to Pounds 132m. Although the comparable year's figures were undermined by a Pounds 4.67m restructuring charge, operating profits before provisions rose by 35.5 per cent from Pounds 5.64m to Pounds 7.64m. Mr Gordon Bond, who took over as chief executive in January, said: 'Every division has shown growth and we can now pursue our aim of getting profitability back to 1990 levels.' In that year pre-tax profits reached Pounds 28.7m. His optimism was fuelled mainly by improved results from the heating and refrigeration divisions, which saw operating profits increase to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 1.8m) and Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.56m). The engineering and office products sectors both reported lower turnover but increased their operating profits to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 2.19m) and Pounds 943,000 (Pounds 83,000) respectively. The group said it had appointed an internal auditor to oversee financial controls after a Pounds 1.4m mis-statement last year at the south west branch of its General Refrigeration subsidiary. The branch has since been merged with its Midlands operation and the accountant responsible has been dismissed and faces civil proceedings to recover more than Pounds 30,000 of missing cash. The shares rose 9p to 154p yesterday after the group announced earnings per share of 3.85p (0.02p). The final dividend is held at 1.75p. COMMENT Mr Bond has shaken up Bullough. The workforce in the group's office products companies has been cut in half and managers have been instructed to pursue quality at low cost. He was lucky to arrive after the group had been through the worst part of its 'pain first, gain later' restructuring. But he deserves credit for refocusing it into four key areas and cutting gearing from 12.5 per cent to 3.1 per cent, leaving plenty of room to buy market share through acquisitions. Steady long-term growth in each division is a real prospect and analysts have upgraded their forecasts for full year pre-tax profits by about 15 per cent to around Pounds 17.5m. On a forward multiple of 16, the shares seem an expensive but secure long-term bet.</p>

Some 275 enterprises with ROK's investment have been set up  in the city since 1992. The ROK investors have put in 260  million U.S. dollars in these enterprises.    The firms are mainly engaged in industry, agriculture,  construction, real estate, transport and services. The greatest  number -- some 212 of them -- are in industrial production and  have made good profits.    The Tianjin Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., a joint venture to  produce video-corders, funded by Tianjin Telecommunication and  Broadcasting Company and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd of the ROK,  went into production in October last year. Its video-corders  are the first from China to enter the international market, and  the company plans to export 120,000 video-corders this year.    In the Tianjin economic and technological development zone,  an 1,156,000 sq m site has been leased to ROK investors for 50  years. Land leveling is expected to be finished next year.</p>

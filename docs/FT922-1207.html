But, having been brought up on a farm, attended agricultural college, and 'played midwife to more lambs than I ate before I became a vegetarian', the broadcaster and journalist reckons he is the man for the job. He was approached by David Puttnam, film producer and president of the CPRE for the past seven years, and the current chairman David Astor. Despite his time in Hollywood, Puttnam was seen as an effective president; the Council was therefore convinced of the merits of looking for another media personality rather than, say, an expert planner. 'I came to the environment as an issue via development,' says the new president, who made a film about desertification in the Sahel in the early 1970s 'when it was a non-story'. Now his job will be to 'represent the consensus of the CPRE beyond its natural constituency'; this includes getting city dwellers, rather than just the denizens of the shires, interested in the Council's work. 'One of the things that attracts me about it is that it is not a narrow Nimby organisation,' says Dimbleby, who does, however, have his own back yard, a beautiful valley outside Bath, to defend from a proposed by-pass. A 'cautious optimist' about the Earth summit, which he attended as a reporter, he thinks there are 'significant hostages for all governments' that the environmentalists can and will winkle out of Agenda 21, the 800-page guide to sustainable development that was put together in Rio.</p>

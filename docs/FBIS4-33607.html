			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Chilean Foreign  Minister Carlos Figueroa presented Chile's formal proposal to  Argentine authorities to join the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) as an "independent partner."    Figueroa expressed Chile's "firm decision" to increase its  economic ties with the rest of Latin America, a step that "is  not incompatible" with its attempt to join NAFTA, which  comprises the United States, Canada, and Mexico.    During a news conference in which he was joined by Argentine  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Figueroa explained that Chile  proposed measures to gradually deregulate the trade of goods,  services, and investments between Chile and the Mercosur  partners.    Figueroa stressed that Mercosur, to which Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay belong, "is an extremely clear opportunity  to export Chilean manufactured goods of high added value."    Figueroa pointed out that Chile seeks to join, as an  "observer," Mercosur's dozen or so "working groups," which  establish the trade and economic policies that the four partners  of the regional integration agreement must implement.    Di Tella, as the Mercosur "pro tempore" secretary  (coordination chief), received Chile's formal proposal. He  stressed that Chile "has animated" the regional integration  agreement's partners. The Argentine foreign minister  emphasized: "It represents a very significant step because from  now on the great political and economic advancements among the  American Southern Cone countries will be even greater, like  never before."    Di Tella noted that Bolivia is the other Southern Cone  country that has shown "great interest" in joining Mercosur,  whose full implementation is scheduled for 1995. The Argentine  foreign minister said "it would be ideal" to reach an agreement  on Chile's entry next year.    Carlos Figueroa denied that the Chilean entry proposal had  been received with distrust by Uruguay, whose foreign minister,  Sergio Abreu, "was one of the most animated."    The Mercosur foreign ministers received a preliminary  Chilean  proposal during the OAS General Assembly that met for two days  in the Brazilian city of Belem do Para.    The Chilean foreign minister refused to supply more details  on the proposal because "it must be reviewed" by the Mercosur  partners.    Figueroa pointed out that Chile's interest in joining stems  from Mercosur's economic potential and its negotiating power  with other trade blocs, especially the EU. Figueroa said the  Chilean proposal follows agreements with the Latin American  Integration Association (ALADI) and the Brazilian proposal to  establish a regional free trade zone.    The Chilean foreign minister is scheduled to meet tomorrow  with Argentine and Chilean entrepreneurs who have invested in  Argentina.</p>

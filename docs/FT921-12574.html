			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Bills seek their place in history - American Football MARV LEVY, Harvard graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean game of American football. The silver-haired head coach of the Buffalo Bills analyses the strategies and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press conferences can come laced with literary allusions. He uses words like 'inculcate' and 'salient' in pre-game meetings with his team. Tomorrow in Minneapolis, however, the erudite Levy will leave the talking to his players, who must play a mean game of football if they are to defeat the Washington Redskins in Superbowl XXVI. The Redskins start as favourites, and are expected to win by at least seven points according to the bookmakers in Las Vegas. Yet for those of us who have enjoyed watching the Bills this season, it is difficult to think of them as underdogs. Under Levy, Buffalo has set the National Football League alight in the past two seasons with a rapid-fire passing and running game which led the team to a host of high scoring victories. At the root of their success is the 'no-huddle' offense - a tactic that dispenses with the huddle before each play and allows the quarterback to call his own moves. At its best, the no-huddle offense puts points on the board quickly and leaves opposing defenses scrambling to keep up with the pace. At the heart of the Bills attack are two great players, quarterback Jim Kelly and all-purpose running back Thurman Thomas. Kelly is an experienced leader with a sharp tactical brain and a strong arm, while Thomas is a superb all-rounder, a quicksilver runner and an acrobatic receiver. Powered by Kelly and Thomas, and supported by receivers James Lofton and Andre Reed, the Bills topped the statistical tables in a number of key attacking categories this season, including most total yards gained and most touchdowns scored. So with all their offensive firepower, why aren't the Bills favourites to win? There are two reasons, and both come down to defense. The Redskins' defense is strong, against both the running and the passing game, and it ranks third best in the league for overall effectiveness. Washington's defense is especially good at 'blitzing' the quarterback - in the 16 regular games this season they reached opposing quarterbacks and sacked them 50 times. Kelly has looked vulnerable to the sack in the past, particularly two weekends ago when the Denver Broncos' blitzed relentlessly, giving Kelly insufficient time to get his no-huddle offense into gear. The fragility of their own defense, which ranked next-to-last in the league this season, is the second reason why the Bills are not favourites tomorrow. They have shown an improvement in the playoffs (holding Denver to just seven points in the AFC Championship game), thanks partly to the return of two powerful players, slashing defensive end Bruce Smith and bulldozing nose tackle Jeff Wright. Yet in the Redskins, the Bills defense will be facing one of the toughest offensive lines in football. This is where the 'Hogs' come in. Hogs is the collective nickname for the enormous front-line that defends Redskins' quarterback Mark Rypien. Not only are the Hogs good at giving Rypien time to throw long passes to receivers Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders (the protection has been so effective that Rypien was sacked just nine times all season), but they are also adept at knocking holes in defensive lines for backs Ernest Byner, Ricky Ervins and Gerald Riggs to run through. One big advantage the Redskins have is the versatility of their attack. The Bills rely heavily, perhaps too heavily, on Thomas's all-round skills. Stop Thomas, and Buffalo usually struggles. Washington's three running backs possess different strengths and styles providing a balance of power and precision. The trio of fleet wide receivers spread defenses and regularly break open for long yardage. The variety of attacking options available to Redskins coach Joe Gibbs helps explain why his team was the highest-scoring unit in the NFL this season. Yet, as any fan of sports cliches knows, statistics and history mean little when it comes to one Big Game. The difference may ultimately lie in motivation, and how badly each team wants to win. In this respect, the Bills could have the edge. It has been 363 days since Scott Norwood's potential game-winning kick sailed wide of the right hand goalpost in the closing seconds of Superbowl XXV against the New York Giants, and the determination of the Bills to avenge that loss burns just as bright as it did a year ago. Both teams have prepared thoroughly, but Buffalo seem to have gone about their business amid the outrageous hype and publicity of Superbowl week in a quieter, more purposeful manner. And while less than half of the Redskins are survivors from the team's last Superbowl appearance in 1987, the Bills squad is much the same as it was last year. The memories of that game are still fresh for Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, and Bruce Smith. My money is on Buffalo to win by three points, courtesy of kicker Scott Norwood.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of a credit crunch in Japan Sir, While the FT deserves praise for its excellent coverage of the Japanese economy, your report, 'Japan's credit crunch threatens anaemic recovery' (August 12), misses the mark. Although lending by the banks included in the Bank of Japan's statistics is indeed falling, there is no evidence that this is the result of a 'severe credit crunch'. If a US-style credit crunch (which, by the way, did not prove fatal to the economic recovery there) did indeed exist, we would expect the gap between banks' cost of funds and their lending rates to widen, as well as a surge in their holdings of government bonds. In fact, these figures have shown little change. Most complaints about banks' reluctance to lend have come from small business owners, many of whom face negative cash flows and are trying to borrow in order to stave off bankruptcy. This is not the type of borrower most banks seek out even in the best of times. These borrowers seem to be showing up not in the Bank of Japan's statistics but in the National Tax Agency's. Some of the top income tax payers in Japan last year were owners of financing companies specialising in high-risk loans, at interest rates often exceeding 20 per cent a year. We should also not forget the important role in credit creation of government financial institutions during the current recession. In 1993, they increased their total loans and discounts outstanding by Y11,800bn (about USDollars 118bn). If we add in the Y3,700bn increase in corporate straight and convertible bonds outstanding, it becomes clear that bank lending is not the only means of credit creation in Japan.

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric says loss will be less than forecast OKI Electric, the Japanese maker of communications equipment and semiconductors, said yesterday that losses for the year ending March 1994 would be less than initially expected. Oki said it now expects sales for the first half of the year to be 2 per cent higher than previously forecast, at Y255bn (USDollars 2.4bn), and that its pre-tax loss for the six months would be Y7bn, rather than the earlier estimate of Y14bn. Full-year sales are expected to be slightly lower at Y555bn instead of Y560bn. Pre-tax losses for the year are, however, expected to be more than halved at Y8bn, against the Y19bn incurred in 1992-93. The company, however, is passing its dividend. It is aiming to return to profit in 1994-95 and resume dividend payments the following year. In the second half of this year, Oki expects demand to remain weak with its main customers, banks and other corporations, keeping capital spending low. One reason for the improvement in Oki's forecast is strong demand for memory chips, particularly in the US.</p>

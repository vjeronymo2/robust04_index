At its Beijing residence yesterday afternoon, the Fujian NPC  delegation held a conscientious discussion of Premier Li Peng's  government work report. It was chaired by Fujian NPC delegation  leader Yuan Qitong. The Fujian deputies to the NPC session  spoke one after another in the discussion.    Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and  governor, delivered a key-note speech in which he stated: The  key to implementing the central principles by taking into  account and showing concern for overall national interests lies  in cultivating a new train of thought; learning and mastering  dialectics; as well as emancipating our minds and seeking truth  from facts in a down-to-earth manner. Reform, development, and  stability -- Jia noted -- are interrelated with and are  complementary to each other. In seeking development, we should  take actual local conditions into consideration. In furthering  reform, we should make every possible effort to solve various  contradictions. In addition, we should firmly grasp the two  aspects -- reform and stability -- simulteneously.    Jia Qinglin further expounded on this issue in light of the  realities in Fujian, saying: Since last year, Fujian has  enjoyed sound and rapid national economic growth, but also has  undertaken more arduous reform tasks. In his government work  report, Premier Li Peng emphatically called for rapidly building  a socialist market economy structure, this being an issue of  great significance to deepening reform, promoting development,  and maintaining stability. In the years to come, we should  always place reform high on the agenda and resolutely adhere to  the following train of thought in the course of reform:  Orienting production to market demands; conducting  comprehensive reform experiments in a down-to-earth manner;  learning and mastering international practices; integrating the  domestic and international markets; and making the domestic and  international markets complement each other.    Jia Qinglin stressed: By grasping opportunities, we mean  grasping opportunities for reform. By promoting development, we  mean making reform promote development. By maintaining  stability, we mean seizing appropriate opportunities for reform  and deepening reform in an appropriate way. Practice already  has borne out that deepening reform and building a socialist  market economy structure are the the only way out for Fujian.  It is both necessary and possible for Fujian to move ahead  earlier than others with respect to building a new socialist  market economy structure. This year, we are going to embark on  a series of pioneeringly deep-going reforms on an  unprecedentedly large scale. Thus leaders at all levels across  the province should make redoubled efforts to deepen reform,  promote development, maintain social stability, and rapidly  build a socialist market economy structure.    Huang Changxi, vice chairman of the NPC's Overseas Chinese  Affairs Committee and vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial  People's Congress Standing Committee; Xiamen Deputy Mayor Hong  Yongshi; Fujian Mayor Jin Nengchou; Xiamen University Professor  Wang Qiaoru; and others; also spoke one after the other during  the discussion.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Look for new young TV stars to meet up with veteran performers on Sunday's Emmy  Awards telecast, Fox Broadcasting said Monday. Fox, which will televise the  ceremonies, listed Johnny Depp, Kirk Cameron, Fred Savage, Tracy Ullman,  Arsenio Hall and Jamie Lee Curtis as participants along with Bob Hope, Angela  Lansbury, Robert Wagner, Robert Duvall and Marlo Thomas. There will be no  production numbers on the show, but there will be clips of "unlikely duos,"  plus a five-minute tribute to Lucille Ball, who will posthumously receive the  TV academy's Board of Governors Award. Overall, the theme of this year's 41st  annual Emmy Awards is to celebrate 50 years of television. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fourth alternative emphasizes helicopter harvesting in areas with significant heritage resources. It harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately 6,750 acres_with approximately 550 acres less tractor logging than alternatives two or three. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands only within those areas entered for salvage activities. Removal of 30 to 35 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of this project requires a permit from the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). It is in a classification of actions requiring TRPA Governing Board review and approval. Additionally, encroachment permits from the Nevada Department of Transportation are required for project implementation. Consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is required. Concurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is needed if the Forest Service Biological Assessment results in a ``may affect'' determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision on this analysis, pursuant to NEPA, is made by Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Forest Supervisor, Robert Harris, as the Forest Service is the lead agency under NEPA. There is no other joint lead agency and no cooperating agencies under NEPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft EIS is anticipated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and made available to the public for comment in February of 1994. The final EIS and its Record of Decision is expected in May of 1994. The decision will be appealable under Forest Service regulations found at 36 CFR part 215. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period for the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The public will also be informed of the availability of the DEIS by news releases issued to the media in the Lake Tahoe region. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft EIS' must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9th Circuit, 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available for the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John R.

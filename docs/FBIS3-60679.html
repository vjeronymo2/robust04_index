NODONG SINMUN today says that his utterances soon after he  got into office revealed his true color as the same warhawk as  his predecessor Keisuke Nakanishi and his anti-DPRK attitude.    The news analyst says:    As far as the socalled ``nuclear issue'' of the DPRK is  concerned, it is not a problem into which the Japanese  reactionaries are not supposed at should poke their nose.  [sentence as received] The nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula must be solved through negotiation between the United  States, the party responsible for it, and the DPRK.    Lurking behind Japan's imprudent fuss is a sinister  intention  to use the fiction of ``nuclear threat'' from the DPRK as a  pretext for its own nuclear armament and a shield to divert  elsewhere the arrow of international criticism of its nuclear  armament.    The ``missile issue'' of the DPRK over which Aichi raised an  outcry presents no problem at all. It is entirely natural that  we should take a self-defensive measure when the situation on  the Korean peninsula has been strained and brought to the brink  of war by the hostile forces. It is self-evident that this  poses no ``threat'' to Japan and cannot be decried.    Japan, however, has decided to develop a missile defence  system jointly with the United States with a shrill cry over the  ``missile issue'' of the DPRK, as if something big had happened,  and is intensifying arms buildup more openly.    We will never tolerate this.</p>

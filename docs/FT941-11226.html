			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Build-up of allegations behind the Malaysian dam: The Pounds 234m Pergau aid project may have some disturbing parallels with the arms-for-Iraq affair 'Great Britain plc has come out of all this very well,' Lord Younger, the former defence minister, said this week. He was commenting on the controversial events which led to a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and Malaysia in the late 1980s. British companies may have benefited, but allegations about the deal are troubling the government. Two Commons committees are investigating whether the arms package was secured as a direct consequence of the promise of substantial aid to Malaysia. In October a National Audit Office report criticised the government's commitment to provide Pounds 234m to a Malaysian hydro-electric dam project  -the most ever provided for a single scheme under the Overseas Development Administration's Aid and Trade Provision. In a parallel with the arms-for-Iraq affair, the question is whether the government breached its own guidelines or the law in securing the arms deal in 1988. Another allegation has emerged in the past week that the government suppressed evidence in a criminal case against a Malaysian banker to prevent embarrassment to the Malaysian government. This case also echoes the arms-for-Iraq affair. It involves Mr Lorrain Osman, former head of the Hong Kong operations of Bank Bumiputra, the Malaysian state-owned bank. In a 1990 High Court appeal by Mr Osman against moves to extradite him to Hong Kong, the Foreign Office applied for public interest immunity certificates to prevent disclosure of government documents in thecase. This was the first time the government had used such certificates to prevent disclosure of information in a criminal case. It was the direct precedent for its failed attempt to use them to prevent disclosure of ministers' knowledge of arms sales to Iraq in the Matrix Churchill case in 1992. In the Osman case the certificates were allegedly used to withhold evidence of a supposed cover-up of the involvement of senior Malaysian politicians, including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, in lending by the bank to the failed Carrian Corporation. The allegations were made under parliamentary privilege by Mr Robert Parry, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside. The Foreign Office is still refusing to disclose the contents of the documents withheld. If they say what Mr Parry alleges, they would have been unwelcome news for Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, who had developed a close relationship with Dr Mahathir. In 1989 she said: 'I hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a friend, whose counsel I have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and tough negotiator for Malaysia's interests.' They took the leadingroles in the negotiations on the Pounds 1bn arms deal. Lady Thatcher, ever the champion of the UK defence industry, wanted to persuade Dr Mahathir to end his 'Buy British Last' trade policy, introduced at the beginning of the decade as a reprisal against withdrawal of concessions on fees paid by Malaysian students in British universities. She succeeded in March 1988 when a protocol for a substantial defence contract was agreed. According to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, this contained a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects under this programme'. Lord Younger, who signed the protocol, said this week that the aid reference was included in error. He had not noticed the reference at the time. The Foreign Office, which was 'totally clear all along that there could be no link', pointed out the mistake to him soon afterwards. Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian government saying there could be no link between arms and aid. Negotiations were continued by Lady Thatcher personally when she went to Kuala Lumpur in September 1988. In a meeting with Dr Mahathir from which all officials were excluded, a memorandum of understanding on Pounds 1bnof British arms sales was agreed. The following month, the development administration received a strong recommendation from the Department of Trade andIndustry that Malaysia's Pergau dam scheme should be regarded as a strong candidate for Aid and Trade Provision cash support. The DTI has a formal role in recommending schemes for such support, but the final decision is supposed to be taken by the Overseas Development Administration. The Pergau scheme was expensive and rapidly became more costly. A contract estimate of Pounds 316m in January 1989 by Trafalgar House and BICC, the UK companies which would build the dam, roseto Pounds 397m on March 31. At about this time, Dr Mahathir was visiting London. Lord Younger met him in his hotel room, but he said there was no discussion of aid. In April 1989, the UK government made a formal aid grant offer toMalaysia. The final offer was not made or accepted by the Malaysians until 1991, when the cost of the scheme had reached Pounds 417m, including a British contribution of Pounds 234m. The magnitude of the British subsidy was unusual. There wasalso a breach of normal Whitehall procedures in that the offer was made againstthe advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the administration, and of Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, who regarded the scheme as uneconomic and a bad use of scarce resources. Businessmen and officials admit privately that there was an informal link between the offer ofaid to Malaysia and the winning of civil and military contracts for British companies. One businessman closely involved in UK-Malaysian trade relations said: 'You and I know that there is a connection between winning arms sales in Malaysia and offers of aid - but the question is whether anyone was stupid enough to leave explicit evidence.' In ethical terms, that link might be wrong, 'but you don't win contracts against competition from the French and the Americansif you take ethics too seriously'. The British government is not discussing the affair in terms of ethics, but in terms of the law. Ministers and Whitehall officials insist there is no legislation banning ministers from offering aid in return for defence business. The central piece of foreign aid legislation, the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act, does not cover the subject of military assistance. But if there was no breach of the law, there may have been a contravention of official Aid and Trade Provision guidelines,described by one official as the administration's 'bible'. Its commandments include: 'The aid programme may not be used to procure equipment of a military nature or for a military use.'</p>

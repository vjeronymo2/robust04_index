			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rayko Stoyanov commentary: "Dogan and Communists Are </F> Liquidating the Bulgarian Army"]    [Text] The government's draft budget dooms the army to a  slow death, the deputies of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]  in the parliamentary National Security Commission think. They  point out with concern that the 12 billion leva envisaged for  this year will hardly cover the most urgent needs of the  Bulgarian Army. "Rapidly growing inflation will eat into a  significant part of this meager sum," a SDS deputy told  DEMOKRATSIYA. "It must be remembered that at least 3 billion  leva will go on last year's expenditure."    The situation is especially grave in the Air Force and the  Navy. As Vice-Admiral Ventseslav Velkov, Navy commander,  recently said, "70-80 percent of our warships are hopelessly  obsolete." A high-ranking air force officer said with alarm  that the the spare part situation for warplanes is desperate.    The situation of the ground troops is no better. Not only  are there insufficient means for the army's equipment and  training, but on top of this the budget envisages humiliatingly  meager wages for the officers and sergeants. Battalion  commanders will receive wages lower than those of the cleaning  ladies in some private companies.    The Bulgarian Army's troubles do not end with the budget.  New dismissals of capable officers are imminent, while at the  same time people who implement the political orders of the  present leadership are being promoted to command positions.  Many officers think that the Army is again being deliberately  politicized, even before the process of decommunization has  ended. Reports confirm that the functions of the former State  Security Third Administration, so much hated in the past by the  officers, are being seized by Brigo Asparukhov's service. The  Foreign Political Intelligence Service has already publicized  its control over the General Staff and the civilian leadership  of the Ministry of Defense.</p>

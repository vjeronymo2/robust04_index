Among other things, they will discuss the question of  reorganizing the Internal Affairs Ministry. It is worth noting  that Yuriy Skokov, Viktor Yerin, and Viktor Ilyushin already  held a meeting the other day. According to the source, these  consultations may precipitate significant reshuffles at the  Internal Affairs Ministry in the near future. In particular,  Viktor Yerin's first deputy, Mikhail Yegorov, who is also chief  of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Main Administration for the  Struggle Against Organized Crime, may be appointed internal  affairs minister.</p>

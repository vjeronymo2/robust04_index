			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / CFA franc is devalued under IMF pressure Fourteen African nations which use the CFA franc yesterday agreed to devalue their French-backed common currency from 50 to the French franc to 100 to FFr1, buckling to pressure from France and the IMF, AP reports from Dakar. The move will make their exports more competitive, but will raise import prices and could lead to social turmoil in countries already beset by political instability. The 14 nations faced pressure from International Monetary Fund director-general Michel Camdessus, who along with France had pressed for the currency to be devalued. The IMF had threatened to withhold loans and aid. The Communaute Financiere Africaine franc, or CFA, has been pegged at 50 to the French franc for 46 years. The CFA countries are Senegal, Comores, Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Chad, Benin, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Niger, Togo, Cameroon and Mali.</p>

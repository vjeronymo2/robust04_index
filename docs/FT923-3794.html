			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Invesco to pay compensation to Drayton from charge INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, said yesterday that a portion of a Pounds 9m exceptional charge to its interim earnings will be paid to Drayton Consolidated Trust, an investment trust managed by Invesco, as compensation for having violated investment trust guidelines. The move is connected with Drayton's investment in Alma Holdings, Scotland's largest sweet manufacturer, which collapsed earlier this year. Drayton Consolidated, which concentrated on investments in unquoted companies, had the value of its assets written down by Pounds 47m earlier this year and is under reorganisation. Mr Rattan Engineer, Invesco MIM's finance director, said there were no legal proceedings connected with the compensation. The violation which attracted the compensation concerned a rule of the Drayton trust barring it from holding a stake greater than 15 per cent stake in any company. While the nominal value of Drayton's stake in Alma, at Pounds 4m, did not exceed that, Drayton also guaranteed a Pounds 15.8m bank loan for the company. Loan guarantees are contingent liabilities and off-balance sheet and these were not immediately disclosed to shareholders. However, when Alma collapsed, the loss was crystallised, raising Drayton's stake in Alma above 15 per cent. Analysts expected the compensation to Drayton to be distributed to shareholders. Mr Engineer said a portion of the Pounds 9m exceptional charge also included the effects of further Drayton asset writedowns but he did not expect more provisions would be needed for Drayton. Plans for a complete reorganisation of Drayton will be submitted to shareholders in October. Preliminary plans call for the quoted investments to be sold and proceeds distributed to shareholders while the unquoted portion will be managed by Foreign and Colonial as an investment trust. Mr Engineer said Invesco might have to repurchase a portion of those assets for its own book to prevent the new trust from violating the ceiling on holdings in individual companies.

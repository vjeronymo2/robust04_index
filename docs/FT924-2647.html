			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: Landing Lee? After 13 years at the controls of the once-ailing Chrysler car company, could Lee Iacocca, its high-profile chairman, be preparing for one last rescue mission? There are rumours that the 68-year-old Iacocca has been approached by advisers involved in the restructuring of Trans World Airlines. If the restructuring goes through as planned next year, the airline will be owned by its creditors and unions. The top job, however, will become vacant because Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who currently holds the bulk of TWA's shares, is bowing out as part of the deal. So far, there has been no word on the subject from Iacocca HQ although the great man has not, apparently, been short of job offers after he quits Chrysler at the end of the month. But the notion does raise some interesting possibilities. Would Iacocca  - who starred in a series of Chrysler ads - appear on the nation's TV screens, flogging cheap fares, for example?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nicolae Manolescu, president of the Civic </F> Alliance Party, PAC, by Ralu Filip; place and date not given:  "The Idea of a Coalition Government Is No Longer Topical"]    [Text] [Filip] The majority of commentators and political  leaders argue that we are facing a moment of political crisis.  I would like to ask you whether you agree with this view and to  give us your opinion about the reasons, consequences, and  prospects of this crisis.    [Manolescu] I believe that the major reason for the current  political crisis is connected with the fact that the  parliamentary majority and the government backed by it have not  yet found the appropriate solutions to the problems that we are  facing. Not only have they not found the solutions, but the y  have also set off on a path that leads nowhere. Or rather, it  does not lead to any of the solutions that would solve Romania's  current problems. In turn, the parliamentary opposition has  virtually exhausted all avenues of negotiations or understanding  with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] aimed at  finding a solution, other than early elections and a change in  the parliamentary configuration. A month or two ago, when the  negotiations between the opposition and the ruling party began,  I was optimistic and believed that together we could find a  solution that would not involve early elections. Today I am no  longer sure that there is such a solution.    [Filip] Do you believe that early elections could be the  solution to the current political crisis?    [Manolescu] The early elections option is double-edged. In  addition, we are not sure that the elections would create an  acceptable and reformist configuration of Parliament. To start  burdening people with an electoral campaign now, with all the  expense that this involves, would ultimately mean ignoring that  people want to know what they are going to eat tomorrow, whether  they will have jobs, and whether inflation will be kept more or  less under control. Thus, it means forgetting all these things  and producing electoral slogans again, which, no matter how  generous they are, cannot ensure food or the other things that  people need. That is why, in my view, early elections would  involve a certain amount of immorality. However, if there is no  other way, ultimately we may resort to it.    [Filip] Let us imagine that the PDSR did not reach an  understanding with the opposition and that this did not result  in early elections. How would the country be governed under  such circumstances?    [Manolescu] Unfortunately it would not be possible to rule  the country under such circumstances. I will give you an  example in this respect. One of the objections to government  policy is the excessive delay in implementing privatization and  the preservation of bankrupt enterprises. The MEBO [Management  and Employee Buy-On] program proposed at one stage has been  contested by everybody. Even in the PDSR program there is a  clear statement that the MEBO program is not efficient and  involves great risks. We have suggested an alternative, that  is, a privatization program, which the CDR [Democratic  Convention of Romania] and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party  (National Salvation Front)] have also accepted in principle. We  presented this program to the trade unions and the economists  and held a symposium on it in Buftea, and everywhere we received  a favorable response, meaning that people said yes, this program  indeed suggests a solution and must be given a try. But the  PDSR is ignoring this program just because it comes from the PAC  [Civic Alliance Party].... We believe that the program  represents a viable solution and must be discussed and never  mind who initiated it and who drafted it. We do not wish to  turn this program into political capital. However, we are keen  that it should be implemented. There is another aspect worth  mentioning here. Our program, or anybody else's program of this  kind, cannot be implemented at any time that we wish to do so.  Thus, we are linked to a deadline and this deadline is the  beginning of next autumn at the latest. To achieve a  privatization program we need certain laws that must be passed  by Parliament, thus presupposing parliamentary support and the  broadest possible political and social basis. The majority on  which the PDSR now relies does not respond to this requirement,  in spite of the greater number of seats that they hold, which  nobody knows for how long. Delaying the privatization process  leads to hyper-inflation and, further, to a deterioration to the  very limits of social life. And how can one govern under  conditions of social instability?    [Filip] Recently, in an interview granted to our newspaper,  Mr. Corneliu Coposu [president of the National Peasant Christian  Democratic Party-PDSR] came up with a way to get out of the  current crisis by forming a cooperation government, which should  be made up of parties with different, even opposing, ideologies  and programs, and which should rule on the basis of a minimal  program jointly agreed upon. We can call it interesting that  [PDSR President] Oliviu Gherman also expressed a similar support  for the idea of a minimal program that could be followed by any  government or parliamentary combination. In spite of these  similarities and convergence of ideas, a cooperation government  and minimal program are far from being accomplished. Thus, the  following question arises: How sincere are the proposals made  by political leaders? How sincere is their will to reach an  understanding that is of benefit to the country?    [Manolescu] I could say that in this case the issue of  sincerity does not have any importance. Sometimes we are  compelled to do certain things against our beliefs or interests.  Basically, I am not even interested in whether the sides  involved in such a discussion are sincere or not. What is  important is that they should reach an agreement. Better a  hypocrisy that leads to an accord than a sincerity that  disunites.    Second, the idea of a coalition government is no longer  topical. This was discussed after the Cotroceni meeting, when  the opposition put to Iliescu a proposal to mediate between the  CDR and the PDSR. This issue is no longer topical. At that  time we proceeded from the following course of actions: We said  that first of all we, that is, both sides, should sit down and  examine whether -- as Mr. Gherman said -- there is the  possibility of agreement on a minimal program. This would have  been the first compulsory stage. Then, if we agreed on such a  program, we should examine how it could be implemented. But to  implement something you need laws. Therefore, we need the  support of the opposition, which it should grant to the  government under certain conditions and for a given period of  time. Then, finally, when we have the program and we have the  laws, we must also have the people to do the work. These were  our proposals: a minimal program, a different parliamentary  configuration, and a coalition government. We never reached the  stage of seriously discussing the second and third proposals  because we never sat down to discuss the minimal program!    [Filip] Why not?    [Manolescu] First of all because of mutual suspicion. Each  side suspected the other of being insincere. However, I want to  repeat: It seems useless to discuss this issue because I can  understand that even when the PDSR is not sincere in embarking  on an action, it will still do so because it is under pressure  from the IMF, the trade unions, its own electorate, or the  general situation prevailing in Romania.    [Filip] Oliviu Gherman affirmed that there is no political  crisis in Romania because there is a parliamentary majority of  53 percent. He also said that the tacit understanding of the  PDSR with the PSM [Socialist Workers Party], the PRM [Greater  Romania Party], and the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party],  which have allegedly accepted the PDSR program, is satisfactory  for governing the country. Do you believe that Romania can be  ruled on the basis of such a political formula?    [Manolescu] Officially, there is no political crisis. We  have a Constitution, a Parliament, a government, a president, an  opposition, and all that. However, if we consider that  Parliament does not succeed in passing laws that are necessary  for the reform, that the government comes up with a draft budget  that aims to support bankrupt enterprises and not revive and  assist those able to produce something and the private sector,  then we do face a political crisis. Because neither we nor they  are doing anything. We cannot because we are not governing.  Those who are do nothing because they have other interests or  because they are also blocked by God knows what mental inertia,  so to speak.    [Filip] Do you think that the current government coalition  is able to implement the economic reform in Romania?    [Manolescu] The current coalition has no means of  implementing such a reform in Romania. A lot of shortfalls have  appeared in this coalition -- which includes the PDSR, the PUNR,  the PSM, and the PRM. The PUNR currently wishes to withdraw its  support and denounce the protocol with the PDSR; the PSM has  made explosive declarations regarding current social life; and  the PRM has acted in a similar fashion. It is clear that the  PDSR cannot go any further with these allies, especially as far  as reform policy is concerned. It must decide whether it wants  to continue moving along with its current allies and with  pseudo-reforms, which will lead to hyperinflation and disaster  or look for allies somewhere else and negotiate each point of a  minimal program with them.    [Filip] Do you really believe that the shortcomings that you  are talking about are real? What can stop the PSM, PRM, and  PUNR members of parliament from continuing to vote with the PDSR?    [Manolescu] The shortfalls are real. It was possible for  the PSM and PRM to vote for the investiture program, and the  memorandum with the IMF was a contradiction of their own  doctrines and platforms. In other words, the PSM and PRM voted  for a program that is 80 percent liberal. The memorandum with  the IMF, except for the excessive taxation and two or three  additional things, is almost a liberal program. I do not  believe that [PSM President] Verdet can continue with such a  program to the very end and to the very last consequences. The  PDSR should take this into account. The support that comes from  the left is temporary and it will last only as long as the PSM  and PRM wish to remain in the coalition because they have  certain interests in doing so. At the moment I do not know what  type of games will be played before the elections, but you will  see that the two parties, even the PUNR, will denounce the  government. As a matter of fact, this is happening even now.  The press is full of accusations and criticism against the  government voiced by its current allies.    [Filip] I agree: During the voting in Parliament, all those  who criticized the government are supporting it...    [Manolescu] Here we are witnessing a political game and I  believe that this game will last only as long as the conditions  that generated it also last. When they no longer have an  interest -- around the time of the elections, for example -- the  PSM, PRM, and PUNR will withdraw from the coalition, and the  reason that they will invoke for this move will be that they can  no longer participate in the country's disaster because they  would lose credibility and their own electorate, which is  attached to the idea of state ownership and does not want reform  but rather the conservation of certain structures. Since the  existence of these parties and their political success depend  directly on a certain type of voter, they cannot afford to risk  too much.    There is a certain limit that they cannot exceed. That is  why the PDSR must understand that if it wants a reform program,  then it has to look for reformist allies. If it does not want  this, then it can stay with its current allies. But in that  case, it will get into an impasse and that will be the moment  when the political crisis will no longer be -- as Mr. Gherman  says -- only a rumor but a real one, and it might bring about  the fall of the government.    [Filip] If we were guided by the results of the latest  opinion poll, which indicates a very high percentage in favor of  the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], we  could conclude that there is a risk that the size of the CDR  might be reduced and mixed up with the PNTCD. Am I mistaken or  is there indeed such a risk?    [Manolescu] There was such a risk especially during the last  elections and it continues to remain. But this is a risk that  we have accepted and the PNTCD -- we must admit this --  emphasized it as much as it could. This situation suited  them.... Now it is to be seen if in the next elections the  electorate will want a convention that can be identified with  the PNTCD or one in which each political formation, starting  with the most radical and ending with the most "well behaved,"  is appropriately represented. As far as the opinion polls are  concerned, I read them in two ways. First, as if they were  perfectly correct. However, I ask myself what will happen at  the elections, because Romania is not a country where you can  say that if the opinion polls come up with a certain result,  this will also be the result of the elections. Then, there is  another way of reading them. I do not believe that in our  country opinion polls are not manipulated. The sympathies and  antipathies of those who conduct them are quite obvious, so this  is a situation in which I read the opinion polls as signals  coming from those who manipulate them and who wish to implant a  certain idea in my mind. Why is the CDR leading and why does the  PNTCD have a higher percentage than it could have hoped for?  The opinion polls may create a certain state of mind that makes  us believe that we are already the winners. Thus, let us have  early elections and win them! But then we go into the elections  and realize that we have lost again! I distance myself from  such opinion polls.    [Filip] Is the CDR a political formula compatible with the  liberal alternative?    [Manolescu] We have said that it would seem normal to us if  the PNL [National Liberal Party] returned to the CDR, where it  was from the beginning and from which it withdrew because of an  error committed by Mr. [Radu] Campeanu [former PNL leader], an  error that, as a matter of fact, cost him dearly. In this way  two very clear political factions could be established within  the CDR. The Christian democratic side and the liberal side.  This however does not mean a split in the CDR, but a certain  clarification that is recommended both for parties as well as  for the electorate. That is all, it means nothing else!    [Filip] Let us assume that the CDR won the elections. In  what direction would Romania move?    [Manolescu] From an economic point of view it would move  according to liberal doctrine. There is no alternative on this  point, as even social democratic parties prove to be liberal  when they come up with reform programs. From the social  viewpoint, none of the liberal parties is so naive as to believe  that a sudden liberal reform without social protection, without  elements that would consolidate the family and the civic  society, can produce positive results. Thus, there would be no  great problem because the liberals and the Christian democrats  understand each other on fundamental issues. They also talk  about a liberal economy just as we talk about the civic society  and social protection. There is no other way.    [Filip] Currently, the liberal parties are split and some of  them are troubled by internal conflicts. Therefore, the image  of Romanian liberalism is about to be discredited. What would  be the consequences of a possible failure of liberalism at the  next elections?    [Manolescu] The current image of our liberalism is very poor  and if the liberal movement fails it will be a disaster. The  PAC and the PL'93 [Liberal Party '93] have been in conflict not  for ideological reasons in the first place, although there are  certainly differences between us, but mainly for personal  reasons. There is a struggle between two wings within the PNL,  a struggle between two leaders who are not separated by  differences of doctrine. If the liberal parties do not learn  how to set aside these confrontations of a personal nature and  generated by arrogance, then it means that they want to commit  suicide. The unification of the liberal movement does not  necessarily mean a merger. You do not walk over all the  personalities and place Patriciu [member of the PL'93  leadership] in a position to give orders to [PNL President]  Quintus or vice versa. But at least an alliance of principles  and program can be achieved by maintaining the identity of each  party. If liberalism fails, it will lead to the loss of its  electorate and to the establishment of a parliament that  resembles the parliament in Poland, with the consequent  political consequences, among them the strengthening of the  left....    [Filip] On several occasions, representatives of the "A  Future for Romania" group have stated that the traditional  left-right model is worn out and another political formula is  required. What is your opinion of this?    [Manolescu] I agree with it. In a society as confused as  ours, a clear model with precise delimitations between right and  left has never worked. Our electorate is not very receptive to  terms such as right or left. However, we have no other choice  because this is the classical definition of the fields of  political force. Either we use them or we do not.... But I do  not believe that the essence lies in terminology. I do not  believe that an electoral campaign based on terms such as right  or left will clarify things for many people.    [Filip] What formula would you suggest?    [Manolescu] Currently the situation is simple. Reformists  and anti-reformists.... Thus, also the word reform should be  checked to see whether it has been discredited in the  post-December 1989 period.... However, let us say that we still  have a tradition of four years of reformism and anti-reformism.  Do you want changes or not? If you want changes, we understand  each other. The pace and methods can be established later. But  if you do not want changes, then there is nothing to talk about!</p>

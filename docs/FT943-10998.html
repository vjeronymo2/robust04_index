			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television One American influence on Cuba that seems to have developed deep roots is baseball. It is the national sport - and then some. A whole different ball game (BBC 2 at 7.40), the programme that travels the world to reveal how important sport is to some cultures, looks at the phenomenon. Castro is a great fan; seven players have made it into politics; yet for the stars the real money lies across the Florida Straits, a constant temptation which few apparently dare succumb to. Keith Floyd seems much happier eating his way through Italy than wrestling with the mysteries of south east Asian cuisine. This week (BBC 2 at 8.30) he has reached Umbria, and after a spot of grilled perch for breakfast he goes mushroom hunting before settling down to the cooking - beef and mushrooms in red wine. Yet another programme which has successfully made the jump from radio to television is Just a Minute (ITV at 10.40.) Robert Jahn was Dean of Engineering at Princeton University until his interest in ESP lost him the respect of his colleagues. He is the latest Heretic on BBC 2 at 10pm.</p>

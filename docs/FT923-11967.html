			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Personal View: Credibility gap in policy Many people are sadly puzzled that there is still no sign of economic recovery. It is right to be sad, but wrong to be puzzled. Why on earth should we expect recovery on present policies? Has there ever been a serious and sustained recovery (ie: a return by the economy to its underlying growth path) with real short-term interest rates maintained at more than 6 per cent? It is hard to find precedents. In the balmy decades of zero to 2 per cent inflation, a bank rate of 6-8 per cent was regarded as a crisis measure - not one to be maintained for years at a time. There is one apparent precedent: the mid-1980s recovery from the last recession when real interest rates, although not as high as now, ranged from 3-5 per cent in the years 1982-84, rising further as expansion gathered pace in 1985 and 1986. Some may feel encouraged by this, arguing that then, as now, policy was driven by the need to crack down on inflation and inflationary expectations; and that as these duly fell, a strong and sustained recovery took place - the only problem being that it was too sustained. The precedent, however, is misleading. The initial policy shock was administered by means of a tight fiscal policy, a high exchange rate and (initially) low real interest rates, imposed on an economy that was relatively under-borrowed (1980 registered the peak postwar personal savings rate of 16.5 per cent). Recovery from the recession was driven by two forces not in prospect now: a sharp fall in the exchange rate (13 per cent between 1982 and 1984) and a massive expansion of credit throughout the period associated with financial deregulation. (Deregulation was seen as a supply-side measure at the time, but no less an authority than Mr Nigel Lawson has recently drawn attention to the substantial and significantly underestimated effects on demand.) This time round, the authorities have for three years been working to curb the inflationary excesses of a seriously over-borrowed economy with high real interest rates, a loose fiscal policy and a fixed exchange rate. The excessive credit expansion of the 1980s is being unwound with a vengeance, but will continue, as the infernal machine of compound interest takes its toll, to exert a downward pressure on the economy for some time to come. A man from Mars would find our official policy stance surprising. So indeed might a man from the United States, where, confronted by a similar hang-over from a credit boom and although stuck with gigantic fiscal deficits, the authorities have acted in a classically appropriate way by dropping interest rates and letting the exchange rate fall. They are being rewarded by some recovery, although the slowness and apparent fragility of this testify to the dragging power of debt deflation, even when it is being tackled appropriately. Why then is the British economy being put through this particularly painful wringer? The first answer is, as it was in the early 1980s, to squeeze inflation out of the system. If, because inflationary expectations are so stubbornly embedded in the UK, it is necessary to produce a deep and long-lasting recession to get retail price expectations down from say 4-5 per cent to 2 per cent, then so be it. As the years go by and the damage mounts, one might query whether this game is worth the candle. But if it is, the situation cries out for tight fiscal policy - another 'Howe' Budget (with savage expenditure cuts, tax increases or whatever was necessary) to allow interest rates to drop. But of course the main reason given for maintaining interest rates at current levels is our membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. It is true that the maintenance of our present ERM parity is not consistent with the substantial (at least 2-3 per cent) drop in interest rates that we need. And we are told that a devaluation within the ERM, let alone allowing sterling to float for a period, would produce a blow to confidence and a loss of official credibility that would be quite unacceptable. Our situation is so serious that there is unlikely to be any way out of it that is not messy, embarrassing and risky; and does not involve eating a lot of official words. But, having entered the ERM, after 11 years' delay, at the wrong time, at the wrong rate and in the wrong manner, must we really regard the indefinite maintenance of the parity then chosen as the ultimate touchstone of political and economic credibility? For one thing, we shall not be able to hold the present exchange rate for ever. By the end of this year we shall have notched up a cumulative deficit of Pounds 70bn since 1987 (and a net deficit of Pounds 50bn since North Sea oil first arrived). If and when the economy recovers the deficit will expand beyond its rate of Pounds 10bn a year. Of course, no one can say how long this deterioration in our balance sheet, with its cumulative effect on our invisible earnings, can go on. Maybe for years. But this tree will not grow to the sky. Commitments to an exchange rate are meant to be difficult to abandon: that is their purpose as a policy tool. But they are not meant to be impossible to abandon until there is a single currency. The way towards a single currency lies through a serious and sustained integration of the economies concerned, not through gestures which can be widely seen to have inappropriate economic consequences. (If by historical accident we had not yet joined the ERM, who can doubt that our interest rates would be lower?) The recently ended series of optimistic forecasts from the chancellor, each falsified in turn, indicates that the government itself did not expect or will the effects on the economy that we are suffering. For the moment, however, we cannot expect a serious shift towards tight fiscal policy, lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate. It is more than 20 years since the UK has operated in a fixed exchange rate regime, and many people have forgotten, or never knew, the paralysis which that is apt to produce in British policymaking. Serious action is unthinkable until it happens. In the meantime, activity will perhaps inch up as inflation inches down and that may be thought to be enough, at least during the British presidency of the European Community. But one day, something really will have to be done. The author is the former chairman of Midland Bank and former deputy governor of the Bank of England.</p>

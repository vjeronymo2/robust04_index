			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Socialists' win in Bulgaria lifts hope for reform The Bulgarian Socialist party won a decisive victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections, preliminary results show. Calculations based on 95 per cent of the vote give the BSP, the successors to the Communist party, 43.5 per cent support and an outright majority of more than 120 seats in the 240-seat chamber. Mr Zhan Videnov, BSP leader, who is expected to become prime minister, said he would try to form a broad coalition government. However, other parties have so far ruled out co-operation with the former communists. The last election in October 1991 was won by the Union of Democratic Forces, a broad anti-communist alliance, but it fell from office after losing a vote of no-confidence in October 1992. A non-party government of technocrats took over, led by Mr Lyuben Berov and supported in parliament by BSP votes and a collection of breakaway parties from the UDF. On Sunday the UDF won only about 24 per cent of the vote and 69 seats, compared with 34 per cent support and 110 seats in 1991. At that election the BSP won 33 per cent of the vote and 106 seats. Under Bulgaria's electoral rules, only parties which gain more than 4 per cent support win representation in parliament. In Sunday's turnout of more than 75 per cent, the Popular Union attracted more than 6 per cent of the vote, the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF) won more than 5 per cent, and the Bulgarian Business Block took just under 5 per cent. Monarchist parties failed to gain entry to parliament, as did the Democratic Alternative for the Republic, a small coalition of centre-left parties. Both the UDF and the MRF have appealed to the anti-communist forces to combine their efforts to become an alternative to the Socialists. Bulgaria now has an opportunity for stable government by a Socialist party which is internally divided but which is likely to be dominated by pragmatic reformers who accept the need for a market economy and privatisation. In this Bulgaria is following a pattern in central Europe, where pragmatic wings of Socialist parties in Poland, Hungary and Lithuania have gained the upper hand. However, unlike these countries, where economic reforms are well advanced, Bulgaria has a long way to go. A report by the IMF's representative in Sofia revealed last week that Bulgaria is expected to have the highest rate of inflation and the lowest real economic growth in eastern Europe next year. According to the report, the reasons for this disappointing outcome are the long delays in implementing necessary structural reforms, combined with mistakes in macro-economic policy.</p>

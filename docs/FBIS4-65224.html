			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Clear Slowdown of Growth in Export </F> Value"]    [Text] The slower trend in the growth of exports that began  in February continued in the March foreign trade statistics.  The value of exports rose by a mere 6 percent in March as  against 23 percent during the same period last year.    The cumulative increase in exports for the period  January-March was 11 percent, whereas it was still at 24 percent  the year before. The active trade balance, however, has  continued to grow as the result of a reduction in the value of  imports, which fell by 19 percent in February and 9 percent in  March. The accumulated surplus for the period January-March was  9.8 billion Finnish markkas [FMk]. This surplus exceeds the  same figure for 1993 by FMk4.5 billion, i.e., 86 percent.  <H5>  Surplus in Trade With Russia </H5>   Finland's trade figures show surplus with nearly every  country to which it exports. The highest cumulative figures for  the period January-March relate to trade with Britain, Sweden,  Germany, and the Netherlands. These show a total surplus of  more than FMk1 billion in Finland's favor. Trade with Russia  also showed a surplus for the early part of the year, but only  of FMk140 million. The value of exports to Russia grew in  January-March by 70 percent while the value of imports dropped  by 12 percent. Exports to Germany rose to FMk4.8 billion, which  made it Finland's most important customer for exports.    The greatest deficit for the January-March period was, as  usual, to be seen in trade with Japan. Finland's imports from  Japan exceeded exports by FMk1 billion, although exports rose by  45 percent. The slower growth of exports became evident in what  is financially the most important sector, namely metal products  and machinery, where, in the period January-March, the value of  exports grew by only 12 percent compared to 42 percent last  year. Exports of products in the paper and printing industry  sector rose by 5 percent as against 18 percent last year.  Exports rose in the sectors of textiles, clothing, leather,  footwear, chemicals, and mining products, but their share of  Finland's total export value is modest. Exports of chemical  products grew in value from 4 to 6 percent.</p>

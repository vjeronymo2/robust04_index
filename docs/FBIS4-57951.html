			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero from the "ACIR Radio News"] </F>   [Text] Cecilia Soto Gonzalez, Labor Party [PT] presidential  candidate, commented on the events that occurred yesterday at  the National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] involving  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party] presidential candidate, and accounting faculty students.    Ernesto Zedillo visited the UNAM, specifically the  Accounting  and Business Administration Faculty, to meet with university  students in a closed forum at a faculty auditorium. What took  place instead was several instances of verbal and even physical  abuse against Zedillo. Things got so out of hand that the PRI  candidate was nearly hit by a bottle or a stone. Insults may  not cause any physical harm, but they do undermine an  individual's morale.    Ernesto Zedillo had agreed to meet with the university  students, who requested an open dialogue in the university's  esplanade, not in a closed auditorium guarded by presidential  security agents for several hours prior to the meeting. As a  result, the dialogue never took place. The media, including  Radio ACIR, have commented extensively on what took place.    The PT candidate said it would be a mistake to stop trying  to  hold dialogues at public and private universities and demanded  respect for all presidential candidates.    Ms. Soto was interviewed after a breakfast meeting with  bankers, businessmen, and investors at a Mexico City hotel.  Naturally she condemned the abuse to which the PRI presidential  candidate was subjected, saying it was an unfortunate incident  that could jeopardize dialogues at the nation's universities.  She called on everyone to keep working for dialogues at the  universities.    Cecilia Soto stressed that the presidential candidates  should  not be attacked and should be received with respect. She added  that the attack against Zedillo is an irrational action  reminiscent of the dinosaurs.    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate of the Mexican  Green Ecologist Party [PVEM], said that what took place at the  UNAM yesterday with Ernesto Zedillo must be analyzed within its  real perspective. He added that university students have always  been very serious about dialogues with the authorities.  According to Gonzalez, the PRI candidate must also respect the  guidelines in force at the UNAM.    The PVEM candidate said that perhaps the person most  responsible for the incidents,which fortunately did not develop  into anything more serious, was Zedillo himself. The PRI  candidate organized a meeting with students that even included  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] members. In addition,  it was a dialogue during which the genuine students were not the  ones who spoke out.    Gonzalez Torres warned that there is pent up dissatisfaction  among the population that is ready to explode throughout the  country. He said that what the people really want is a closer,  more genuine relationship with the presidential candidates, not  violent confrontations such as that which took place this  Tuesday between PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce  and UNAM students.    During a visit to the community of (Pericos) as part of his  campaign program, Gonzalez Torres rejected the figurative type  of democracy that the government's candidate is offering as well  as the Defense Secretariat's decision to purchase more weapons.    [Begin Gonzalez Torres recording] The campaign programs do  not address genuine needs. You all witnessed how one attempt  turned out. This indicates that first there is a need for prior  contacts. Contacts cannot take place hastily; they must be  gradual. I hope we will all be able to understand this. If  not, we will be going along with a figurative democracy  believing that everything is fine when the truth is that there  is rising dissatisfaction throughout the nation and it is ready  to explode The Mexican people do not want more weapons to  repress them, they want assistance. The government's  responsibility is to serve, not to repress or to remain in power  by any means. [end recording]    The PVEM candidate's visit to (Pericos) was quite colorful.  Gonzalez Torres distributed calendars and [words indistinct] to  businessmen. Amid shoves and shouts, he stopped and spoke to  the people, who were demanding answers from the federal district  about increasing garbage, candidates not honoring their campaign  promises, and a closer relationship with the candidates.  (Pericos) businessmen, mostly young adults, shouted slogans  such as "Green is Life" while the PVEM candidate toured the  community.    Gonzalez Torres expressed his opposition to the appointment  of citizen advisors, whom he described as more advisers to the  PRI, the National Action Party, and the PRD than to society in  general.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Broad Front presidential candidate and </F> Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez by unidentified BUSQUEDA  reporter; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [BUSQUEDA] You have said that the electoral  "options" in November will be "between neoliberalism and  democracy." What did you mean by that?    [Vazquez] A society can be individualist or collectivist.  The  first centers on a person's ego, and so society inevitably  becomes egoistic. The other alternative seeks the common good  for present and future generations. I think that is the key to  the matter. The neoliberal concept points to an individualist  society, with free competition, where "the best" wins. If we all  participated on equal terms I could, perhaps if not accept it,  at least analyze it. But not everyone starts from the same  point. Some people start with an advantage and arrive first.  This is tremendously unfair. Besides, individualist societies  can lead to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands  of very few individuals, who end up controlling the rest of the  population. This system considerably weakens democracy. In this  system the people do not govern. They are governed by a group of  individuals who have concentrated strength, power, and wealth.  This group has power and force because it has wealth. This is  not democratic, and it materializes as a consequence of the  neoliberal concept. On the contrary, societies working with a  democratic, collectivist, socialist spirit tend to be a model  like the one we have tried to implement in Montevideo, where we  have tried to decentralize power, seek people's participation,  and redistribute wealth to deepen democracy. This is why we  think we will see a confrontation of two sets of ideas. On the  one hand there are the liberal or neoliberal ideas--whatever you  want to call it, it is the same thing--and on the other  progressive, socialist ideas. That is the center of the  confrontation. I do not think there are other options.    [BUSQUEDA] Who are the "socialists" and who the  "neoliberals?"    [Vazquez] I do not want to characterize Uruguayans as good  or  bad. Some of us simply think in one way, and others in a  different way. In the National Party the Herreraist faction,  other related movements, and Gonzalo Aguirre all point to a  neoliberal idea. I do not know what Carlos Julio Pereyra would  do in government. All I know is that he has participated in the  government with the ruling party, and has supported liberal or  neoliberal ideas. The Colorado Party as a whole has neoliberal  principles. All Colorado Party factions support neoliberal  principles. Pacheco Areco, Jorge Battle, and Luis Maria  Sanguinetti do so.    [BUSQUEDA] In your opinion, then, a vote for either the  National Party or the Colorado Party suggests a vote for  "neoliberalism," while the Broad Front alone supports  "socialist" ideas?    [Vazquez] Yes, although it is not only the Broad Front that  believes in alternatives to the neoliberal system. Many  progressive groups within the National Party, the Christian  Democratic Party, the Civic Union, and the PGP [Party of  Government by the People], which do not want to join in a  coalition with the Colorado Party, also have alternative ideas.  [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think Cerro Largo Mayor Rodolfo Nin  Novoa is the best candidate for becoming your running mate?    [Vazquez] I do not know if he is the best candidate, but  from  the point of view of an alliance, he has extremely important  credentials. He was Cerro Largo's mayor during the previous  period, and was reelected. There must be a reason. He could have  chosen between the Cerro Largo city hall and a seat in the  Senate. He chose to continue in a very difficult position, in a  very poor department, with very few resources. This shows that  he is a very serious politician. He also worked against the  impunity law. Then he worked against the imposition of the state  enterprises law, and on very important municipal issues. He  defended the deregulation of services and functions, political  decentralization, and people's participation. He has maintained  really progressive ideas within his party, adopting clear  positions. He recently said that he was willing to resign from  the National Party if necessary to defend his political  position. This is extremely serious and consistent. Nin Novoa's  political behavior moves in a clearly defined direction, which  must be respected. For all these reasons I think he is an  excellent candidate for becoming part of a presidential ticket.    [BUSQUEDA] What will be the main issues in the campaign?    [Vazquez] We think the numbers have to add up, the accounts  have to balance, but our ultimate objective is not balanced  accounts but an improvement in people's standards of living. All  issues that have something to do with human beings will be given  priority. For instance, the issue of social security. There is  no social security without solidarity.    [BUSQUEDA] Do you think the current social security system  must be reformed? Or should it be left the way it is now?    [Vazquez] I think we have to improve the system, not destroy  it. We must improve the system's administration and the  collection and distribution of funds. But all improvements must  be done without changing the state role, and insisting on each  employee's work history.    [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the fight against inflation?    [Vazquez] The current government reduced the country's  inflation rate, but we want to reduce it faster. At what cost  and how is another matter, but inflation dropped. We also want a  fiscal balance, such as that we achieved in the municipality.  This shows that efficiency and the good handling of figures can  also be achieved by groups that are not liberal or neoliberal.  The difference is that progressive groups seek to benefit man.  Figures are not the final objective. Now if you ask me what will  be more important, or whether I will support and seek loans for  bankrupt financial institutions and banks, the answer is no.  That will not prevail in any way.    [BUSQUEDA] The state has more than 250,000 employees. Would  you implement programs aimed at reducing the number of public  employees?    [Vazquez] The number of public employees during my municipal  administration dropped from 13,000 to 10,500. That was all right  because there were too many employees. But I cannot give you an  answer now about what we will do if we win the presidential  race. If the situation in the national administration is similar  to the situation we found at the Montevideo city hall, we will  make adjustments. In Montevideo we had a significant number of  administrative personnel and few people rendering services to  the people, which is what the public needs. We spent more money  in the area of services than in any other area. Perhaps the  problem is similar at the national level. But we will see about  that later.    [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the issue of privatization if  you become president?    [Vazquez] Without prejudices. Private initiative can also  generate jobs. If it is correctly handled it can also  redistribute wealth. Private initiative is not a dirty word. We  can say the same thing about "entrepreneurs" or "enterprises."    [BUSQUEDA] Will you speed up the devaluation of our currency  if you become president?    [Vazquez] From our point of view it is clear that our  currency is overvalued, and there is a clear increase in the  import of luxurious items. This is the result of the free market  concept. These kinds of policies inevitably end up benefiting a  small group of people. This group handles large amounts of  capital and treats Uruguay as if it were just a financial  market. This path is not best for the public. On the other hand,  it is true that inflation punishes most harshly the poorest  sectors, and particularly those with fixed incomes. I think the  goal is to reduce the inflation rate. We must change the concept  that the country is just a financial market. We must produce and  export more. Trade must be balanced, or it must show a surplus.    [BUSQUEDA] Yet exporters contend that as the dollar is  cheap,  their activity is not cost effective. If you are elected  president, do you think you will have to implement some measures  in the exchange system?    [Vazquez] In the exchange system, and in the country's  system  as well, because inflation is not the result of only one factor.  At one time this administration argued that inflation stemmed  from a fiscal imbalance. It therefore undertook a fiscal  adjustment to roll down inflation. The fiscal adjustment had  some measure of success, but inflation did not go down as much  as expected. The administration resorted to other measures that  were in obvious alignment with laissez-faire ideas. I think we  have to seek a meeting of minds if we are to curb  inflation--which weighs more heavily on precisely the  neediest--through a different economic, political, and social  concept. This cannot be achieved overnight, and the steps to be  taken will be gradual. We are not proposing a radical change in  policy, but rather a gradual one, trying to keep inflation under  control but changing into a producer country through a major  industrial retooling.    [BUSQUEDA] You said in Rivera last December that wealth  ought  to be "taxed" and redistributed. Are you considering  establishing new taxes or increasing those that are already in  effect?    [Vazquez] Tax policy should be changed, for example on  landholding of unproductive large estates, or on those used for  extensive rather than intensive agriculture. Taxes should be  levied on the financial sector, and the country's production  should be fostered by easing the tax burden on productive  activities. Wealth should be taxed so that those who have more  may pay more, changing the distribution of taxes. This change  may allow us, for example, to reduce the VAT [value added tax].    [BUSQUEDA] Will you encourage the elimination of bank  confidentiality if you gain the presidency?    [Vazquez] Bank secrecy in Uruguay has led some international  sectors to the opinion that Uruguay is a stronghold for the  laundering of drug money. If Congress does enact such  legislation, and the judiciary gives its okay, I believe that it  would be quite appropriate to do away with bank confidentiality  in some cases.    [BUSQUEDA] Referring to you and to the Broad Front's  problems, Luis Eduardo Gonzalez, a sociologist, said in an  article published in the MIAMI HERALD: "We have a jockey who is  a real pro, but the problem is the horse." What is your opinion  on this remark?    [Vazquez] The Broad Front is neither the pinnacle nor the  ideal as a political party, but it is making much headway. The  Broad Front has had internal problems, but over the last few  months it has shown very significant coherence. First, it  elected provisional authorities who are also empowered with  significant decisionmaking power. Second, it proposed that the  decisions of the second Broad Front Congress--held in August  1991--concerning political alliances be firmly pursued.  Third--and this is something that would have been unimaginable  seven or eight months ago--it has been able to draft a framework  program dealing with crucial issues such as the external debt,  relations with the Armed Forces and the police, and the  country's economic and financial policy. We will be able to use  this program as a basis for our discussions with other political  parties. Moreover, it has nominated its consensus candidates.</p>

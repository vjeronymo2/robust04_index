			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nippon takes 15% stake in MIM study NIPPON MINING, the Japanese resources group, has taken a 15 per cent stake in a ADollars 10m (Pounds 4.5m) feasibility study being carried out by MIM, the Australian mining group, into metals deposit at Macarthur River in the Northern Territory. MIM said Nippon had also taken an option on 15 per cent of the deposit if development proceeded. The ore body, midway between Mount Isa and Darwin, is thought to contain some 200m tonnes of zinc, lead and silver ore. Macarthur River is the third joint venture between MIM and Nippon. The two companies last week announced the go-ahead for a Y50bn (Pounds 215m) lead and zinc smelter in Japan, to be built together with Mitsui Mining and Smelting and Mitsubishi Materials. MIM produces copper, lead, silver and zinc from its main mines at Mount Isa, Queensland, and has extensive interests in coal and gold mines in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The group suffered a 76 per cent fall in interim net operating profits to ADollars 16m in the six months to December, but says it will achieve a reduction of ADollars 100m a year in Mount Isa operating costs this year. Western Mining Corporation has asked the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order striking miners to return to work at its Kambalda nickel operation. Mr Phil Lockyer, general manager of state operations, said the strikers had twice rejected a compromise agreement reached between the company and the Australian Workers Union. WMC says the strikers are seeking a general increase in piece rates of 18 per cent, and a specific increase of 30 per cent for part of the workforce, but have rejected proposed productivity improvements. The miners have been on indefinite strike since March 17, but the company claims a total of 35 working days have been lost since the claim was made. The IRC has the power to order the strikers to return to work while negotiations take place.</p>

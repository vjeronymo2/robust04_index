			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Farms 'fit for heroes' under threat: Council smallholdings may fall victim to a budget squeeze Henry Duncalfe began farming five years ago on a modest 60 acres near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. Today he runs a thriving business growing soft fruit for Marks and Spencer and Tesco. He is about to double his acreage to 240, providing summer jobs for 120 fruit-pickers and putting Pounds 130,000 into the depressed local economy. Mr Duncalfe, a former farm manager, was only able to start his own business thanks to a little-known institution - the county council small-holding. He could not afford the price of land and was unable to find a long-term tenancy in the private sector because fears about security of tenure have stopped landowners letting for more than a few years. Now the 5,700 public-sector farms in England and Wales are under threat from local government reorganisation and the squeeze on council budgets. Many in the industry are worried that the farms, promoted by Lloyd George to provide 'land fit for heroes' returning from the first world war, will be split up and sold off. The pressure on councils to realise short-term capital gains is mounting. Mr Desmond Hampton of land agents Cluttons told a recent conference organised by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: 'If I was advising county councils, I would be suggesting they should retain their estate until they can secure vacant possession of any holding, but at that point sell it to the best advantage in the open market.' The case was strengthened by 'the small and frequently uneconomic size of the county council farming unit'. Mr Greg Birdseye of the Audit Commission said county councils had to ask 'whether there might be better things to do with the money' given agricultural over-production and the squeeze on other services such as education. Advocates of the county farm system believe such arguments are misplaced. Mr Charles Coats, head of Gloucestershire Estates Consultancy, which runs 9,000 acres of farms, says the farms bring jobs, new ideas and environmental benefits such as public access and maintained hedgerows. The Gloucestershire estate employs 480 people directly and indirectly - which suggests more than 18,000 jobs on the 340,000 acres of council farms nationally. Demand for tenancies is strong. Gloucestershire receives 20 to 30 applications for each of the four or five vacancies that arise every year. Competition has been intensified by a logjam. County farms were designed to give young entrants a first step on the farming ladder. But many tenants have failed to move on because there are no long-term private-sector tenancies - a problem which should be eased by pending de-regulation. Tenants also had life tenure until retirement at 65 was introduced in 1984. Farmers pay commercial rents but they benefit from 'pump-priming' in the form of loans for repairs or new buildings and machinery which they pay back through rent increases. The county councils also bear the extra costs of managing a large number of small farms of 100 acres or less which private landowners would generally amalgamate. But council farms are 'not a drain on the taxpayer', insists Mr Coats. He says most estates produce surpluses on both revenue and capital through careful management and sales of unwanted land and buildings for development. And he believes that the break-up of county councils into unitary authorities could reverse those gains. The local government commissioners have recommended keeping the status quo in Gloucestershire, but neighbouring counties such as Somerset face big reorganisation. 'Our concern is that if there's a split into smaller authorities . . . one could lose the economies of scale and of managing on a county-wide basis,' says Mr Coats. Some farmers' leaders are suggesting keeping estates intact by having them transferred into trusts. They might be managed under contract by existing teams acting as private-sector consultants - an option Mr Duncalfe would favour if, as seems likely, Cambridgeshire County Council is split up. Success stories like Mr Duncalfe's are being used by proponents of the county farms to press for their preservation. 'If we don't provide this service, there aren't the opportunities for the able, entrepreneurial and innovative to start in farming,' said Mr Coats.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking limits gains in continental bourses RENEWED pressure for a further round of interest rate cuts provided background noise yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Morgan Stanley commented that while they still expect European short-term interest rates to fall below 4 per cent in the core countries by next year, earnings growth is unlikely to be sufficient 'to prop up current valuation levels in European equities'. As a consequence Morgan Stanley has reduced its European equity weighting in its model portfolio, although continuing to highlight Germany 'where the benefits of corporate restructuring should support corporate earnings growth'. FRANKFURT slipped from the day's highs on late profit-taking, but the DAX index still managed to stay just above the 2,000 level at 2,001.51, a day's gain of 2.90. Equity market commentators remarked that sentiment in Germany remained positive at present, helped by Tuesday's news that the federal constitutional court had rejected challenges to the Maastricht treaty. Turnover was DM8.5bn. A recent announcement that a new mutual fund was to be launched on October 20 which could inject some DM2bn into equities was also keeping sentiment high, analysts said. Schering rose DM50 to an all time high DM1,069 on news that production of its Betaseron drug may be increased. A record high was also recorded by Kloeckner, up DM7.70 to DM92.20 on reports that its steel division might be sold. Wella put on DM26.50 to DM848 ahead of reporting after the close a rise in its dividend and plans to list 20 per cent of its ordinary shares. PARIS was another market which lost ground in late trading, the CAC-40 index ending up just 0.43 at 2,127.28, after a day's high of 2,144. Turnover was FFr3.4bn. Turbulence in the currency markets which pushed the French franc down sharply had some effect on the market. Generale des Eaux shed FFr39 to FFr2,618 following its announcement, widely expected, of a FFr3-4bn rights issue by the end of the year. James Capel kept the stock at a buy recommendation given expectations of outperformance on a 12 month view, helped by steady development in core activities and recovery potential in loss making businesses. ZURICH extended its record breaking run to four sessions, the SMI index adding 18.5 to 2,571.0. Strong demand for blue chip index heavyweights was attributed to short covering ahead of tomorrow's futures and options expiry. Ciba-Geigy registered shares slipped SFr2 to SFr718 in response to nine month results and the forecast of higher full year profit, although limited by economic conditions. MILAN finished lower ahead of the end of the monthly account today and began clearing the way for the Fiat rights issue. The Comit index shed 11.91 or 2.1 per cent to 568.03, with the failure of a small Milan brokerage house also casting a shadow. One analyst commented that the lower market was a positive sign for the Fiat capital raising exercise since it suggested that investors were cashing in profits in preparation for issue which begins tomorrow. Fiat shed L62 to L5,662. Ferruzzi was a major casualty of the session. The stock was delayed from trading on several occasions due to order imbalances and the rapid decline in the price. It ceased trading L101.40 or 24.8 per cent lower at L308. AMSTERDAM saw strong support for Unilever, up Fl 3.10 to Fl 203.80 as the CBS Tendency index added 0.1 to 128.8. Oce, the office machines manufacturer, rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 52.80 on better than expected third quarter results. STOCKHOLM saw further gains in Ericsson as the Affarsvarlden general index attempted to breach its all time high set in August 1989. However, it finished slightly below, up 8.10 at 1,371.90. ATHENS built on Tuesday's gains as investors decided that the election of the socialist party to government was good news. The general index added 25.21 or nearly 3 per cent to 874.62 after a rise of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders commented that the market had been driven yesterday mainly by individuals with little institutional buying noted. The banking sector, he added, was particularly active.

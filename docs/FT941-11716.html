			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Officials try to patch up relationship with US Downing Street yesterday launched a concerted attempt to paper over deep cracks in its relationship with the US after the visit to New York by Mr Gerry Adams. At the same time, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the almost unchallenged 48-hour access to the US media which the Sinn Fein president had. The government was unable, however, to conceal its dismay at President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. Publicly, Downing Street put a brave face on the affair. A senior official said the UK/US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'. In private, ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One senior minister said the president seemed to have put UK/US relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the Irish lobby in the US. The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to Mr Adams by the US media, and the lack of interest in balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said Mr Hurd was 'pushed off the networks by programmers who decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting'. The bitterness in London was not eased by a broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the US. Mr Seitz did not dispute a suggestion that he argued against giving Mr Adams the chance to capture US media attention. Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday as part of a drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity had borne fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the British/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy' to Belfast. Officials vehemently denied suggestions that Britain lost the propaganda war in the US because it was caught unprepared by Mr Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Mr Adams.</p>

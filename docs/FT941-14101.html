			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica sees break-even Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, said a recovery in the second half of last year meant it should break even in 1993 in spite of a L159.9bn (Dollars 97.3m) loss in the first half. The recovery forecast, made after a board meeting in Rome, is largely the result of the flotation or sale of a number of subsidiaries in the closing months of last year. These moves realised substantial extraordinary gains and helped reduce the group's heavy debts. Group sales dropped to L10,450bn from L11,200bn, largely because of the recession in the aerospace business and cuts in defence spending, which hit Finmeccanica's Alenia subsidiary. The group said the disposal drive would continue with the sale of its Esaote Biomedica medical equipment subsidiary, which is expected to be bought by a management team. Asset sales helped reduce net group indebtedness to about L5,250bn at the end of last year from L5,310bn the previous year. However, the fall was much more substantial when measured against end-June 1993, when net debts stood at L6,311bn. Finmeccanica's order book remained littled changed at L22,100bn at the end of last year against L22,300 in December 1992. Meanwhile, the group moved a step closer to taking over the defence operations of the former Efim state holding company with the appointment of Lehman Brothers and San Paolo Finance to advise on valuing the assets being transfered. Several auditing companies will advise Efim's special commissioner.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Hopes of EC unity on minimum for VAT THE Luxembourg presidency of the EC is to try next month for an agreement by 11 Community states on a minimum standard rate of value added tax, leaving the UK alone in its opposition to any EC regulation of fiscal rates. A discussion in Luxembourg on Saturday by EC finance ministers on how to bring indirect tax rates closer together, in advance of the planned removal of tax checks at internal EC borders in 1993, revealed a three-way split. Luxembourg had only Spain's backing for its proposal of a 14 per cent minimum standard VAT rate, while nine governments indicated their desire for a 16 per cent minimum. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, said Britain believed indirect tax rates should be market-driven, and it would oppose any EC tax proposals, all of which require unanimity to pass. Mr Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg said his country, with its traditionally low indirect tax rates, had some sympathy with the UK argument, but wanted to use the last month of its presidency to get some agreement on the issue. Approximation is already, in fact, happening with low-rate countries such as Luxembourg and Germany raising their VAT rates, and higher-rate countries like France, Belgium and Ireland lowering theirs. But this process is not going fast enough for others to contemplate abolishing all cross-border tax checks in less than two years without fear of trade distortions. Other proposals to be tackled by finance ministers on June 3 include reduced VAT rates for necessities, and minimum excise rates on petrol, tobacco and alcohol.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (7): Still caught in the vice - Foreign debt OF ALL the problems in Africa's post-independence legacy that now have to be resolved, few are more burdensome and debilitating than external debt. In 1962, the outstanding debts of all sub-Saharan African countries were less than Dollars 3bn, with a debt service ratio of less than 2 per cent, says Dr Percy Mistry, a former World Bank economist who has written extensively about African debt. By 1990 debt exceeded Dollars 146bn, equivalent to 110 per cent of GDP; service payments would take up three times its annual export earnings. Dr Mistry traces the build-up over three phases. The rush to borrow, which began with the commodities boom that followed the first oil price increase in 1973, came to a sudden end in the wake of the second oil shock. Between 1978 and 1982, high interest rates and deteriorating terms of trade for Africa meant that sub-Saharan debt soared to Dollars 72bn with a further Dollars 8bn in arrears. The third phase continues: the struggle to manage an ever-increasing debt well beyond Africa's capacity to service, let alone repay. 'Although it seems almost incredible in retrospect,' writes Dr Mistry, 'international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank used little of their influence to curb extravagant and unsustainable programmes of public expenditure financed by external borrowing.' Some of the white elephants from this era are carcasses, others are still on their feet. Grand conference centres, airports, steel mills and hotels dot the African landscape. With better management, some might have been viable; most should not have got beyond the drawing board. The most prominent survivor is Nigeria's Ajaokuta steel mill, conceived in the 1970s. Even with the project cost written off, it will be a net loser of foreign exchange when operating. Yet successive Nigerian governments have refused to write-off a Dollars 5bn project that will be a liability for its lifetime. The institutions remain reluctant to intervene. Nigeria today seeks further rescheduling of its Dollars 34bn debt. But neither the Bank nor the Fund has so far been prepared to add the scrapping of Ajaokuta to the list of conditions for debt relief. The burden extends beyond the Ajaokutas of Africa. The time and energy of finance ministers and senior officials is spent in seemingly endless rounds of external-debt negotiations. Debt initiatives over recent years have had a limited impact. Between 1989 and 1991 some Dollars 10bn of concessional debt was written off, with most donor countries converting concessional bilateral loans to grants, while official creditors have applied enhanced Toronto terms to a dozen low-income countries. The more generous Trinidad terms (which would write off up to two thirds of official debt) have rarely been applied. But the World Bank says a permanent, and workable, solution must go further: 'The enhanced Toronto terms and the Trinidad terms are not enough to ensure that African countries can service external debts in the medium and long term as scheduled. A more radical approach is needed.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa: Facing the competition                                        Sub-Saharan Africa     East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population growth rate 1980-91                    3.1            1.6 GDP growth rate % pa 1980-91                    2.1            7.7 GNP per capita 1991 USDollars                     350            650 GNP per capita growth rate % pa 1980-91        -1.2            6.1 Inflation 1980-91                           18.4% pa          8.3% Investment (% of GDP 1991)                         16             35 Savings (% of GDP 1991)                            14             36 Exports of goods and services (% of GDP 1991)      28             30 Government consumption (% of GDP 1991)             15             10 Share of  Global exports 1991                              1.1            7.5  Global imports                                   1.0            7.6 Annual growth  Rate of exports  1980-91                                          2.7           10.2  Imports                                         -4.0            8.4 Terms of trade: Change 1985-91                 -18.7%          12.5% External debt % of GNP 1991                     107.9           28.2 Debt-Svc ratio 1980                              10.9           13.5                1991                              20.8           13.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % Enrolment primary education  Primary  1970                                              46             88  1990                                              68            127  Secondary  1970                                               6             24  1990                                              17             49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

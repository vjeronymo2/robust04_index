			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Copycat 'Turtles' Look for Trouble: Children enthralled with the Teenage Mutant  Ninja Turtles should be reminded that the swashbuckling exploits of the movie  aren't meant to be played out in the streets, safety experts said.  </P> <P> At the Northampton, Mass., studios where the popular characters were created, a  few calls have been received, mainly dealing with children who apparently went  looking for their heroes in real-life drainage systems, said Cheryl Prindle,  executive director of Mirage Studios. Since the sewer-dwelling comic-book  heroes made a smash screen debut in April, there have been a few reports of  injuries. "Basically, our feeling is that kids need to be able to discern what  is real and what isn't," Prindle said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Lombana, president of the Panamanian </F> National Vote-Counting Board, by Ciro Ortega and Alexandra  Ciniglio at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Ortega] There has been word of a recess; what does  this mean?    [Lombana] Good evening. We had called for a meeting at 2300  today [0400 GMT 9 May], thinking that by then we would have  figures for the first circuit -- namely 8-7 -- per Electoral  Tribunal plans. Apparently there has been some delay in the  electoral district vote count, and it is believed that it will  be 0100 [0600 GMT 9 May] before it is ready. This means the  National Vote-Counting Board has again gone into recess until  that time. Likewise, we have reports that 8-8 and 8-9 will  arrive about one hour after 8-7 is received. In other words, we  have enough work for all the predawn hours.    [Ciniglio] Can you explain the difference between the work  of  the National Vote-Counting Board and the work in the press room  with the unofficial results?    [Lombana] It is important to point out that the unofficial  results released by the Electoral Tribunal, as the word  indicates, are unofficial results. We, at the National  Vote-Counting Board will receive the vote tally sheets covering  the 40 electoral districts, which collect the results of the  5,310 voting tables throughout the country. In the presence of  and together with political party representatives to the  National Vote-Counting Board, we will count and certify that  what the vote tally sheets say agrees with what the voting  tables received.    [Ciniglio] In view of the delay, when do you think the  National Vote-Counting Board will proclaim the next president of  the Republic?    [Lombana] We continue with our plan of four to six days. In  other words, we hope to do our duty by Thursday or Friday.</p>

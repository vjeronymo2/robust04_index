			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Islamic party seeks wide powers in Algeria: Uncertainty over economic policy ALGERIA'S Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which swept the poll in the first round of the country's elections last month, has unveiled a 16-page manifesto which affirms that the party would govern the schools, the army, sexual morality and all facets of Algerian life if it takes over the government, AP-DJ reports from Algiers. 'Islam is the ideological reference point embracing all aspects of life,' the manifesto says. 'We will employ freedom of expression to defend the Islamic identity.' The front promises to extend Islamic law to the schools, family law, associations between men and women, the police force, the army, factories and farms. It calls for reforms of government at all levels. The document says that the party, as government, would 'reinforce the faith in women's morality' - a statement interpreted as meaning that women will be kept largely at home and required to wear modest dress. The FIS also intends to 'combat the depravities of libertines considered by religion and confirmed by science to be at high risk' of Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Relations with the International Monetary Fund and other creditors will be reviewed, and usury forbidden, the manifesto says. Francis Ghiles adds from Algiers: The FIS has never provided a detailed economic policy platform. A considerable uncertainty, therefore, lies over what would happen were the party to form the next government - after the second and final vote on January 16 - to Algeria's economic reforms, launched three years ago to liberalise what for 30 years, had been a tightly-controlled command economy. Islam traditionally favours free trade, but as Mr Abdelhak Benhamouda, the leader of Algeria's main trade union, Union Generale des Travailleurs Algeriens, pointed out recently, Islam has never shown any interest in the problems of industrial production. The FIS has offered unsophisticated reactions to some of the economic problems facing the country. Mr Abdelkader Hachani, its provisional leader, has been dismissive of an Ecu400m (Pounds 283m) European Community loan made three months ago in support of Algeria's economic recovery. The loan was a key gesture of support for Algeria's central bank policy aimed at refinancing the country's Dollars 25bn debt, but Mr Hachani said it was 'made by countries who are enemies of Islam'. Mr Hachani has also denounced the new hydrocarbons law voted by the national assembly last month as a 'transaction of shame'. Yet this policy, which aims to associate foreign oil companies with research and exploration of existing oil wells, could offer Algeria access to much-needed know-how and capital. The FIS leader says he is not against privatisation on 'religious grounds' but adds that he is nevertheless opposed to the privatisation of what he describes as 'publicly-owned strategic industries'. When Mr Abassi Madani, who was one of the two paramount leaders of the FIS until his imprisonment in June, spoke on economic matters, he always did so in a manner reassuring to foreigners. He appeared mindful of the economic realities of Algeria's dependence on western banking and technology. However, many of the present FIS leaders belong to the Djar'ara wing of the party, which believes in an Algerian version of Islamic society and that the country should pull itself out of its current crisis by its own efforts, a nationalistic approach strikingly similar to the populist ideology so long propagated by the ruling National Liberation Front.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Libero Gualtieri, Senate floor leader of the </F> Italian Republican Party, by Marco Marozzi in Cesena; date not  given: "We Will Carry On; La Malfa Must Reconsider" -- first  two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Excerpts] Cesena -- "We are not saying, `we obey.' The  left abandoned by the PRI [Italian Republican Party] is a left  betrayed throughout the country. It is very irresponsible,  serious political error. And we do not accept it."    The senator displayed his old mettle, calm but resolute --  the quality that caused him to be both appreciated and feared  during his long and difficult years as chairman of the  parliamentary violations committee. At his home in Cesena,  Libero Gualtieri, the PRI's senate floor leader, was waiting "to  see what is going on in Rome, what is being decided. Everything  is still in flux," he said, "and I do not want to exacerbate the  situation." However, his ideas are quite clear: "We will  remain within the Democratic Alliance [AD] as a federated force,  with all that this may entail." [passage omitted]    [Marozzi] Does staying in the AD mean taking part in the  progressive alignment's negotiations, discussing policies and  candidates?    [Gualtieri] We are staying in the arena. The majority of the  PRI in Emilia-Romagna are siding with the progressive front. We  do not want to be thrown out; we do not want to split the PRI,  or to leave. But neither do we want to relinquish the policy in  which we believe.    [Marozzi] But [PRI Secretary] La Malfa has threatened  expulsion: "Whoever stands as a candidate with the left, with  the AD, will be out of the party," he said.    [Gualtieri] Whom will they expel? Half the party? Its  command? Visentini, its 14 deputies, and the floor leaders of  the lower house and the Senate, who reject the center? The UIL  [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], the cooperatives of the  Republican area that are remaining within the AD? All this is  important.    [Marozzi] Among the progressive forces, your own candidacy  seemed to be a certainty, one of the few capable of enjoying  everyone's approval. What will you do now? Will you be running  again?    [Gualtieri] I do not know. It depends on how things turn  out. Either there is a policy that can help the country, or....    [Marozzi] Will you remain with the progressive forces, come  what may?    [Gualtieri] Why should someone like me join the center?    [Marozzi] That is what La Malfa wants.    [Gualtieri] We shall see what happens to the entire party  structure. Everything is still in flux. A hard trial of  strength is under way. Certainly, we represent the PRI in  Romagna and Emilia. We command a majority, and are thus able to  decide with whom to align. We are the ones who are taking part  in consultations, who will forge agreements.    [Marozzi] Do you not consider it paradoxical that  Republicans  could be running on opposite lists?    [Gualtieri] It is not we who changed our policy. In any  case, I said long ago that the new electoral system would impose  a substantial regionalization of politics, that the Republicans  would have to come to terms with some very different situations,  that it was impossible to expect consistent conduct between  North and South, or a single system of alliances. Be that as it  may, La Malfa does not seem to me to have realized what has  happened in Italy over the past three or four weeks.    [Marozzi] What?    [Gualtieri] There has been a large-scale restructuring of  the  right, on all sides. The Northern League allying with [Forza  Italia leader] Berlusconi, the Democratic Christian Center, the  MSI [Italian Social Movement] threatening to conquer the south.  One must also consider the Catania provincial elections, not to  mention what is happening in Puglia, Calabria. We are  witnessing a phenomenon that seemed impossible until two months  ago, when a victory by the progressive forces was too  confidently forecast as a certainty. It seems to me a terrible  mistake to abandon the left now, to withdraw a democratic  linchpin such as the PRI.    [Marozzi] What is the danger?    [Gualtieri] Being overwhelmed. Whatever lay behind the  interests defeated by Bribe City is now emerging. The old  system is being reestablished in an even more extreme form. It  is necessary to make a choice, even if it means paying for the  mistakes over the electoral law.    [Marozzi] But to many Republicans it seems unnatural to form  a common front with [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta.    [Gualtieri] True, there is some internal differentiation  within the left. True, we do not agree at all with some  stances. But the elections cannot be won by running outside a  progressive front which nevertheless represents the change in  the left over the years, its essence a part of the country's  heritage. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] is certainly  no longer the PCI [Italian Communist Party], and Ugo La Malfa  always taught us that the PRI represents the other focus of the  left. Certainly not of the center or of the right.</p>

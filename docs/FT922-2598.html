			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Sun Alliance to boost ties with Chinese insurers SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurance company, is to strengthen its ties with the People's Insurance Company of China, as part of efforts to raise its profile in the fast-growing Far East insurance markets. Representatives of the two companies yesterday signed an 'understanding' intended to pave the way for a formal co-operation agreement by October of this year. Mr Tony Barron, director of Sun Alliance (Overseas), said the accord was 'a long-term strategic move'. The group, with an existing Hong Kong subsidiary, eventually hopes to insure business directly in the potentially huge Chinese market. Sun Alliance has provided training facilities for PICC and will provide technical and other support for PICC's operations in China and the UK, where the China Insurance Office provides a service to the Chinese community. Worldwide co-operation is likely to extend to underwriting and specialist services, and the exchange of technical and market information. The British group has marked the Far East, Europe and North America as areas for expansion. In Asia, it has forged links with Lucky Insurance Company in South Korea and Taisho in Japan. In Europe, it has signed an agreement with Helvetia of Switzerland. It also has less formalised links with Vesta group in Norway and Atlantica in Sweden. Reuter reports from Taipei: Taiwan will try to establish air links with 19 countries over the next five years, Mr Eugene Chien, the country's communications minister, said yesterday. 'Our airlines will fly to 45 destinations and more than 40 foreign airlines will fly to our country in five years' time,' Mr Chien told a meeting of senior government officials. At present, Taiwan's three international airlines fly to 26 destinations and 24 foreign airlines have landing rights on the island.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM NATIONS SEEKING UNITY;  </P> <P> TRADE: ECONOMIC COHESIVENESS IS THE GOAL AS 12 NATIONS MEET IN AUSTRALIA. BUT  NO DRAMATIC GAINS ARE EXPECTED.  </P> <P> What Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called "the Pacific century" began  cautiously Sunday when the leaders of 12 Pacific Rim nations opened an economic  cooperation conference that is audacious in concept but modest in expectations.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III led a U.S. delegation that also includes  Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and trade negotiator Carla Anderson  Hills. The conference is the first comprehensive attempt to meld the Pacific  region's disparate and often feuding nations into a cohesive organization.  </P> <P> The nations joining the United States here in the Australian capital include  Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the six members of the  Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.  </P> <P> "Closer, more effective regional cooperation is an idea whose time has come,"  Hawke said. "We are entering or have already entered the Pacific century."  </P> <P> Hawke conceded that the notion has been coming for a long time. Proposals for  Pacific Rim economic blocs have been made at least since the mid-1960s but have  always foundered because, in the final analysis, the nations of the region have  little in common except for their geography.  </P> <P> The plan may fare better this time because the 12 nations are also motivated by  a newly realized need to prevent the region's economic frictions from sapping  its remarkable economic growth.  </P> <P> The United States is applying pressure to Japan and South Korea to open their  markets to more American goods. In Korea, at least, the effort has produced an  upsurge of anti-Americanism. The other 10 countries are concerned about the  domination of the superpowers in Tokyo and Washington. Malaysia is free-trade  oriented, while Singapore is protectionist. The list of potential disputes is  staggering.  </P> <P> But supporters of the conference hope problems that have defied solution in  bilateral terms can be solved in the larger context.  </P> <P> An Australian official said the process will give the other 10 countries  greater leverage in their dealings with the United States and Japan. He said it  could provide "a way of making our interests count."  </P> <P> A senior State Department official said the conference will give the United  States and Japan a way to "communicate a sense of the positive possibilities  for the other nations in the region without posing a threatening role."  </P> <P> However, no one expects the new forum to produce dramatic results. The  conference will reach decisions by consensus, meaning that any one of the  participants can veto any proposed action. For this reason, organizers have  decided not to try to craft a final communique, a process that often results in  lengthy squabbles over wording.  </P> <P> U.S. and Australian officials said that the only concrete decision they expect  is an agreement to hold at least two more similar meetings. Indonesia has  offered to host a meeting in 1990, and South Korea has offered to hold one in  1991.  </P> <P> All 12 nations seem to agree that the meeting, officially called the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, will not evolve into a trading bloc  like the European Community.  </P> <P> "We do not meet here at this time with any hidden agenda to create some form of  Pacific trading bloc," Hawke said. "Our commitment is to open, multilateral  trade. Our united resolve is that the world economy should not fragment into  defensive trading blocs."  </P> <P> Despite their differences, all 12 nations at the conference profess  capitalistic economic systems. U.S. officials like to suggest that the meeting  is also one of political democracies. This is certainly true in many cases, but  Brunei is an absolute monarchy, and some of the other nations practice only  limited democracy.  </P> <P> A U.S. official said the group's "unifying principle is market economics."  </P> <P> Left out of the meeting, at least for the time being, are two of Asia's fastest  growing and dynamic economies, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The two, along with  Singapore and South Korea, make up Asia's so-called Four Tigers -- the newly  industrialized nations that are pushing their way into the first rank of the  world's economic powers.  </P> <P> Organizers of the conference concluded that Taiwan and Hong Kong could not be  included as long as the People's Republic of China was left out. After  Beijing's suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations last June, the inclusion  of China this time was out of the question.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the United States, Japan and Australia all say that eventual  inclusion of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong should be discussed. The issue is made  more complex because both Beijing and Taipei claim to be the capital of China,  while Hong Kong, now a British colony, is scheduled to become part of China in  1997.  </P> <P> Conference sources say that the six ASEAN nations are the most strongly opposed  to including the rival Chinese entities.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Art Pine, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tough haulage rates restrict Seafield Intense competition in its transport division restricted the reduction in pre-tax losses at Seafield, in the first half to June 30. The Dublin-based company said activity had increased in the warehousing and transport division and a careful disposal programme had cut property division borrowings. However, poor economic conditions and competitive haulage rates had restricted the reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.46m (Pounds 1.58m) or 2.2p (2.4p) per share. Turnover rose by 5 per cent from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 11.4m. The property disposal programme had achieved sales of more than Pounds 8m, with further sales expected soon.</p>

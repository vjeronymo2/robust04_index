			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Aleks Adamesku, doctor of economic </F> sciences, and Professor Viktor Kistanov, doctor of economic  sciences, under the rubric "Sick and Tired of Talking and  Arguing": "There Has Got To Be a Better Way: Three Forms of  Economic Operations Are Known in the World Economy--Free Market,  Planned, and Regulated-Market, But We Are Fixated on One"]    [Text] The astonishment of many people at the outcome  of the elections is altogether astounding. It is hard to say  what this is largely due to--naivete or ignorance. It is just  that Russians displayed the wisdom of mature and sober-minded  people. They know that 90 percent of the enterprises that  provide jobs for the people were built during the Soviet years,  and that social benefits that previously did not exist in any  country of the world date back to the same time. All this is now  being destroyed at a rate unheard of in peacetime. The president  himself believes that the patience of the people has to a  considerable degree run out. Therefore, there is no point in  looking for the causes of this distribution of votes in the  "estrangement" of the democrats and so on.    Something else is more important at present: finally  beginning genuine people's reforms. The prerequisites for this  already exist. The first of them is the new constitution, which  proclaims a "social" state, which means a state in the interests  of all the people. The obvious failure of Gaydar's course of  economic transformations is the second prerequisite. After all,  reforms are customarily interpreted as transformations of  aspects of public life without destroying the foundations of the  social structure, and in political and economic practice they  are interpreted as positive restructuring. So, the supreme organ  of representative power should begin to act proceeding from  these goals.    In our opinion it is necessary first of all to throw up  legal  obstacles to all destructive transformations that are not  confirmed by world and domestic experience and are not in line  with the specifics of the Russian state. This should also be  codified in the constitution.    In Russia, important affairs of the state have been  frequently made the domain of a narrow circle of individuals,  and not discussed by the people at all. Meanwhile, according to  the constitution we have people's power in the country! This is  why a mechanism for upholding the guarantees in question is  needed. A preliminary, highly professional public expert review  of major political and economic innovations with the  participation of authoritative scientists and economic managers  could be one of the elements of this mechanism. Upon the  findings of this competent organ, the parliament would adopt a  relevant act that would be referred for endorsement to the  president, and subsequently to the government for execution.  Some decisions may be put to popular referendums.    Therefore, the compulsory monitoring of reforms would  appear,  together with timely adjustments in their course, and strict  accountability, including criminal, would be established for  violating laws concerning reforms. Such violations should be  added to the list of unconstitutional actions. By way of  "insurance," it would be worthwhile to introduce parliamentary  verification of the competency level of all candidates for  supreme state positions, as some Western countries have.    At present, furious attacks are being registered against  state structures and their representatives, scientists, and  practitioners who come out (albeit with a delay) in favor of  making the market purposeful and organized in nature. However,  does the reaction indicated not testify to the obvious  incompetence of the opponents, their lack of a notion of modern  market relations? It has been said time and again that the plan  and the market are not opposites; at present, nobody  successfully operates on the market without a plan. Both the  Japanese automotive plant that produces on its assembly line  dozens of modifications of a car for specific consumer-customers  who are known in advance and the local Fedorov's  Scientific-Technical Complex "Microsurgery of the Eye" with  branches all over the country were created and operate according  to their own plans, while providing incentives to their  employees by market-economy methods. Unlike Russia, almost all  other states of the CIS have preserved planning in the national  economy as a means for organized transition to a market economy.  Those that have energy and raw materials available have secured  particularly weighty results in conducting economic reform by  combining plan and market methods.    Those who complain that free enterprise is undermined when  markets are regulated proceed from technical considerations. In  the environment of the contemporary social division of labor  even within the borders of an isolated country, the number of  production, scientific-technical, financial, and other links  goes into billions and trillions. To advocate such "freedom"  means dooming manufacturers to a pernicious blind cruise in a  boundless sea of market elements. Contrary to their own will,  supporters of this approach come out as adversaries of the  market because they doom it to failure when they call the  champions of the opposing view antimarketers!    Genuine rather than illusory market freedom is found in an  opportunity for each manufacturer to voluntarily select his  effective "niche" on the all-Russian, interstate, and even  regional and local markets within the system of organized  economic space. Without infringing on the freedom of entities in  the marketplace, a market orientation model which takes into  account the feasible sequence of the territorial assignment of a  group of consumers to a group of suppliers is capable of  ensuring not only maximum profits for them but also perceptible  benefits for the entire society, for example, by preventing  nonrational hauling which places a heavy burden on the state  budget.    Understandably, economic space may only be organized at the  all-state level, using principles and methods of rational  planning, the development of indicator charts for production and  sale zoning and normal flows of freight, a system of incentive  and prohibitive transportation tariffs, and so on.    Incidentally, the now common attempts to provide market  information to consumers in the form of all manner of  "registers" of enterprises, etc., are clearly inadequate.  Fundamentally different market data banks are needed that would  be capable of truly assisting in making relations rational as  goods, capital, and labor move freely. We must say that the best  conditions for the organization of highly efficient economies  have emerged precisely in the states of the former USSR,  primarily in Russia. This is possible through combining the  methods of purposeful, planned economic operations (national  economic plans--projections, programs, projects) with a  mechanism of market-based incentives (prices, taxes, credit, and  so on) while drawing on our domestic planning experience and the  world practice of an organized market economy.    The natural, geographic, historical, and other specifics of  the country influence socioeconomic development substantially,  and it is impossible not to reckon with them. The authors of the  well-known "Economics" textbook, K. McConnell and S. Brew, were  among the many prominent authorities who warned about this. On  the basis of generalizing the experience of the world, they  maintained: "The best way of resolving the `unlimited  needs-scarce resources' dilemma in one economic system may turn  out to be unsuitable in another." This is why it is simply  inexpert to blindly borrow the Western monetarist reform  scenario without taking into account other foreign experience  (for example, the Chinese) and, most importantly, Russian  specifics. Does the following question not provide food for  thought: Why do influential circles of the United States and  Germany approve a market-based model in Russia that is  completely different from the one used in their countries to  overcome grave crises?    In conjunction with this we must acknowledge that the term  "market economy" (like "mixed economy," "economic democracy,"  and so on) does not reflect the essence of the phenomenon quite  correctly. First, in its contemporary interpretation this  phenomenon is not reduced to the processes of distribution but  deeply affects the sphere of material production acting as a  universal method for its effective development. Second, elements  of a market exist in any economy; we also had them under  directive planning. Third, as has already been noted, the normal  market has long been identical with the organized rather than  free market, and calls for extensive state regulation;  therefore, this condition of the economy cannot be considered  market-based.    Three common forms of rational economic operations are known  in the world economy--free market, planned, and  regulated-market. Each of them emerges, develops, and is  progressive at certain historical stages. It is no accident that  our methods of planned development once showed advantages over  foreign market-based methods, in particular in the rates of  economic growth, the resolution of social issues, and so on, and  were extensively borrowed abroad. Against the background of the  failure of the current "reform" course, attempts to ignore and  even reject our former accomplishments are no accident. This was  manifested even in the replacement of the symbols and power  structures of the strong but Soviet state with those of a weak  but prerevolutionary one.    One would think that the specifics of the historical  development of Russia would make it possible to assert in our  country not just a regulated market economy but a higher stage  of it--a planned market economy. This should be a synthesis of  indicator planning, economic optimization programming, and a  mechanism of market-based self-regulation in the economy. The  fine-tuning of this model holds the promise of a tremendous,  previously unparalleled effect. This is why a well-thought-out  scientific concept of economic reforms is necessary.</p>

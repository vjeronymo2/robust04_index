			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU SENIORS GO OUT IN STYLE  </P> <P> A half hour after the U.S. International University men's basketball team had  played one of its finest games of the season in defeating visiting Akron,  90-77, Saturday night, a handful of stragglers and kids participating in an  impromptu game on the floor at Golden Hall remained.  </P> <P> And Steve Smith.  </P> <P> As the rest of the USIU team was heading home, contemplating their season or  careers, Smith remained on the floor, taking his last post-game hugs as a Gull.  </P> <P> "I didn't think this day was going to come," said Smith, who played in a  school-record 108 games in four years at USIU. "Not so soon."  </P> <P> But the day came for Smith and also Demetrius Laffitte and Paul Wilson, who  both started the past two years after transferring from community colleges.  </P> <P> And as far as farewell addresses go, the trio couldn't have asked for much  more.  </P> <P> USIU, a team that had struggled more often than not this season, was facing an  Akron team (16-12) that had the second-best record of NCAA Division I  independents and had defeated the Gulls, 92-80, in Akron, Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Feeling excited from the prolonged introductions on their final night of  collegiate basketball, the Gulls ran out to a 9-2 lead. And the fact that USIU  started with a driving layup by Smith, a defensive rebound by Laffitte and a  10-foot jumper by Wilson -- the three departing seniors -- seemed appropriate.  </P> <P> But the Zips scored the next 11 points and 13 of 15 to take a 15-11 lead. From  that point, no team led by more than five points and USIU was ahead, 44-43, at  halftime thanks to two baskets in the final minute by Kevin Bradshaw, who  finished with 30 points.  </P> <P> The Gulls went on another run to start the second half and this time Akron had  no answer. USIU outscored the Zips, 19-5, after Akron scored a basket to open  the half. The run gave the Gulls a 63-50 lead and the closest Akron could get  was, 76-68, with 4:46 remaining.  </P> <P> The victory gave USIU a 12-16 record, the most victories in the five years  Coach Gary Zarecky has been coach and the most since the Gulls went 13-12 in  1980-81 -- there only winning season as an NCAA Division I member.  </P> <P> Laffitte finished the game with 24 points and 11 rebounds to conclude his  career averaging double figures in scoring and rebounding. Wilson had 12 points  and Smith added 13 points and 12 assists for USIU.  </P> <P> While Zarecky was handing out the customary compliments to his seniors, Smith  was surrounded by family and friends who had watched him play since his days at  Serra High School.  </P> <P> "Monday, I'll be thinking 'I've got practice at 1 p.m.,' " Smith said. "But I  don't.  </P> <P> "I'll probably go over to a friend's house tonight. Try to put my mind off this  game. My last game."  </P></p>

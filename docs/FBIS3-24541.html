Chernykh, </F> Russian State Medical University, Moscow; UDC  612.826.4.018.014.2:612.6.02]    [Abstract] In studying the survival capabilities of  xenotransplantates of embryonal neurosecretory nuclei of the  human hypothalamus in the rat brain and the morphogenesis of  neurosecretory cells, the researchers here transplanted the  nuclei into 30 mature female white rats. The transplants  survived in 11 rats (36.7 percent) as clusters of neural and  glial cells. [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine was incorporated into the  neurosecretory cells to varying degrees. The most active  proliferation of neuroblasts was found in rats injected with the [.sup]3  [/]  H- thymidine four weeks or eight weeks after the  transplantation. Rats injected 16 weeks after transplantation  demonstrated a considerably lower level of proliferation.  Average volume of nuclei and nucleoli grew with time. The degree  of differentiation of large-cell supraoptic and paraventricular  neurons in the transplanted tissue varied as it would in normal  ontogenesis.

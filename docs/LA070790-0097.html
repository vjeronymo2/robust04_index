			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE;  </P> <P> LAW: EMPLOYEES MUST CALL IN EVIDENCE OR RELIABLE REPORTS OF NEGLECT OR ABUSE  IMMEDIATELY. L.A. DISTRICT ALSO HAS ITS OWN SYSTEM FOR CONFORMING TO LAW.  </P> <P> Procedures for school officials to report cases of suspected child abuse by  anyone are spelled out in state law.  </P> <P> In addition, the Los Angeles Unified School District has its own system for  ensuring that all its employees are familiar with the law and know what their  responsibilities are.  </P> <P> School employees must report evidence or reliable reports of neglect or of  physical, sexual or emotional abuse immediately by telephone to a child  protective agency. In Los Angeles, that is local police, the Sheriff's  Department or the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. The  telephoned information must be followed up within 36 hours by a written report  on a state-supplied form.  </P> <P> Once a case is reported, district officials said, they generally take their cue  from the investigating agency on how to proceed or what the school's further  role should be.  </P> <P> Those who fail to follow the proper procedures are subject to criminal  prosecution. All new district employees are required to sign a statement that  they are familiar with the reporting law and that they will report suspected  cases as required.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, the Los Angeles district developed its reporting policy  with the assistance of a project known as CARE -- Child Abuse: Recognize and  Eliminate.  </P> <P> The CARE program, headed by former teacher Shayla Lever, provides intensive  training for teachers, other staff members and parents in 152 of the district's  elementary schools.  </P> <P> Lever said one of the most difficult aspects of child abuse is getting people  to recognize what is and is not abuse, along with the need to be specific.  </P> <P> For example, it is not against the law for a parent to spank a child; however,  any injury that resulted from the spanking would be considered child abuse and  must be reported. Vague statements cannot be reported, she said. If someone  accused a teacher of touching a student in a way that was "inappropriate," it  would be up to the principal, for instance, to determine just what was touched  and how before deciding whether the incident should be reported.  </P> <P> Lever said the district's policy was already in place when teacher Terry  Bartholome was accused in 1984 of molesting several of his third-grade students  at 68th Street Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles. Bartholome was  later convicted and sentenced to 44 years in state prison.  </P> <P> She noted that a district administrator was convicted of a misdemeanor for not  properly reporting the students' allegations against Bartholome. The  administrator's conviction was overturned on appeal.  </P></p>

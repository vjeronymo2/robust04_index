			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Guild mentality of doctors and cabbies Sir, I would like to congratulate Dominic Lawson on his piece highlighting the 'guild mentality' of the medical profession ('Doctors: a life-threatening problem', May 1.) I cannot help feeling, however, that he is fighting a lost cause. Everyone needs to consult a doctor at some point and this inhibits politicians from taking a radical decision. The doctors defeated the government in 1948 and have continued to do so, in one way or another, since then. More immediately it will be interesting to see whether the government will be able to modify the regulations requiring mini-cabs to be registered. Like the doctors, the black cab mafia are using their monopoly position to prevent anything that vaguely threatens them. After all, virtually every member of parliament uses taxis] Bernard Heymann, London EC1R 0HH</p>

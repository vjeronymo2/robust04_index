			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY AWAITS A REBIRTH OF HOPE  </P> <P> Ricky Reed turned 5 on Tuesday. But how many more birthdays he'll live to  celebrate may depend on whether he can receive a lifesaving bone marrow  transplant from a brother or sister who is due to be born in five days.  </P> <P> Ricky has suffered from leukemia since he was 22 months old, and his parents,  with the help of the National Marrow Donor Program, have searched the United  States and Europe for a donor of bone marrow -- the thick, almost granular  substance within bone structure that manufactures the blood's red and white  cells.  </P> <P> In Ricky's case, it's the stuff that could save his life by providing him with  the raw material necessary to replenish his body with healthy white blood  cells. But no donors have been found yet who match Ricky's exact blood and  antigen types. Now his best bet for the future may rest with an unborn sibling  whose due date is Monday.  </P> <P> While the chances of finding compatible bone marrow donors among unrelated  people is 1 in 20,000 -- and the reality can be 1 in a million -- the chance of  a match between siblings is 1 in 4.  </P> <P> But little Ricky isn't watching the odds.  </P> <P> "He's more excited about having a baby sister than the fact that the baby may  save his life," Theresa Reed said Tuesday while her kindergartner son  celebrated his birthday with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle swords, pajamas and  posters.  </P> <P> She and her husband, Richard -- a Navy hospital corpsman -- live on the  northern fringe of Camp Pendleton, near San Clemente.  </P> <P> "Ricky's living as normal a life as possible. He doesn't think about it (the  leukemia) all the time, but he does know that he can die from it," she said.  </P> <P> The Reeds thought they were getting close to finding a compatible donor when  the national registry found five people in the United States -- and two more in  Europe -- who showed on the first screening that they might match. But further  testing eliminated them.  </P> <P> The couple's other child, 2 1/2-year-old Ruben, didn't match, either.  </P> <P> So, for years, Ricky has received a steady regimen of chemotherapy and  radiation treatment as he roller-coasters between remissions and relapses. Now  the leukemia has infected his spinal fluid and entered his brain, and the  youngster undergoes regular spinal taps to relieve the pressure in his head.  </P> <P> "He knows something's up when the headaches won't go away. He knows he's got  cancer, but he doesn't understand why, or why him, or the depth of it," his  mother said. "He's constantly asking questions, and constantly learning.  </P> <P> "We're not hiding anything from him. It's not fair for a child to go through so  much pain without knowing what he's got. We don't want him to be scared, but we  talk to him about what he has, and that it can be fatal, and we talk about God,  and how we accept the fact that there's nothing we can do but be there for him  and support him."  </P> <P> But a wellspring of hope erupted nine months ago -- coincidentally, at a low  point in the family's life, when Ricky was being treated for another infection  that required he be taken off chemotherapy. With the lapse of that medication,  his bone marrow cancer flared up, sending the family into depression.  </P> <P> At the same time, though, the Reeds learned Theresa was pregnant with her third  child.  </P> <P> "It was like a miracle," she said. "It's the best we can hope for. We know the  baby may not match Ricky -- we've been let down before -- and we won't let our  hopes go real high. But still. . . . "  </P> <P> The baby will be delivered at the Navy Hospital at Camp Pendleton, and the  newborn will be typed for its human leukocyte antigens -- the six particular  components of blood that should match identically with the would-be recipient.  </P> <P> There are 210,000 potential donors registered with the National Marrow Donor  Program -- a number that virtually doubled in the past six months with  increased awareness. But the critical antigens are somewhat linked to race and  ethnicity, and only about 1.5% of the donors are Latino, like Ricky.  </P> <P> That's why all the attention is focused, for now, on the new baby.  </P> <P> If the siblings prove compatible, doctors will wait as long as necessary --  weeks, or maybe months-for Ricky's leukemia to again go into remission. Then he  and his new brother or sister will be flown to Seattle's acclaimed Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the largest bone marrow transplant unit in  the world, for the procedure.  </P> <P> While chemotherapy and radiation remain the primary treatments for leukemia,  bone marrow transplants have grown in popularity in recent years -- thanks  largely to the growth of the donor list.  </P> <P> The use of children -- even babies -- as donors is increasing as well.  </P> <P> "The youngest donor I'm aware of was a 6-week-old baby, and the marrow  transplantation was successful," said Dr. Carl Lenarsky, medical director for  the transplantation program at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Personally, I've done transplantations involving a baby 5 or 6 months old, and  that was successful, too," he said. "It's technically feasible, and can be  done."  </P> <P> Given the time it will take for Ricky to re-enter remission, and for the  newborn to be tested, the baby will likely be at least 6 weeks old before the  transplant is done -- assuming the two children match -- he said.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Kadota, director of bone marrow transplantations at Children's  Hospital of San Diego, said doctors prefer to wait until a baby is 6 months  old, if not a year, before undertaking the procedure. "But you don't always  have the luxury of waiting that long," he said.  </P> <P> In such procedures, the donor is put under a general anesthetic, and a needle  is inserted into the center of the hip -- the body's largest bone. A tablespoon  of marrow is withdrawn for every kilogram of the recipient's body weight, then  introduced into the recipient's body by a catheter that leads directly to the  heart, where it then is carried to the bones and settles.  </P> <P> The greatest risk to the recipient during the recovery time is infection; for  the donor, it is the anesthesia itself.  </P> <P> Some medical ethicists question the use of babies as donors of bone marrow.  </P> <P> "The first issue is, is it right to impose risk on a child in order, solely, to  benefit another person?" said Art Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical  Ethics at the University of Minnesota, who specializes in the ethics of  transplantation.  </P> <P> "The second issue is, who can give consent for the baby, since normally we  presume parents can, but in these kinds of situations -- donations between  siblings -- there may be a conflict of interest. Should there be a third party  -- an ethics committee, a guardian, a court or an advocate for the newborn  child?" he said.  </P> <P> Psychologically, he said, the parents have to be braced for the possibility  that the newborn child's bone marrow won't match the older child's -- and  consider the baby a disappointment.  </P> <P> "The hidden issue is the strain on the parents who have a child who is dying,  and are filled with joy because of the birth of a new child. That's an  incredible burden," Caplan said.  </P> <P> Lenarsky agreed that ethicists have debated turning to babies as donors of bone  marrow -- but says he endorses the practice.  </P> <P> "The chance of doing overwhelming good outweighs the very slight risk to the  baby," he said. "And in situations like this, reasonable people believe a child  would give his consent, if he could."  </P> <P> Ricky Reed, meanwhile, is focusing on other matters. "I got a Ninja Turtle  poster for my birthday!" he blurted. "And I've got a girlfriend."  </P> <P> People interested in donating marrow can call the San Diego Blood Bank at  296-6393 or the National Marrow Donor Program at 1-800-654-1247.  </P></p>

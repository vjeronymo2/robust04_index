Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] claimed responsibility  for the murder.    Anatoliy Kalsanikov, a guard at a building site in Ashdod's  Rova' Tet neighborhood, was found by a night watchman who had  come to replace him. Kalsanikov had suffered deep stab wounds  in the neck and chest. [passage omitted]</p>

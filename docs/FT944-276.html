			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / CIA chief who quit the troubled world of spying Mr Jim Woolsey, who resigned late on Wednesday as CIA director, has personal qualities that do not quite fit with the conventional image of espionage shaped by real spies. He is gregarious, fond of sailing and singing, and quite willing to talk about his trade. Indeed, these days old spies tend to talk a lot. Earlier this week Mr Aldrich Ames, the unearthed Soviet 'mole' who was the heaviest cross Mr Woolsey had to bear, went on television to discuss his treachery quite freely. Earlier this month, a whole gaggle of past and present spies and scholars convened at Harvard for a public forum which saw one former director, Mr Stansfield Turner, confess that intelligence estimates of the Soviet threat he provided to President Jimmy Carter 'were not much help'. Even the cost of intelligence is no longer the closed book it was. In November, a congressional sub-committee inadvertently released details of the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 17.9bn) national intelligence budget, of which the CIA's particular slice was disclosed at Dollars 3.1bn, half as much again as the State Department's (military intelligence, much of which is electronic and to which the CIA has access, accounted for Dollars 23.6bn). Not since the 1970s, when past CIA activities from Cuba to the Congo were made public, has the agency been so much in the spotlight and subject to so much analysis and criticism. This year Congress got into the act by setting up a bipartisan commission under Mr Les Aspin, President Bill Clinton's first defence secretary, and Mr Warren Rudman, the Republican ex-senator from New Hampshire, to define new missions and purpose for America's spies. From all this comment, much pre-dating examination of the political entrails surrounding Mr Woolsey's resignation, a composite picture of a troubled CIA emerges. Salient points include: An 'old boy' culture protective of its own. This was most evident in the failure to detect Mr Ames's activities in the face of what now looks like overwhelming evidence, such as a personal lifestyle out of kilter with his modest salary. Yet Mr Woolsey, in the hope that miscreants could be reformed, gave them the disciplinary equivalent of a wrist-slap. A sexual harassment suit brought by a highly regarded woman case officer denied promotion was so strong that the agency settled out of court. Deep divisions between the new breed of intelligence analysts and the old operational cold war warriors, described at Harvard by Mr McGeorge Bundy of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as 'hard-boiled, activist, give-us-the-job, anti-Communists'. It was the latter school who went to great lengths to besmirch the reputation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, thus immensely complicating administration efforts to restore him to power, and who continued to produce reports on leftwing dissidents around the world or Russian crop estimates, often duplicating the work of the media and academia. No real consensus on a post-cold war mission in the face of proliferating demands for intelligence both because of old targets (Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang) and new ones dotted around the world (Algeria being merely the latest). Mr Woolsey's supporters argue that he had quietly done much to rationalise electronic surveillance, including a controversial extension into commercial intelligence-gathering, and had improved the quality of CIA analysis. But this never satisfied his congressional critics, especially when he sought exemption from budget cuts or tried to explain why he had not hung up by the thumbs those implicated in the Ames affair. All this is a far cry from the last heyday of espionage under President Ronald Reagan when Mr William Casey more or less did with his CIA what he liked and if blocked, as over the Iran-Contra scandal, found other ways of doing it, like recruiting Colonel Oliver North. But Mr Casey never felt accountable to anyone, even, it seemed, his president. This is not the fortune of today's CIA.</p>

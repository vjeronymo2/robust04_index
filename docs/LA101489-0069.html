His last Mass was attended by 100,000 people in northern  Sumatra. In a speech to the country's 42 bishops later in Jakarta, the pontiff  acknowledged "occasional difficulties" facing his 5 million-member flock but  reminded them that religious freedom is protected by Indonesia's constitution.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Ciampi ready to stay on as PM Italy's prime minister Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi indicated yesterday he would like to stay in office, despite today's parliamentary no-confidence vote which could determine the fate of his fragile eight-month government, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. At the Nato summit in Brussels, Mr Ciampi underlined his commitment to remain at a time of great change for Italy. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected to dissolve parliament and announce the date of new elections shortly. Mr Ciampi is likely to remain in office as caretaker premier, however the vote turns out.</p>

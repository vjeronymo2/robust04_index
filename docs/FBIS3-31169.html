He said he could not imagine on what basis a coalition could  function if the governing parties preserve their current policy.  "I cannot imagine how members of the current cabinet such as  Roman Hofbauer, Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes would sit in the  government along with SDL Deputies Milan Ftacnik, Robert Fic and  Ludomir Fogas" Weiss said.    He pointed to a scenario drafted by the HZDS which seeks to  again win a majority in parliament through calling a referendum.  These efforts are aimed at installing either a presidential  regime or a chancellor system, Weiss said.    He voiced the view that the latest parliamentary crisis when  HZDS deputies and part of SNS deputies purposefully postponed  parliamentary discussion on the law on large privatisation  "questioned parliament as institution". Government coalition  deputies made their further presence at the parliamentary  session conditional on the ruling of the Constitutional Court on  the dispute whether or not deputies can deprive (in a vote) the  chairman of parliament of the right to chair a parliamentary  meeting.    Weiss described as politically expedient statements Slovak  Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar's offer -- reiterated  publicly -- that the SDL form an open coalition with the current  government coalition parties. Weiss said this offer lacked the  support of the decisive HZDS and SNS bodies.</p>

In his address, he commented on the  Security Council's last resolution on the situation in Abkhazia,  in which, the head of state stressed, "the stance of the  Republic of Georgia" is confirmed. The head of state said that  the resolution of the Security Council was a balanced document  in which the legal status of Abkhazia was defined clearly within  the framework of single, indivisible Georgia. It allows the  hope that the question will be resolved by exclusively political  means.    The head of the Georgian state especially singled out the  formulation of the Security Council's resolution concerning the  refugees who, according to Paragraph 3 of the resolution, must,  without any limits, return to their homes in all rayons of  Abkhazia.    Shevardnadze once again confirmed the readiness of the  Georgian side to negotiate with the representatives of Abkhazia,  despite the resumption of war by the separatists in the Kodori  gorge.    The chairman of the republic's parliament announced with  responsibility, before parliament and the state, that Georgia  had not initiated the current escalation of tension in the  Abkhazian Svaneti and the rayons adjacent to the Inguri River  and that Georgia would not betray its course of "peaceful and  political settlement of the conflict, about which the United  Nations, the Security Council, and Russia must be informed".</p>

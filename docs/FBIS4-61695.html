			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Nikolayevich Klyuchnikov, chairman </F> of the Executive Committee of the People's Party of the Crimea,  by V. Korolkov; place and date not given: "From Opposition to  Fruitful Work"]    [Text] [Korolkov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, during  consultative meetings with deputies from the "Russia" bloc, you  were considered to be a real candidate for the post of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. By the way, your name was  repeated both by independent deputies and deputies from working  collectives and political parties. What is your opinion on this  issue?    [Klyuchnikov] Along with my candidacy, some other candidates  were also discussed. In my opinion, this issue will be  regulated by the beginning of the first session. I do not fear  the thought that a number of candidates for this post could be  fielded. The key issue is that the majority of deputies from  the "Russia" bloc, other parties and national groups understand  that a Supreme Soviet chairman should organize the work of the  legislature basing not on the differences and confrontation but  on consolidation of all sane forces for the sake of normal  legislative work which is required for the implementation of  reforms and realization of the election promises by Crimean  President Yu. Meshkov.    [Korolkov] You were one of the organizers of the Republican  Movement of the Crimea [RDK] in August 1991. You put a lot of  energy into the organization of this movement, headed the RDK  Executive Council which has been the most popular opposition  force in the Crimea recently. The RDK's ideas, along with the  "Russia" bloc program, won. What are your next steps?    [Klyuchnikov] It is necessary to popularize the RDK's ideas  otherwise the Crimean residents will stop supporting us. It  will be difficult to do this because we were in opposition for  more than three years while currently we have to change our  methods and begin working constructively and creatively. It  will not be easy for many former oppositionists, and -- God save  them! -- I wish their process of transformation be painless. If  they do not manage to change, I suspect that, in spite of  performing normal legislative work, they will occupy positions  of dissatisfied deputies or critics because this is easier and  less responsible. I wish that the "Russia" bloc, its followers,  and those who support our principles of legislative work, will  form the basis for performing sane and constructive work in the  newly elected Crimean Supreme Soviet.    [Korolkov] It means that the RDK's ideas are included in the  "Russia" bloc program....    [Klyuchnikov] The election platform and "Russia" bloc  program  are wider than the RDK's ideas notably, that over the last three  years, specific political changes took place. Nevertheless, we  will not reject the key ideas of the RDK and will look for  chances to realize them within the "Russia" bloc program  supported by the majority of the Crimean voters during the  presidential and Supreme Soviet campaigns.    [Korolkov] What are the key political aims of the "Russia"  bloc deputies' faction in the Crimean Supreme Soviet?    [Klyuchnikov] There is no "Russia" bloc deputies' faction  yet  but it is being formed and its aims are detailed by the election  program. This is a further development and establishment of the  Crimean statehood. For us, the future of the Crimea can be only  with union with Russia and other CIS states. We will draft and  adopt our own laws on citizenship, local administration,  detailed separation of legislative, executive, and judicial  powers, and deputy and state employees' status. The law on  recall of deputies, which broadens the rights of the Crimean  electorate, should be adopted by all means. The law on the  Crimean constitutional court should become a guarantor of all  Crimean laws and the Crimean constitution.    [Korolkov] However, you will not achieve any of your  policies  if economic issues are not resolved. What should the Crimean  legislature do in this respect?    [Klyuchnikov] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's edicts laid  the basis for resolving the Crimean issues. They should be  reinforced by corresponding laws. It is very difficult to raise  the standard of living through the acting budget and taxation  system, for which Kiev rather than the Crimea should be blamed.  In my opinion, the law on the Crimean Republican bank, which  will be authorized to register subsidiaries of foreign banks,  first of all, Russian ones, should become one of our first laws.  To reconstruct resorts and other production sectors, we should  seek to attract large investments to the Crimea on a legal  footing and establish a system of legal benefits for investors.  When adopting economic laws, we should first of all consider  the interests of the Crimean producers. To do this, we should  draft and adopt the law on protection of rights of Crimean  producers. I admit that the work on drafting laws regarding  privatization and implementation of reforms in the agrarian  sector will be very difficult. Nevertheless, we hope to avoid  mistakes which had been made in other CIS states, and,  considering our experts's experience, we will draft laws  appropriate to the specific economy of the Crimea and its  population.    [Korolkov] What is your vision of the future foreign policy  of the Crimea?    [Klyuchnikov] We will support Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov's signing of treaties with Russia and Ukraine. Our main  goal is the resolving of the dire domestic problems --  primarily, economic ones -- of the Crimea at the expense of its  foreign policy. In particular, this concerns the program  regarding the return of the deported peoples. Crimean foreign  policy should bolster the resolving of the issues regarding the  Black Sea Fleet, stationing of military units, environmental  protection, in a word, all the issues which the Crimea cannot  resolve independently. We hope that Russia will assist us in  our foreign policy.    [Korolkov] Your friends from the Union of Afghan War  Veterans  say that you begin your work at six in the morning and finish at  10 in the evening. Is it really so?    [Klyuchnikov] I have such days, especially, of late. The  work  in the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers, the People's Party of the  Crimea, which, along with the RDK, to set up the election bloc  "Russia." [as published] But I have no right to forget the  problems of Afghan war veterans. The state promised to resolve  these problems but forgot about its promises. We have to earn  the money to help our Afghan war veterans, the families of those  who perished, and socially protect them.    [Korolkov] My last question is of a personal character: Have  you time for your family?    [Klyuchnikov] Of course. I have two children, two growing up  as Crimean residents, and I never forget about them. I wish  they can grow and live in the happy land of the Crimea in peace  and friendship with all peoples who live on our land of plenty  and be happier than we are. I am an optimist even though I had  to overcome many hardships but I believe in the future and fight  for it.</p>

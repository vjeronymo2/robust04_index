In the Notice, we indicated that we might use spectrum set-asides for designated entities in the broadband PCS service but did not expressly propose to use bidding credits. For two other services, IVDS and narrowband PCS, however, we did conclude recently that the use of bidding credits in auctions would be an effective tool to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate in the provision of those services. <FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>  On further reflection, and based on the many comments in the record favoring this approach, we believe that bidding credits are necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses and small businesses participate in broadband PCS. Accordingly, we adopt a bidding credit plan for winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks that gives small businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 105 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Third Report and Order, FCC 94&hyph;98, 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994; Fourth Report and Order, 9 FCC Rcd 2330, 59 FR 24947, May 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 131. At the outset, we note that we are confining the bidding credit option to the entrepreneurs' blocks because, given the extremely capital intensive nature of broadband PCS, we do not think bidding credits in an uninsulated block would have a meaningful effect. <FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>  Indeed, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for broadband PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who are likely to bid for licenses in this service. DCR Communications states, for example, that all of the existing large telecommunications carriers can justify must larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur, regardless of a bidder's credit. Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable to any of the large companies. <FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>  Many other commenters echo this concern. <FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>  Some state that, if bidding credits alone are used, extraordinarily large credits, even on the order of 50 percent or more, would be ineffective. <FOOTCITE>109</FOOTCITE>  As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the broadband PCS service, we have taken measures to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the C and F blocks. These measures will enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits will have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in these blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 106 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We also are concerned that allowing bidding credits in the MTA blocks would increase substantially the incentive for businesses to engage in shams and fronts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 107 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  filing of DCR, May 31, 1994, at 4&hyph;5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 108 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  filings of DigiVox Corporation, May 31, 1994, at 3 (the use of bidding credits to the exclusion of frequency set-asides will not fulfill the objectives of Section 309(j)), Communications International Wireless Corp., May 27, 1994, at 1 (bidding credits alone cannot level the playing field between designated entities and members of the Fortune 100 companies), CWCC, May 27, 1994, at 2 (bidding credits alone cannot level the playing field for designated entities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 109 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  filings of AWCC, May 26, 1994 at 2, Columbia PCS, June 2, 1994 at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 132. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make special provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in broadband PCS. <FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>  In effect, the bidding credit will function as a discount on the bid price a firm will actually have to pay to obtain a license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased capital formation difficulties, we will provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than that granted to small businesses. Thus, women and minorities will receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts they bid on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it would be virtually impossible to assure that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision of broadband PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems endemic to both groups and that a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent is therefore appropriate. We believe that these measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing and operating a broadband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 110 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although we did not grant bidding credits to small businesses in the narrowband PCS or IVDS services, we believe that, given the exponentially greater expense likely to be incurred in acquiring broadband PCS licenses and construct the systems, bidding credits are a proper means to ensure that these firms have the opportunity to participate in this service. We note that for narrowband PCS and IVDS, the cost of license acquisition and implementation of service is anticipated to be considerably more modest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

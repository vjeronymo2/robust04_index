			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: FT-Actuaries World Index At its last quarterly meeting, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee decided that Thailand and Brazil should be added to the World Indices with effect from October 1 1994, subject to satisfactory resolution of several outstanding technical issues. Users of the World Indices are invited to contact the compilers (below) detailing any factors they would wish to be considered before the calculation of these new country indices. Other stock markets that may comply fully with the Construction and Maintenance Rules of the World Index will be added as fast as practicable. The Committee does not intend to change its policy regarding the inclusion of 'emerging' markets in the daily calculation of the World Index for the time being, since it does not wish to introduce a second, less demanding set of rules for countries which cannot meet current World Index criteria. In response to recent changes in investment patterns, publication in the FT of the World Ex-South Africa index will cease at the same time that Brazil and Thailand are added to FT-AWI. In addition, the North America index will be renamed Americas and will consist of the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The Mexico index will then be based on the most up-to-date prices, rather than on prices taken one day in arrears as is currently the case. A clarification of the wording of the guidelines falling within Section II of the Construction and Maintenance Rules has been proposed by the Committee with effect from October 1 1994, subject to confirmation at the next meeting: 'When a government is a holder of shares but either the shares are not listed or the government is constrained through requiring legislation before being able to sell them then a weighting factor will be applied.' Changes to the Construction and Maintenance Rules are announced after the quarterly meeting at which they are agreed, but will not be put into effect until after they have been confirmed at the following quarterly meeting, in order to allow for comment. There are no quarterly changes to current FT-AWI constituents. A list of constituent changes to the FT-AWI Large Cap and FT-AWI Medium-Small Cap Indices as a result of the half-yearly rebalance will be available from NatWest Securities Limited and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co on July 5 1994. The changes will be effective July 15 1994. The FT-Actuaries World Indices are jointly compiled by The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited in conjunction with the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. All enquiries should be made to Symon Bradford, NatWest Securities Limited, on 031-243-4258 or to Barbara Mueller, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, on 0101-212-902-6777.</p>

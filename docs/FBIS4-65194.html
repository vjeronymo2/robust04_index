			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On the telephone we have Federal  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Good morning.    [Kinkel] Good morning.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, to begin with, a topical  development. Yesterday evening the German ambassador in London,  Hartmann, was summoned by Agriculture Minister Shephard, who  evidently protested at the possible plans of the Federal  Government to act unilaterally on the question of BSE [Bovine  Spongiform Encephalitis -- Mad Cow Disease] and possibly  introduce import restrictions on British beef. This is not an  entirely normal event. What is your assessment of it?    [Kinkel] Well, to begin with, this is a subject that  particularly interests us, and we have of course said that if no  agreed policy can be found in Europe, we must in certain  circumstances reserve the right to our own course of action. And  I am assuming that that remains the position. I must now -- I  have heard about the summoning -- but my position is that I must  first know precisely what the subject of the discussion was and  then we will deal with it.    [Correspondent] Do you see in this development a strain on  German-British relations in view of the fact that British  Agriculture Minister Shephard threatened -- to give one  quotation -- very serious consequences?    [Kinkel] No, I do not see any strain. We should not  immediately put such things in the category of strained  relations. It is in a lower category, let us wait and see. It  is an important subject; we shall discuss it and settle it  calmly and quietly.    [Correspondent] Minister, you will soon be beginning a  meeting at the Petersberg in Bonn with Russian President Yeltsin  on the third day of his German visit. What is on your agenda  today?    [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] Of course, the visit and the  talks  have shown we have deepened and strengthened our relations of  friendship and partnership with our great neighbor. We are both  economically and politically very important partners for each  other; (?a factor there) is the personal chemistry between the  chancellor and the president. [passage omitted] We are  supporting Russia, particularly in its admission to the Council  of Europe and the G-7 problems. Russia is naturally also  placing its hopes especially on our support for a cooperation  agreement with the European Union [EU] when we take over the  presidency of the council on 1 July.    But we have also achieved a number of particular results. It  is now clear how the dignified withdrawal of the Russian troops  will take place here. Above all, we have been preparing the  meeting today in Geneva of the five on the Yugoslav question,  and we have, of course, also discussed intensively -- which is  of great importance to the Russian side and to us -- the  Partnership for Peace, the problem of creating a new security  architecture for Europe.    [Correspondent] What would you say is the most important  result of this Yeltsin visit?    [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] I am, of course, also pleased  that  we have been able to have intensive discussions about the NATO  problem and the Partnership for Peace, since that, I believe  [word indistinct] is the crucial subject for the Russian side  and is of course of very considerable importance to us too.    [Correspondent] Some of the press comment today expresses  regret that the Yeltsin visit has basically produced few  concrete results. [passage omitted]    [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] The criticism that we have  achieved few concrete results is mistaken. [passage omitted] We  have also, for example, discussed other subjects that on their  face are not so crucial but are still very important. For  instance, we were able to explain the enlargement of the EU to  take in the Central and East European countries, decided last  Monday [9 May] in Luxembourg, which is also important for the  Russian side. We have talked intensively about relations with  the Baltic states. It is now clear that Mr. Kozyrev will come  to the forthcoming Baltic Sea conference in Tallinn. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] You will be meeting your Russian counterpart  Kozyrev again today, this time in Geneva at, as you have  mentioned, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United  States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the EU troika on the  Bosnian conflict. This meeting is taking place against the  background of the new developments in Washington, where the U.S.  Senate has expressed itself in favor of lifting the arms embargo  against Bosnia- Herzegovina. What is Bonn's position?    [Kinkel] When I was in Washington recently this very  discussion was taking place on the Hill, and the expectation was  that the result would be what it now is. It does not bind the  executive. As far as lifting the embargo is concerned, of the  12 Europeans the Dutch and the Germans have always been on the  American side, or at least very close to it. The other 10  countries, in particular those with troops on the ground, are  against lifting such an arms embargo. I have just been speaking  with Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe: The British and the French  in particular are against it, and I understand that, because  they are concerned for their troops on the ground and are  concerned that the fighting will only get worse. Aside from  that, it would of course also be relatively difficult now, with  a lifting of the arms embargo, to get arms into the enclosed  areas.    But as I said, we are with the American position. It is just  that I do not think it will come to lifting the embargo. For  that we need the Security Council, and the Russians, the  British, and the French will certainly be against it.    [Correspondent] Germany does after all supply weapons to  governments that do not take human rights all that seriously --  like Turkey and Indonesia -- so why not the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fighting against the Serbs for its  very survival?    [Kinkel] Yes, as far as the first subject goes, we must have  more time for me to explain this a little, because of course I  quite understand this. But I I will have to concentrate on the  second question, for reasons of time. The issue is that there  exists a resolution of the Security Council that simply does not  permit it, and of course we are abiding by that, just as are the  others.    [Correspondent] That was Federal Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel. Many thanks.    [Kinkel] Thank you.</p>

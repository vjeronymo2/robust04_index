			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO BAIL FOR 4 IN N.Y. PARK CASE; RACISM ALLEGED  </P> <P> Four more youths indicted in the Central Park attack on a woman jogger that a  prosecutor called "the most vicious and brutal assault" in New York City  history were denied bail today in court sessions that exploded with charges of  racism.  </P> <P> The bail hearing for one of the youths, Michael Briscoe, 17, was interrupted  when black activist attorney Alton Maddox Jr. violated an agreement that he  remain silent as Briscoe's attorney, Joseph Mack, spoke to State Supreme Court  Justice Carol Berkman.  </P> <P> When he persisted in trying to speak, the judge ordered Maddox to join the  spectators behind the courtroom rail.  </P> <P> "You're a bunch of racists! This is a kangaroo court!" two dozen black  supporters led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted. They surged forward as a dozen  court officers rushed to form a human wall at the rail.  </P> <P> Berkman left the bench and returned only after the group followed Maddox's  instructions to sit down.  </P> <P> Maddox and Mack then wheeled and stormed from the courtroom, followed by their  supporters.  </P> <P> Maddox and Sharpton were figures in the case last year of Tawana Brawley, a  black teen-ager whose tale of abduction, rape and abuse was eventually  discredited.  </P> <P> In all, seven youths are being held without bail in the rape and beating of a  Wall Street investment banker who was jogging through Central Park on April 19.  </P> <P> The woman, from the Pittsburgh suburb of Upper St. Clair, remained in a coma  for the eighth day at Metropolitan Hospital today.  </P> <P> Her accused attackers are Kevin Richardson, 14; Steve Lopez, 15; Kharey Wise,  16; Raymond Santana, 14; Antron McCray, 15; Yusef Salaam, 15, and Briscoe.  </P> <P> An eighth youth arrested in the rape, Clarence Thomas, 14, was released to his  mother's custody Thursday after a grand jury failed to indict him within the  legal time limits. An indictment against him is still possible.  </P></p>

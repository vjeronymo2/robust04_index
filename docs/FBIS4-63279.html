			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin did not accept Sergey Shakhray's  resignation from the post of vice premier, Vyacheslav Kostikov,  press secretary of the president, reported today. He also  denied rumors that preparations for a major reshuffle are under  way in the top echelons of power in Russia, in particular that  Sergey Filatov is going to be dismissed from his post as head of  the presidential administration.    In the meantime, Sergey Filatov himself considers that the  arrival of the new minister for nationalities will considerably  speed up the settlement of the Russian-Chechen issue.    State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin is convinced that this became  possible largely thanks to Sergey Shakhray's successful work.    [Begin Rybkin recording] Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray did a  great deal to remove the little splits that have appeared  between Russia and Chechnya. I think this should be said to his  credit -- naturally, together with the president -- that the  treaty on dividing powers between the center and Tatarstan as a  region has been concluded. I think the fact that the Chechen  Republic has joined the negotiating process also bears witness  to the diplomatic activity and sophistication of Sergey  Mikhaylovich Shakhray. It is hard for me to say how the new  minister will tackle his job. I think questions relating to  inter-ethnic relations are very subtle questions -- extremely  so, I would say -- and this fine tissue of relations should be  woven by the hands of professionals of the highest class. [end  recording]    Incidentally, Interfax has learned from well-informed  sources  that since Sergey Shakhray announced his resignation from the  post of vice premier, several Russian regional leaders have  appealed to the leadership of Russia not to accept his  resignation. Among them are the presidents of Tatarstan and  Bashkiria, and the head of the Karelian government.    As for Chechnya, Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov expressed an opinion that a personal meeting between  Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev may take place in the near  future. He said Russian-Chechen relations are the most painful  issue of all, but added that some progress is beginning to show  in the matter.</p>

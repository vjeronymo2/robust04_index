			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLEVELAND ALL BUSINESS IN 99-71 BLOWOUT  </P> <P> For the first time in anyone's memory, there was no chanting by the Cleveland  High basketball team as it stormed from the locker room Friday, poised to take  on Granada Hills in a game that would decide the North Valley League title.  Subdued, or even intense, doesn't quite describe it.  </P> <P> "A business-like attitude," said forward Brandon Martin, describing the tenor.  "At Granada Hills, we were acting crazy in the hallway. Our minds weren't on  the game."  </P> <P> Their minds have been on nothing else since. Two weeks ago, the Highlanders  upset Cleveland, and reminders were everywhere Friday at Cleveland -- including  one taped to the back of Eddie Hill's high-tops.  </P> <P> "(Teammate) Kayheed Murray started the shoe thing," said Hill, who guaranteed  that Cleveland would not fall in the rematch. "His said 'Terror Dome.' "  </P> <P> And Hill's? The left shoe read "Revenge." Scrawled on the right, the final  score from the first game, "88-82."  </P> <P> And retribution it was, with the Cavaliers stomping Granada Hills, 99-71, to  win their second consecutive North Valley title. The defeat snapped a  seven-game winning streak by the Highlanders (17-8, 8-2 in league play), who  entered the game ranked No. 1 in the Valley by The Times. Cleveland, ranked No.  2, is 19-5, 9-1.  </P> <P> How soon did it end? Not when Cleveland stalked onto the floor for warm-ups,  but it wasn't much later. Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson said that he felt it  slipping away "in the second quarter."  </P> <P> It might have started earlier. Cleveland trailed, 9-7, in the first quarter  when Hill, who had been fouled while shooting by Osiris Nalls, wheeled and gave  Nalls an earful -- earning a technical. "It was nothing, just the heat of the  battle," Hill said.  </P> <P> Well, heated to be sure. By the time the free throws were in the book, Granada  Hills led, 10-9. Cleveland then went on a 49-27 tear to conclude the half. "I  didn't do it purposely," Hill said. "But I guess it did give us a little  boost."  </P> <P> Kenny Collins, who relieved Hill, made two baskets and Martin -- who finished  with 20 points on nine-of-14 shooting -- tossed in two more for a 23-20 lead  after one quarter. The Cavaliers rolled up 35 points in the second quarter --  eight players scored -- to take a 58-37 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Five Cleveland players reached double figures: Hill (16), Pat McCook (13),  Bobby McRae (11 points, 10 rebounds) and Murray (12). In the first three  quarters, Cleveland made 31 of 57 field-goal attempts (54.4%) to 19 of 55  (34.5%) for Granada Hills. Only Adrian Sellers, who scored 15 of his 19 points  in the first half, and Jermoine Brantley (17 points) kept the Highlanders in  the building.  </P> <P> "Are they that good usually? I don't know how often they play that well," said  Johnson, who smiled and added the following, an observation that area fans have  come to know too well the past few years: "The thing is, they have the  potential to do that every time. They're that good."  </P></p>

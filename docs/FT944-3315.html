			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Warranties may lose earning power The Office of Fair Trading report on the sale of extended warranties, due out on Friday, is likely to be an unwelcome Christmas present for electrical retailers. Its recommendations are not expected to ban the sale of such warranties at point of sale, as some had feared, but are still likely to have a big impact on what has become a main source of profit for several large retailers. Extended warranties are insurance policies which provide extra protection against product breakdown after the standard manufacturer's guarantee has expired. The OFT's report is thought likely to call for the introduction of a new code of practice in the electrical retail sector governing the sale of such warranties, plus a lengthy 'cooling-off' period during which consumers could cancel warranties. The OFT announced its probe into the sale of extended warranties in February after much criticism from consumer groups. They highlighted the high-pressure sales techniques employed by some companies, the lack of information provided to shoppers, the difference between the prices of extended warranties offered by retailers and those offered by manufacturers, and questioned the value of them. Retail analysts have also criticised large electrical goods retailers such as Dixons and Comet for their reliance on extended warranties as a significant source of income. Fierce high street competition has severely squeezed margins on retail electrical goods, and extended warranties account for a significant slice of the sector's profits. Dixons, which also owns Currys and accounts for about 20 per cent of the UK electrical market, is thought by several analysts to derive most of its pre-tax profits from extended warranties. The group has sold 4.5m such warranties since setting up its own insurance arm. The latest research, by Mr Terry Smith and Mr Neil Darke of stockbrokers Collins Stewart, claims that: Dixons made total gross profits from extended warranties of about Pounds 100m in each of its past two financial years - more than the group's pre-tax profits of Pounds 77m and Pounds 73m respectively. That Pounds 100m includes commission earned by stores on policy sales, underwriting profits, and investment income from cash - estimated at Pounds 384m in April this year - held by its subsidiary Dixons Insurance Services, to cover warranty claims. Dixons' dividend 'is being funded through the retail commission they pay themselves on the sale of the extended warranty policies'. The group makes a gross margin of 40 per cent on extended warranties, more than twice that made by Domestic &amp; General, an insurer selling such warranties mainly through independent electrical retailers. The conclusions echo those published earlier this year by Mr Tony Shiret of stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr John Clare, Dixons chief executive, yesterday said they ignored or underestimated costs associated with selling extended warranties. 'You don't have physical stockholding costs, but you do have a large service organisation to provide the service.' Dixons has its own subsidiary, Mastercare, which provides after-sales service on products it sells. 'We might make a gross profit which is quite considerable on many parts of the business, but after all the costs and overheads the net profit looks very different,' Mr Clare said. He said analysts ignored the fact that without extended warranties, the dynamics of Dixons' business and of the whole electrical retail sector would change. 'In the extreme event of extended warranties disappearing from the mix, the assumption that nothing else would change is ludicrous,' he said. He said that if the group did not make money from selling insurance policies to cover product repair costs, it would instead make money from charging customers directly for repairs. More importantly, if the electrical retail trade could no longer make profits on selling extended warranties, there would have to be 'some structural change in the margins of the business'. Retailers would be forced to renegotiate deals with suppliers, Mr Clare said, and some unprofitable stores - and weaker chains - might be forced to close. The OFT is not expected to recommend a ban on selling extended warranties, but its efforts to introduce more competition into the warranties market could force retailers to cut the margins they make on selling the policies. Ms Hilary Monk, author of this year's report on electrical retailing by research group Verdict, said: 'The balance between margin on the product and margin on warranties clearly needs to be redressed.'</p>

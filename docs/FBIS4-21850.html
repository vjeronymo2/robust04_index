			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by Ekkaphum Wittayayut: "Who's behind the </F> bomb attacks in the Kingdom?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Let's consider the probable  intentions of the group responsible for the [recent] bombings:    A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the  country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry  out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to  maintain stability.    To increase pressure on the government at a time when  parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look  incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible  this could lead to the dissolution of parliament. [passage  omitted]    Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts  to  pressure the government. Their use of criticism during  parliamentary sessions is usually adequate.    Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the  suspicions  of those investigating the bombings.    Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of  political power are the most deserving for the focus of  suspicion as they have the most to gain.    With the democracy system now firmly in place they are  unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their  only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of  creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to  seize power again.    It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace  those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an  impression of competence.    The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a  good place to begin investigations although some observers have  said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN ALTERNATE LOOK AT ACTRESS WHO CLASHED WITH REPORTER  </P> <P> I wonder if other readers found Jan Herman's account of his interview with  Kelly McGillis as nit-picking and petty as I ("Interview for Garden Grove's  'Eve' Gets McGillis Irish Up," July 24)? Perhaps I got the distinct impression  that Mr. Herman's personal animosity got in the way of his ability to conduct a  good interview for two reasons.  </P> <P> First is the excellent, in-depth interview with Miss McGillis which appeared in  the Washington Post's Sunday supplement last fall.  </P> <P> It portrayed a very different Kelly McGillis. The second reason is based on  personal observation. I spent eight hours in production with Miss McGillis in  Washington last October when she agreed to do the introduction and closing  message of a video to educate women about early detection of breast cancer.  </P> <P> This reportedly "high-strung" actress was newly pregnant and doing six grueling  performances weekly at the Folger, yet she cheerfully gave up her day off to  work for free because she believed in the importance of the message. She never  complained, never rushed us and treated the entire crew in a professional  manner, even when we guiltily asked for autographs and a photo at day's end.  </P> <P> One might ask whether the privileges and haughtiness of celebrity extend to  reporters and critics.  </P> <P> GAIL D.

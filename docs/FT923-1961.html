			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: A great crusader THE GREAT MELODY: A THEMATIC BIOGRAPHY OF EDMUND BURKE by Conor Cruise O'Brien Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 22.50, 692 pages CONOR Cruise O'Brien's book is worthy of Edmund Burke. Humane, passionate and polemical in equal measure, it is more a vindication than a biography. Yeats supplies not only the book's title, but also its theme and structure. Burke's life and work is a 'great melody', a single, coherent crusade against corruption, misrule and oppression, whether in George III's England and America, Hastings' India, Mirabeau's France or Grattan's Ireland. O'Brien is adamant that on all five fronts Burke was right. And not just right, but consistent - consistently courageous, liberal, and influential. The consistency of principle is hard to refute. 'I feel an insuperable reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution of government, upon a theory, however plausible': those words, delivered on Fox's India Bill, summarise Burke's stance in most of his controversies. Circumstances is the key Burkean word: 'Circumstances . . . give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour, and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind.' Circumstances precluded the abolition of the French nobility, and the denigration of the Catholic Church by the Jacobins, every bit as much as they forbade the taxation of the American colonists, enjoined religious toleration, and required the impeachment of Warren Hastings. O'Brien does well to stress that Burke was revered as much by 19th century Liberals as by reactionaries then and since. More than anything, it was because of his zeal in exposing and lambasting oppression and abuse of power. To Burke, oppression was always a circumstance demanding reform, even if circumstances permitted only of partial, piecemeal change. 'The happiness or misery of multitudes can never be a thing indifferent,' he urged in one of his earliest tracts against the Catholic penal laws. Whether it concerned the Irish Catholics, Marie-Antoinette, or the eunuchs of the Begums of Oudh, tortured that Hastings might plunder their mistresses, once Burke's emotional sympathy was engaged the torrent followed. Gladstone, not Disraeli or his successors, is Burke's most credible and creditable heir. The Grand Old Man read and re-read 'On Conciliation with America' when grappling with Irish Home Rule. Government in Ireland could be successful, he argued, after Burke, only if 'as in England, the law is felt to be indigenous.' The Irish were manifestly capable of self-government, and no time was riper for granting it than 1886. Parliament refused to follow Gladstone as it had rejected Burke; it was wrong both times, to tragic effect. Unsurprisingly, it is in relation to Ireland that O'Brien's emotional insight deepest. He establishes fairly convincingly that Burke's father, a Dublin solicitor, was a Catholic who conformed to the established church in 1722 for fear of his livelihood - shortly after giving legal advice to the hapless James Cotter who was judicially murdered for little other than being a young, wealthy and extrovert Catholic. O'Brien has Richard Burke's shame and bitterness concealed by a necessary and total reticence (inherited by Edmund) continually obliging him to feign a disinterested persona and hide his anguish about the plight of Irish Catholics. For all the conjecture, this seems entirely plausible. The 'Catholic layer' helps explain not just the ferocity of Burke's reaction to the irreligion of the French revolution, but a number of personal feuds and the contrast between the extreme reserve he almost invariably exhibited when dealing with Irish issues and the occasional impassioned outburst. 'I vow to God,' he told his Bristol electors, in his one public eruption, justifying his support for the 1778 Act relaxing restrictions upon the ownership of property by Catholics, 'I would sooner bring myself to put a man to immediate death for opinions at once, than to fret him with a feverish being, tainted with the jail-distemper of a contagious servitude, to keep him above ground an animated mass of putrefaction, corrupted himself, and corrupting all about him.' Burke, we are told, divided his world into angels and devils. So does O'Brien. Burke's enemies are his enemies, and much of the book, alas far too much, is devoted to laborious rebuttals of almost every historian ever to have under-rated or criticised the Master. Public Enemy Number One is Sir Lewis Namier, now dead 32 years, whose manifold sins appear to be as much of omission as of commission. Other critics are damned simply as 'Namierite', in some cases with gross unfairness. The same defensive ardour gives rise to perverse omissions and judgments. It was emphatically not just 'George III's will' which kept the American war going for five years after Saratoga (1777): popular fervour and large parliamentary majorities supported it. The political immorality of the Fox-North coalition is nowhere addressed; nor is the most damaging charge against the Burke/Fox India Bill - that it gave the Indian patronage, almost entire, to Fox's Whig relations and put it beyond parliamentary control. The notion that Fox repudiated Burke's stance on the French revolution through resentment of 'Burke's intellectual and moral ascendancy over him' rings distinctly hollow. O'Brien's portrayal of the revolution as the 'first great experiment in totalitarian innovation' is apt, and Burke's Reflections were indeed, as he argues (quoting Reynaud), 'a la fois liberale et contre-revolutionnaire.' Yet Burke's view that a Bourbon restoration was the best policy for France should not go unchallenged. To do that is to ignore the post-1793 circumstances of France, and the disastrous experience of Charles X's reactionary reign - something a true Burkean would never do.</p>

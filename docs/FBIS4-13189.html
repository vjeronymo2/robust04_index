			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo] </F>   [Text] Chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has  warned that he who does respect the dates in the agreements that  he has signed does not adhere to the texts of these agreements,  and accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of going too  far in his attempt to ignore the dates, saying this violates the  commitments by which we are determined to abide.    Sha'th told AL-HAYAH that any agreement takes place between  two sides, and we should reach an agreement within two or three  weeks at most. [sentence as published]    He expressed the Palestinian side's fear that Rabin may  delay  the deadline from 15 May to a later date, and said: We are  supposed to fix a date and to stick to it.    Sha'th reiterated the call on the U.S. Administration to pay  its role as a sponsor of the peace process, and to adhere to its  stated positions, and said: We are determined to continue the  negotiations.    He described U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  expected visit to the region later this month as important.    On the Hadera operation that took place yesterday, he said:  It is painful that actions of killing in Gaza, Hebron, 'Afula,  and Hadera continue and that innocents, whether they are  Palestinians or Israelis, are killed without any reason other  than that no applicable just peace has been reached.    He said the operation should encourage an expedited peace  agreement in order to protect the innocents on both sides.    Answering a question on a statement by Military Intelligence  Commander General Uri in which he said negotiating delegation  members Muhammad Dahlan and Faysal al-Husayni, among others, are  nominees to replace Palestinian President 'Arafat, Sha'th  accused Israel of trying to instigate differences among the  Palestinian personalities and said: This is no more than an  attempt to instigate 'Arafat in an exposed and lowly manner  against his men.    Sha'th denied that there is agreement with Israel on  supplying the Palestinian police with six helicopters, two of  which will be placed at the disposal of President 'Arafat, and  said: There is no such agreement.    He denied that there is a plan to convene a meeting between  'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Bucharest  tomorrow.</p>

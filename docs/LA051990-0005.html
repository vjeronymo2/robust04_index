			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOCK OF LAKER FANS OVERCOME BY WONDER: WHERE TO PLACE BLAME  </P> <P> Pat Riley certainly deserves credit for leading a post-Kareem team to 63  victories in the regular season.  </P> <P> But Riley's accomplishments don't approach the outstanding job Larry Brown did  with the San Antonio Spurs.  </P> <P> Brown took a perennial loser with only three holdovers and molded them into a  poised, winning machine.  </P> <P> With Magic, Worthy, Scott and the excellent backup cast that Jerry West has  assembled, my grandmother could get the Lakers this far. And she wouldn't have  to go to Italy for her wardrobe. She shops at Penney's.  </P> <P> BEN DASSI, Santa Monica  </P></p>

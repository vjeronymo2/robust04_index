			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: New Issues Investors will have yet another chance to buy shares in a nursing home group when Goldsborough Healthcare comes to the stock market on Thursday with a flotation valuing it at Pounds 74.5m. This is slightly different from the purer plays in the sector as it combines 26 care homes - of which four are residential, not nursing, homes - with acute hospitals, Goldsborough has two plus a half share in a third, and a home care division which provides nurses to clients in their own homes. There is great interest in this industry just now. Following 1993's Community Care Act, the roles of purchaser and provider have been separated, allowing the private sector to expand. Goldsborough claims its range of activities give it strength, although the bulk of profits still come from the care homes which produce higher margins but, in the expansion phase, consume more cash than they produce. One concern about Goldsborough is that it is coming to market with net debt of Pounds 7.8m, and gearing of 15.4 per cent, in spite of raising Pounds 29m of new money. The other Pounds 33.3m being raised in the float is going to existing shareholders - mainly Kunick, the gaming machine group - which are selling. That leaves Goldsborough at something of a disadvantage to other companies, which have arrived on the market with net cash. And given that it is only seventh in the pecking order of care home operators, investors may prefer to stick to one of the larger groups, even if their shares are rated more highly. At the 170p offer price, the shares are on a prospective p/e of 14.8 on a forecast of Pounds 6.55m pre-tax on a pro forma basis. Sponsor to the issue is SG Warburg and the broker is SG Warburg Securities.</p>

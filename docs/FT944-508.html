			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Italy taking part in EU exercise Sir, I refer to your editorial, 'Germany's EU balancing act' (December 16), which said that 'last spring France and Germany announced plans to co-ordinate their consecutive presidencies of the European Union, joined a few months later by Spain'. On behalf of my government, I would like to state that what was agreed last spring - that is, before the start of Germany's EU presidency - was an exercise of co-ordination among the consecutive presidencies of four countries - Germany, France, Spain and Italy - in view of the 1996 inter-governmental conference, which will be inaugurated under Italy's EU presidency. All along, Italy - which the editorial oddly fails to mention - has participated in the above-mentioned exercise, whose first two meetings took place in Bonn on July 2 and November 2. The exercise is supposed to continue until the end of the IGC. Livio Caputo, under secretary of state for foreign affairs, Rome, Italy</p>

Yevgenyev report under the "Regions" rubric: </F> "Impoverished Regions Will Not Add to the Country's Wealth"]    [Text] That Russia needs a well-thought-out regional  policy more than ever today is the conclusion drawn by  specialists of the Institute of Experts of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in their report entitled "The  Regions of Russia in the Transitional Period."    For some time now we have been unable to kick the bad habit  of being wise after the event (remember the bitter sobering up  that occurred after the recent elections). The analysis put  forward by Yevgeniy Yasin, Andrey Neshchadin, Andrey Grigoryev,  and Mikhail Malyutin is an attempt to "seize the moment," to get  to grips with the key problem of Russian reforms.    In the experts' opinion, there are now two objectively  inevitable processes under way in Russia -- decentralization and  federalization. The crux of the former is the transfer of  economic decisionmaking or, to be more precise, the sources of  economic decisionmaking downward -- from the organs of  centralized planning and management of the command economy to  the marketplace. It is our common misfortune that this process,  which began under the influence of the democratization of the  USSR, got stuck at the level of the republics and led to its  disintegration. The process was actually simply incapable of  penetrating further -- to the lower, market level -- at the  time. Compared with the USSR, Russia is a more uniform country  in geopolitical and national terms (83 percent of the population  are Russians), and its market groundwork has been better  prepared. That should, as it were, reassure those who see in  its fate direct analogies with the great Soviet empire. The crux  of the matter, however, is that even here, in the process of  decentralization, a hiatus has occurred at regional level in the  devolution of power. Enterprises are not yet able to operate in  a new way while the center is no longer in a position to manage  in the old way. As a result the regional authorities get  involved in everything under the sun from regulating prices to  privatization, from subsidizing the disadvantaged to the  purchase and sale of goods and the organization of inter-oblast  bartering. This situation will not last forever. The  development of private trade, commodity and money markets, and a  labor market will set everything to rights. What we must not do  is hurry events along or demand the impossible but must let the  process come to fruition.    But the temptation to call to order, to regulate, and to  take  the center to task is greater than ever today. The report  examines two diametrically opposed economic management models --  one in Nizhniy Novgorod, the other in Ulyanovsk. The first  model is actively reformist, with the accent on privatization,  the development of enterprise, deregulation of prices  [svobodnoye tsenoobrazovaniye] prices, and a very open region.  The second model largely sticks to the old-type structures and  relationships. There they do not much welcome the private  sector, they regulate prices, set quotas for the allocation of  prime necessities, and ban the export of subsidized goods from  the oblast. The upshot is that inhabitants of Ulyanovsk Oblast  can acquire for their income twice the quantity of staple  foodstuffs that the average inhabitant of Nizhniy Novgorod can,  although, from the standpoint of the future, it is the Nizhniy  Novgorod strategy, which promises to yield the greatest return.  But it would be a very great mistake to order everyone to march  in step! The Ulyanovsk authorities' tactics are dictated by the  totality of the specific conditions that obtain there,  conditions that are not reproduced countrywide, such as the  oblast's self-sufficiency in food and the balance between the  industrial and agrarian sectors. Moreover, in Ulyanovsk, as in  other regions where they regulate prices, inflation is no lower  than where prices are free. No one, anyway, will be able to  keep prices fixed. Of course, there is some injustice in all  this: The inhabitants of Nizhniy Novgorod are working not just  for their own future but the future of the whole country; in  Ulyanovsk they are seeking to squeeze the maximum out of what  the Lord God has sent them and have created a command system.  But this is the will of the regions, and it must not not be  ignored.    The other process, which we are experiencing, is  federalization. That is to say, the formation of a system of  institutions of power bound up with the transition from a  unitary union state to a truly federal one. And that is  impossible without a budgetary system. So long as Moscow  determines how much tax someone must pay to the center, there  will always be aggrieved people who think that their neighbors  are eating them out of house and home. And there will  consequently be grounds for separatism. A single-channel  taxation system does not suit us, experts believe, and it leads  toward confederation. The German option is the most acceptable:  The center sets a single value-added tax and a single moderate  rate of tax on profits payable to the federal exchequer while  the local authorities have the opportunity to increase it to the  benefit of the regional budget and also to set and collect any  other taxes for their own exchequer.    That is what the theoreticians think, but the  administrators?  The Finance Ministry would seem not to be against. But another  year has now elapsed and there is still nno clarity. Until we  sort out taxes, there will be no peace in our common home.    And yet structural reorganization is the most difficult task  from the standpoint of the future. The authors of the report  make an interesting observation. They started by trying to  define what concepts of reform in general are feasible in Russia  today. In the experts' opinion, there are three such options.  The raw-materials option, placing reliance on the extractive  sectors, whose output we could sell abroad. The conversion  option, entailing the development of high-tech production and  the restructuring of the military-industrial complex. And  finally the third and, unlike the previous ones, self-contained  option, geared toward the domestic market. Each of them has its  own advantages and disadvantages. Something else is important:  Depending on the structure of their economy, all the regions  gravitate toward a particular concept of reforms. The authors  of the report have done a simple thing: They have taken the  results of the April referendum and examined to what extent the  results depend on the coincidence of the center's reform line  and the structure of the region. There turns out to be a very  direct link. Politics is one thing, but it is the economy that  feeds us. It is the economy that determines our political  sympathies.    The resume will be brief: Russia is too big a country to  adopt and maintain a single pure strategy of reforms. The  strategy must be a mixed one, which takes account of the  interests of Nadym and Kaliningrad. To press down obstinately  upon a single lever while moving along such a difficult,  treacherous, and unpredictable path as the one we are trying to  traverse is an ineffectual activity. And a dangerous one.</p>

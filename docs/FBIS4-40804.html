			<p>BFN     [Text] A joint Russian-American naval exercise for aiding  the civilian population in the case of a natural disaster  started near Vladivostok on June 20. The Russian Pacific Fleet  detached a large landing ship and 180 marines for the exercise  managed by Rear Admiral Nikolay Kochergin, commander of the  fleet's landing ship unit.    The U.S. is represented by a landing-helicopter-carrying  ship  Debuc with marines and 12 boats under the command of Rear  Admiral John Siegler.    Officers in the Russian navy's press center told INTERFAX  that the ships were already in the area where the exercise was  to be carried out and would start the "humanitarian landing" at  7:00 local time on June 21.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH GANG ATTACKS TRAIN, FINDS IT EMPTY  </P> <P> A gang of 50 attacked a high-speed French train Sunday night but found it empty  and fled with only the driver's jacket and wallet.  </P> <P> Police said Monday that the gang halted the train in a Marseilles suburb by  placing concrete blocks across the tracks. The train, heading for the  southwestern city of Montpellier, was moving slowly when the driver saw the  barrier.  </P> <P> Travelers have complained frequently about robberies on trains traveling from  France into Italy and Spain, but Sunday's attack was the first recorded  instance of an attempt to hold up one of the country's special high-speed TGV  trains.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Campaign"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 21 -- Italian People's Party  leader Mino Martinazzoli promised today that if the center wins  the general election Sunday and Monday [27 and 28 March] the  nation will have a new government within 24 hours as Achille  Occhetto, whose Democratic Party of the Left is the mainstay of  the Progressive Coalition, promised "no idleness and luxury" if  the left is victorious but "sacrifices equitably shared."    On the right, the chairman of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest  group, Fedele Confalonieri, lashed out against the press for  coverage of alleged complicity between his group and Sicilian  Mafia families while an ally of Berlusconi's Forza Italia  movement, neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] leader  Gianfranco Fini, defended national unity and vowed never to  recant Fascism.    With four days left in the campaign leading to the crucial  vote, Martinazzoli, who steered his Christian Democrats through  a name-change in mid-January, lashed out at the right and left  on national television in describing Occhetto as "politically  somewhat spherical" and Berlusconi as having "a natural aptitude  for lying, the political vision of an abacus and the thinking of  an imbecile."    Fini, said the party leader, is a person a used car could  not  be sold to "because he wouldn't pay for it" and Umberto Bossi,  whose Northern League is in the Forza Italia camp, as "a big  talker."    Another voice from the center today was that of Mario Segni,  who dismissed all prospects of his Pact for Italy entering a  government with the Democratic Party of the Left after the  election. Segni, a reforming Christian Democrat who quit the  Catholic party before the name change, also said that though  surveys are banned, "we all have the sensation that this week we  are strongly recovering because reason is beginning to replace  emotion and sentiment."    On this score, Democratic Alliance, a grouping of left-wing  intellectuals running on the progressive ticket, announced a  petition drive which has garnered more than 2,000 signatures led  by Nobel medicine price laureate Rita Levi Montalcini, conductor  Claudio Abbado, theatrical director and entrepreneur Giorgio  Strehler and figures of this caliber.    In Milan today, Confalonieri told a press conference, "We  are  outraged, if only for a lack of a better word." The conference  had been called to answer allegations made, and highlighted by  the press, that Fininvest executives, including Berlusconi who  owns Fininvest, had been fingered by Mafia turncoats for wrong  doing.    Fini, a guest on a Fininvest television channel talk show,  said of Berlusconi's ally in the north, "I don't talk to Bossi  because I think he doesn't understand. He insults, I try  reason." On Berlusconi, the neofascist leader said, there is no  problem. "When I sign an understanding, I respect it," he added  with reference to his National Alliance deal with the  businessman turned politician.    Questioned by a left-wing journalist on his position on  Fascism, Fini said, "If you are asking me to forsake it, I will  never do this. If you tell me to look ahead, that's what I'm  doing. History will be the judge of Fascism."    On the stump in Parma, Occhetto told a rally, "Do not  believe  in a magic wand and those who say they will create a million  jobs." If the progressives win, there will be no idleness and  luxury around the corner because the country has been unnerved  in recent years, destroyed. "Sacrifices, however, will have to  be equally shared and will especially have to be made by those  who have never done so," he declared. Looking to the right, he  said, "In Europe, they laugh when they hear it said he  (Berlusconi) entered the field to weaken the communist peril."    If the right wins and Berlusconi becomes premier, he added,  "I will ask myself of what use was Bribesville; the poor would  have to restore to the wealthy of Bribesville the wealth (the  corrupt) should now return to justice," he said with reference  to his proposal to make those in possession of ill-got gains  reimburse the state.    In another development today, the Italian Episcopal  Conference branded the mass media as "one of the strongest  factors in the de-Christianization process and the eclipse of  human values themselves" and told Italy's Catholics going to the  polls to turn away from "high-sounding words which hide lack of  content."    After admitting that the political unity of the nation's  Catholics is a thing of the past, the bishops said the faithful  should, nonetheless, be mindful of the moral requirements  attached to the Church's social doctrine when casting their  ballots.</p>

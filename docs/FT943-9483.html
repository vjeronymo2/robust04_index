			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Shake-up at the top for Democrats The Clinton White House, increasingly anxious about the prospect of losses in November, in congressional mid-term elections, has moved to shake up the top of the national Democratic party. Mr David Wilhelm will step down as party chairman in November and, meanwhile, he will take a back seat to Mr Tony Coelho, a former rising star in Congress from California, who will serve as a party special adviser. The decision, finalised at a meeting of Mr Wilhelm and President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, is very much the work of Mr Leon Panetta, now beginning to exert effective control as new White House chief of staff. In another move, Mr Panetta, also a former congressman from California, was thought likely to recommend that Judge Abner Mikva of the federal appeals court in Washington succeed Mr Lloyd Cutler as White House legal counsel, when the latter's temporary secondment ends, probably next month. Judge Mikva was a veteran congressman from Illinois before being appointed to the bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 and, like Mr Coelho, served on Capitol Hill with Mr Panetta. Both moves represent the further assertion of the professional Democratic politician over those, such as Mr Wilhelm, heavily involved in Mr Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Mr Wilhelm, who is 37, has presided over losses by the Democrats in state-wide and other elections since Mr Clinton was elected. The prognosis for November is not good, with Republicans expecting to win 25 seats or more in the House and hoping to take control of the Senate. By 1989, Mr Coelho, now 51, was already a House Democratic whip and seemed on track to be Speaker of the House. But he was forced to resign his seat to stave off an ethics investigation of his personal financial dealings. This arose from reports that he had borrowed money from a now defunct Californian savings bank owned by a friend to purchase Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) in junk bonds from Mr Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. This year, the Justice Department ended its investigation of the junk bond deal without further action. Mr Coelho is now president of Wertheim, Schroder, the Wall Street investment bank.</p>

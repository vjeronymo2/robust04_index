			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> One-Year T-Bill Rates Plunge: The Treasury sold $9.0 billion of the 52-week  T-bills at an average discount rate of 7.58%, down from 8.18% at the last  comparable auction on June 1. The rates were the lowest since Oct. 20, 1988,  when the one-year bills sold for 7.57%. The new discount rate understates the  actual return to investors -- 8.16% with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,233.60.  </P></p>

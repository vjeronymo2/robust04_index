			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Alain Chastagnol: "Clinton and Europe"] </F>   [Text] President Clinton returns to Europe today for the  second time, surrounded by confusion. He is due to join in the  celebrations of the 1944 operation, to "cloak himself in the  prestige of Normandy," although he has never experienced war and  escaped the Vietnam War. He is due to reaffirm "Lafayette, we  are here!" although he is more concerned with domestic policy  than foreign policy and often advocates isolationism.    The criticisms of his foreign policy are now building up:  vacillation and sudden about-faces on China's trade privileges,  on Haiti, on Somalia, or North Korea; with regard to Bosnia in  particular where the French, who urged a negotiated agreement,  think that he is not going far enough and fast enough. "I am  doing what I can in face of very difficult problems," Bill  Clinton said, which is a far cry from the authority of Ronald  Reagan, whose panache and emotion worked miracles in Normandy  itself in 1984.    The U.S. President nonetheless knows that Europe is vital to  him. He studied at Oxford. He has had the D-Day landings  explained to him. He said before his departure that the  Americans had then understood that they were taking part in a  historic action and that there could be no security in the  United States if it did not defend "freedom." Is this enough to  shoulder the role of world policeman, which Bush intended to  play? Probably not. But it is enough to understand our  interdependence.    It is enough to propose, with more credibility than any  other  U.S. President, that Europe should take control of its own  affairs. Clinton wants a "united and strong" Europe. The  European defense initiative has never been viewed more favorably  and the U.S. President would not be annoyed if the Eurocorps  troops, the precursor to the European intervention force, were  to march down the Champs-Elysees on 14 July.    In four days' time lyricism will prevail. It could result in  a salutary European reorientation if the strong solidarity of  the past and France's gratitude for it finally find their  present-day military and political expression. There would then  be at least one lesson learned from history.</p>

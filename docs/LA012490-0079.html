			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILTON TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES TO SALE  </P> <P> Hilton Hotels Corp. said Tuesday that it will consider restructuring  alternatives other than the much anticipated sale of the company, sending its  stock sharply lower on Wall Street.  </P> <P> Hilton's stock closed down $8.75 at $65.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange  trading. It had traded as high as $115.50 a share after the company put itself  on the block last August.  </P> <P> After trading closed, William Lebo, the company's general counsel, said Hilton  had received a takeover proposal, but he declined to reveal details.  </P> <P> Shares of the lodging and casino company have spiraled downward in recent weeks  as prospects have faded that it would be sold at a premium.  </P> <P> Analysts had estimated that Hilton could fetch as much as $130 a share. The  company has about 48 million shares outstanding.  </P> <P> In its earlier announcement Tuesday, Hilton said its board next week "will  consider a number of alternatives for the company, including proposals to  acquire the company, as well as restructuring strategies which would not  involve a sale of the company.  </P> <P> "There can be no assurance that the company will elect to pursue any of those  alternatives," it added.  </P> <P> Hilton issued its statement in response to inquiries by the New York Stock  Exchange. The company's stock had fallen sharply before the announcement, and  trading was halted briefly because of an imbalance of orders.  </P> <P> "My interpretation is that there's a big difference between what may be coming  in on the bid side and what Barron (company Chairman Barron Hilton) thinks is  the proper ask side," said Marvin Roffman, analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott  Inc.  </P> <P> Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chicago-based JMB Realty  Corp. was offering about $90 a share.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday traders said a rumor that JMB had dropped out of the bidding was  a factor driving Hilton's stock down.  </P> <P> Bert Glazov, executive vice president for JMB, declined comment. JMB has never  confirmed that it was a bidder for Hilton.  </P> <P> Alternatives to a sale include declaration of a special cash dividend or other  measures.  </P></p>

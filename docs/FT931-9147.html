			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeking healthy advice Such is the complexity of Britain's health and safety legislation that companies frequently turn to consultants for advice and training. But how do they decide whether a consultant is really necessary, choose the right one and make sure they get value for money? A leaflet* from the Health &amp; Safety Executive provides the answers to these and other questions. Recent experience indicates some consultants do not understand the relevant regulations well enough and lead employers into unnecessary expense, the HSE warns. Other consultants, meanwhile, appear deliberately to misinterpret the legislation to promote their own services. If a business is not too large and the risks are relatively clear it may find the solutions in HSE booklets, by having an employee trained or by speaking to its trade association. A consultant may prove of value if the company is adopting new or complicated technology or if it requires specialist skills for only a short period. When it comes to choosing a consultancy, a company should define its requirements. It should describe the problem and why it cannot be dealt with in-house; detail what it wants the consultant to do; and describe what it would consider as a successful outcome. That should be developed into a brief, which should outline a budget, set a timeframe and describe what resources the company can offer. The client should judge performance by assessing whether the consultant asked searching questions, his recommendations were understandable and the company can act upon them. The booklet contains a list of useful addresses (though curiously no telephone numbers) of specialist organisations that can provide further advice. CB*Selecting a Health &amp; Safety Consultancy.

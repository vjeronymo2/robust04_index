			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Institutions bid for 2bn BT shares INSTITUTIONAL shareholders had bid for more than 2bn British Telecommunications shares after the international offer closed yesterday. The final figures will not be released until tomorrow, but SG Warburg and Co, global coordinators of the bookbuilding exercise, said that orders for 2bn shares had been received by the close of the first day of bidding and that the book had grown since then. A total of 1.2bn shares are on sale, tentatively split equally between institutions and retail investors although the ratio might be changed over the weekend. Trading in the partly paid shares begins on Monday. Of the institutional bids received it is believed that as many as 1.5bn were at a price equivalent to about 12p over yesterday's closing price of 408p for existing shares. The premium is close to the theoretical value to investors of 13p a share of buying part-paid shares. As a result of the demand, several leading UK institutional investors said that they expected the deal to be highly successful but they no longer thought the shares worth bidding for at this price. 'It's just not worth it at this level,' said one life insurance company investment manager. Another insurance company fund manager said that while he had placed bids for up to 1m shares, he realised that the prices he offered for them were too low relative to where BT shares were trading late Friday. 'We won't get any shares and we don't care to at these prices', he said. Figures from the first day's bidding suggest that UK institutions are less enthusiastic than their counterparts abroad about the new shares. Although UK shareholders account for well over half of all current BT investors, they were only half of all bidders on the first day. Retail investors have applied for just over 1bn BT shares in the UK public offer, according to final figures released yesterday. This is slightly more than expected but well down on applications for 1.7bn in the last sale of government BT shares in 1991.</p>

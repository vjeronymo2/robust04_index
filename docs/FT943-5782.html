			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arms-to-Iraq report held over to 1995 The publication of the report from Lord Justice Scott into the sale of defence equipment to Iraq has been delayed until early next year, it was announced yesterday. The need to gather and assess additional evidence has led to the postponing of the report's release, originally scheduled for this autumn, the inquiry team said yesterday. Lord Justice Scott has also decided to question two witnesses from the Secret Intelligence Service or MI6, it was disclosed. One of the witnesses is a serving MI6 officer and the other a former officer with the secret service. The judge's decision to question them face-to-face follows extensive recent requests to both witnesses to supply further written evidence. These requests followed evidence given to the inquiry by other witnesses about the role played by MI6 when defence-related equipment was exported to Iraq. The two witnesses will be questioned about MI6's concerns regarding the Iraqi procurement network and the service's involvement in the consideration of granting export licences for defence equipment - in particular the contracts awarded to Matrix Churchill, the Midlands engineering company, for the export of 'dual-use' machine tools will be looked at. The two MI6 witnesses will give evidence in closed sessions later this month. The exact dates have not been released 'for reasons of national security and for the personal safety of the officers concerned', the statement said. More than 30 other witnesses have been asked to provide further written evidence to the inquiry since the public hearings ended in May. No other face-to-face interviews with witnesses are planned. The statement said, however, that no final decision about such sessions could be taken now. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the inquiry secretary, said: 'Lord Justice Scott has already written a large part of the report and continues to write while the investigative work goes on. 'Requests for evidence and for information are still being sent out. The need to gather and assess additional evidence has inevitably extended the timetable. 'The judge hopes to have completed the draft by the end of the year and he will then give witnesses whom he proposes to criticise an opportunity to comment before the report is finalised.'</p>

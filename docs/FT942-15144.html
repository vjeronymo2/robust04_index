			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Defiant Bosnian Serbs blast into Gorazde The Bosnian Serbs, defying western air power and diplomatic pressure, blasted their way into the town of Gorazde last night and urged its Moslem defenders to surrender. Senior US officials, who held an emergency meeting in Washington to discuss the enclave's virtual collapse, said the Serbs were in control of all strategic points. One member of Britain's elite Special Air Services died in hospital after being evacuated from Gorazde by helicopter with serious wounds, while another injured British soldier remained in the town after the rescue mission treated him. The other United Nations personnel in the town, believed to number about 14, were taking shelter in the besieged city centre as UN authorities considered ways to ensure their safety. The Bosnian Serb army said it would guarantee the safety of any of Gorazde's 65,000 residents who took refuge behind its lines. This amounted to an ultimatum to civilians to leave the city centre. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia, told Bosnia's Moslem leaders, who were furious over the collapse of Gorazde, that the UN had considered ordering fresh air strikes against the Serbs but dropped the idea after the wounded soldier was evacuated. Mr Akashi made clear the rescue mission had been possible only because of a short-lived ceasefire arrangement with the Serbs. The collapse of Gorazde represents a massive blow to the prestige of the western governments which had declared the town a safe area and pledged to protect UN personnel. The attackers' success in Gorazde brings them within striking distance of their long-standing aim of linking eastern Bosnia with Serbia. Earlier, a French jet circling Gorazde was hit in the tail by anti-aircraft guns but managed to return safely to the aircraft carrier Clemenceau in the Adriatic. The Bosnian Serbs denied firing on the aircraft, although they had earlier issued threats to shoot down Nato aircraft. The Serb stranglehold on Gorazde forced waves of local inhabitants to flee from outlying villages into the town centre. Many of the enclave's 65,000 inhabitants are already refugees. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said he hoped the Serb action was not a 'prelude to more vigorous military action elsewhere'. The US said last night it was sending extra troops to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, bringing its presence there to about 500, but it has made clear it will not send ground troops to Bosnia unless there is an overall settlement.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Post-auction bid secures Bacon painting for Pounds 735,000: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S in London had a successful auction of contemporary art yesterday in spite of a temporary setback when the most important lot, the first important painting by Francis Bacon to appear on the market since his death in April, was unsold in the saleroom. But a Continental bidder, who had been unable to get his telephone bid through, acquired 'Study of a Nude with Figure in a Mirror' for Pounds 735,000 after the auction, well below the Pounds 1m-plus estimate. That boosted the take to Pounds 4.2m with only 13 per cent unsold, if the Bacon is included. The other star lot was '4 Marilyns', an Andy Warhol silkscreen of four heads of Marilyn Monroe in bold shades of yellow, turquoise, red and orange. It sold to a Continental collector for Pounds 610,500, way above estimate. Another good price was the record Pounds 209,000 for a work by Leon Kossoff. 'Children's Swimming Pool' was painted at Willesden Baths in London in 1969. 'Gran Ocre amb Petjades' by the Catalan artist Antoni Tapies beat its estimate at Pounds 214,500. 'Elke' by Georg Baselitz, depicting his naked wife upside down, went for Pounds 165,000, half its estimate, suggesting a desperate seller, while a painting by another modern chronicler of London, Frank Auerbach, a view of Mornington Crescent Station, went just below forecast at Pounds 148,500. Corporate sponsorship of the arts in the UK in 1991-92 rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 65.4m in spite of the recession and cuts by some significant supporters, notably banks and the oil companies. Yesterday's figures, from the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, show growth in sponsorship mainly from medium-sized companies in the regions, notably the professions and packaged-goods manufacturers. The media and privatised industries have also increased involvement. Nationally, straightforward sponsorship including support for capital projects rose 28 per cent from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 57.6m in the year, while contributions to corporate membership schemes, which are used mainly for entertaining, fell 37 per cent from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 7.8m. That has caused difficulties for organisations such as the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which look to such schemes for much of their sponsorship revenue. Mr Colin Tweedy, the association's director-general, said the figures showed that business was 'cutting back on anything that is non-commercial. This is proving a difficult year, but the way things are going I would expect a small increase in sponsorship expenditure in 1992-93.'</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Tarnished image fades as profits replace loss - British Steel This time last year, British Steel was unveiling its worst set of results since privatisation in 1988. Today, things will be very different. The company's Pounds 149m pre-tax loss for 1992-93 was the result of recession and falling demand at home and abroad, and price reductions caused by excess production capacity in the European steel industry. Since then, British Steel has started a long climb back into the black. In November, it reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds 27m, reflecting improvements in prices and in operating performance. It restored an interim dividend of 0.5p. Today, even the most pessimistic of analysts expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m for the year to March, and forecasts range as high as Pounds 95m. The majority believe a maintained final dividend of 1p per share is likely. While the expected results remain a long way short of the record Pounds 733m in 1989-90, the company is at least making profits and generating cash. Some robust comments are likely from Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, on the progress of the European Commission's rescue plans for the industry. The UK company is adamant that a line should be drawn under state subsidies and that the capacity cuts already pledged by continental producers should be implemented. But analysts will also be looking closely at his remarks on market conditions and price trends. At the interim stage the company reported that UK demand for steel had recovered markedly, but noted that this was due largely to an increase in inventory levels and the underlying improvement was modest. Continental markets remained 'very depressed'. For 1994-95, the City's most optimistic forecasts run to as much as Pounds 300m for the current year's pre-tax profits.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / EC posts change hands Brussels' cyclical game of musical chairs is under way, with the announcement yesterday that Mr Karel Van Miert will take over responsibility for the environment, until Rome names a commissioner to succeed Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, appointed environment minister in Italy's new cabinet, writes David Buchan from Brussels. In 1989, Mr Van Miert ended up with transport and consumer protection, but he may get environment in the next Commission, which would run only for 1993-1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, Switzerland, April 7 (AFP) -- Trade  negotiators agreed Thursday [7 April] on a compromise formula  for including labor rights in the future work of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to become the World Trade  Organization, GATT said in an official announcement.    They said the compromise text, due to be officially accepted  at next week's GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh for  signing the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of trade  negotiations, does not refer specifically to international labor  standards.    But it was agreed that the conference chairman, Uruguayan  Foreign Minister Sergio Bonilla, should make a declaration in  Marrakesh specifically mentioning the inclusion of the "social  clause," for which the United States and France have pressed  hard, in the working program of the future World Trade  Organization.    Washington had threatened to delay the signing of the Final  Act in the absence of a commitment to have the future World  Trade Organization discuss workers' rights. It maintains that  countries exporting goods made by low-paid workers enjoy an  undue advantage in trade. Developing countries have opposed  inclusion of this issue on the WTO agenda.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Board of directors plan for Tories A REVIEW of Conservative party internal organisation is thought to have concluded that a new board of directors should be set up to improve the party's effectiveness. Those sitting on the board would be drawn from the various branches of the party, including constituencies, area offices and the national union, the party's voluntary arm. The review - commissioned by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman - is believed to have concluded the board would improve the cohesiveness with which the party performs activities.</p>

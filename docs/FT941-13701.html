			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK renews export cover to Lebanon The British government yesterday renewed export insurance cover to Lebanon for the first time since 1977. The announcement coincided with an hour-long meeting in London yesterday between Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Rafik Hariri, his Lebanese counterpart. It signals increasing international confidence in returning political and commercial stability following the end of the 1975-90 civil war. British ministers hope the move will make it easier for UK companies to bid for some of the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of work to rebuild Beirut. The initial credit facility is understood to be for Pounds 50m. Premiums will depend on what assessment officials make of the risk of operating in Lebanon. Mr Richard Needham, British trade minister, said yesterday: 'The British Export Credits Guarantee Department is one of the first export credit agencies to go back on cover following the cessation of hostilities.' British officials believe that French authorities have also provided an export credit facility and that Italy has signed a trade protocol with Lebanon. Glimmer of confidence, Page 20</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (5): When is an import an acquisition? - The impact of rule changes regarding the movement of goods within the single European market is only just beginning to dawn on many UK companies / New VAT regulations ON JANUARY 1, next year, new VAT regulations come into force in the European Community, the most far-reaching changes since VAT was introduced 19 years ago. By 1997, a Community-wide system will be in place, but in the meantime, the new regulations bridge the gap between the 1997 rules and the current national VAT systems. This is one step along the road to creating a single market of 380m consumers. In effect, the 1993 changes abolish fiscal and physical border controls. The complex paperwork presently required to import and export goods across borders will be replaced with a set of regular reports and statistics. There are three separate requirements: EC sales listings. Requirement to account for the acquisition of goods. The statistical returns, known as 'intrastat,' which record the intra-EC movement of goods. In some cases, (businesses paying more than Pounds 2m VAT a year), returns or at least VAT payments will have to made monthly instead of every three months. There will be heavy penalties for those unable to supply the information within the time limit. Although the new regulations are designed to simplify import/export work, they are likely to create more work in other quarters. They shift the focus to accounting procedures, because they ask for information which has not up to now been systematically stored. To introduce any level of automation, most existing computerised accounting systems will be affected: sales order-processing, purchase order-processing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets and inventory. Even if freight forwarders undertake to register the information, most companies will still have to cope with a substantial amount of manual collection and collation of information to submit their VAT reports. Few companies are fully prepared for the changes, which demand that all goods bought, sold or transferred between EC countries appear on VAT returns as acquisitions (imports) or despatches (exports). 'The VAT people think it's a problem for the systems people, and the systems people think it all belongs to the VAT people,' comments Richard Collier-Keywood, a tax partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand. His mission is to put a sense of urgency into companies who have done little so far to prepare. He estimates that only a tenth of those affected have begun to assess the detailed system changes, which will apply to the top 24 per cent of traders, accounting for 97 per cent of the value of all exports and imports. 'Unless they have replaced a system in the last couple of years, the vast majority of companies will still be working with national systems which have grown organically as the company has grown.' Implications are dawning The adjustment of internal, particularly bespoke systems will cause the biggest headaches, he suggests. Package suppliers can cater for the changes within their own software, and some have done so, but users have to cope with systems integration, particularly the passage and recording of data between systems. 'People are beginning to get the message,' he concludes. 'The volume of concerned phone calls is mounting as people realise the implications.' Among the points he highlights from the 50 or so pages of VAT legislation are the requirements by January 1993: Lists of VAT registration numbers of customers. EC sales listings for intra-EC export sales. Systems to recognise intra-EC imports to make them subject to the reverse VAT charge procedure and account correctly for output and input VAT. Detailed statistical returns for both imports and exports for each transaction. Ability of systems to cope with several different VAT rates (from 1997). From 1992, the new boxes 6 and 7 on the VAT return form have to be completed by importers and exporters. From 1993, the extra requirements will be added to the VAT100 form: VAT on goods acquired from other member states, and a subtotal output tax. There will be a small de minimis limit which will enable smaller companies not to submit the EC sales listing. As not all of Europe is within the EC, existing systems will have to distinguish between EC and non-EC countries. Freight forwarders and clearing agents have in the past dealt with the import/export requirements (the Single Administrative Document), so they are in a good position to help with the new data regulations. The customs authorities are ready to encourage the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) techniques to ease paperwork, and systems already exist to take advantage of this. Computing Services for Industry, a UK-based software house, has developed its CIEL/400 freight forwarding software to cope with the new regulations, producing the new Intrastat data as well as the SAD. One of Europe's largest freight forwarding operators, the Swedish-based Bilspedition group, has already licensed the system worldwide. Even if such systems relieve some of the administrative overhead, most companies will have to retrain and re-deploy staff. Inevitably the change means considering introducing new systems, or augmenting existing ones by downloading new data. In making the changes, users and software developers who have invested in flexible development tools (software engineering) will begin to see the payoff. Their systems should be more forgiving of such major additions and changes. But even the best-prepared will have to be quick on their feet to comply. Some countries, namely Greece and Italy, have not even produced draft legislation, and by July, only Denmark and Ireland had ratified their laws. For details on the Single Market, see page 6.

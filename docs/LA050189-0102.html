			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECORD BEARS WRIGHT PRAISE FOR VIDEO TIED TO WIFE'S JOB  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright inserted into the Congressional Record a glowing  endorsement of a privately produced home video program at a time when his wife  was drawing a $36,000 salary from the company that was marketing the video.  </P> <P> The praise for the Pacific Institute's family video series was inserted into  the record on Dec. 9, 1985, and was later used in promotional material for the  company's sales force. Wright's statement does not mention his wife's  employment at the Seattle firm that sells motivational tapes and programs,  primarily to corporate clients.  </P> <P> In the endorsement, Wright calls the marketing of the video "a heartening  development indeed" and notes that the series is "available at a nominal price  within the range of most American families."  </P> <P> The existence of the Congressional Record endorsement was first disclosed in  today's editions of The Wall Street Journal.  </P> <P> Any member of Congress is free to insert material into the Congressional  Record. But the rules generally bar any member from receiving benefits "which  would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position in the  Congress."  </P> <P> The guidelines also caution lawmakers not to become "too closely affiliated  with a particular enterprise" to prevent the appearance that the rule is being  broken.  </P> <P> The latest revelation comes at a time when Wright is battling a series of  ethics charges brought by the House Ethics Committee.  </P></p>

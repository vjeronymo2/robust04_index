Assistant First State Minister for Political Affairs An  Kyong-chin and Second State Minister for Political Affairs Chong  Chin-yong changed places as a result of the recent discovery  that An is a brother-in-law of First State Minister for  Political Affairs So Chong-won.    An, who is seven years older than his new boss, married So's  elder sister while he was in the Home Affairs Ministry. So was  then studying politics and diplomacy at Chungang University.    Born in Wonju, Kangwon Province, An served as deputy  governor  of Kangwon and director-general of the civil defense  headquarters before settling in at the Ministry of Political  Affairs I in 1991.    He said he had never dreamed his brother-in-law, a  Democratic  Liberal Party lawmaker and close aide to President Kim Yong-sam,  would become his superior.    The "too-close-for-comfort" partnership lasted 15 days,  until  An was made to change seats with Chong of the Ministry of  Political Affairs II on Wednesday.    "Never was there a case when brothers-in-law worked in the  same office with the superiority order reversed," a ministry  official noted, adding that although An had reason to be  uncomfortable he did not show it.</p>

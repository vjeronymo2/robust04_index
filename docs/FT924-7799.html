			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Fresh setback for industry: Manufacturing output down CBI forecasts regional declines THE weakened state of Britain's manufacturers, shown in official figures yesterday, gave a fresh warning to the government that it faces an uphill struggle to revive the economy through the package of measures unveiled in the Autumn Statement. Manufacturing output fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, reversing the modest improvement in the sector's fortunes in the first six months of the year. More gloom came from a survey by the Confederation of British Industry which said manufacturing output was expected to fall in every UK region over the next four months, except for the north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside. The news came as figures released by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) showed the Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation - the retail prices index less mortgage interest payments - fell to a year-on-year level of 3.8 per cent in October, the lowest figure since March 1988. This gave the government fresh evidence that inflationary pressures are extremely slight, providing the basis for what it hopes will be a slow recovery next year. Yesterday's indications about economic weakness appear to justify the growth package unveiled by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as part of Thursday's Autumn Statement. The package included 1 percentage point off interest rates from yesterday and other measures to inject Pounds 1bn into the economy by next April. The officially inspired reduction in bank base rates to 7 per cent led to a fresh spate of cuts in mortgage interest rates. Woolwich, the third biggest building society, cut its basic mortgage rate by 0.75 percentage points to 8.55 per cent, while two other societies - Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester - also shaved their borrowing rates. Together with other economic data released in recent weeks, the manufacturing figures from the CSO suggest that total UK output, excluding oil and gas, may have dropped slightly between the second and third quarters, after an 0.1 per cent increase between the second and third three-month periods. The CSO is releasing a provisional estimate for third quarter GDP next week. According to government statisticians, the best estimate of the year-on-year growth rate of manufacturing output is that it is flat. A month ago, the CSO was slightly more confident, saying manufacturers appeared to be increasing production by a modest 0.5 per cent per year. Manufacturing output - which accounts for just over a fifth of the economy but strongly influences other sectors such as services - has so far dropped by 7.5 per cent since the start of the recession around the second quarter of 1990. The Treasury said the fall in factory output was 'disappointing'. However, it was cheered by the news on inflation, which brought the underlying measure comfortably within Mr Lamont's 1-4 per cent target range.

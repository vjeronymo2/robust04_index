			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MEANING OF ROE VS. WADE'  </P> <P> By complaining of the Los Angeles Police Department's handling of recent  abortion protests relative to its actions against homeless people and Hispanic  day laborers, Councilwoman Gloria Molina seems to be assuming some sort of  political motives on the part of the department (Metro, March 9). I am not an  official apologist for the department, but as a seven-year veteran I feel  qualified to comment.  </P> <P> Be they protesters or day laborers, those who block sidewalks and entrances to  businesses are committing a misdemeanor, a fact which limits our authority to  take action. Put simply, we can only enforce the laws in these situations after  a complaint from a victim. In the case of the day laborers, the LAPD responded  to complaints from merchants and residents who found the day laborers littering  and urinating on their property. Any citizen has the right to ask the police to  prevent such activity.  </P> <P> The abortion protesters, however, were seeking a confrontation with the police  as a means to gain public attention for their cause. The operators of the  clinics realized this and chose not to have the police intervene and generate  publicity for the protesters. If they choose to request assistance in the  future, the LAPD will enforce the laws without regard to the ideology of either  side.  </P> <P> DANIEL HORAN  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

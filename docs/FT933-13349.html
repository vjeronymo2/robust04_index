			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Roadshow aims to help industry 'pick winners' THE GOVERNMENT is to send a research and development roadshow around the country this autumn to drum up support among industrialists and academics for the science and technology white paper it published in May. The roadshow is the first stage in establishing a Technology Foresight Programme, intended to make recommendations on which areas of research and development companies should concentrate. The programme's findings will also be used to direct grants by research councils, such as the Medical Research Council, and may affect product standards and regulations. Mr Grahame Walshe, head of the technology foresight unit at the Office of Science and Technology, said the intention was 'to maximise the possibility that industry will pick (technological) winners'. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, warned the government that 'winner picking' should be conducted by industry, not the government. Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, said at a CBI workshop on the white paper yesterday that the roadshow 'will be used to explain the concept of foresight and to develop a commitment to the programme across all sectors of the community'. The Focus on Foresight seminars are scheduled for September and October in England, and will take place in Manchester; the Midlands; Swindon, Wiltshire; and London. There will also be seminars in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Industrialists, academics, consumer bodies and the public sector will be invited, Mr Waldegrave said. He added: 'We need to build (a) more intimate, regular and structured contact between the scientist and engineer at the bench and the industrialist. This will enable us to tap into the expertise of people closest to emerging scientific, technological and market developments.' In the next few weeks the government will appoint panels of experts in areas such as chemicals and information technology. The panels, which will be the core of the technology foresight programme, will next year identify 'generic technologies' - those with the potential to be used across a variety of products and processes - that British industry is in a good position to exploit. The panels will probably publish recommendations on developments over 10-year and 20-year time scales. Industrialists at the CBI workshop generally welcomed the move, but others warned that the search for promising technologies should not be limited to the UK.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AILING ATLANTA DOORS AND WINDOWS LOCKS UP STORES  </P> <P> The retail stores of Atlanta Doors and Windows were locked Monday as the  apparently financially troubled Orange County door and window manufacturing  company prepared to seek the protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  </P> <P> Ira Katz, lawyer for the San Juan Capistrano-based firm that has retail outlets  in Orange and Laguna Hills, said the company planned today to file for  protection from its creditors and reorganize operations under Chapter 11 of the  Federal Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> "It is the intention of the company to continue operating and do the best it  can within the limits of the bankruptcy law for its creditors," Katz said.  </P> <P> Katz declined to give any more information about the company or its financial  condition. County records show that the firm, which makes fashionable French  doors and other expensive doors, has been doing business as Atlanta Doors and  Windows since Feb. 1, 1987.  </P> <P> Among its founders was Keith Powell, a Laguna Hills resident who was formerly  president of the Los Angeles-based Federated Group, the struggling home  consumer electronics chain bought by Atari Corp in 1987 for $67 million.  </P> <P> Kathy Powell said Monday that her husband Keith is a financial partner in the  door and window business. "We are definitely not going out of business," she  said.  </P> <P> Robert Edward Allen, president of the company, declined comment when reached at  his El Toro home.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, customers of the company were distressed to find Monday that phones  were disconnected or unanswered at various business locations of Atlanta Doors  and no representative of the firm was around to answer questions.  </P> <P> "I'm a customer, and they have about $3,200 of my money as a deposit for doors  and windows," said Phil Bonesteele, a computer programmer for a software  company in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Bonesteele said he was told that new windows would be installed at his Tustin  home at 9 a.m. Monday morning. When no one arrived, he tried in vain to call  the company. Bonesteele said he and his wife got worried and drove to the store  in Laguna Hills, only to find that the door was locked and a sign said it was  closed for inventory. Moreover, he said, there were six other anxious customers  standing at the door.  </P> <P> "It looks like the company just vaporized overnight," he said.  </P> <P> Besides the stores in Laguna Hills and Orange, the company had another outlet  in the Mission Viejo Mall that it closed about six months ago, a mall spokesman  said.  </P></p>

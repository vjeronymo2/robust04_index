			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Line will be drawn between past and future LLOYD'S IS to create a new reinsurance company in an ambitious effort to control a tide of claims from old US liability insurance policies. NewCo, as it is referred to in the plan, will provide the 'strongest practical ring fence' around billions of dollars in potential US asbestosis and pollution-related claims, insulating new investors from these claims and allowing Names trapped in 'open years' to leave the market. If successful, the new company will allow Lloyd's to 'draw a line' between the market's past and its future. The plan warns, however, that 'no-one should underestimate the difficulties associated with restructuring'. Lloyd's hopes to reinsure all insurance policies underwritten before 1985 with the company, into which it will put more than Pounds 4bn of reserves from its premium trust funds (into which syndicates pay premiums). Lloyd's will generate capital for the vehicle by 'discounting' these reserves. At present syndicates set aside the full value of each claim in the year it is reported, though it may not be paid out for many years. If these reserves were discounted to their present value - without taking into account the value of future investment income - some of them would be freed to be used as capital. The plan says Lloyd's could supplement this by transferring funds from the central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations. The new company, registered in the UK, should start business by the end of 1995. In time Lloyd's will consider distributing shares in it to the Names who contribute their reserves to it at its formation. Before Lloyd's transfers reserves and capital to the new company it will need to make sure all syndicates trading on the market have put aside reserves on the same basis - the syndicates currently apply different reserving formulas. Lloyd's will create a central database, define a common methodology for setting aside reserves and carry out an 'independent scrutiny of syndicate reserves'. Some members of syndicates which have not reserved enough could be faced with further cash calls. Lloyd's will 'set up flexible arrangements to help them manage their payments. We will not insist on calling all of the payment in cash immediately'. The plan fixes on 1985 as a cut-off date because all material North American asbestosis and long-term pollution exposures stem from 1985 and prior years. It was also the last year in which liability policies were widely underwritten on 'occurrence' wording, in which the relevant policy for a claim is the one in force when the event occurred rather than when a claim is made - as in the newer 'claims made' wording. Most asbestosis and pollution claims were made on these older policies. Syndicates would be able to close any years of account left open because of uncertainty over these claims.</p>

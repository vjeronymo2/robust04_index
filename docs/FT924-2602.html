			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Novo Profits of the Novo Group, a provider of inventory management, storage and distribution services to the film and television industries, rose from Pounds 529,000 to Pounds 653,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30. The 23 per cent improvement came from turnover little changed at Pounds 5.97m after stripping out contributions last time from discontinued operations. Earnings dipped to 2.48p (3.8p) per share because of a greater number of shares in issue and a higher tax charge of Pounds 191,000 (Pounds 38,000). However, the company is returning to the dividend list via an interim of 0.3p. Directors expect to pay a 'significantly higher' final.</p>

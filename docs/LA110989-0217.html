The 10 defendants were charged with  conspiracy to defraud and are scheduled to appear before City of London  Magistrates Court on Friday, police said.  </P> <P> A Natwest division, County Natwest, was adviser for the British employment  agency Blue Arrow in its 1987 bid for Manpower Inc., a much larger U.S.  employment company.  </P> <P> When a $1.3-billion stock sale to finance the bid flopped, County Natwest  allegedly obscured how much of the stock was left in the investment firms'  hands.  </P></p>

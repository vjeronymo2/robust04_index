			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON WINS ANOTHER BARN BURNER  </P> <P> The past three weeks of Fullerton College football have taught fans one lesson:  don't leave early.  </P> <P> Fullerton trailed by 13 points entering the fourth quarter Saturday night, but  rallied in the final 5 minutes 37 seconds for a 24-23 victory over Golden West  in a Mission Conference game at Orange Coast.  </P> <P> A nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eric Robinson to fullback Don  Norris with 43 seconds left tied it at 23-23. Eric Lange then drilled the extra  point and Fullerton led, 24-23.  </P> <P> Golden West got the ball at its 30 on the ensuing kickoff, but turned the ball  over on downs and Fullerton (6-1, 5-1) ran out the final 16 seconds.  </P> <P> This was the third consecutive week Fullerton has been involved in a wild  fourth-quarter finish. Two weeks ago, Fullerton scored 22 points in the final  5:36 to defeat El Camino, 31-24, after being behind, 24-9.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, Fullerton held a 29-17 lead, only to watch Saddleback score 14  points in the final 5:21 for a 31-29 victory.  </P> <P> "I getting too old for this," said Hal Sherbeck, Fullerton College coach who is  in his 30th season.  </P> <P> Fullerton's comeback started when Golden West quarterback David Brunet fumbled  an exchange from center and the ball was recovered by defensive lineman Steve  Griggs at the Golden West 34 with about eight minutes to play.  </P> <P> Six plays later, Brian Williams scored on a one-yard run and the Golden West  lead was cut to 23-17. Golden West then had to punt after three plays, and  Fullerton started the winning drive at its own 31 with 4:20 left. The Hornets  went 69 yards in nine plays including a 23-yard and a nine-yard screen pass  from Robinson to John Mountain.  </P> <P> Golden West (5-2, 4-2) won't have to go far to find what would have made the  difference in the outcome. Kicker Wayne Duplantis, who tied the state and  national record with five field goals last Saturday, missed a 31-yard field  goal attempt and an extra point in the first half. Golden West also failed on a  two-point conversion try in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Frank Vaccaro had an 89-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and Golden  West led, 9-0, at the half. He led all rushers with 136 yards in 15 carries.  </P> <P> Fullerton rallied for 10 consecutive points early in the third quarter, but  Brunet came back with two touchdown passes as Golden West built a 13-point  lead. He completed a 22-yarder to Troy Walker, who made a diving catch in the  end zone to put Golden West up, 15-10, with 2:06 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> With 48 seconds left in the third quarter, Brunet hooked up with Robert Bedford  for an 18-yard screen pass for a touchdown. Brunet completed the two-point  conversion pass to Jake Witherspoon to give the Rustlers a 23-10 lead.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Low prices for colour LCDs Buyers of notebook computers now expect colour liquid crystal displays. The leading technology - active Thin Film Transistor (TFT) - gives excellent performance but at a high price: TFT displays cost at least Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 800) each, even when ordered in large numbers. Electronics companies are therefore racing to develop cheaper LCDs without sacrificing too much contrast and speed. Hitachi of Japan has a range of new displays, based on the passive Super Twisted Nematic technology used conventionally for monochrome LCDs. Their contrast ratio is only 25:1, compared with almost 100:1 for TFT, and their response time is 0.27 sec rather than 0.05 sec. But the company says this performance is more than adequate for applications where a low price is paramount. Hitachi's new displays cost about Dollars 600 each for bulk orders.

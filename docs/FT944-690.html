			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Call for probe into N Electric share price Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, yesterday urged the Stock Exchange to investigate the unbroken increase in the price of Northern Electric shares in the weeks following a meeting between Trafalgar House, now a hostile bidder for the company, and Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator. In a letter to Mr Michael Lawrence, the chief executive of the Stock Exchange, Mr Foster writes: 'It appears to me that it is beyond the bounds of coincidence that the shares should gain in price every day after the conclusion of that meeting.' Trafalgar House and some of its advisers met Prof Littlechild on November 25 and the conglomerate confirmed on December 14 that it was considering a bid for the north-east of England's regional electricity company. Between those two dates, Northern's share price closed higher each trading day. It rose from 787p on November 25 to open at 910p on December 14, closing 100p higher, after the announcement. Mr Foster points out that in the four days preceding the meeting, the shares fell each day. 'In the circumstances I firmly believe the public are entitled to an explanation that can only be given if an immediate investigation is carried out by the Stock Exchange Council.' On December 15, Northern Electric asked for an exchange inquiry into the movement in its share price before the Trafalgar announcement. Yesterday the exchange said the investigation launched at the rec's request was continuing. Trafalgar House and the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer), of which Prof Littlechild is the head, both declined to comment on Mr Foster's observation about the share price movement.</p>

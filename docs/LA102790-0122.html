			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UNSEALS KEATING GRAND JURY TESTIMONY;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: DEFENDANTS IN THE SECURITIES FRAUD CASE CLAIMED IT WOULD HURT THEIR  CHANCE OF A FAIR TRIAL.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County judge Friday ordered the public release of nearly 4,500  pages of grand jury testimony that led to the state securities fraud indictment  of former thrift magnate Charles H. Keating Jr. and three co-defendants.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito rejected a defense request to keep the  documents secret. The testimony, transcripts of which will be released next  Friday, provides the basis for the 42-count indictment against the former  operators of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, said after the hearing that he did not  plan to appeal Ito's ruling. Defense attorneys had argued that release of the  transcripts could hurt their clients' ability to get a fair trial. All the  defendants have pleaded not guilty.  </P> <P> Meantime, though, Neal said he would be willing to talk to federal authorities  about limited immunity for his client in exchange for Keating's testimony  before the Senate Ethics Committee, which is investigating the conduct of five  senators who intervened on Keating's behalf.  </P> <P> "I certainly would receive or return a phone call" from ethics committee  members, Neal said. His comments came in the wake of an article in The Times  this week revealing that the committee had considered offering Keating immunity  in exchange for testimony against the senators, including Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.).  </P> <P> The committee has denied that it ever discussed granting immunity for Keating,  an act that would severely damage a federal criminal investigation into one of  the nation's biggest thrift disasters. Lincoln's collapse in April, 1989, is  expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> In court Friday, defense attorneys argued that the release of grand jury  testimony from 94 witnesses would fuel further damaging publicity in the case,  provide one-sided stories on the prosecution's claims and limit the number of  potential jurors who have not been influenced by continued news reports.  </P> <P> Lawyers for The Times and the Orange County Register argued that any stories  arising out of the release of the transcripts would constitute only an  incremental increase in the amount of information on the case.  </P> <P> Ito pointed out that The Times has been putting Lincoln stories in the business  section, "which frankly not a lot of people read." He found that the defense  failed to provide enough facts showing that release of the grand jury  transcripts would prejudice the defendants' right to a fair trial.  </P></p>

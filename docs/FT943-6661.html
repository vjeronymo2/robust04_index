			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Russia seeks more timeto repay its Pounds 51bn debt The Russian government is trying to find a radical long-term solution to its Dollars 80bn (Pounds 51.6bn) foreign debt burden as its budget is stretched to the limit, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's economics minister, said yesterday. In a wide-ranging statement on economic policy, Mr Shokhin hinted that Russia would seek a more generous time-scale for debt repayments, and raised the possibility of reintroducing price controls covering such areas as electricity, gas and transport. However, he insisted this should not be seen as a return to central planning. Mr Shokhin, who as head of the debt negotiation team has repeatedly confirmed Russia's intention of meeting its obligations, said the problem was not the size of future repayments but the short period into which they were compressed. Despite a rescheduling earlier this year, Russia faces repayments of more than Dollars 20bn next year. His comments confirm that there are mounting pressure on government finances as companies struggle to pay taxes because of a massive accumulation of inter-enterprise debts. The problem is so acute that the government has failed to pay thousands of state employees, prompting unrest across the country. In Vladivostok yesterday, hundreds of women and children picketed the headquarters of the Pacific fleet. Some claimed their families had received no pay since April. Mr Shokhin forecast that seasonal factors might push up inflation this autumn to 10 per cent a month from the average of 4-5 per cent a month that has recently been achieved. But economic plans being drawn up for next year envisaged a budget deficit of 5 per cent and a monthly inflation rate of 3 per cent by the year-end, he said. He also cautioned against the government running up potentially huge debts through guaranteeing the promissory notes which are seen as a means of alleviating Russia's inter-enterprise debt crisis. The reintroduction of some price controls, he suggested, could lessen the problem, which has risen to the top of the political agenda. The government is drawing up six presidential decrees to generate more domestic private investment. Mr Shokhin estimated that Russia had Rbs30,000bn (Pounds 9bn) of private savings. Mr Oleg Davydov, minister for foreign economic relations, suggested Russia should seek partial debt forgiveness from foreign creditors, but was publicly rebuked by Mr Shokhin. Russian officials say former Soviet client states, which collectively owe Russia Dollars 147bn, are paying only Dollars 2bn a year compared with their annual obligations of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn. In an interview in Trud newspaper yesterday, Mr Boris Yeltsin said the danger of Russian disintegration had passed, but called on Russia's regional leaders to stimulate economic reform. 'Economic problems are being decided more and more. . . by how the political leaders of a region can succeed in creating a business climate and conditions for the stable and reliable development of a regional economy,' he said.</p>

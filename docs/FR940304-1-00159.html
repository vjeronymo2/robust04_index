			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dioxide (CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total estimated CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction would be 39 million tons. During this time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the peak annual reduction of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions that are expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted by powerplants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 48 million tons; 56 million tons; 65 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons; and 71 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these levels is 0.12 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 12.74 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in oil imports are estimated to be 21.33, 32.68, 51.88, and 63.07 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrels, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conventional ovens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 5 for amended conventional oven standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.88  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that all conventional ovens will not have an oven door window and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased and improved insulation, convection and an oven separator, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced thermal mass and conduction losses. Additionally, electric ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be biradiant, and gas ovens would incorporate an electronic ignition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years and 15.7 years for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the gas and electric representative classes is roughly equal to the 19-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product life and ranges up to 55 years for other classes. At this standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level, all classes have increased life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for conventional ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for conventional ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 4 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.69 quads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 287,000 tons and 239,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.15 and 0.12 percent, respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 187 million tons, or 0.20 percent, over the forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 7.5 years and 4.9 years for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative gas and electric classes, respectively, with a payback no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher than 10.4 years, or roughly half of the 19-year product life, for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost for the electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative class and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of approximately $53 for that class. Life-cycle cost savings are $26 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the gas representative class and are positive for all other classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the standard is expected to have almost no impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

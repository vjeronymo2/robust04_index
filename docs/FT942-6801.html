			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / MFN Renewal for China: Human rights groups denounce 'hypocritical' US Human rights groups reacted angrily to the decision to extend China's most favoured nation trading status, accusing Mr Clinton of removing all pressure on the Chinese to improve their human rights practices. 'Clinton has left his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed, uncompromising, and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by this decision,' said Ms Sidney Jones, the executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. The consensus view among western officials in Beijing is that the administration bungled the mfn-human rights issue from the start by insisting on linkage and has suffered embarrassment as a consequence. 'The lesson here for a young and inexperienced American president when dealing with the dragon throne is that you better be prepared and have a carefully-thought-out strategy,' said one diplomat. Western officials expressed concern that China's apparent 'victory' on the vexed mfn issue would strengthen the hands of hardliners in the leadership who advocate an uncompromising stance on human rights. American business in China welcomed the decision. Mr Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, predicted that 'a lot of deals with be concluded' and that US trade deficit with China would shrink. Sino-US two-way trade reached Dollars 40.3bn (Pounds 26.8bn) last year, an increase of 21.8 per cent over the year before. The balance in China's favour reached Dollars 22.8bn, a 25.3 per cent jump over 1992. Human Rights Watch/Asia warned that the MFN decision left 'outspoken intellectuals, workers, and religious activists' more vulnerable to persecution and arrest 'given that Chinese leaders understand that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade'. It said that in spite of claims to the contrary by the administration, severe restriction remained on Chinese emigration; exports of prison-made goods continued; no agreement had been reached on Red Cross access to Chinese prisons; and 'no progress' had been made in curbing human rights abuses in Tibet. The group called on Congress to authorise Mr Clinton to raise tariffs on all exports from China by 10 per cent across the board. 'This would not destroy US-China trade, but it would require China to pay a significant price for not fulfilling conditions laid down last year for mfn renewal.'</p>

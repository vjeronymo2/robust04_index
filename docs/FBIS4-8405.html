			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alija Izetbegovic of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency received Butrus-Ghali's special  envoy Jasushi Akashi, and General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville  de Lapresle, UN commander for the former Yugoslavia. The talks,  which were attended by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Commander General  Rasim Delic, concerned the difficult situation in Gorazde.    Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic  said after the talks:    I expressed to Mr. Akashi the readiness of our side to halt  the fighting throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina on condition that the  attacks on Gorazde cease. The Serbs [words indistinct] have to  withdraw to the positions of 30 March, and then the political  talks can start. An arrangement has to be reached that the  cease-fire agreement does not turn into the freezing of the Serb  occupation. There can be no political talks while the population  is being killed. These are our conditions, and Mr. Akashi  expressed understanding for our position. We stand available to  Mr. Akashi and his [word indistinct] to continue the talks in  order to achieve a cease-fire around Gorazde as soon as possible.    President Izetbegovic stressed the cooperativeness between  the Bosnia-Herzegovina side and the UN, and said that, if the  aggressor failed to show cooperativeness himself, decisive  action against the Serb side was expected from the UN. This  implies energetic [word indistinct] of air power against Serb  equipment in and around Gorazde.    Expressing his satisfaction and honor at meeting President  Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Army General Delic,  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Akashi said:    We agreed at the talks that the situation in Gorazde  requires  special attention. I understand very well now the position of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Based on these talks I will  now be going to hold talks with the Serb side in accordance with  our constant efforts to find common ground for reaching a just  solution. Asked by the reporters whether he had already  contacted Karadzic and whether there were indications that the  Serb side would agree to talks, Akashi said: I will try and  meet Karadzic as soon as possible. I do not think that anyone  should refuse to talk to the peacekeepers from the United  Nations. Asked whether there would be further air strikes  against the Serb positions in Gorazde, Akashi said that this  depended on the development of the situation. If our staff and  the staff of the humanitarian organizations come under attack or  are exposed to direct threats, and if there is a threat to  Gorazde as a safe haven, then the United Nations will draw the  relevant conclusions and can ask for close air support from  NATO. I think that enough restraint will be shown, and that we  will not be placed in that situation. We have carried out close  air support action twice already, and I think that this is  enough. I think that this should be enough for reasonable and  realistic people. This is what Butrus-Ghali's special envoy  Yasushi Akashi said.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Fishermen turn ones that got away into profit: New markets are allowing fleets to expand their capacity despite government efforts This summer's 'tuna wars' in the Bay of Biscay have left an impression of a struggling British fishing fleet being forced to fight for new markets to stay afloat. The Royal Navy's arrest yesterday of a British-owned but Spanish-based trawler suspected of exceeding its quota was the latest skirmish in an increasingly bitter battle. Declining fish stocks and tight quotas imposed under the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy have restricted supplies in traditional waters and driven fishermen to new species in hostile territory. But the image of an industry in terminal decline is far from representative of the UK fleet. Fleet capacity has grown by 1 per cent to 2 per cent a year in two years, and fishermen in some regions are benefiting from lucrative new markets. When the government launched a Pounds 25m three-year decommissioning programme last year it attracted most interest from north-east and north-west England and northern Ireland. An official said: 'That's probably a good indicator of where the industry is really being squeezed.' Higher bids for grants, which the government rejected, came mainly from Scotland and south-west England. These more buoyant fleets are exploiting new outlets in continental Europe. Spanish fishermen may be objects of hate in Cornish fishing villages, but the Spanish taste for monkfish and megrim, a flatfish, has proved a godsend for Scottish fishermen in the past few years. Mr Ian MacSween, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Organisation, a body which promotes the interests of the fishing community, said fishermen off the west coast of Scotland would have been 'wiped out' if they had to rely on traditional catches. Monkfish used to be thrown back, or turned into scampi. 'Now the monkfish are worth more than the scampi.' The tuna caught in the Bay of Biscay go mainly to France and Spain. Mr MacSween believes the real cause of Spanish resentment at Cornish boats is that they are catching tuna for sale in Spain and undermining prices because the Spanish drift nets mark the fish and reduce their value. Scotland is Europe's biggest producer of langoustine, yet they are caught for export and most Britons are unaware of the delicacy on their doorstep. These new markets have enabled the best-placed fishermen to invest in more powerful boats and tackle, which they need to exploit more distant waters. Financial imperative then drives them harder. A new boat can cost as much as Pounds 300,000 and weekly running costs are Pounds 1,000 or more. But technological advances in fishing also threaten the stocks the fishermen depend on. Mr MacSween said: 'We're getting better at catching the fish, but they're not getting more efficient at breeding.' The fleet's staying power is causing problems for the government, which seems unlikely to be able to keep its pledge to cut fleet capacity by nearly a fifth by the end of 1996 as part of a European Union drive to conserve fish. Part of the problem is that quotas are broken. Officials say there are not enough fish to provide a decent living for the UK's 10,000 vessels. But estimates of the number of so-called 'black' fish - caught over and above quota - range as high as 50 per cent of the legitimate catch. In a further blow to its efforts, the government was forced to suspend its controversial plan to limit days at sea after a High Court challenge by fishermen last year. That leaves it having to mop up capacity through tighter licensing of vessels, decommissioning and the possible introduction of bigger mesh sizes and closed fishing zones, to allow immature or breeding fish to escape capture. Officials say the trend towards increased capacity appears to be reversing, but they admit that the fleet remains obstinately resistant to restructuring. There has been little concentration of ownership in the past decade and the number of vessels has remained fairly constant, with most still owned and run by individuals. Mr MacSween believes market forces will fail to drive fishermen out of the industry, in spite of overcapacity. 'As long as you're getting a marginal return on your investment, it's better to keep going than to scrap your boat,' he said. 'There's no demand for a redundant fishing vessel.'</p>

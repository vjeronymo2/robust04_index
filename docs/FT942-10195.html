			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Bosnian Serbs threaten advance Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday signalled that his forces might move to widen their land corridor, renewing fears of an escalation in the fighting around the Serb town of Brcko, north-eastern Bosnia. The statement followed UN confirmation of a Moslem attack on Brcko on Tuesday night which killed three people. As the Bosnian Serb assembly met for the second day in Brcko, Mr Karadzic said: 'The corridor must be strategically deep enough to defend.' His remarks heightened fear of clashes because the corridor is 6km wide and not thought of as 'defensible'. He warned that the 'criminal behaviour of the Moslems and Croats' will make the 'Serbs cede much less land than they hope for'. Last night Bosnian Serbs accused the Moslems of a new attack on Brcko while two separate artillery attacks were launched on the Moslem town of Tuzla, killing two people and wounding five.</p>

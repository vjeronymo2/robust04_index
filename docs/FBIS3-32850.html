			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] More than two months before the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion in Chiapas, the 25  October PROCESO carried a 23 September letter to the editor from  the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ), denying any  involvement in earlier Chiapas guerrilla activities. Such  guerrilla activity had been alleged by Jesuit priest Mardonio  Morales in the 13 September issue of the magazine (for this and  related reports, see the 9 December FBIS LATIN AMERICA DAILY  REPORT). The OCEZ letter also criticizes high-level officials  who prior to beginning their government careers were involved in  leftist political activities in Chiapas during the 1970's.    The letter asserts that since its formation in 1982 the OCEZ  has operated entirely within the law in its struggle for land  and in its organizing activities throughout Chiapas. It also  acknowledges that the group that eventually became the OCEZ had  had political ties with a Maoist group, the Popular Line (which  later became the Proletarian Line), or so-called "northerners,"  during the period March-August 1978. The letter concedes that  "we dealt with Adolfo Orive, Javier Gil, and another two dozen  `cadres' who came to Chiapas to develop `support bases'" but  claims that in the course of our dealings "we discovered serious  contradictions between their radical phraseology and their  actual behavior, most notably: their great waste of economic  resources, their unusual links with public officials, a  so-called `two-faced policy,' a disguised pro-government  approach, manipulation and immorality--all of which clashed with  our viewpoints and principles and prompted us to break relations  with them." In addition, the letter denies that the OCEZ ever  sought to penetrate the Church to increase its influence, as  charged by Father Mardonio.    The letter's criticism of the northern organizers' integrity  touches on an issue already raised in the press: the  government's reported efforts to recruit leftists for government  service. The 13 September PROCESO report itself, for instance,  asserts that while Orive had been a professor in the School of  Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where  he founded the Popular Line and Proletarian Line groups, he has  since gone on to serve as current training director of the  ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)-affiliated  National Peasant Confederation (CNC) and as a director of the  National Solidarity Program (Pronasol) as well as adviser to  Pronasol Coordinator Carlos Rojas Gutierrez. The letter also  implicitly criticizes former Popular Line leader Hugo Andres  Araujo de la Torre, who is identified as a PRI federal deputy  and CNC secretary general by Father Mardonio in the 13 September  PROCESO report. A 7 September 1992 PROCESO article on political  recruitment had described the careers of Orive (written there as  "Oribe," but clearly referring to the same person) and Araujo,  adding that the latter "had passed through almost the entire  gamut of organizations on the left, ranging from radical Maoists  to the...Popular Action Movement." A 9 December 1991 PROCESO  article had identified Araujo as sharing a "compadre," or  godparent, relationship with President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari.</p>

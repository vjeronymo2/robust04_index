			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter He Chong (6320 3095)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Sino-U.S.  textiles talks are to be held in Beijing between 15 and 17  January. This is probably going to be a final showdown  negotiation. Because the United States suddenly announced 10  days before the talks that as of 17 January the United States  will unilaterally cut quotas for 88 kinds of textiles and  garments imported from China by 25 to 35 percent (worth about  $1.2 billion to 2 billion) and China also announced that it  would take retaliatory action accordingly, if these negotiations  fall through, a trade war may break out immediately.    The chance of success of these negotiations is fifty-fifty,  because the United States, in breach of the international  practice, brandished the big stick of hegemonism and used the  so-called "anti-malpractice sections" in its domestic law to try  to deal a head-on blow at China from the very beginning and  overpower China even before the talks begin. But China is not a  weakling and is unlikely to give in to U.S. pressure. If the  United States unilaterally cuts import quotas for China's  textiles, China will retaliate by stopping or reducing the  purchase of U.S. agricultural and industrial products.    The previous textiles agreement with China expired at the  end  of last year. In order to reach a new agreement, the two sides  talked three times, in September, November, and December last  year, all of which came to nothing. During the talks, the U.S.  side kept accusing the Chinese side of "deliberately" selling  textiles and garments to the United States by "illegal  transshipment" via third countries or regions and, in the  meantime, using others' import quotas, which took up  approximately one third of the total value. But China kept  denying these groundless accusations. In its opinion,  Chinese-made textiles transported o the United States via Hong  Kong, Taiwan, and Honduras were nothing but transit goods of  those regions or export goods that had been processed in those  regions. They were not directly connected with China, nor were  they exported by China through "illegal transshipment." China  also demanded the United States produce evidence of "illegal  transshipment." In answer to this demand, U.S. personnel  spot-checked Chinese agency companies to the United States in  New York, only to find no evidence. Later, the United States  even demanded that China allow U.S. Customs to send personnel to  the relevant factories in China for "spot investigation." This  unjustifiable infringement of sovereignty was, of course, flatly  refused by China. After all that, in order to please its own  textile and garment manufacturers, the U.S. Government still  ignored international practice and announced unilateral  reduction of import quotas for Chinese textiles.    An official of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation pointed out: The United States'  unilaterally slashing quotas for China's textiles imported to  America is in violation of international and bilateral  agreements. According to the new agreement concluded at the  Uruguay round of talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, the textile import quota system of relevant countries  will be removed by stages within 10 years to make free trade  possible. But the United States is now using quotas to pressure  other countries with double strength. Obviously, by so doing  the United States ignores the spirit of the international  agreement, violates the provision of the "Multifiber Agreement"  that the importer concerned can increase its import volume by 6  percent each year, and does not comply with the principle that  any dispute between importer and exporter shall be brought to  the "Textiles Supervision Institution" for arbitration.    According to a commentary in "Wall Street Journal" of the  United States, this textile trade conflict between China and the  United States "is obviously largely caused by the protectionist  fever of the U.S. bureaucracy, rather than any wrong doing on  the part of the Chinese Government." According to analysis, the  United States is pressuring China on the issue of textiles not  only to obtain the privilege for sending a "spot-check team" to  China, but also to launch a skirmish to aid the decision on the  extension, or otherwise, of most-favored-nation status for China  in June this year to put additional pressure on China to open  its market to the United States.    China, on the other hand, is prepared for two situations.  First, it expressed willingness to cooperate with the United  States in preventing the problem of "illegal transshipments."  It also agreed to the United States sending a representative to  Beijing to help China investigate the exportation of textiles to  the United States by nongovernmental trading companies. But  under the principle of safeguarding state sovereignty, China  categorically refused to let the United States send a spot-check  team to China. In the meantime, China is also prepared for the  worst. Once the talks break down and the United States cuts  import quotas, it will announce specific retaliatory measures.    If a trade war breaks out between China and the United  States, Hong Kong will bear the brunt. According to an estimate  by a Hong Kong businessman, a large portion of the textiles and  garments exported by China to the United States last year, worth  a total of $4.7 billion, went through Hong Kong, while Hong Kong  manufacturers produce or process garments on the mainland and  export them via Hong Kong. Once the Sino-U.S. talks break down,  Hong Kong businessmen will suffer a lot. Similarly, U.S.  importers and retailers will also suffer major losses and  consumer interests will also be impaired.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F> for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 28 May]    [Text] 1. In an attempt to blame the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for the disruption of the  UN relief program at a time when the UN Security Council is  about to meet and when U.S. senators are in Angola, government  forces have been instructed by their General Staff to resume  clashes in sensitive areas like Malange and Bie [Cuito].    2. As reported in our previous communique, government forces  resumed clashes in the city of Bie at 1950 on 26 May 1994. The  clashes continue.    3. On 27 May 1994, government Su-22's and Su-25 bombed our  positions, using 48 bombs of 250 kg each. Self-propelled  long-range artillery units were fired in all directions, even  hitting outlaying wards.    4. The clashes were stepped up on 28 May 1994 with  government  forces trying to expel our forces and the Air Force renewing its  raids.    5. Incidents of this nature take place whenever a UN  Security  Council meeting is about to take place.    6. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] are  on alert and as usual will know how to give an appropriate  response.    [Issued] Huambo, 28 May 1994    [Signed] Army General Ben Ben, FALA chief of staff</p>

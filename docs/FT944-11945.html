			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: First National Bank posts record profits First National Bank, the South African banking group, performed strongly in the year ended September to raise pre-tax income to a record R1.1bn, up 20.9 per cent from R906.3m previously, writes Mark Suzman. Net interest income rose 13.7 per cent to R2.59bn from R2.28bn, while the charge for bad and doubtful debts edged up by only 2.2 per cent to R351.3m from R343.6. Advances increased by 18.6 per cent to R48.26bn from R40.7bn, while total assets, which include those of First Bowring and Associates for the first time, rose 15.3 per cent to R61.76bn, up from R53.6bn. Group capitalisation is at 9.1 per cent, down from 10 per cent last year but still well within the 8 per cent limit required by the Banks Act by January 1995. Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said the results reflected market gains in both home loans and credit instalment across all divisions. He said he was optimistic the good results would continue into the next year in spite of pressure on gross margins from higher interest rates.</p>

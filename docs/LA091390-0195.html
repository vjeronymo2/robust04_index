			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> NATURAL STEPS;  </P> <P> ROBIN BISIO'S ENVIRONMENTAL WORKS WILL BE PUT ON THIS WEEKEND AT THE OUTDOOR  DANCE FESTIVAL.  </P> <P> Women in flowing gray slips dance in the moonlight. Performers skip through a  flower garden in a merry promenade like elves in a child's fairy tale. Four  dancers, their bodies buried in sand, their faces covered by seaweed, slowly  emerge from the beach in a representation of Genesis.  </P> <P> All three of these dances were choreographed around and rely upon their  environment. "We feel the outdoor sites are beautiful sources of artistic  information and inspiration," said choreographer and dancer Robin Bisio of the  Cormorant Dance Foundation. The three numbers will be performed this weekend as  part of the Santa Barbara Outdoor Dance Festival, founded by Bisio four years  ago.  </P> <P> Each piece "emanates from the sense of the place in which it was born," Bisio  said. For example, the "Mimetic Moon Dance" expresses the haunting, mysterious  qualities of a moon-shadowed night, the "Rose of the World" number takes on the  mood of a garden of flowers. "It almost conveys the feeling that little,  magical people are coming out in secret and dancing around the roses," Bisio  said.  </P> <P> The popular moon dance will be performed for the third time in the festival's  history Friday at 9 p.m. at the County Courthouse sunken gardens, Anapamu and  Santa Barbara streets. This is the second year for the rose dance, which was  also performed during the opening ceremonies of the Los Angeles Festival on  Sept. 1. Unlike prior daytime performances, this one will be at 9 p.m. Saturday  at the Mission Rose Garden lawn, Los Olivos and Garden streets. Bisio said, by  way of explaining the time change, "The spirits of the garden come out to play  by night; we wanted to be there when they did."  </P> <P> New to the festival is the "Sand Shiva" which will take place at 3 p.m. at Mesa  Lane Beach, at Mesa Lane Drive off Cliff Drive.  </P> <P> Once again the grand finale will be the Coastal Dance Project, Sunday from 2 to  4 p.m. at Thousand Steps Beach, Santa Cruz Street below Shoreline Drive. The  beach stairs at Shoreline Park can also be used for coastal access.  </P> <P> About 40 artists and dance groups will gather on a half-mile stretch of beach  to dance in the waves and sand, to create works of art by the ocean, to read  their poetry out loud. "This is a gathering of artists, not an art show and  sale," Bisio said. "The whole event is noncommercial."  </P> <P> All events are free, and the audience is encouraged to bring lawn chairs and  picnic foods. The dances last about half an hour each. For more information,  call 962-6945 or 963-0611 Ext. 4539.  </P> <P> Solvang will also be animated with dance and song this weekend during the  annual Danish Days Festival. The small town founded by Danish settlers is best  known for its Danish look -- even modern hotels and restaurants boast window  boxes and windmills. The streets are lined with bakeries, and a replica of the  Little Mermaid fountain is located in town as is the Hans Christian Andersen  Museum.  </P> <P> Ethnic food and entertainment will be featured in the festival, and not only  will clowns and jugglers wander the streets but so will the Danish performance  trio of Linie 3, known in the States as The Three Danes. The singing and comedy  group is currently one of Denmark's most popular acts. As well as wandering the  streets, The Three Danes will perform Friday at 8 p.m. at the Sheraton Hotel,  400 Alisal Road, 688-8000. Tickets are $10.  </P> <P> Saturday starting at 3 p.m., a parade will weave through the village. For more  information, call the visitors' bureau, 688-6144.  </P> <P> Another celebration of cultural heritage, the Mexican Independence Day  Festival, with authentic food, music and dance, will be held 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday in Santa Barbara's Oak Park.  </P> <P> And the culture and history of Southern California will be represented in "You  Oughta Be in Pictures," a costume party from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Friday at Fess  Parker's Red Lion Resort, 633 E. Cabrillo Blvd. Guests are encouraged to dress  as their favorite Hollywood movie star or character. The party -- a benefit for  the Santa Barbara County Chapters of the American Diabetes Assn. and the  American Heart Assn. -- will offer prizes for the best costumes, a silent  auction of celebrity memorabilia, a motion picture trivia contest, a band and  dancing, and a buffet. Alice Faye, who starred in more than 40 movies in the  1930s and '40s will be special guest.  </P> <P> Tickets for the event are $60 per person. For more information, call 963-4194  or 963-8862.  </P></p>

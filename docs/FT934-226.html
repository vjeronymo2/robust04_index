			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Steel stockholder boost is forecast Steel stockholders, which buy steel in bulk from mills and prepare it for sale to end users, will see their market grow modestly until 1996 because of the expected upturn in the UK economy, says Marketing Strategies for Industry, the market-research company. The growth will reflect greater demand for steel from industries such as automotive, construction, chemical process plant and gas supply, Marketing Strategies says in a report. It forecasts negligible market growth in 1997 as the economy slows, and predicts a decline of 2 per cent in 1998. The report estimates that UK mills' deliveries of steel to stockholders rose 3 per cent to 2.9m tonnes this year, reversing the downward trend which reduced the size of the stockholders' market by 17 per cent between 1990 and 1992. Strip mill products are believed to have increased their share of stockholders' sales this year, accounting for 49 per cent of the market, according to the report. Stainless steel also increased in importance. In spite of the large number of stockholders, five companies together accounted for almost half of UK sales this year. The largest, British Steel Distribution, had a market share of about 32 per cent, said MSI. Steel Stockholding: UK.

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Russian weapons scientists complain of 'degrading' conditions Scientists at a top nuclear weapons centre in Russia have complained of 'degrading' conditions and warned leaders in Moscow that falling standards could lead to a Chernobyl-type disaster, according to Itar-Tass news agency, Reuter reports. Scientists at the Arzamas-16 nuclear facility told the leaders in an open letter that Russia could not afford to take short cuts in financing work on nuclear weapons safety, because of the vast costs that would be involved in the event of an accident. The scientists, who complained earlier this week they had not yet got their wages for April and May, said degrading working conditions could lead to nuclear specialists leaving Russia.</p>

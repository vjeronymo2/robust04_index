According to him, "the conflict between  the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is extremely  acute, since one of the main human rights, the right to live, is  being violated".    Shumeyko reported that lawmakers instructed the Federation  Council chairman to set up a special commission for further  investigation into this issue. After this, the commission is to  submit its proposals for the president's consideration.  Lawmakers think it necessary to hold an enlarged meeting of the  Security Council with the participation of the special  commission so that the next meeting of the upper house could  pass the final decision.    The Federation Council chairman emphasised that this  mechanism of decision-making was the most expedient. In his  opinion, many decisions have been taken earlier, but all of them  were never implemented. Therefore, Shumeyko stressed, "it is  critical that all the three branches of power (the Federation  Council, the president and the government) discuss this issue  and make a joint decision".    The upper house speaker also told reporters that deputies  adopted at their meeting an appeal to the peoples of Ingushetia  and North Ossetia. The document stresses the need "to lay down  arms and solve the problems piled over many years by peaceful  means".</p>

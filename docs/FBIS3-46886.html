			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on a SIN TONG-A poll of 72 political reporters on </F> the performances of the 14th National Assembly and its members,  by the SIN TONG-A Editorial Department]    [Text] A year and a half has elapsed since the 14th  National Assembly was sworn in. How is the public viewing it?  SIN TONG-A has conducted a survey to evaluate its performance  and performances of individual assemblymen.    Analyses and evaluations of parliamentary activities and of  individual lawmakers should, in principle, be carried out by  directly polling voters. Realistically, however, data on  parliamentary activities are not readily available for the  public. Of late, Kyongsilnyon and a few other groups and  scholars have begun monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating  assemblymen's parliamentary activities, but their work is still  in its initial stage and unable to offer information to the  public in general.    Considering these facts, the survey was carried out by  polling political reporters of newspapers, radios and press  agencies assigned to the coverage of the National Assembly,  political parties and individual lawmakers. The reason was that  the public is inevitably influenced by mass media in their  impressions of the National Assembly and its members, and that  the evaluations by reporters watching political developments can  provide important data. At the same time, SIN TONG-A's judgement  was that they can speak accurately for the public on their  feelings toward the National Assembly and its members.    Our purpose was to verify if the assemblymen elected are  performing as the voters want them to. It was not our purpose to  make any journalistic approach to parliamentary politics or to  show the likes or dislikes about any individual lawmakers.    The poll was conducted by distributing the prepared  questionnaire sheets--listing 14 questions about activities of  the National Assembly and its members--directly to reporters at  the reporters rooms in the National Assembly and the Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] and Democratic Party [DP] headquarters, and  retrieving after they filled them out. A hundred-odd  questionnaire sheets were distributed and 72 reporters  responded. The retrieved sheets showed traces of great pains  they took with their responses.    The 14th National Assembly--the result of the general  election held on 24 March--opened on a squeaking note. The  ruling and opposition parties, in a confrontation over the issue  of the legally overdue mayoral and gubernatorial elections, had  already clashed in the bargaining over the procedures of the  opening. The assembly barely managed to open on 29 June,  recessing without doing anything but electing the speaker (Pak  Chun-kyu) and vice speakers (Hwang Nak-chu and Ho Kyong-man).  Thus, it idled away its 30-day first session.    Then, the DLP decided to unilaterally convene the National  Assembly to railroad a revision of the local autonomy law (for  holding the mayoral and gubernatorial elections in 1995). The  assembly was convened on 1 August but the limping continued.  Meanwhile, the regular plenary session opened on 14 September  but, under the pressure of the upcoming presidential election,  had to recess in less than 50 days or half of its legal length.  Although it barely completed its formation in early October, the  14th National Assembly remained unable to concentrate on its  primary duty because of the imminent presidential election.    Then came the forceful reform drive of President Kim  Yong-sam  early this year, flustering the National Assembly. Assemblymen  do not dare to conceive institutionalization of reform, or  checking government policies, or presenting alternative  policies. They only dithered about trying to read the  president's mind. The upheavals brought on by the  administration's audit-and-inspection and the public disclosure  of property programs plunged the National Assembly into an  unprecedented crisis, forcing a former speaker and the current  speaker to resign their assembly seats. Even the opposition, not  to mention the government party, could not properly respond to  the reform wind. Assemblymen exposed themselves as a bunch of  weaklings who would only sit back and watch the president's  "one-man race."    Also, in the parliamentary inquiries into the Yulgok defense  buildup program, the 12.12 [12 December 1979] incident and the  Peace Dam scandal, the 14th National Assembly indeed made its  efforts to bring out the truth but, to the eyes of the public,  its performance fell short of their expectations. The public  also assessed as inadequate its performance in the regular  parliamentary inspection of the administration this year.  Furthermore, it even wasted a whole week because of the squabble  over the liquidation-of-the-past issue, demonstrating that as  far as the National Assembly is concerned, nothing has changed.    Such being its performance, the appraisals of the 14th  National Assembly could be anything but high. Of the  respondents, 66.7 percent (48 persons) saw no particular  difference in it from its predecessors, while 8.3 percent gave  it negative ratings--6.9 percent viewed its level of  parliamentary activity as "relatively low" and 1.4 percent as  "low." On the other hand, a quarter of the respondents (18  persons, 25.0 percent) gave it positive ratings, viewing the  14th National Assembly as performing more constructively than  any of its predecessors.    Compared with a similar survey conducted by SIN TONG-A in  1991, the numbers indicate that the 14th National Assembly are  rated more favorably than the 13th. In the 1991 survey, only  12.9 percent gave the 13th National Assembly positive ratings  while 38.6 percent voted in the negative and 48.6 percent said  that it was a mediocre assembly. The survey this time found a  decrease in the negative responses and a gain in the positive.    Nevertheless, two-thirds of the respondents could find  nothing new of the present National Assembly. This seems to  reaffirm the fact that in contrast to developments in other  realms, nothing has changed in the political world, and that the  public sees the way the National Assembly is in the negative  light.    In the questionnaire, the reporters were asked what they saw  as the most distinguishing feature of the 14th National  Assembly. Nearly one-half (33 persons, 45.8 percent) cited the  presentation of alternative policies while only 6.9 percent and  2.8 percent respectively picked legislative activities and  activities to check the administration, both the primary  functions of the National Assembly, in what seems to unveil a  legislature overwhelmed by the government's reform drive.    Some respondents noted that even in the presentation of  alternative policies, the 14th National Assembly does not  measure up to expectations. Their point is that thanks to  efforts by some assemblymen who breathed fresh air into the  assembly, parliamentary activities showed some signs of  productiveness but nevertheless failed to be positive in showing  alternative policies. In this connection, two reporters  commented that the legislature is in a "state of lethargy."    Noteworthy is the fact that 41.7 percent of the respondents  (30 persons) picked "improvement in ethical consciousness" as  the distinguishing feature of the 14th National Assembly. It  seems to be a natural aftermath of the audit-and-inspection and  public disclosure of property upheavals; however, it can be said  that the rise in ethical consciousness has its limitations  because it represented not the result of a voluntary resolution  or movement of the National Assembly but a passive response to  the president's "high-handed" drive.    No matter what led to it, the fact that assemblymen made a  public disclosure of their wealth for the first time is  recognized as an extraordinary change, not only because it will  undoubtedly help end irregularities and corruption in elections  that have been frowned upon by the public, but also because it  will go a long way toward shutting off from politics those who  accumulated their wealth by dishonest means.    In this connection, it is noteworthy that 75.0 percent of  the  respondents found assemblymen "wealthier than I thought." A look  at the disclosed property of grade-one or higher officials in  the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, the  Constitutional Court, and the Central Election  Committee--disclosed to the public on 7 September in accordance  with the Public Office Holders Ethics Law--will explain the  reason for the high percentage. While the public disclosure  involved a total of 1,167 officials, as many as 64 assemblymen  were among the top 100 "men of wealth."    Especially, the top 15 were all assemblymen. Conspicuously,  however, none of those picked by the reporters as "assemblyman  of outstanding legislative activity" or "promising assemblyman"  or "assemblyman of high credibility among colleagues" was  included among them.    The average wealth of assemblymen was reported at 2.61  billion won, somewhat close to the average worth of the entire  public office holders subjected to the disclosure action, which  was 1.42 billion won. In particular, the average worth of DLP  lawmakers was 3.25 billion won, compared with 1.26 billion won  of opposition assemblymen, or the executive branch's 860 million  won, or the judicial branch's 1.19 billion won.    Meanwhile, 9.7 percent of the respondents saw the disclosed  wealth of assemblymen as an "appropriate size" and 12.5 percent  as "smaller than I thought." Two persons said that they have no  answer.    The next question was about the pay for the assemblymen. At  a  glance, the responses appeared to contradict those concerning  the wealth of assemblymen, for 30.6 percent saw the need for a  large pay raise and 44.4 percent a small raise. In other words,  75.0 percent were of the opinion that they should be given a  raise. Meanwhile, 22.2 percent said that the present pay scale  is appropriate. One reporter said that their pay should be cut.  (Another had no answer.)    One of the respondents explained that "the responses that  the  amount of their wealth is unexpectedly large are average of the  legislative branch. As for those young and new assemblymen, we  feel that the present pay scale is not enough to assure  satisfactory parliamentary activities."    What he means is that assemblymen need political funds for  satisfactory parliamentary activities, and because it is  difficult to raise the necessary funds from supporters alone,  the government should help them.  <H5>  Ex-Activists Leading in Legislative Activities </H5>   The reporters were then asked about the "necessary  conditions  for satisfactory legislative activities." They were asked to  consider four elements--assemblyman's political insight,  political fund, party support, and activity for  constituency--and indicate the order of precedence. The result:  69 persons or 95.8 percent picked "assemblyman's political  insight" as the most important element. Only 4.2 percent (3  persons) voted for "political fund" as the most important. None  picked "party support" or "activity for constituency" for the  top place. For the second important factor, 31.9 percent picked  "political fund" while 29.1 percent voted for "party support."  And 16.6 percent picked "activity for constituency" as the next  important factor.    Then, what are the levels of the members of the 14th  National  Assembly to the eyes of the reporters who see "political  insight" as the most important qualification of assemblyman? How  many do they think have the capabilities and dignity befitting  assemblymen? Fifty percent of the respondents said that only  one-half of the assemblymen meets that qualification. More  specifically, none picked "90 percent or more" as the proportion  of assemblymen meeting that qualification; 15.3 percent picked  "60 to 70 percent"; 34.7 percent picked "approximately 50  percent"; 31.9 percent "about 30 percent," and 18.1 percent  answered "less than 30 percent."    Next, the reporters were asked to grade individual  assemblymen whom they know through their work. They were asked  to pick five assemblymen in four categories--"assemblyman whose  legislative activity is considered most vigorous," "assemblyman  who is demonstrating qualities of a rational and democratic  politician and is very likely to grow to be a superb  politician," "assemblyman who seems to have the highest  credibility among colleagues," and "assemblyman who engaged in  parliamentary activity giving a negative impression (e.g.,  persons who made illogical, slanderous, irresponsible or stupid  remarks)."    It is assumed that their grading of individual assemblymen  were influenced by their experiences in official and unofficial  coverage activities and by their personal likings. However, the  tally showed a clear-cut trend in the choice of the respondents,  in particular with the ten lawmakers who received most votes.    The top ten assemblymen picked by the 72 political reporters  for most contributions to legislative activities are:    (1) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 34 votes); (2) Yi  Sok-hyon (43, DP; Anyang-B, Kyonggi; 32 votes); (3) Kim Won-kil  (51, DP; Tobong-B, Seoul; 27 votes); (4) Kim Won-ung (49, DP;  Taedok, Taejon; 22 votes); (5) Kang Chang-song (65, DP; national  constituency; 16 votes); (6) Yim Pok-chin (50, DP; West-B,  Kwangju; 14 votes); (7) Sin Kye-ryun (39, DP; Songbuk-B, Seoul;  14 votes); (8) Pak Sok-mu (50, DP; Muan, North Cholla; 13  votes); (9) Pak Myong-hwan (55, DLP; Mapo-B, Seoul; 12 votes);  (10) Son Hak-kyu (47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Kyonggi; 11 votes)    Yi Hae-chan, who won the most votes in the previous survey,  retained his top place, followed by Yi Sok-hyon, a freshman  assemblyman. Conspicuous is the rise of Son Hak-kyu who made the  top ten only seven months after his election in an April  by-election. The fact that the list includes as many as four  former activists seems to point to the successful performances  of the ex-activists since their move into the  chedokwon [conservative camp]. It is noteworthy that  those who had been active participants in the democratization  movements until they were elected to the National Assembly are  being favorably viewed as assemblymen, too.    Needless to say, some object to this observation. They  contend that such ratings by reporters are more a propensity  analysis than a political analysis. Their point is that the  preconceived notions of reporters--who are hoping for an end to  outdated political styles--would prompt them to take the side of  those reformists who are in the same age bracket and share  similar values with them. A reporter said: "For instance,  dominant in 'Assembly Sketch'-type articles these days are  comments by party executives and crusaders for clean politics.  They carry no stories about the middle group." Young  assemblymen's public relations strategy, he observed, appears to  be working as a factor attracting young reporters.    Anyway, the top ten list seems to indicate that the former  activists impressed the reporters with their image of diligence,  while assemblymen like Kang Chang-song and Yim Pok-chin, both  defense and foreign policy experts, and Kim Won-ung, who is a  rare ex-businessman among opposition assemblymen, earned their  high ratings by distinguishing themselves in their respective  fields. Kim Won-kil, Pak Myong-hwan and Pak Sok-mun are also  known for "diligence" in their parliamentary activities.    One thing to be noted is that except Yi Hae-chan and Pak  Sok-mu, they are all freshman assemblymen. Of the top ten picked  in the same category in the previous survey of the 13th National  Assembly, six were reelected to the 14th National Assembly--Yi  He-chan, Yi Chol, Pak Sok-mu, Cho Se-hyong, Kim Yong-chin, and  Kim Won-ki. Of the six, only two made it this time.    The fact that the ratings on ruling party assemblymen are  relatively low seems to have something to do with structural  matters. Undoubtedly, it comes in part from the fundamental  nature of the ruling party which is basically the government  party. In addition, before proceedings begin in the National  Assembly, ruling party assemblymen are already required to  comply with decisions made in the party-government consultation  processes; as a result, they naturally cannot be as offensive as  opposition assemblymen. Nowadays, some ruling party assemblymen  criticize the government and present alternative policies like  opposition assemblymen do. But the survey found that their  activities are not forceful enough to impress the reporters.  With all these things taken into consideration, the fact that  only two DLP assemblymen are ranked among the top ten still  seems to point to the need for redoubled efforts on the part of  ruling party assemblymen.    From the national constituency, which is of the nature of  professional representation in that it gives specialists in  specific fields an opportunity to be elected to the National  Assembly, only Kang Chang-song made the top ten, a fact  indicative of how active national constituency assemblymen are  in their legislative activities.    The tally also included the following results:    10 votes: Che Chong-ku (DP); 9 votes: Kim Yong-chin (DP),  Pak  Sang-chon (DP); 8 votes: Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Chong-ung (DLP);  5 votes: Kang Sam-chae (DLP), Kang Su-rim (DP), Kim Hyong-o  (DLP), Na Pyong-son (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chang Chun-ik  (DP), Han Hwa-kap (DP); 4 votes: Kang Kyong-sik (DLP), Kim  Pyong-o (DP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Song Tu-ho (DLP), Chong  Kyun-hwan (DP); 3 votes: Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Pak Chu-chon (DLP),  Yi Pu-yong (DP); 2 votes: Kang Chae-sop (DLP), Kim Yong-il  (DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na O-yon (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak  Hon-ki (DLP), Paek Nam-chi (DLP), Song Chon-yong (DLP), Won  Hye-yong (DP), Yu In-tae (DP), Yi Kyu-taek (DP), Yi Yun-su (DP),  Chong Sang-yong (DP)    The number of assemblymen who received two or more votes was  44 or 14.7 percent of the 299 total number of assemblymen.  Meanwhile, 24 assemblymen got one vote each. This means that 68  assemblymen--22.7 percent of the total number of  assemblymen--impressed the reporters with their legislative  activities. Assemblymen who received a single vote are: Kim  Yong-kwang, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Pyong-il, Kim Un-hwan, Kim In-yong,  Kim Hae-sok, No Sung-u, Mun Chong-su, Mun Hui-sang, Pak  Kwang-tae, Pak Il, Pak Tae-yong, So Sang-mok, Sin Ki-ha, Sin  Sun-pom, Yi Kon-yong, Yi Ho- chong, Yi Hwan-ui, Chong Tae-chol,  Cho Se-hyong, Cho Sun-hyong, Cho Il- hyon, Cha Su-myong, Choe  Yong-han.  <H5>  Yi Pu-yong Picked as Most Promising </H5>   The second question was about the future of individual  assemblymen. While the first question was about the  "accomplishments" to date, this one was about the "potential."  Yi Pu-yong was found leading overwhelmingly in this category.  The top ten are:    (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 51 votes); (2) Yi  Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 26 votes); (3) Son Hak-kyu  (47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Seoul; 19 votes); (4) Kang Chae-sop (46,  DLP; West-B, Taegu; 13 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP;  Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 15 votes); (6) Kang Sam-chae (41,  DLP; Hoewon,, Masan; 13 votes); (6) Kim Tok-yong (52, DLP;  Socho-B, Seoul; 13 votes); (8) Yi Hyop (52, DP; Iri, North  Cholla; 9 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 8  votes); (9) Han Hwa-kap (56, DP; Sinan, South Cholla; 8 votes)    It is recalled here that Yi Pu-yong, pressing for new  politics as a leader of the reformist group in the DP, received  only three votes in the category of "accomplishments." Equally  noteworthy is the fact that Kim Tok-yong, who received not a  single vote in that category, and Chong Tae-chol, who received  only one vote in the same, were respectively ranked in the 6th  and 9th spot in this category about how promising individual  assemblymen are.    The landslide for Yi Pu-yong can be attributed to the fact  that the assemblyman whose name was already a synonym for reform  has successfully adapted himself to real politics, and that he  is one of the reform leaders in the National Assembly. It seems  that reporters gave Yi Hae-chan, Son Hak-kyu, Che Chong-ku and  Yi Hyop high points for their potential as reformists. As for  DLP spokesman Kang Chae-sop, ranked in the fourth place, he and  reporters find congeniality in each other for the age factor.  Moreover, he is one of the most clear-headed and brilliant.  These things and his successful move to the YS [Kim Yong-sam]  group apparently brought him high ratings in this category.    Kim Tok-yong, first minister of state, and Chong Tae-chol  are  respectively viewed as the ruling and opposition party champion  of the new generation. Kang Sam-chae is deeply involved in the  reform program of the DP as a real power of the RDP [former  Reunification Democratic Party] faction; in addition, his age  seems to make him a promising assemblyman. These factors must  have been taken into account. As for Han Hwa-kap, reporters  apparently considered the fact that he is seen as the next  representative of the Tonggyo-tong faction "vacated by Kim  Tae-chung." People say that the way Han Hwa-kap is acting these  days makes them think of Kim Tae-chung, stirring nostalgia among  them.    The following is the tally on other assemblymen in this  category:    7 votes: Sin Kye-ryun (DP), Yi Chol (DP), Hong Sa-tok (DP);  6  votes: Kim Won-kil (DP), So Sang-mok (DLP); 5 votes: Pak Sok-mu  (DP), Cho Se-hyong (DP); 4 votes: Kim Won-ki (DP), Paek Nam-chi  (DLP), Yu Chun-sang (DP), Yi Ki-taek (DP), Yi Sok-hyon (DP), Han  Kwang-ok (DP); 3 votes: Kim Yun-hwan (DLP), Kim Yong-o (DLP),  Mun Hui-sang (DP), Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Sang-chon (DP), Pak  Chong-ung (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak Hon-ki (DLP), Yi In-che  (DLP); 2 votes: Kang Chang-hui (independent), Kim Won-ung (DP),  Kim Yong-il (DLP), Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na  Ung-pae (DLP), Pak Myong-hwan (DLP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Won  Hye-yong (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chong Kyun-hwan (DP), Chong  Sang-yong (DP), Choe Chae-uk (DLP)    Altogether, 45 assemblymen or 15 percent of the entire  assemblymen received two or more votes. Meanwhile 33 received  one vote each and they were: Kang Su-rim, Kang In-sop, Kim  Sang-hyon, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Chong-ho, Na O-yon, No Chae-pong,  Pak Kyong-su, Pak Sil, Pak Un-tae, Pak Chong-hun, Pak Chu- chon,  Pak Chan-chong, So Hun, Son Se-il, Song Chon-yong, Sin Ki-ha,  Sin Sang-u, O Chong-sop, Yi Kil-chae, Yi Man-sop, Yi Sun-chae,  Yi Yong-sam, Chang Sok-hwa, Chang Chae-sik, Chong Mong-chun, Cho  Pu-yong, Cho Sun- hyong, Cho Yong-chang, Choe Pyong-yol, Choe  Hyong-u, Ho Kyong-man, Hwang Nak-chu.    The third question was about credibility among colleagues.  Yi  Pu-yong topped the list in this category, too. Unlike in other  categories, more senior party leaders made the top ten. Another  characteristic point was that votes were more scattered. The  following are the top ten and ties (13 in total):    (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 22 votes); (2)  Kim  Yun-hwan (61, DLP; Sinsan, Kunwi, Kyonggi; 16 votes); (3) Yi  Man-sop (61, DLP; national constituency; 11 votes); (3) Yi Hyop  (52, DP; Iri, North Cholla; 11 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP;  Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 10 votes); (6) Cho Se-hyong (62,  DP; Songdong-B, Seoul; 9 votes); (6) Kim Won-ki (56, DP;  Chongju, Chongup, North Cholla; 9 votes); (8) Kang Chae-sop (46,  DLP; West-B, Taegu; 7 votes); (9) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B,  Seoul; 6 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 6  votes) (9) Cho Sun-sung (64, DP; Sungju, South Cholla; 6 votes);  (9) Choe Hyong-u (58, DLP; Tongnae-B, Pusan; 6 votes); (9) Kan  Kwang-ok (52, DP; Kwanak-A, Seoul; 6 votes)    That an assemblyman enjoys high credibility among colleagues  can be interpreted in a variety of ways. First, it suggests that  he is sociable and is respected. It could also mean that he is  practicing politics on the basis of debate and compromise. Those  listed among the top ten are mostly known for their relatively  modest and reasonable lines.    In this sense, the fact that assemblymen like Yi Pu-yong, Yi  Hyop, Che Chong-ku and Yi Hae-chan are ranked high in this  category disproves, in effect, the common knowledge that  ex-activists who are "making important contributions to  legislative activities and considered promising assemblymen" are  usually not rated as high in the "credibility among assemblymen"  category. At the same time, it carries a lesson to assemblymen  who are the subjects of criticism that their excessive elitism  and radical style are alienating themselves from colleagues.    Kim Yun-hwan of the DLP, ranked second in the top ten, is  reportedly in an ill mood these days because of Yu Song-hwan of  the RDP faction in the same party, who attempted to make an  issue of his past record. He has continued to move up the ladder  since the Yusin era [under President Pak Chong-hui] and is  currently expected to play a "godfather" role for the DJP  [former Democratic Justice Party] faction which is under the  pressure of the RDP faction. The high ratings of his popularity  among assemblymen seem to reflect the perceived "hopes" of the  DJP faction as well as the affability of Kim Yun-hwan himself.    Speaker Yi Man-sop came, conspicuously, in the third place.  The ratings for him seem to reflect sentiments of assemblymen  pinning their hopes on his declaration that "a speaker of the  National Assembly should never allow himself to be influenced by  Chongwadae" and that "while I am the speaker, there will be no  railroading by surprise." As for Kang Chae-sop, DLP spokesman,  it is observed that his deft handling of personal relationships  led to the ratings.    Ratings for other assemblymen:    5 votes: Kim Tok-kyu, Yi Han-tong; 4 votes: Kim Pyong-o, Pak  Chol-on, Sin Sun-pom, Yu In-tae, Yi Chol, Cho Sun-hyong, Hwang  Nak-chu; 3 votes: Kang Sam-chae, Kim Chong-ho, Kim Chung-wi, Kim  Chin-chae, Kim Tae-sik, Na Ung-pae, Pak Sok-mu, Pak Hon-ki, Sin  Kyong-sik, Sin Sang-u, Choe Chae-uk, Han Hwa-kap; 2 votes: Kang  Chang-song, Kang Chang-hui, Kim Tok-yong, Kim Pyong-o, Kim  Yong-ku, Kim Won-kil, Kim Won-ung, Kim Chung-cho, Pak Kyong-su,  Pak Sang-chon, Pak Hui-tae, Paek Nam-chi, Son Hak-kyu, O Se-ung,  Yi Sang- tuk, Yi Song-ho, Yi Chun-ku, Yim Pok-chin, Chang  Chun-ik, Chang Chae- sik, Chong Pil-kun, Hwang Nak-chu.    Altogether, 57 assemblymen received two or more votes, while  48 received one vote each.    In the above three categories, Yi Hae-chan is the only  assemblyman who made the top ten in all of them. He topped the  list in the "legislative activity" category, in the second place  in the "promising assemblyman" category, and in the ninth in the  "credibility" category. Meanwhile, in Yi Pu-yong's case, he  emerged at the top in two categories but fell way behind in the  "legislative activity." Other assemblymen who made the top ten  in two categories are: Son Hak-kyu ("promising" and "legislative  activity"), Kang Chae-sop, Yi Hyop, Che Chong-ku, and Chong  Tae-chol ( "promising" and "credibility").    The fourth question was who the reporters think are misfits  as assemblyman. In this category, 101 assemblymen received one  or more votes. (The number of them who received two votes or  more was 57.) Of the top ten, seven were DLP assemblymen, two  DP, and one UPP [United People's Party]. The first place went to  Rep. "B" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 27 votes), followed by Rep.  "B" of South Chungchong (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "Y" of the  national constituency (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "J" of North  Chungchong (DP, 14 votes), Rep. "J" of Kyonggi (UPP, 13 votes),  Rep. "K" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 12 votes), Rep. "Y" of the  national constituency (DLP, 9 votes), Rep. "K" of North  Kyongsang (DLP, 8 votes), Rep. "P" of Seoul (DP, 8 votes), and  Rep. "J" of Taegu (DLP, 7 votes).    Such being their ratings of the 14th National Assembly, what  do the reporters see as its problems? The survey found 48.6  percent (35 persons) citing "the lack of vision in leading the  civilian government era" as the biggest problem, followed by  22.2 percent (16 persons) picking "the National Assembly Law and  the way it is being steered," 18.1 percent (13 persons) accusing  the legislature of being swayed too much by the party interests,  and 11.1 percent (8 persons) charging that assemblymen are  preoccupied with the interests of their constituencies and of  themselves.    In the previous survey, 58.6 percent of the respondents saw  "political activities swayed by the party interests" as the  biggest problem of the 13th National Assembly. The lower  percentage this time is interpreted as the public demand for a  legislature worthy of the civilian government era has been  overwhelming. Both at the time of its launching and during the  recent regular session, it demonstrated the lingering old  practices. Reporters are of the opinion that they will very  likely be compelled to highlight the same unresolved problems  again.    The reporters were also asked what they felt while watching  assemblymen's parliamentary activities. To this question, 34.7  percent (25 persons) pointed out that "the levels of individual  assemblymen should improve," while 29.2 percent (21 persons)  noted that "political parties should be democratized" and 8.3  percent (6 persons) cited the need for amendments to the  National Assembly Law and for reasonable management of  parliament. Those who cited the need for solution to the  political fund issue were only 2 persons (2.8 percent). This  indicates that as far as reporters are concerned, they had drawn  the conclusion that in order for the National Assembly and its  members to act as they should, assemblymen and political parties  have to change, and that there are no other ways after all.    To the question concerning influences affecting  parliamentary  activities of the 14th National Assembly, 32 persons (44.4  percent) picked media, followed by 22 persons (30.6 percent)  citing party leadership, and 13 persons (18.1 percent) naming  the administration. It was confirmed that of the respondents who  named the administration, many included Chongwadae. In the  previous survey, 54.3 percent cited party leadership and 27.8  percent media.    As politicians exposed to public scrutiny, it is quite  natural that assemblymen are sensitive to media. Hence, the joke  that "assemblymen and reporters are the kings in the assembly  hall."    Only two reporters picked constituents and public  organizations as the major influence on the National Assembly.  (One reporter made no response.) The survey found that there are  virtually no other major influences affecting assemblymen. This  is viewed as meaning that the authority and status of the  assemblyman is that high.    Currently, political parties represented in the National  Assembly are the DLP, DP, UPP, the New Korea Party and the  Sinjong Party. The reporters were asked which party they think  has been most effective in the bargaining in the 14th National  Assembly. The result: 72.2 percent (52 persons) picked the DP  and 20.8 percent (15 persons) the DLP, while two cited the  independents but not a single reporter paid attention to the  UPP, the Sinjong Party or the New Korea Party. Meanwhile, three  reporters wrote in a separate pick, "I see no party befitting  this category."    To evaluate the National Assembly and individual assemblymen  is not an easy task. It requires comprehensive analyses of all  remarks in the parliament by the assemblyman, his legislative  and social activities, as well as the role he plays inside his  party. Needless to say, the work requires fairly high levels of  professional knowledge. Also, for the fairest possible ratings,  it is necessary to consider evaluations by related people, too.    Before this type of full-scale evaluations are attempted, we  have shown you the appraisals by the reporters assigned to the  coverage of the National Assembly, political parties and  individual assemblymen. Needless to say, their evaluations are  of undeniable importance. As we said earlier, they cover  political developments live and therefore are considered fit for  the task. Therein lies the significance of this survey, we  believe.    Anyhow, it is expected that the full-scale evaluations of  the  14th National Assembly will be carried out in late 1995 in  advance of the 1996 general election for the 15th National  Assembly. What we have presented are a kind of interim  evaluations. The results so far seem to point to a mixture of  potential hopes and disappointments. Our parliament and its  members undoubtedly have their problems but it is also true that  there is an effort under way for a rebirth and that we have fine  assemblymen with gifts, capabilities and excellent political  records. For all this, we feel that we can pin our hopes on the  14th National Assembly.    Moreover, along with the foregone conclusion that to have a  National Assembly is better than having none, there is the  national consensus that our legislature should develop further  in the future. For this fact, too, we can attach our hopes to  the future of the 14th National Assembly.</p>

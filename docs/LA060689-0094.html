			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO THREAT TO WATER SEEN ON LAB GROUNDS  </P> <P> After weeks of dealing with worried residents and alarming reports of  contamination, many of the public officials who got a firsthand look at the  Rockwell International Santa Susana Field Laboratory on Monday emerged from the  scene expressing relief.  </P> <P> "No one has any reason to fear from any problems up there," said Mel Blevins,  water master for the Upper Los Angeles River Authority of the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and one of 70 officials who toured the site.  "There's not any ground water or surface water flowing away from the area that  has any pollution in it."  </P> <P> Radioactive contamination of a portion of the 2,668-acre complex three miles  west of Chatsworth was described in a preliminary report released last month by  the Department of Energy, which has contracted with Rockwell's Rocketdyne  division for nuclear work.  </P> <P> The report found that while the pollution poses no immediate threat to nearby  residents, more environmental tests are necessary to determine the extent of  the contamination because of inadequacies in the company's ground water  monitoring system.  </P></p>

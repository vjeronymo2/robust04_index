			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / BBC journalists to hold strikes BBC journalists have voted to stage a series of 24-hour strikes in a dispute over pay and working conditions. A large majority of members of the National Union of Journalists voted in favour of a stoppage although fewer than half the 2,274 journalists took part in the ballot. Members of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, voted at the weekend for a series of 24-hour strikes and threatened to disrupt outside sports programmes. The unions are in dispute over the introduction of performance pay and plans for new contract terms which they say will lead to longer working days and less time off.</p>

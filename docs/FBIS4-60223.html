			<p>BFN     [Text] The Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] has issued a statement on the occasion of the blessed 'Id  al-Adha feast. The statement pointed out [words indistinct]  Arab and Islamic peoples were celebrating with joy and high  hopes and Muslims everywhere were exchanging greetings on this  occasion. Yet the war criminal 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was  determined to send 'Id greetings in his own special way: instead  of peace and security, he killed the children's joy.    The statement added that 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih has stubbornly  challenged the national, Arab, and international will to stop  the war. Thus, he has confirmed his satanic inclinations and  his desire to destroy everything beautiful.    The statement also said that a number of towns and villages  in the southern governorates have been the target of random and  barbaric shelling. War criminal 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has pushed  thousands of innocent people from certain areas into the  crematoria of death. He ordered soldiers to kill each other and  tanks and airplanes to destroy installations in villages and  towns. He has also robbed the country's wealth and has filled  the prisons with innocent people.    The Political Bureau expressed appreciation for the Arab  leaders' stances and for their desire to end the fighting in  Yemen. It also held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the al-Ahmar  family responsible for (?continuing) the war.    The Political Bureau hailed the heroic achievements of our  armed forces against the attacks. It also greeted people in all  the republic's governorates on the occasion of the advent of the  blessed 'Id al-Adha feast.</p>

Speaking at a conference on Jewish communications in Jerusalem,  Peres noted that the deputy Russian foreign minister and the  Greek foreign minister, arrived in Israel today from Tunis.  They brought a message from the PLO leadership stating it is  very important that Israel realize these are indeed conditions  for the resumption of the negotiations.    Minister Peres clarified that Israel had accepted some of  the  conditions, including the release of prisoners. Israel agrees  that the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre  include a temporary placement of foreign presence in Jericho and  Gaza, in accordance with the DOP. We are also willing to  discuss the Palestinian request that the autonomy police force  be larger, Peres said. Our correspondent Amy Rhodes filed this  report.</p>

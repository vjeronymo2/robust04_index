			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / EU divided over Ukraine accord Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to sign a 'partnership' agreement with the European Union in Luxembourg tomorrow , the first sign of a more even-handed EU strategy toward Ukraine and neighbouring Russia. Mr Kravchuk will draw satisfaction from the fact that a similar partnership agreement between the EU and Russia remains unfinished, though Brussels hopes to wrap up the accord in time for the European summit in Corfu next week. Ukraine's collapsing economy and nuclear arsenal make it the regional danger spot, but the EU's new policy of engagement is being hobbled by a row over a European Commission plan to send emergency food aid. Britain, among others, opposes the provision of farm credit guarantees amounting to Ecu100m (Pounds 77m) so Kiev can buy western fertilisers with scarce hard currency. The UK believes that reports of food shortages are exaggerated, and that the Commission's move is a short-term palliative. Winter crops in Ukraine failed and had to be replanted. Many spring crops were planted without fertilisers, making them vulnerable. Kiev's powerful agricultural lobby, trying to restore traditionally high subsidies, has warned of pending disaster, but western diplomats believe large-scale humanitarian aid is 'premature'. Though choice is limited, food stores are stocked. Many warehouses are watching their potatoes rot because demand has dropped on the retail market. The explanation is that self-sufficient Ukrainians with access to garden plots have been planting their own. 'Ukraine doesn't need food,' said one diplomat. 'They need much more sophisticated help' - such as market incentives to produce, a competitive distribution system and better storage facilities. Nuclear safety in Ukraine will feature high on the agenda of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples next month. Brussels estimates suggest that the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant could cost Ecu300m-500m. Ukraine is trying to make a goldmine out of the international outcry to close Chernobyl, raising its asking price to shut the station down from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn. With Ukraine's future government still up in the air, it will be tricky to secure a deal with the executive branch without the danger of it back-firing in Ukraine's parliament.</p>

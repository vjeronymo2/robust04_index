			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FLASHBACK;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK IN COUNTY PREP SPORTS HISTORY;  </P> <P> 10 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> When Edison faced Fountain Valley, the game was considered the biggest in the  county because:  </P> <P>  -- It was for the Sunset League championship.  </P> <P>  -- For the seventh consecutive season, it was played at Anaheim Stadium to  accommodate the 15,000 fans the game averaged.  </P> <P>  -- It got top billing over the Rams-Miami game on the message board at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P>  -- Edison was the CIF champion in 1979, Fountain Valley in 1978. Many involved  in the game would have rather won it than a CIF title. One sportswriter called  it "The Super Bowl of CIF."  </P> <P> "Winning the CIF title in 1978 was great," Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner  said. "But beating Edison is better. I think our game with Edison outdrew the  CIF finals two years ago."  </P> <P> The best thing was that the game lived up to its billing. Edison won, 15-14,  with an exciting, almost bizarre, ending.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley opened a 14-0 lead behind the passing of junior quarterback  Matt Stevens, who wore a towel that said "FV Air Force."  </P> <P> But Edison came back and pulled within one when quarterback Ken Major scored on  a three-yard run with 15 seconds left. Edison then called the same play to  score a two-point conversion.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley did not give up. Stevens completed a 61-yard pass to Keith  Richards as time ran out, moving the ball to the Edison six. A penalty flag was  thrown because Edison piled on during the tackle.  </P> <P> A game cannot end on a defensive penalty, but official Jim Patterson said:  </P> <P> "The clock had run out when the ball was in the air, and the game ended when  (Richards) hit the ground."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 YEARS AGO  </P> <P> The Marina special teams were known for the quality of their play, and for  their size.  </P> <P> Marina's special teams' players averaged 5-feet-8, 155 pounds, fairly small by  football standards.  </P> <P> "Westminster was laughing at us on the sidelines," said special teams player  Dean Loghry. "They were saying, 'Who are these little guys?' "  </P> <P> Accordingly, the group decided to call itself the Smurf Patrol, after the  popular cartoon series. It was also an allusion to the diminutive Washington  Redskin receivers who called themselves the Smurfs.  </P> <P> "When you see them out there, you don't think they can hurt anybody," defensive  back Sean Barbosa said. "But they put some good licks on people."  </P> <P> Apparently. Marina opponents averaged just 13.5 yards per kickoff return, with  a longest of 38, as the Vikings went 6-3-1, 4-1 in the Sunset League.  </P> <P> The players weren't chosen because of their (lack of) size. It just worked out  that way because Coach Dave Thompson believed in using players who didn't start  on offense or defense for his special teams.  </P> <P> "That's a good place for a kid to get on the field," Thompson said. "If he's a  junior, he'll get a lot of hits and gain a lot of confidence. If he's a senior,  he'll at least feel like he's contributed to the team."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 YEAR AGO  </P> <P> Running it up: Rancho Alamitos' Dana Riddle gained 144 yards in 34 carries to  end the regular season with 2,082 yards, the fourth-highest total in county  history behind Servite's Derek Brown (2,301, 1988), Edison's Kerwin Bell  (2,226, 1979) and Valencia's Ray Pallares (2,085, 1985).  </P> <P> Tough ticket: As expected, Capistrano Valley's stadium was packed for the  showdown between top-ranked El Toro and No. 2 Capistrano Valley. Fans began to  fill the stadium at 5 p.m., and the 3,500 bleacher seats were taken by 6.  </P> <P> Just ask Mission Viejo Mayor William Craycraft how hot a ticket it was.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Craycraft had telephoned Capistrano Valley Principal Tom  Anthony and asked if Anthony could reserve a couple of seats and a parking  space at the school for his family.  </P> <P> Anthony politely declined.  </P> <P> The mayor missed a good game. Capistrano Valley won, 22-21.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] International mediators between the two factions in  the Lesotho army appeared to have brokered a final peace deal  today. After more than two weeks of tension and clashes between  them, mediators from the subregion and from the Commonwealth  have been trying to get the mutineers to hand over unauthorized  weapons. Today, there was an exchange of weapons in Maseru.  Journalist Mamelo Maurisini was there. On the line, Audrey  Brown asked her how it went.    [Begin recording] [Maurisini] At two o'clock our time, the  traffic came to a standstill in Kings Way as armored vehicles  traveled down Kings Way, with soldiers waving white flags,  moving toward the headquarters barracks.    [Brown] And what were these soldiers going to go and do  there?    [Maurisini] According to the information that the  Commonwealth team had given us, the purpose of the soldiers  going to the barracks was to go and hand in all heavy weaponry  in order to get ready for talks with government, as soon as all  heavy weaponry had been returned to the armories.    [Brown] So these soldiers who were handing in the armory,  were they the rebels?    [Maurisini] There are no rebels, as far as the government  and  as far as Basotho are concerned. It was both sides of the army.  The army at Makoanyane and the army at the headquarters.    [Brown] So, they were giving in the weapons that they used  to  shoot each other with and to attack each other within the last  couple of weeks?    [Maurisini] Yes, that is what was happening. They were  beginning their descent from the mountain at the same points  where they had been keeping watch over the last two and half  weeks.    [Brown] So, these weapons that they were handing back, were  they weapons that had been looted from the head office's arsenal?    [Maurisini] The Commonwealth observer team assured us that  all weapons had been signed out and that it would be easy for  them to be returned, because they were going to be signed in,  depending on the register of what had been taken out.    [Brown] So, please, just clarify [words indistinct]. So, the  army was actually giving weapons back to the army?    [Maurisini] The army was returning the weapons to the  armories, and we had been made to believe that two British  captains attached to the Royal Lesotho Defense Force would  monitor this handing in at the two barracks.    [Brown] So, the weapons that they were giving back, these  weapons, they say, were legitimately signed out and used to  attack each other. Is that what had happened? And these  weapons were now being given back?    [Maurisini] The weapons had been legitimately taken out, the  Commonwealth observer team says, but we have no proof that it  was as they had said. But we have no reason to doubt that they  had been legitimately signed out, as the two sides were getting  ready for a final showdown. Now, it was all this extra armories  that they were returning into the armories and they would be  remaining with one firearm each, as is normal.    [Brown] So, is everyone satisfied with the way the whole  process went?    [Maurisini] The people are satisfied because, as far as I  could judge, there was ululation, there was cheering, and they  were singing as the soldiers went down Kings Way in the company  of members of the diplomatic corps and religious leaders. I  would like to believe that everybody, including the Commonwealth  team, are happy with the process this far. The major problem,  of course, will be whether, after the army has been brought  together by the Commonwealth team, the government will now be  willing to talk. [end recording]</p>

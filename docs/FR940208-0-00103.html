			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7&blank;Consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are found at 50 CFR part 402. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines an action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy and incidental take of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy, are directly related. Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer one is to recovery, the greater the certainty in the species' continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are thus related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high degree of certainty for the species' continued viability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species, thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the protection of the critical habitat's ability to contribute fully to a species' recovery. Thus, the adverse modification standard may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas the jeopardy standard traditionally has been applied nearer to the extinction end of the continuum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat focuses on the primary constituent elements within the defined units and their contribution to the species' recovery, based on consideration of the species' biological needs and factors that contribute to recovery (e.g., distribution, numbers, reproduction, and viability). The evaluation of actions that may affect critical habitat for the desert tortoise should consider the effects of the action on any of the factors that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical, including the primary constituent elements of nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow, as well as the contribution of the area to recovery. The Service will focus on a proposed action's effect on the eventual recovery of the tortoise in a CHU (e.g., the type of activities that led to the tortoise's listing, such as habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation). The Service would issue an adverse modification opinion if it determined that a proposed action was likely to preclude recovery of the tortoise in a particular unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of the desert tortoise has been divided into six recovery units in the Draft Recovery Plan. These areas are based on genetic, morphological, ecological, and physiological differences among the desert tortoises. The designated CHUs are intended to provide for viable populations of desert tortoises representing this variation in traits. The basis for an adverse modification opinion should follow the recommendations in the recovery plan for maintaining viable populations and variation throughout the range. Should the Recovery Team redefine these parameters in the final recovery plan, then the basis for analysis under section 7 will follow that basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a wide-ranging species such as the desert tortoise, where multiple CHUs are designated, each unit has both a local role and a rangewide role in contributing to the conservation of the species. The loss of a single unit may not jeopardize the continued existence of the species but may significantly reduce the ability of critical habitat to contribute to recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present conditions vary throughout the range of the desert tortoise, with the result that some areas may be less able to sustain continuing impacts than others at any given time. The level of disturbance a CHU could withstand and still fulfill its intended purpose is variable throughout the tortoise's range and will need to be reviewed in the context of its current status, condition, and location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each project will need review as to its impacts at all levels. When determining whether any particular action would appreciably diminish the value of the habitat for the survival and recovery of the tortoise, the baseline condition and expected role for the individual unit and those within the same recovery unit must be considered. Among the factors to be considered are the extent of the proposed action, the present condition of the habitat (e.g., percent of the area containing the primary constituent elements, degree of fragmentation, size of the unit), the existing density of desert tortoises in the unit, the expected time to regenerate sufficient habitat to support an effective population in a particular area, consistency of the action with the intent of the recovery plan, geographic consideration, and local and regional problems. The analysis should also consider the effect of the action on critical habitat from actions planned outside the designated area. Analysis of impacts to individual units must consider the effects to the local area, the recovery unit in which it resides, and the overall range of the listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Implicated   Police Officers   <F P=102> PA2106025794 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 10 Jun 94 pp 1, 2 </F> <F P=103> PA2106025794 </F> <F P=104>  Managua BARRICADA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Freddy Potoy] </F>   [Text] Brigadier Commander Eduardo Cuadra Ferrey, acting  director of the National Police, has confirmed to BARRICADA that  an avalanche of drugs coming from the Atlantic coast of  Nicaragua is being received by a network of drug traffickers in  Masaya and other departments on the Pacific coast.    The cocaine invading the Pacific coast cities comes from  Puerto Cabezas. It is smuggled through Minas, Mulukuku,  Matagalpa, and Tipitapa, to Ciudad de las Flores, where  traffickers have managed to infiltrate the police force and  where several police officers are in charge of distribution.  This activity has changed this city into the capital of drug  trafficking.    The cocaine seized in Nicaragua is classified as "Lacross,"  "Esterlina," and "The First." "Lacross" is cocaine that experts  rate as "medium grade," and its price makes it more readily  available to consumers. The traffickers receive it in Masaya  and distribute it in eastern towns and other areas.    Drug traffickers are believed to have moved their operations  center to one of the major cities outside Managua, where there  are excellent market possibilities due to population and  facilities for moving into other areas along the Pacific coast.    Drug traffickers also may have moved their operations  because  of the recent crack downs in the capital. Authorities have  delivered severe blows to large and small-scale drug sales,  capturing and prosecuting anyone who "sticks their head up."    Cuadra Ferrey said his office will initiate an in-depth  investigation of the police implicated in the Masaya drug  trafficking activities. "If they are found guilty, they will be  prosecuted, because we cannot allow drug trafficking."    Donald Sanchez, Virgilo Canales, Mario Vergara and  Lieutenant  Pablo Potosme are the police officers allegedly implicated in  drug trafficking activities.    After repeatedly asking Sub Commander Carlos Rodriguez,  chief  of the National Police in Masaya, for information regarding the  men said to be involved in drug trafficking activities, he  finally told BARRICADA that Potosme is currently being  investigated by military internal affairs for providing  information to drug traffickers in exchange for payoffs.    It was discovered that Potosme was receiving payments from  one of the biggest criminals in Masaya, who was recently  arrested for fraud and bribery of a policeman. The former  police officer is also charged with having sold information for  600, 700, 1,000, 2,000, and even 3,000 cordobas. Reportedly, he  once took a television set from one of the traffickers, because  the trafficker had no money to pay him at the time.    On another occasion, a police officer gave Potosme a ride to  the Parque de los Leones. According to National Police  investigations, Potosme then went to the Masaya criminal's home  to receive a payoff.    Although Cuadra Ferrey and Rodriguez gave no significant  details of the investigations, BARRICADA was able to learn the  names of four other police officers believed to be under  investigation.    Our informant said that Police Officers Dino Shelleby,  Ernesto Chamorro, and Eliphar Villaobos are reportedly drug  users, "although they are still not involved in the drug  business itself."    Police officer Francisco Valdez is under investigation for  his relations with former police officer Francisco Malespin, who  is to be sentenced by a military court in the next few days  after being found guilty of drug trafficking.    Several police officers have been seen at a distribution  point, near the Salinas movie theater in Managua, allegedly  consuming drugs or receiving payoffs.    Sources close to the National Police high command reported  that "they are bringing in all kinds of weapons to Masaya and  Managua to fight the police officers connected with the drug  traffickers and to prosecute whoever they find to be involved."</p>

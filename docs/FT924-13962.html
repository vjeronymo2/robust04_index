			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television A promising night. BBC2's often excellent foreign affairs series, Assignment (7.45) considers the reduction to second class citizens of those Russians who, when the Soviet Union collapsed, found themselves marooned in such places as Latvia and Estonia which are now once again independent republics. C4's arts magazine Without Walls, also often excellent, promises Simon Callow on Shakespeare's sexuality ('challenging the conventional notion of his heterosexuality', which hardly sounds novel, but still) and an examination of Brigitte Bardot's influence on style and sexuality in France. Battlecries (9.50 BBC2) considers the relationships between officers and men in the trenches of World War 1 and in Japanese PoW camps in World War 2. Omnibus (10.25 BBC1) provides a profile of film director Ridley Scott, so strong on atmosphere (from the Hovis ads to 'Blade Runner') but weak on narrative and character. ITV's four-part documentary series on The Kennedys (10.40) begins with Joseph, father of John, Robert and Edward. There are few good movies about television; Network (11.20 BBC1) is one.</p>

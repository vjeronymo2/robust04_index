			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;I. A closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules and other primary containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment used to contain operations involving viable organisms containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA molecules shall include monitoring or sensing devices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the integrity of containment during operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;J. A closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be tested for integrity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the containment features using the organisms that will serve as the host for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. Testing shall be accomplished prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the introduction of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following modification or replacement of essential containment features. Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and methods used in the testing shall be appropriate for the equipment design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for recovery and demonstration of the test organism. Records of tests and results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be maintained on file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;K. A closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be permanently identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This identification shall be used in all records reflecting testing, operation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance, and use of this equipment for research production activities involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;L. The universal biosafety sign shall be posted on each closed system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and primary containment equipment when used to contain viable organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;M. Emergency plans required by Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(6) and IV&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;c&hyph;(3) shall include methods and procedures for handling large losses of culture on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N. Closed systems and other primary containment equipment used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be located within a controlled area which meets the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;1. The controlled area shall have a separate entry area. The entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area shall be a double-doored space such as an air lock, anteroom, or change room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that separates the controlled area from the balance of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;2. The surfaces of walls, ceilings, and floors in the controlled area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be such as to permit ready cleaning and decontamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;3. Penetrations into the controlled area shall be sealed to permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid or vapor phase space decontamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;4. All utilities and service or process piping and wiring entering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the controlled area shall be protected against contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;5. Hand washing facilities equipped with foot, elbow, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically operated valves shall be located at each major work area and near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each primary exit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;6. A shower facility shall be provided. This facility shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in close proximity to the controlled area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;7. The controlled area shall be designed to preclude release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culture fluids outside the controlled area in the event of an accidental spill or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release from the closed systems or other primary containment equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;8. The controlled area shall have a ventilation system that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of controlling air movement. The movement of air shall be from areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower contamination potential to areas of higher contamination potential. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ventilation system provides positive pressure supply air, the system shall operate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner that prevents the reversal of the direction of air movement or shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with an alarm that would be actuated in the event that reversal in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direction of air movement were to occur. The exhaust air from the controlled area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not be recirculated to other areas of the facility. The exhaust air from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled area may not be discharged to the outdoors without being high efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate air/HEPA filtered, subjected to thermal oxidation, or otherwise treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prevent the release of viable organisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;O. The following personnel and operational practices shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;O&hyph;1. Personnel entry into the controlled area shall be through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry area specified in Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;N&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;O&hyph;2. Persons entering the controlled area shall exchange or cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their personal clothing with work garments such as jump suits, laboratory coats,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pants and shirts, head cover, and shoes or shoe covers. On exit from the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area the work clothing may be stored in a locker separate from that used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal clothing or discarded for laundering. Clothing shall be decontaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before laundering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;V&hyph;O&hyph;3. Entry into the controlled area during periods when work is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress shall be restricted to those persons required to meet program or support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs. Prior to entry, all persons shall be informed of the operating practices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency procedures, and the nature of the work conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

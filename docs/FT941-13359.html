			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Enthusiasm and a mission to train - Lisa Wood interviews the chief executive of Investors in People UK Mary Chapman is getting used to the response at social gatherings when she describes her new job. ''Chief executive of Investors in People UK. Umm. I've heard of IIP.'' Then silence. Chapman feels some sympathy. 'The name is getting to be known, but less well understood is what IIP is about,' she says. IIP is a national standard for effective training. It was developed by the government as part of its strategy to address Britain's dismal record in this area. Until now Training and Enterprise Councils have been responsible for persuading employers to seek to attain the standard and validating it when they have done so. IIP, which was launched yesterday, will now inject a national dimension into promotion and marketing. Supported by Pounds 2m of public funds, it should ensure that standards of assessment remain consistent and of high quality. Chapman brings enthusiasm to her new job, which she says is based on her experience of working at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company, latterly as director of personnel operations and management development for the group in the UK. Like other French companies, L'Oreal subscribes to a training levy which she says is evidence of a French national commitment to training. The levy, she says, does not guarantee that training is good, but it establishes a culture with the potential to succour training. 'L'Oreal did just that,' she says, with the company's culture disseminating to its overseas operations. 'Talking to my friends in this country I felt my then employer did more than most of theirs to allow us to fulfil our potential as well as uphold the quality of the company.' Chapman believes IIP can help companies to be more competitive and employees to be better skilled. She says that IIP, contrary to many employers' expectations, is not about spending more on training programmes. Rather it is a mechanism for assessing whether or not a company's training fits its business needs. Attaining the standard may require specialist help from consultants, for whom grants are available. So far the standard has been taken up mainly by the 'great and the good' including Boots the Chemist, the retailing to drugs group; Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, and Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive subsidiary of British Aerospace's Rover Group. The task now is to disseminate it more widely. 'It is not enough to say it's good to train people,' says Chapman. 'You have to be able to demonstrate how it benefits the bottom line in a way that businesses can measure.' IIP, she says, can also influence the individual development of employees. At a division of Unilever, the management, while working on IIP, realised that it was not making the most of its female employees. An affirmative action programme has been introduced. Chapman says: 'Worked with properly, the standard can help companies identify personnel matters such as these but it is then up to the company to decide whether it wants to do anything about it.' Big companies, she says, can use the standard as an audit tool, that is, to ask 'are we as good as we think we are at linking our training to our business needs'. Small companies can use it at a more fundamental level, which may result in new personnel and training practices.</p>

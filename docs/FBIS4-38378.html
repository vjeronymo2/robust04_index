			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ROK President Kim Yong-sam by RIA Novosti </F> correspondent Sergey Kudasov specially for NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA in Seoul; date not given: "Eve of Visit: Can You Travel  From Seoul to Moscow Bypassing Washington?"]    [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam arrives in Moscow 1 June  on an official visit. Russian journalists accredited in Seoul  interviewed the South Korean head of state on the eve of his  trip.    [Kudasov] What is Russia's place in the ROK's "new  diplomacy" now and in the long term?    [Kim] Korea and Russia have become important partners in  cooperating in various spheres, including the economy, security,  and culture. That is why I believe that my present visit to  Moscow will make it possible to strengthen still further the  relations of friendship between the two countries that have  developed. If you look at our bilateral relations from the  historical viewpoint and with consideration for the geographical  location of the two countries one can say that their role and  significance will be enhanced in the future. I therefore think  that they will develop rapidly despite the past associated with  the Cold War years.    I have long wanted to visit Russia without combining this  visit with trips to other countries since I regard it as  extremely important.    [Kudasov] In your view, what could be the main result of the  coming summit-level meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin  in the political sphere and the sphere of bilateral trade and  economic relations?    [Kim] I have already met with B. Yeltsin. I therefore think  that during our meeting in Moscow we will be able to have an  open exchange of opinions on various issues.    Our summit meeting with the Russian president will primarily  confirm the fact that constructive partnership, mutually  complementary relations already exist between our two countries.  Thanks to talks at summit level the sad past in our relations  will remain just that and a new era of friendship and  cooperation will open up instead.    President Yeltsin and I will discuss the international  situation and the situation in the region, along with ways of  promoting the development of Korean-Russian relations. Thanks  to the current talks our countries will strengthen their  cooperation not only as regards stabilizing the situation on the  Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, but also as regards  their activity in the United Nations and in the international  arena.    From the economic viewpoint the Korean-Russian talks will  serve to strengthen and develop real mutually complementary  relations geared to the future.    [Kudasov] How do you see the situation developing in  relations between South and North Korea in the near future and  can you predict with certainty any substantial progress in this  area, including the possibility of a summit-level meeting with  DPRK President Kim Il-song?    [Kim] As our government has repeatedly stated, given the  uncertainty over North Korea's nuclear plans no progress can be  expected in North-South relations. In order to make this  progress North Korea must first provide the international  community with clear proof that it is suspending nuclear  development work.    If Kim Il-song does indeed want peace on the Korean  Peninsula  he should abandon nuclear development. If he is sincerely  committed to peace North Korea should enter into direct dialogue  with the South and should not strive to resolve Korean problems  via the United States. The cessation of North Korean nuclear  research is the only way of ensuring peace on the Korean  Peninsula.    Russia has hitherto actively supported our stance on the  nuclear problem of North Korea and I am counting on that support  in the future.    [Kudasov] Do you not have plans to change your system of  military cooperation with the United States given your closer  rapprochement in this sphere with Russia and, in particular, do  you not have plans to buy arms from the latter?    [Kim] Our government's main position is that, in order to  ease tension on the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary to  strengthen relations not only with the United States but also  with any neighboring country. Korean-Russian relations have  grown even stronger as a result of visits to Russia by the chief  of the General Staff of our Armed Forces and the defense  minister and also the Russian defense minister's visit to Korea  and Russian Navy ships' friendly visits to our ports.    In principle I think that the sphere of defense procurements  can be expanded. However, this question must be given careful  study on the principle that this output must conform with our  existing arms systems and their tactical use.</p>

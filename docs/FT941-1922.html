			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mayborn increases 19% to Pounds 4.24m Mayborn Group, involved in the packaging and distribution of consumer goods to the retail trade, achieved a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 4.24m in the year to December 31. The largest rise came from the fabric dyes division with operating profits ahead to Pounds 1.94m (Pounds 1.52m). Baby products contributed Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.91m) while losses at florists' sundries deepened to Pounds 28,000 (Pounds 19,000). Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said it could be some time before that division returned to profitability. Turnover of this USM-quoted concern grew 11 per cent to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 36.1m) and the pre-tax result was after net interest payable of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 311,000). Earnings per share were 14.3p against 12.4p and a final dividend of 3.9p (3.4p) lifts the total to 5.7p (5p).</p>

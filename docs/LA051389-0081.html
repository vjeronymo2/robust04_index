			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Tandon Corp.: The Moorpark, Calif.-based computer company reported a loss of  $9.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, compared to a $7.16 million  profit a year earlier. Tandon also reported that revenues rose 15% to $92.7  million. Tandon said that 89% of overall first-quarter revenues were accounted  for by sales of personal computer systems and subsystems in Europe, which  remained its predominant market. Tandon attributed some of the loss to the  scaling back of its of U.S. operations so that it could function more  cost-effectively and to the strengthened value of the U.S. dollar against  European currencies compared to the first quarter a year ago, translated into  about $5 million fewer dollars earned.  </P></p>

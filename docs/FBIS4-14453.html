			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- "The paralysis of the financial  system in the country is not allowing many formulated programs  to be implemented." This was stated today by Russian First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets at a sitting of the Russian Government.  Summing up the results for the first qyarter of this year he  referred to the drop in inflation as a positive element. On  average it was 13-14 percent over the quarter. In addition, the  first vice premier noted, a positive balance has been achieved  in foreign trade. We have also been able to attain a definite  stabilization of the population's standard of living.    However, Oleg Soskovets asserted, capital investments, which  amounted to only 75-80 percent, have decreased. The volume of  paid services fell by 40 percent, and the price index for  industrial goods grew by 1.5 times. As far as the industrial  sector is concerned, for example, the fall in production levels  in light industry was 15 percent. The volume of freight carried  by rail decreased by 23 percent.    Oleg Soskovets noted a deterioration in production activity  in the fuel and energy complex, the export potential of which  has significantly declined. According to him, owing to the the  confused nature of the quota system Russia failed to deliver 1.5  million tonnes of oil for export.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> RESEARCH RATES SPERMICIDES ON BATTLING DISEASES  </P> <P> The most widely used spermicide may not offer the best protection against  sexually transmitted diseases. Instead, new research data concludes, the active  ingredient in only one contraceptive jelly marketed in the United States and  another chemical not in any American product were the most effective in tests  against diseases such as herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea and AIDS.  </P> <P> The UCLA research identifies octoxynol-9, the chemical used in Ortho-Gynol  Contraceptive Jelly, and benzalkonium chloride, used in Europe but not here, as  superior to the most common ingredient, nonoxynol-9, that is present in such  products as Gynol II, Ortho-Creme and the Today contraceptive sponge.  </P> <P> "On balance," the study concluded, "it would appear that octoxynol is the  spermicide most effective."  </P> <P> The Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., the largest manufacturer of spermicides, said  it could not respond to the UCLA findings because its choice of ingredients was  based entirely on contraceptive effectiveness. Ortho said its product line  includes both octoxynol-9 and nonoxynol-9 to offer consumers a choice in the  event one ingredient or the other causes side effects.  </P> <P> The spermicide test results, which knowledgeable scientists said would be  highly controversial, may pose a problem in fashioning a large-scale  AIDS-prevention campaign. Like condoms, spermicides have never been certified  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for anything but pregnancy prevention.  Yet in a variety of public and consumer-oriented forums, Surgeon General C.  Everett Koop and other public health officials have urged use of condoms and  spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 as an AIDS-prevention technique. Now the  UCLA-sponsored tests introduce the possibility that it is not the most  effective agent for that purpose.  </P> <P> The report on spermicides was included among hundreds of pages of a federally  funded condom research project headquartered at UCLA. The spermicide testing  was conducted in 1987, but the report wasn't written until earlier this year.  </P> <P> The results, which had not been publicly released because of a variety of  political and scientific intrigues, were obtained by The Times last week under  the Freedom of Information Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposed Spermicide Study  </P> <P> The UCLA researchers initially ordered a study of spermicide effectiveness  against the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases as part of a  plan for a large human trial of condoms to assess their true ability to prevent  AIDS. The study sought to identify the most effective condoms and spermicides  on the market so such products could be distributed to research subjects.  </P> <P> The plan was terminated, however, when the federal government's National  Institute on Child Health and Human Development withdrew financial support for  the project. The institute concluded that such a large-scale human test would  be too dangerous to its subjects because the high concentrations of AIDS cases  in Southern California, where the research would have been done, would have  made the chances of contracting the disease dangerously high if a condom  failed.  </P> <P> In an especially controversial finding, the UCLA-sponsored research found that  octoxynol-9 alone is also capable of killing the Epstein-Barr virus, linked to  the mysterious disease associated with chronic fatigue and other symptoms.  </P> <P> In their report to the government, UCLA researchers also disclosed that  laboratory notebooks containing one of two sets of AIDS test data had been  mysteriously lost by a laboratory technician working on the study as a UCLA  subcontractor. The loss of the data means that the HIV results "should be  interpreted with caution," the report concluded. But the report also said a  duplicate set of the data had been retained. And the researchers emphasized  that the findings on gonorrhea and chlamydia are at odds with reports by other  scientific teams, requiring further verification. But the results for other  sexually transmitted diseases, the research report noted, were less open to  question.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Conclusion  </P> <P> Despite the questions about spermicides and the AIDS virus, the report  concluded that if the canceled human trial had been held, "the choice of  octoxynol as the spermicide . . . would appear obvious: It is effective against  the most agents and it is already FDA-approved."  </P> <P> However, the report also noted there may be "some user opposition" to  octoxynol. Scientists familiar with spermicide research said there are  tentative and highly controversial studies that suggest the use of octoxynol is  associated with an increase in birth defects.  </P> <P> Researchers questioned by The Times, who agreed to comment on the condition  they would not be named because they did not want to be drawn into a political  or legal controversy, called the birth defect findings preliminary and possibly  incorrect. Ortho has mounted vigorous legal defenses for octoxynol's safety.  </P> <P> Benzalkonium, the researchers concluded, would be a good second choice, but the  FDA said no American product is authorized to use the chemical widely employed  in France and Switzerland. A U.S. drug company, which the researchers did not  identify, is believed to be testing benzalkonium for use in a contraceptive  sponge.  </P></p>

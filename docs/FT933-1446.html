			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Italian ex-minister to be prosecuted as probe advances ROME magistrates yesterday called for the prosecution of Mr Giovanni Prandini, for allegedly extorting a total of L20.5bn (Pounds 8.5m) in bribes as Christian Democrat minister of public works from 1989 to 1992. This is the first time in the 18-month-long corruption scandals that judicial proceedings have reached such an advanced stage involving a former minister. Mr Prandini was minister in the seventh government of Mr Guilio Andreotti, which left office after the April 1992 elections. The prosecution move also involved Mr Francesco Cafarelli, a Christian Democrat deputy and secretary of the parliamentnary anti-Mafia commission, and Mr Antio Crespo, the former head of Anas, the state roads authority. Together they are accused of having forced 22 businessmen to pay bribes to obtain contracts, mainly connected with work awarded by Anas. Mr Prandini is cited as having being linked to 18 different bribery episodes. Among these, he is alleged to have obliged Mr Antonio Baldi, a Naples businessman, to buy for L7bn a hotel near Brescia owned by a group headed by Mr Prandini himself. Court documents claim the purchase price was L3bn above the market price and Mr Baldi was threatened with exclusion from future Anas road contracts if he turned down the arrangement.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA MAKES BIG RUN AT LSU BUT STUMBLES AT THE END, 122-114;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LIONS PLAY THEIR BEST GAME OF THE YEAR AGAINST 10TH-RANKED  TIGERS. LOWERY SCORES 40 POINTS AGAIN.  </P> <P> Louisiana State students chanted "Tiger bait, tiger bait," as Loyola Marymount  took the floor here Thursday, and for most of the game the Lions baited the  Tigers exceedingly well.  </P> <P> Playing their best game of the season, the Lions played on even terms with  10th-ranked LSU, eventually falling, 122-114, before a crowd of 13,044 at the  Pete Maravich Assembly Center.  </P> <P> It was Loyola's third loss in a row against a top 20 team, but after defeats at  UCLA and Oklahoma totaling 111 points, the Lions set the pace in this game and  avoided the all-out Big Shaq Attack they feared.  </P> <P> Shaquille O'Neal, LSU's dominating center, finished with 29 points and 14  rebounds, most of that in the final eight minutes as the Tigers pulled away.  </P> <P> Loyola's Terrell Lowery scored 40 points for the second game in a row and the  fourth time in eight games. He and guard Craig Holt (17 points) combined to hit  11 of 23 three-point baskets, part of the formula for Loyola's good showing.  </P> <P> "I was very pleased with our effort," Lion Coach Jay Hillock said. "Our style  hurt them a little bit. If we can take a couple more steps we can do what I  want to do, which is be a factor in our conference."  </P> <P> LSU Coach Dale Brown said it was "the best I've seen Loyola play all year long,  by far. They dictated most of the game with their up-beat style. Lowery's  performance in the first half was brilliant."  </P> <P> The teams were tied, 57-57, at halftime -- Lowery had 25 -- and LSU led by only  three points before putting together a decisive 12-3 run to build a 99-87 lead.  Loyola never got closer then seven after that. O'Neal, who had only eight  points at halftime, had a series of monstrous dunks down the stretch and the  Lions finally wilted against the taller home team.  </P> <P> "We expected to tire 'em out," Lowery said. "They happened to hold up and push  through. The bigger bodies took a toll. I think they outmanned us a little at  the end."  </P> <P> Forward Vernel Singleton had a career-high 26 points and 12 rebounds for LSU  (6-1) as the Tigers controlled the boards, 48-31. Defensive specialist Shawn  Griggs had 20 points, eight assists and a Southeastern Conference record eight  steals.  </P> <P> Center Richard Petruska, in his best performance, had 18 points and eight  rebounds for the Lions (2-6) and made eight of 12 shots as Loyola shot 55%.  Lowery added 14 assists.  </P> <P> The Lions continue their road swing against highly rated teams with a game  Saturday at Georgia Tech. For a change, they go in with some confidence despite  Thursday's loss.  </P> <P> "This is a big-time motivation builder," Lowery said. "We had taken a couple of  beatings. It's evident we hadn't played up to our potential. We were just  waiting for a game like this, for it to come together. I'm looking forward to  (playing Georgia Tech's) Kenny Anderson."  </P></p>

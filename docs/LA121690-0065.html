			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE WATER SHORTAGE;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE HOLDS KEY TO FUTURE PLENITUDE, NOT DEVELOPERS;  </P> <P> NEW HOMES, WITH WATER-SAVING FIXTURES THROUGHOUT, ARE NEARLY 25% MORE WATER  EFFICIENT THAN OLDER HOMES.  </P> <P> Reminiscent of the meatpacker that said it used every part of the pig but the  squeal, those who wish to stop new home development seem capable of rendering  nearly any conceivable issue into an argument against new homes. The current  argument that new home development should be stopped because of the drought is  based more on fervor than fact, however, since these are the very developments  that do the most to reduce water use.  </P> <P> Many cling to the belief that Orange County's growth is still the result of  incoming floods of outsiders. That is no longer the case; the flood is more one  of little squirts -- our own children -- because most of the county's growth is  now internally generated. Consequently, most new homes shelter our own growing  families and those of our children. These homes don't result in increased water  use, then. They only result in the water that would have been used anyway  coming out of new faucets.  </P> <P> That is a considerable improvement.  </P> <P> New homes, equipped with water-saving fixtures from the kitchen to the  bathroom, are nearly 25% more water efficient than older homes, according to  the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This drop, from 77 gallons per  capita per day to just 60, is the result of such fixtures as new shower heads  that save seven gallons per shower and toilets that save more than two gallons  per flush. One-quarter of water-related arguments against new housing go down  the drain once this is realized.  </P> <P> But household water use is a rather insignificant portion of overall municipal  water consumption. Orange County's biggest water use is landscape irrigation.  Here new home developments offer an even greater degree of conservation versus  older neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Well-planned new communities such as Irvine and Mission Viejo use water  reclamation systems, so greenbelts, medians and parks are irrigated by recycled  water that is wasted in older communities. New communities use drought-tolerant  landscaping and efficient irrigation, including computer-controlled systems  that measure the soil's water content and operate only when needed. These new  developments showcase water conservation techniques, while older neighborhoods  are examples of how not to landscape and irrigate in a semiarid climate.  </P> <P> Instead of criticizing new home development, a much more positive tack is to  look at the larger picture.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District, which provides 70% of our county's water, is  hurt more by politics than by drought. While the drought has certainly  diminished water levels, look what politics has done: It has halved the amount  of water we will be able to draw from the Colorado River, it defeated the  Peripheral Canal and it is threatening sources in the Sierra Nevada. Most  seriously, it is preventing formulation of a much-needed statewide water  conservation and allocation policy.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the political water wars between Southern California and its  water sources to the east and north pit brother unknowingly against brother.  Residents of mountain hamlets, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Southland  alike are pipsqueaks fighting each other for drops, while largely ignoring the  state's main water consumer: agriculture.  </P> <P> Less than 5% of Orange County's water goes to agricultural use, but 83% of our  water statewide is used on farms. To put this in perspective, consider that  more water is used irrigating California's alfalfa crop than is consumed by the  entire Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas combined -- and alfalfa  is but one of the four big water users in California agriculture.  </P> <P> Most of this water is purchased at government-subsidized rates by agribusiness  operations. They use loopholes to gain water subsidies meant to protect small  family farms. As a result, they pay as little as $2.50 per acre-foot for water  that costs the Metropolitan Water District $19 per acre-foot. Of course, MWD  passes its higher cost on to us.  </P> <P> Even if the building industry discovers new ways to greatly reduce residential  water consumption, the total saved would be a drop in the bucket compared with  what agribusiness could conserve through a tiny percentage decrease in water  use. In fact, a UC Davis study recently showed that a 10% decrease in  agriculture water consumption would meet water needs of the state's urban  population for 20 years.  </P> <P> A comprehensive state water strategy could accomplish a balancing of urban,  agricultural, recreational and environmental water needs. A good first step of  such a strategy would be to require agribusiness to pay a non-subsidized price  for water so it has an incentive to conserve. Learning from such countries as  Israel, which have mastered water-conserving farming, California's agricultural  sector could become a world leader in efficient irrigation.  </P> <P> The potential savings are vast. In Israel, highly efficient irrigation systems  have reduced the amount of water used per acre of farm by 50% to 70%. From 1951  to 1985, the amount of land under irrigation in Israel grew 335%, while  agricultural water use barely doubled, because just 20% of the country's  irrigation water is lost.  </P> <P> In the attacks on well-planned new developments that offer water-efficient  homes and drought-tolerant landscaping, we see a continuation of the kind of  political manipulation and blame-shifting that keeps Californians from doing  what must be done to protect our precious water resources.  </P> <P> Orange County has a long history of carefully managing its water supply.  Instead of bickering among ourselves, we should build on our success to date  and encourage the rest of the state to get on with creating a statewide water  resource management plan.  </P></p>

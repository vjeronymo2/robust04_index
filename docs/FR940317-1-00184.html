			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Voluntary Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Voluntary, non-regulatory measures that mitigate noise impacts would impose the minimum burden on operators and can be effective. An example is the recommended minimum altitude of 2,000 feet above ground level described in FAA Advisory Circular 91&hyph;36C, which is honored by most transient operators. Another option would be expansion of the existing Interagency Agreement among the FAA, the NPS, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Through that agreement the proponents agree to assess severe situations where impact of aircraft operations upon human, cultural, or natural resources are sufficiently serious to warrant consideration of site-specific action by the FAA to minimize or eliminate the causes of such problems. Expansion of the Interagency Agreement could provide for additional non-regulatory actions by the agencies to mitigate overflight impacts. The agencies seek comments on the relative merits of voluntary measures generally, and specific suggestions for other voluntary measures not currently used by the FAA or NPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Grand Canyon Model <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One option is to follow a model similar to that in use at Grand Canyon, with extensive regulation of airspace, routes, and minimum altitudes as discussed separately below. Such an approach may not adequately consider the fact that the total number and frequency of flights, and the steady growth in numbers of flights, are not currently addressed under that regulatory framework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibition of Flights During Flight-Free Time Periods <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A prohibition could be established on use of some or all of the airspace above parks at certain times; e.g., 1 hour per day, 1 day per week, or 2&hyph;4 weeks per year. The ``quiet times'' would be published well in advance both for air tour operator scheduling and for planning by park visitors. In terms of noise mitigation, non-flying quiet periods would present an unusual approach to the balance between air access and the interest in restoring some degree of the natural quiet in Grand Canyon National Park. At some cost in inconvenience and lost business for air tour operators and temporarily reduced access to air tours for their passengers, the park would enjoy a virtual absence of aircraft noise in sensitive areas for specific periods. The agencies specifically request comment on the potential efficacy of these approaches in meeting FAA and NPS goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Altitude Restrictions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 at Grand Canyon currently specifies a minimum altitude for flight over the different areas of the park as high as 14,500 feet msl. It also specifies minimum altitudes for operation in the flight corridors between the flight-free zones. Different altitudes are specified for transient general aviation operations and for air tour operators, to separate high-frequency tour flights from one-time transient flights. Different altitudes are also specified for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter tour flights, for safety and efficiency reasons. The tour operation altitudes are at canyon rim level or above (although some are slightly below the minimum altitude requested by NPS as ``rim level'' in 1987). A relatively high minimum altitude in a particular area limits access to the airspace over that area by many general aviation aircraft because of performance limitations. Generally, noise mitigation is achieved through higher minimum altitudes because the greater the slant-range distance from an aircraft to a point on the surface, the lower the sound level on the surface from aircraft noise. However, this mitigation can be offset or reversed based on attenuation factors such as hills, heavily wooded areas, and ``soft ground'' terrain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Flight Free Zones/Flight Corridors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 at Grand Canyon now describes specific ``flight-free'' zones to an altitude of 14,500 feet msl above the park. The remaining airspace is defined as corridors for operations over the park by both general aviation and commercial air tour operators. Impact mitigation is achieved through specifying corridors for flight over the park that assure there are no overflights of large areas of the park below the current minimum altitude of 14,500 feet msl. The current corridors and flight-free zones could be amended to address concerns about effects on particular areas of the park. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Restrictions on Noise Through Allocation of Aircraft Noise Equivalencies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A noise budget is a mechanism for limiting total aircraft noise impact on the park by assigning each air tour operator an individual limit on noise impact. This would allow individual air tour operators the flexibility to decide what combination of equipment and flight frequency they will use to attain the target noise level. The noise budget would apply only to air tour sightseeing operators and not to transient general aviation operations. The noise budget concept assumes that the FAA and NPS could determine (1) the acceptable amount of aircraft noise exposure on the park surface, and (2) the number of aircraft operations under various mixes of aircraft types that could operate within the total noise budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

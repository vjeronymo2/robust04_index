			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Eastward with success in glass - Trade across Europe / Ronald van de Krol visits a Philips factory venture in Poland THE easiest way to measure the transformation of Poland's biggest lighting company is to look for broken glass - or a lack of it - at its production site. Before Philips of the Netherlands took a majority stake in Polam-Pila, in 1991, the company had to produce 170 glass tubes to end up with 100 fluorescent lights. This was because so many glass tubes broke, cracked or ended up faulty. The tell-tale signs of inefficiency were the shards of glass littering the factory floor. Now - after investments in a new glass furnace, intensive training of staff and the advent of stringent quality control - Philips Lighting Poland, the new Polam-Pila, needs to produce just 112 tubes for every 100 effective fluorescent lights. This ratio compares well with the 108:100 achieved by Philips factories in such places as the Dutch town of Roosendal. Showing off his new, computer-driven quality-control system, Mr Stanislaw Kozlowski, the 42-year-old general manager, says: 'Before, we had four grades of quality that we checked for. Now we accept only one type of quality - the best.' The sharp improvement, achieved by a 3.5-fold increase in annual investment to Fl 21.8m (Pounds 7.6m) means that the company, at Pila in north-western Poland, is now allowed to export some of its products to the Philips sales organisation in the Netherlands. This effectively puts a small portion of its production on a par with that of the 11 other lighting plants maintained by Philips in western Europe. Still, the Polish company has a long way to go, despite turning in a small profit for 1992 after running up a loss in 1991. The contrast between the new and the old is vividly highlighted by Building 61A - a showcase of new Philips-built equipment - and Building 48, described by one manager as an 'industrial archaeological museum.' Indeed, inside the hall, pride of place is reserved for two machines dating from the 1920s. These were confiscated from the old Philips factory in Warsaw, after nationalisation in 1948, and are no longer in service. The rest of the machines in the hall are virtually carbon copies of this original, outdated, machinery. For Philips, Polam-Pila is an important step in its plans for eastern Europe, giving it a strong foothold in the region's biggest market and access to a company with a proven record in exports. In 1992, exports accounted for nearly 60 per cent of sales of Dollars 55m (Pounds 37m). Most of these were to store chains in North America and Britain, which sold the lamps under their own labels. Russian exports, hit by turmoil in the former Soviet Union, have started to recover, now that sales are denominated in dollars and linked in a complex counter-trade arrangement to Polish imports of Russian oil. The Polish investment is important because it marks a departure from the normal Philips practice. Instead of stationing a team of expatriate managers in Poland, the Dutch company chose at the outset to work with local management under Mr Kozlowski, whose 80-hour week is testimony to the challenge of switching from a command economy to a free market. In many ways, the success of Polam-Pila under Philips is an extension of its impressive achievements under the constraints of communism. The company used to be bound to follow ministerial edicts from Warsaw, but it was allowed to start exporting to the west in the 1970s and to expose itself to the rigours of self-financing in the 1980s. 'In spite of adverse conditions, they had developed according to their own philosophy, they were motivated and they were serious,' according to Mr Einar Kloster, president of the Philips lighting division. Mr Rene van Reeth, a divisional director and key adviser to the Polish team, says: 'This use of local management is something we may want to try elsewhere.' Philips, which has light bulb factories from Nigeria to Indonesia, is keen to expand. Its eyes are firmly set on China. Its efforts in Poland are frequently contrasted with the acquisition of Hungary's Tungsram lighting group by General Electric of the US. The US company has made intensive use of expatriates and of Hungarian-American managers, and job losses have been heavy. A direct comparison, however, is difficult because Tungsram is four times larger than Polam-Pila, and has six production sites instead of one. Even so, only 500 out of 3,500 jobs have been lost in Pila, underlining the fact that the Polish factory had never known the over-staffing common under the former, communist system. The labour force in Poland has had to adjust to new circumstances. Early expectations of western wages were dashed by a temporary freezing of salaries, causing some short-term labour unrest which has since abated. Also, the Polish management put a halt to the old practice of paying people according to the number of light bulbs produced, regardless of quality. 'Over a year, we gradually abandoned paying people on the quantity of their output,' Mr Kozlowski says. 'Payment is now on the basis of a monthly salary, with the possibility of a small bonus to keep quality discipline.'</p>

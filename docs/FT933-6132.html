			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: Palestinian divisions exposed PALESTINIAN rifts came swiftly into the open yesterday following signs of progress in the Middle East peace talks, report David Horovitz and agencies. Conflicting signals emerged from the Palestine Liberation Organisation - euphoria from Mr Bassam Abu Sharif and Mr Yasser Abed-Rabbo, aides to the chairman Mr Yassir Arafat, contrasting with pessimism from political department head Mr Farouk Khaddoumi. The Hamas Islamic Resistance movement has said it will do everything to block a deal. The fundamentalist group is the main rival of the PLO in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the spokesman for the 400 deported Palestinian radicals stranded since last December in southern Lebanon, said that Moslems throughout the world rejected any deal recognising Israel.</p>

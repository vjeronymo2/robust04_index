			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC CAPSULES;  </P> <P> ENGLAND'S PSYCHIC TV RECEIVES SPOTTY RECEPTION  </P> <P> Genesis P-Orridge created the forerunner of all industrial terror-music groups  (Throbbing Gristle), led a pseudo-religion and has exhibited his body piercings  in underground publications. These days the Englishman and his group Psychic TV  play a style called acid house that mixes minimal, disco-dub "house" rhythms  with psychedelic electronic effects.  </P> <P> With its light shows, films and writhing fans in both gloom-doom and neo-hippie  attire, Psychic TV's show at Helter Skelter on Friday resembled a '90s version  of a Merry Pranksters' hippie-era acid test. As three musicians played along  with tapes and P-Orridge's wife Paula manipulated a drum machine, he started  out lucid, but as the night throbbed on, he slipped into his own altered state,  droning indistinguishable slogans against a never-ending, never-changing trance  groove. It might have provided some with hypnotic catharsis, but one man's  ecstasy was another man's agony. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

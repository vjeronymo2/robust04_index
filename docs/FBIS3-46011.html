The output value of rural enterprises in 1992 was 30 percent  up over the previous year in Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai  Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ningxia  Hui Autonomous Region in Northwest China.    For the impoverished minority nationality regions, township  enterprises have become essential to economic development in  rural areas, the officials say.    Meanwhile, for three consecutive years between 1991 and  1993,  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Central West China had been  leading the country in the growth of township enterprises. Last  year, their total output value hit 60.1 billion yuan, or 2.15  times that of the previous year.    To shorten the discrepancy with other economically developed  areas of the country, these regions have been putting more  investments into rural enterprises.    In Shaanxi Province, some enterprises have begun to attract  foreign funds. In the first half of last year, foreign  investors set up more than 50 joint ventures with local township  enterprises involving a total investment of 600 million yuan.    The share-holding system is taking root in such enterprises.  Gansu Province now has some 10,000 share-holding township  enterprises, while share-holding township enterprises in Shaanxi  Province account for ten percent of the total.    At the same time, new and high technology is playing an  increasing more important role. Many of the rural enterprises  are upgrading their technology and readjusting products mix. A  number of large-scale and modern township enterprises are taking  shape.</p>

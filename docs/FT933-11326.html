			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: ABB eyes Russian power venture ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is in talks which could lead to it becoming the first western company to produce power plant from a former Russian defence factory. ABB confirmed this week it was in joint-venture discussions over the future of a Russian defence and aero-engine factory, although it declined to say where the factory was or with whom it was negotiating. LegIt added it was talking to a number of possible partners about joint ventures in Russia. The Zurich-based company is known to be considering developing local production of power plant in Russia. Use of a former defence and aero-engine plant could enable it to produce equipment such as gas turbines for the local market. ABB is keen to sell combined-cycle gas turbine plants in Russia, which many observers believe would be a better option for Russia, with its abundant gas supplies, than modernising its nuclear power stations. Other western power equipment manufacturers have ventures in Russia, but not with defence factories. Siemens of Germany has a joint venture with Leningrad Metal Works, a St Petersburg steam turbine producer. The venture, Interturbo, will develop and manufacture gas turbines for the Russian market and eventually for export. GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, signed a co-operation agreement in 1991 with the Kirov Works, another St Petersburg steam turbine producer. The deal covers the manufacture, assembly and packaging of 25MW gas turbines for the Russian market. ABB has in recent years placed greater emphasis on expansion in eastern Europe - particularly Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary - and views Russia as a long-term opportunity.</p>

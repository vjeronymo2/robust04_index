			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter (3): Retail standards: while cheerful experts exist, others are missing a competitive trick Sir, I wholeheartedly endorse Samuel Brittan's lament about the poor quality of service in high street stores. Requirements for competitive success in the retail sector are changing, with important consequences for corporate decision-makers. Recent discussions with leading managers in both food and non-food companies suggest that their strategic thinking is currently a mixture of old and new. Sites, technology and merchandising are still considered important. For the future, however, these executives suspect that the recruitment, training and motivation of people will be increasingly critical to success. Advantage will lie in human resources, but there is not a great deal of evidence to suggest that retail managers have the tools fully to exploit this in a climate of major demographic change, skill shortages and increased competition.

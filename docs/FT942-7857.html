			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Warning of higher share charges Private investors are likely to face higher charges for share dealing as a result of shorter settlement periods for equity trades, says Fidelity Brokerage, a leading broker for individual investors. However, shorter settlement periods and ultimately a system of paperless share trading would bring benefits to private investors, Mr Mark Collier, chief executive of Fidelity Brokerage, said. From July 18 the London Stock Exchange will abandon its two-week or three-week account settlement periods and shares will have to be paid for or delivered to buyers 10 business days after each bargain is struck. By the middle of next year it is intended that the settlement period will be cut to five days. The Bank of England has called for the City to shorten the period for equities settlement to reduce risks for participants and to bring London in line with other leading financial centres. It has been developing its Crest project for paper-less share trading, a key step in reducing settlement periods, since the collapse of the Stock Exchange's Taurus project for paperless share trading. Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, said on Saturday that paperless share settlement alone should not raise costs for private investors. Speaking at a conference of the Association of Private Clients and Investment Managers, Mr George said that Crest would allow private investors to continue to settle transactions in paper. He added: 'There is no reason that I can think of why this should be any more expensive than it is now.' Paper-based settlement, however, was not likely to be as cheap as electronic share settlement. Mr George said: 'It follows from the voluntary nature of the system that a 'two-dated' market is likely to develop.' Paper-based trades under this system would be settled within a longer period than electronic trades.</p>

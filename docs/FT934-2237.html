			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Consumer group misled readers The Consumers' Association yesterday admitted to being embarrassed after the Advertising Standards Authority found it guilty of misleading advertising. The authority upheld a complaint by a reader of New Scientist over a leaflet promoting a prize draw run by the association's Which? magazine. The leaflet, inserted in New Scientist, was headed: 'We've doubled your chances of winning the Pounds 250,000 grand first prize. Specially for readers of New Scientist.' It went on to state: 'We usually offer six prize draw numbers but for you we have allocated 12 numbers.' The complainant maintained that if everyone received 12 numbers, the chance of winning would remain the same. The association admitted that the insert appeared in 90 magazines, but said most respondents would have come from mailings offering six numbers. The authority said it was 'concerned that the insert implied that the 12 numbers were unique to readers of the New Scientist' and upheld the complaint. Ms Lesley Godwin, the Consumers' Association head of marketing, said yesterday: 'The ASA is there to monitor advertising and it's absolutely right that they should monitor ours just as much as anybody else's. 'It is embarrassing and I'm sorry it happened but if that is the way the ASA have interpreted it (the British Code of Advertising Practice) I obviously accept their judgment. We'll make sure that we don't take that slant in the future.'</p>

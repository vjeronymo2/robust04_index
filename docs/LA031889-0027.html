			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EFFECT OF SIDEKICK PROBLEMS UNKNOWN  </P> <P> Ron Fowler, owner of the Sockers, said Friday that it is premature to speculate  about how the financial difficulties of the Dallas Sidekicks will affect the  remainder of the Major Indoor Soccer League season.  </P> <P> Robert McGuire, a U.S. bankruptcy judge, ruled Thursday in Dallas that the  Sidekicks must post $260,000 by 1:30 p.m. Monday or face foreclosure by their  major creditor, Dallas Basketball LTD.  </P> <P> On Feb. 13, the Sidekicks filed for Chapter 11 protection after learning the  Dallas Mavericks, the team's previous owner, planned to request an order in  state court for the Sidekicks to surrender all assets because of an outstanding  note of $360,000 that was due in July of 1988.  </P> <P> Socker President Ron Cady said there is nothing at this point that would lead  him to believe that the Sidekicks will be prevented from playing the remainder  of the season.  </P> <P> The MISL has requested a 72-hour postponement of Monday's deadline to give  directors from each team an opportunity to discuss solutions. Fowler will  participate in a conference call Monday morning.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping the judge will honor the request," Fowler said. "We want to make  sure we can look at the options in an enlightened manner without the pressure  of Monday's deadline." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

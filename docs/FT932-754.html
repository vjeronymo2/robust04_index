			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BUPA premium changes BUPA is to cut premiums on some of its medical insurance schemes and freeze others, but subscribers to the main BUPACare scheme aged over 60 will face premium increases of up to 12 per cent. Rates will be cut by 10 per cent for the low-cost schemes Healthchoice, which covers private treatment if the NHS waiting list is more than six weeks, and Essentialcare, which has exclusions such as outpatient consultations. Premiums will be frozen for the LocalCare scheme, where treatment is restricted to one local hospital, and for Healthcash, which pays cash for in-patient stays, pregnancy and so on. However, rates for BUPACare, the full medical insurance scheme used by 95 per cent of customers, will increase. Premiums for subscribers under 44 will go up by less than 5 per cent and for those aged 45-59 by about 5 or 6 per cent, but older customers will pay for the fact that the usage of policies by their age group has increased significantly. Rates will increase by 12 per cent for customers aged 60-64; those over 65 face rises of between 10.5 and 11.5 per cent. BUPA reviews its premiums twice a year. The new rates will apply to customers renewing a policy in the six months from July. In 1991-92, rate rises averaged 25 per cent. The figure for 1993 is less than 14 per cent. Arthur Large, managing director of BUPA membership, said the slow-down in price increases was the result of cost containment.</p>

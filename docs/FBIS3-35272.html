Brigadier General Sayyid Farid, director of the General  Department for al-Jizah Investigations, said that the storming  of the slum areas also resulted in the arrest of 145 fugitive  extremists from Upper Egypt. The security forces also seized a  number of firearms, including three machine guns.    He said that within the framework of instructions from  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on the need to extensively  search for activists, during this campaign, in which most of the  security organs participated, the security forces succeeded in  resolving many cases, including 15 drug cases of various kinds,  and in shutting down numerous drug dens.    The search forces -- led by Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Wahhab  Khalil, head of the Investigations Department -- succeeded in  arresting 48 fugitives who were fleeing various sentences for  crimes they had committed. They also arrested a number of gangs  specializing in robbing houses and stores in all parts of  al-Jizah.    The director of the General Department for Investigations  noted that the defendants confessed to their crimes and have  been referred to the prosecution for interrogation and  investigation.</p>

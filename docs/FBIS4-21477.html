			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Boeckh: ``Chemical Industry </F> Fears Black Market''; Subhead: ``EU Commission Raised 1994  Import Quotas for CFC's'']    [Text]Frankfurt, 11 March 1994 -- It was only recently  learned that the EU Commission has massively increased the 1994  import quotas for chlorofluorocarbons[CFC's] and halons. The  chemical industry in the FRG is now up in arms against this  decision. It fears that its efforts so far to develop  substitutes will be frustrated.    Back in the seventies, atmospheric scientists warned of a  thinning out of the ozone layer in the stratosphere as a result  of CFC's that had proven themselves so overwhelmingly in daily  use as propellants in sprays, cooling or cleaning agents or as  foaming agents. The scientists' warning did not go unheeded.  Industry went all out in the search for new, environmentally  friendly substances. Manfred Ritz, spokesman for the Chemical  Industry Association [VDI] in Frankfurt acknowledges the success  of development activities in the branch: ``By now there is an  adequate substitute for virtually all applications.''    For instance, ``R134a'' (hydrofluorocarbon [HFC]), a  chlorine-free fluorocarbon is now available as a substitute for  cooling systems that will not harm the ozone. Naturally, such a  substitute is not to be had free of charge. In the words of Dr.  Rudolf Staab, head of the ``specialty products'' business unit  at Hoechst AG, Frankfurt: ``Such substances currently cost three  to four times more than CFC's because of higher raw material  costs and more expensive production.'' This may also be the  reason for the present emergence of a ``gray market'' for CFC's  and halons through the back door, as it were, and yet completely  legal. In the future they will be allowed to be imported in  large quantities from non-EU countries. For in the EU's latest  decision, the import quota for CFC's from third countries into  the EU was dramatically increased.    VCI spokesman Manfred Ritz characterized it as a ``low-blow  to environmental policy.'' And Dr. Hartmut Vennen, a spokesman  for Hoechst, remarked that the decision was ``political  shenanigans at the expense of the environment.'' Still, what  lurks beneath the patently questionable decision from Brussels?    As so often, it is the different political position inside  and outside the EU that operates at the expense of environmental  protection. The European signatories to the Montreal Agreement  at their November 1992 meeting in Copenhagen resolved that  production and consumption of fully halogenated CFC's in Europe  in 1994 were not to exceed an amount of 46,000 ``Ozone Depletion  Potential [ODP] tons.'' Using the descriptor ``ODP'' as a  clearing-quantity, allowance is made for the different ozone  depletion potentials of the individual compounds.    As of 1 January 1995, production and marketing of CFC's in  the EU is prohibited, albeit not their use. Only in the FRG will  it be forbidden to operate new systems with CFC's as of 1995.  This is because of the 6 May 1991 ``ordinance prohibiting CFC's  and halons.'' In plain terms, however, that means that in the  future, old systems in Germany as well as old and new systems in  other European countries may be unrestrictedly cooled with CFC's.    But, if dealing in freshly manufactured CFC's is outlawed,  where are the CFC's to be gotten from? The alternative here is  to import ``used goods'' from all corners of the world, for,  even countries that have signed the Montreal Agreement may go on  merrily producing them. The People's Republic of China [PRC],  for example, currently has an annual per capita consumption of  nearly 0.05 kg. Like all developing countries, however, it is  allowed to produce 0.3 kg annually per capita. Rudolf Staab's  prediction is: ``In the future, China all by itself will make up  for it if the western world backs out of the production of  CFC's.''    Even worse is the fact that China, India and the CIS  countries as producers are busily seeking out customers in the  industrial nations that are now heading towards zero in their  production of CFC's and want to market their new substitutes. An  indication that this suspicion is not groundless is the enormous  amounts of CFC's ordered by EU importers this year in Brussels.  Dr. Heinrich Kraus, assistant minister in the federal  environmental ministry and responsible for the safety of  chemicals and their impact on the environment acknowledges:  ``The amounts requested were so exorbitantly high that some  applicants did not even get any amount.'' Hence, the EU approved  ``only'' an additional amount of 26,000 t of CFC's, 20,000 t of  halons and 85,000 t of carbon tetrachlorides, each in ODP units.    Naturally, this decision runs counter to neither the  Montreal  nor the Copenhagen protocol. The reason is that specific terms  are linked to the new import licenses. Only used or recycled  goods may be imported. ``Where are the 26,000 t of recycled  goods supposed to come from,'' asks Staab. And chemists  corroborate the suspicion: recycled and new CFC's are chemically  identical and therefore analytically indistinguishable. For this  reason Staab's fear is: ``In those third countries there is no  recycling anywhere, only the labeling.''    In the federal environmental ministry there is a calm  reaction to this charge: ``The Commission has also recognized  this handicap and devised a self-declaration form that has been  forwarded to all potential importers,'' explains assistant  minister Kraus. On it, each importer is obliged to state  specifically where the material originates and also guarantee  that it is recycled or used material.    Kraus states: ``If `black market goods' are involved, fines  of up to DM100,000 are payable.'' To be sure, he does not  dispute the fact that it will be difficult for an official in  Brussels to inspect a producer's recycling capacities in China,  India or beyond the Urals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 2 May (EFE) -- LA REPUBLICA reported today  that several Peruvian Army members cut the throats of five  people, one of them a 13-year-old girl, in the northern jungle  region, according to an accusation made by the wife of one of  the victims, who witnessed the murder.    According to the witness, Amalia Tolentino, whose  whereabouts  are being kept secret, the bodies of five people found near  Moyuna are peasants whose throats had been cut by Army soldiers  who arrested them on 8 April.    One of the dead is Jesus Vera Virgilio, Tolentino's husband,  who was murdered despite having identified himself as an Army  informer.    Tolentino said that an Army patrol commanded by a captain  murdered the five people after accusing them of being  terrorists. She said she was pardoned because she was carrying a  baby girl.    The daily reported that she found her husband's body with a  slit throat.    This case was reported by Tolentino to the special  prosecutor  for human rights in Huanuco, capital of Huanuco Department in  the northern jungle region, where since 5 April a military  antiterrorist operation has been under way in Leoncio Prado  Province.    A prosecutor and several doctors examined on 29 April the  remains of the five people, of whom only the bones were left.    According to the doctors, the skulls and long bones showed  no  signs of gunshot wounds, and therefore the cause of death was  not established. They added, however, that they were probably  killed before 5 April, when the military operations began.    The bodies were buried at the same site, and no autopsy was  carried out.    Francisco Diez Canseco, president of the National Peace  Council, said that "it is obvious" that "isolated cases" of  human right violations were made during the military operation.    Despite this, Diez Canseco believes that accusations by the  Human Rights National Coordinating Board of the bombing of  civilians and the deaths of dozens of people are exaggerated.    Diez Canseco admitted, however, the case involving two women  who said they were raped by soldiers. He said: "The women said  they were able to escape, but others were not so lucky and were  murdered."    He admitted: "It is a fact that abuses were committed."    The U.S. State Department demanded of the Peruvian  Government  an investigation into the charges, and the Peruvian Foreign  Ministry answered with a harsh communique claiming an  "unfriendly" U.S. attitude.    Carlos Blanco, president of the Human Rights Committee in  Congress, said he will visit the U.S. Embassy in Lima today to  protest the "interference in the country's internal affairs."</p>

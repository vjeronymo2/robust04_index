			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg April 13 TASS -- "If NATO air strikes in  the area of Gorazde could help settle the Bosnian crisis, this  would be the only correct solution," deputy speaker of the the  Russian Parliament upper chamber Ramazan Abdulatipov who now  participates, as a member of the Russian parliamentary  delegation, in a regular session of the Council of Europe  parliament assembly, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS here on  Wednesday.    "But I know from my own experience that the use of force  only  aggravates, as a rule, the state of racial relations and does  not lead to the solution of a problem," he added.    "In my opinion," Abdulatipov stressed, "the true solution of  the problem is not in Washinton or Moscow, as some people  believe, but in the land of Croats, Serbs and Moslems. No way  out of the crisis will be found until they come to agreement  with each other."    He expressed apprehension at the same time that this action  can be used by chauvinistic forces in Russia to "revive Slavic  nationalism". "This is not in the interests of Russia. Besides,  this does not settle the Bosnian problem," Abdulatipov stressed.</p>

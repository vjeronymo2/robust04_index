"We do not have an understanding yet that the U.S.  Government  officially approved such action," Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. But "I hope the U.S.  side will refrain from taking unilateral action of retaliation."    He said such action would close the door to dialogue between  the two nations.    The U.S. is considering taking retaliatory action against  Japan's cellular phone market, saying full foreign participation  in the market is restricted. The move comes after the breakdown  of trade negotiations held under a bilateral framework trade  accord concluded last July.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Monday Japan will make  voluntary efforts to whittle down its trade surplus with the  U.S. before the summit of the Group of Seven major economic  powers in Naples, Italy, in July.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy leader of </F> the Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio  Broadcasting, by Anatoliy Vystorobets; place and date not given:  "State Television Is To Be"]    [Text] In his address to deputies of the Russian  parliament, Russian President B.N. Yeltsin stated that the  television channel whose influence extends to the CIS countries  and to several East European countries should remain  state-owned. The name of the channel was not given. We  approached Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy leader of the Russian  Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, asking  him to clarify the issue in question.    [Lazutkin] I welcomed this statement by Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin with great enthusiasm and hope. Finally, a real  opportunity emerges to resolve in a dignified and coherent  manner the questions of preserving and consolidating the  positions of Russian national television.    Ostankino's first channel is a button which is hotter than  the nuclear button. In my opinion, the president's address to  deputies evinced an understanding of this fact and an awareness  of high responsibility. The first channel is working for the  long term, for the life and development of the CIS countries and  the unification of their economic, information, and cultural  areas.    [Vystorobets] At the same time Ostankino's corridors are  awash with rumors about the company's imminent flotation.    [Lazutkin] I would not call the idea of floating Ostankino a  brilliant one. There are more intentions here than  realistically calculated possibilities. At any rate, I do not  know of a single existing model of flotation capable of  satisfying the civic and public requirement for a national  television channel and ensuring its high-quality and  uninterrupted operation.    And when all is said and done, the debate over the flotation  of the federal channel is contrived and artificial. But it is  infectious and dangerous. Imagine, if someone had the idea of  floating missile complexes or tank troops. Ridiculous! But the  strategic significance of federal television as the most  powerful factor in Russia's information and cultural influence  is immeasurable.    [Vystorobets] Does this mean that the president's address  reflected certain views held by the leadership of the Russian  Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting?    [Lazutkin] I am happy that our views coincide.    [Vystorobets] Don't you consider the existence in Russia of  two state television and radio broadcasting companies as strange?    [Lazutkin] When I speak of the opportunity for a coherent  and dignified resolution of the questions of Russian state  television, I primarily have this problem in mind. Its solution  is quite simple, and, most importantly, expedient. The  possibility for the normal development of federalwide television  and radio broadcasting, for the normal function of the 90-plus  regional state television broadcasting companies will thereby be  attained.</p>

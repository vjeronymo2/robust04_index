			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (8): An unexpected success story - Captive insurance ALMOST by accident, the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin has discovered captive insurance. Or more accurately, the captive insurance industry has discovered the IFSC. When the Irish Industrial Development Authority (IDA) set out on its marketing drive to attract international companies to locate in Ireland, the captive insurance business was not on its target list. The IDA was after banks, fund managers and insurance companies. That was in 1987. Then, in early 1988, things changed. 'We had a brainstorming session with six chief executives of Irish insurance companies,' explains Mr David Hanna, the IDA's director of international financial services. 'The captive insurance industry was very well developed in the US and the consensus was that it was beginning to take off in Europe. There was an opportunity for a good location for setting up captive insurance arms, and the IFSC seemed to be it. By May 1988, captive insurance was on our target list.' The result is that there are now more captive insurance and reinsurance companies in the IFSC than there are banks or fund managers - 65 by early June this year - and that figure is expected to grow as the IDA continues its marketing effort and as more European companies set up captive insurance divisions. A captive is a wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary established by an industrial, commercial or governmental organisation to underwrite all or part of the risk of the organisation and its affiliates. The aim is to try to keep as much as possible of the huge premiums, paid out every year by corporations in insurance cover, within the group. 'The captive chooses lines of insurance that have a good loss history,' explains Mr Eamonn O'Brien, manager of Alexander Insurance Managers, one of several companies providing captive insurance management services in the IFSC. The captive lays off most of the risk to reinsurers but retains a greater share of the premium income than it does of the risk. The idea first took hold in the US, according to Mr Garry Cullen, a director of Sedgwick Dineen, the Irish arm of the Sedgwick Group in London. 'I would say about 30 per cent of the companies in the Fortune 500 have captive insurance arms,' he says. US corporations use Bermuda and Barbados as their main captive locations. So what is it about the IFSC that makes it such an attractive location for the captive insurance industry? When companies are considering a domicile for a captive, they look for technical expertise, good communications, formalised insurance legislation, tax efficiency, political stability and a good operating environment. Dublin is seen as having a good mix of these qualities. Where Dublin is seen to have the edge on its main European rivals - Luxembourg, the Isle of Man and Guernsey are the other main European centres  -is in the ability of captives located in the IFSC to write direct insurance into the EC. This, coupled with the 10 per cent tax rate applicable to profits up to 2005 (extended from 2000), makes Dublin unique among captive locations in Europe. Mr Cullen says the fact that the EC has accepted the low tax rate for a certain period gives the ISFC added legitimacy as a location, rather than being perceived purely as a tax haven, such as the Isle of Man or Guernsey. Being located in the IFSC also allows captives to take advantage of 22 double taxation agreements which the Republic of Ireland has signed with trading partners. This ensures that the benefits of the low tax rate applying to the IFSC can be passed back to the parent company without further deduction of tax on remitted dividends. Many of the big European and US insurance companies, including Aachener &amp; Munchener, American International, Marsh &amp; McLennan and Cologne Re, have established themselves at the IFSC. Companies which have set up captive insurance arms there include BMW, Volkswagen, Siemens, and Asea Brown Boveri.</p>

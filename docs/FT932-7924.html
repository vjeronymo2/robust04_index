			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Superdrug cuts prices of condoms SUPERDRUG, the high street discount retailer, yesterday cut the price of condoms by up to a third at all 680 of its shops, signalling a fresh round of its continuing price-war with its main rival, Boots, the UK's largest chemist chain, Gary Mead writes. This is the third significant price reduction by Superdrug in 18 months. Superdrug cut prices on fine perfumes by 30 per cent at 42 of its stores in the run-up to last Christmas. At the end of April it took 25 per cent off the prices of branded suncare products, and Boots responded with reductions of 30 per cent. Prices of 19 types of condom from the two leading brands - Durex and Mates - and Femidom, a newly launched female condom, will be cut immediately. The UK condom market - worth about Pounds 45m at retail prices - is the subject of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. Superdrug estimated yesterday that its price reductions would save a typical couple more than Pounds 30 annually.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LIMITS ON KIDS' SHOW ADS BACKED  </P> <P> A House committee today approved legislation to reimpose limits on commercials  in children's TV shows and require broadcasters to provide quality TV programs  for children or lose their licenses.  </P> <P> The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote, sent the Children's  Television Practices Act to the full House, where it was expected to pass  easily. Congress passed the same bill last year, but then-President Ronald  Reagan let it die without his signature.  </P> <P> Authors of the bill said it was designed to stop the "over-commercialization"  of children's TV shows by reinstituting limits on the amount of advertising  that can be shown on such programs. The Federal Communications Commission in  1974 limited commercials to 9 1/2 minutes per hour on such shows but repealed  those limits in 1984.  </P></p>

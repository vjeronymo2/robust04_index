			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Newspapers here  today issued editorials and commentaries criticizing Britain for  trying to shift its responsibility for undermining Sino-British  cooperation to China by publishing "White Paper" about the  Sino-British talks.    The British side Thursday unilaterally published a White  Paper entitled "Representative Government in Hong Kong", to  disclose the contents of 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks  held last year, despite of an understanding it reached with  China not to disclose to the public the contents of the  negotiations.    The daily newspaper "TA KUNG PAO" in an editorial said that  "the White Paper was designed to deceive the public to believe  that the controversy between the two sides is concentrated on  the development of democracy in Hong Kong."    However, the editorial said, the essence of the Sino-British  controversy doesn't lie in whether or not there should be  democracy in Hong Kong but in whether the agreements and  understanding already reached between the two sides should be  honored.    Although the White Paper is compiled by the British side  according to its needs, it can be seen clearly between the lines  that the British side failed to confirm the principles set in  the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region and understandings and  agreements reached between China and Britain.    The British side had agreed that the Sino-British talks on  the arrangements of Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections should be  conducted on the basis of these documents, understandings and  agreements, the editorial noted.    Another newspaper "WEN WEI PO" said in its editorial "A  Complete Fraud" that in the White Paper, the British side tried  to cover what it has done in undermining the Sino-British talks  and escaping from the historic responsibility it should bear.    Recalling the political development on the Hong Kong issue  over the past few years especially since Patten took office as  the governor in 1992, the editorial said, "what the British side  has done is nothing but a complete fraud."    "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" in a commentary said that as  the  foundation for Sino-British cooperations on the Hong Kong issue  has been seriously undermined, adverse impact is inevitable in  political, economic and other fields.    For example, it said, the Hong Kong stock market suffered a  sharp drop as a result of Patten's announcement to publish the  White Paper and push ahead with his reform package on Thursday.</p>

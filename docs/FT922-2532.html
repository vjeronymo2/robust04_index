			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BET looking for a change of identity BET, the business services company which reported a sharp fall in profits yesterday, is going through a fundamental change of culture. After five years in which the previous management made 170 acquisitions and very little was spared on capital expenditure, Mr John Clark, chief executive, is trying to turn what was, in effect, a financial holding company into an operating company. Unfortunately, the climate in which he is trying to perform this alchemy is less than propitious. After a tough year in which it had to cut its total dividend from 13.25p to 6.5p, barely covered by earnings, the economy is unlikely to give very much help. 'While considerable progress has been made at BET . . . more work will be needed over the next two years to . . . reposition BET as a dynamic growth company,' Mr Clark said yesterday. Operationally, BET's problems appear to be greatest in the UK where 57 per cent of sales are derived. Operating profits fell to Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 185.4m), although on lower sales after the disposal of Biffa, the waste management company. Within the UK, plant services was badly hit by the recession which undercut margins and volume and led to a halving of operating profits to Pounds 31.6m. Textile services fell from Pounds 84.5m to Pounds 52.8m, again with most of the fall in the UK. Cleaning services fell marginally to Pounds 24m as did security services to Pounds 15.3m while distribution services performed well to fall only 4 per cent to Pounds 32.8m after a disposal. BET's 'other' services, which include the personnel and joinery businesses, fell from operating profits of Pounds 18m to a loss of Pounds 1.1m. During the year Mr Clark said the company had focused on generating cash. It had cut its cost base by Pounds 62m, shedding 20,000 staff, at a one-off cost of Pounds 75m which was covered by previously established provisions. 'The importance of cash flow has been stamped on the culture of the company during the year,' Mr Clark said. 'We have to get productivity gains to offset inflation in order to retain as much as possible of that Pounds 62m.' Mr Clark said BET would be cash generative over the next year and strongly positive in the second half before taking into account the proceeds of disposals. During the year BET also sold 10 small under-performing companies, utilising Pounds 8m of the Pounds 90m provision set up for the purpose at the interim stage. Mr Clark expected more than Pounds 100m as proceeds of the sale of other companies to be sold. As part of the management and financial restructuring, BET has cut the number of profit centres from 170, with an average sales level of Pounds 30m, to 110. After little more than a year at the helm of BET, Mr Clark dismissed the idea that business service companies were recession resistant, one of the late 1980 theories that once held water. 'Until you have been through a full cycle you do not know if the business is recession resistant,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and Saudi Arabia agreed  Tuesday to strengthen bilateral relations, Japanese Government  officials said.    The officials said the agreement was reached at a meeting  between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Hisham Muhyi-al-Din  Nazir, Saudi Arabian petroleum and mineral resources minister.    Nazir, who arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a seven-day visit,  handed Hata a letter from King Fahd and expressed hope that  political and economic relations between the two countries will  be strengthened, the officials said.    Hata responded affirmatively and thanked Saudi Arabia for  its  efforts to maintain stable oil supplies to Japan, they said.    Nazir urged Japan to cooperate on a joint oil refining  project in Japan, which has been held up since last November,  they said.    Hata was quoted as saying it is a private undertaking and  the  government hopes a mutually beneficial agreement will be reached.</p>

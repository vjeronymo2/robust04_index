			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Top Canadian bank battered by loan losses Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has had another disappointing year, with earnings hit by restructuring charges and unexpectedly high loan losses, especially in real estate. Net earnings totalled CDollars 300m (USDollars 225.7m), or 46 cents a share, in the year to October 31, compared with CDollars 107m, or a loss of five cents a share, in 1992. Return on equity was a meagre 2.4 per cent, following last year's negative return of 0.3 per cent. The previously-announced charges, totalling CDollars 410m, reflect the costs of integrating the operations of Royal Trust, which the bank acquired earlier this year, and an internal restructuring plan. RBC is cutting 4,100 jobs from its payroll, equal to almost 8 per cent of its workforce. After the charges, the bank posted a CDollars 420m fourth-quarter loss, equal to CDollars 1.47 a share, against a loss of CDollars 473m, or CDollars 1.63, a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions for the year were CDollars 1.75bn. This is lower than the CDollars 2.05bn set aside in 1992, when the bank was hit by its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the failed real estate developer. The final 1993 provisions, however, are more than double the CDollars 820m estimated at the end of the first quarter. Provisions for sour commercial real-estate loans have now reached 20 per cent of the bank's gross property portfolio. Ms Donna Toth, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, said RBC's problems stemmed from aggressive lending policies with inadequate controls. Several of the bank's most senior corporate credit officers have taken early retirement in the past year. On the brighter side, Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said retail banking and treasury operations performed strongly, while the bank's investment banking subsidiary, RBC Dominion Securities, posted record earnings. Non-performing loans have dropped to CDollars 3.26bn on October 31 from CDollars 3.48bn a year earlier, with the level of non-performing consumer loans falling for the first time in four years. The inclusion of Royal Trust from September boosted assets by 19 per cent to CDollars 164.9bn. Royal Trust's operations have been 'close to' break-even since then.</p>

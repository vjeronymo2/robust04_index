This is what Francois  Mitterrand told the American secretary of state, Warren  Christopher, whom he received for 45 minutes at the Elysee  Palace. The American foreign minister also met Alain Juppe and  Edouard Balladur.    Meanwhile, in Bosnia, British General Michael Rose has  replaced Belgian Francis Briquemont as the head of the UN  soldiers.

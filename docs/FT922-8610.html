			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Bad Blood - Theatre Griselda Gambaro's play is a hard nut, though flavoursome: you could break a tooth on it. In effect it is a chamber-sized Jacobean tragedy, but pithier and more rigorously focused than almost any in the original genre. Again steely passion replaces sentiment, and Grand Guignol goes hand in hand with viciously ironic comedy. In the tiny Gate theatre, Bad Blood exercises a ferocious grip for an hour and 40 minutes, with no interval - possibly because the pub downstairs is closed for refurbishing, but anyhow the right decision - and without a wasted moment. Beyond the Jacobean frame, it strikes specific modern veins. Not only a modern-psychological knowingness (which in this Argentinian play never compromises the passion, as it might in Northern latitudes); but a bleak, unblinking insight into what becomes of people under an arbitrary tyranny - both the tyrannised and the tyrant himself. Officially the scene is purely domestic, a grand house in the 1840s; patently it is a microcosm of a tyrannical society, though the point is underlined only by the intermittent rumble of execution-parades outside. Immune to any challenge, Father is the coldly perceptive, loveless tyrant. Mother, broken to his will long ago, has learned to notice nothing but what it is safe to see. Their nubile Dolores has been so hugely indulged - she is wilful, volatile, extravagant - that she thinks she can get away with anything; she is wrong about that, which is the story of the play. Father has carefully chosen as her tutor a young hunchback, poor Rafael, who knows that he daren't take any chances at all; though Dolores is intended for Juan Pedro, a thick aristocrat as brutal as her father (if much stupider), she conceives a burning love for Rafael. Things move inexorably toward catastrophe. No authorial tenderness is wasted upon anybody, but they all speak with such savage precision - or pointed evasions - that their exchanges seethe with embattled character. Marguerite Feitlowitz's elegant translation knows when to retain the forms of Gambaro's Spanish cadences, refusing to blur them into more 'natural' English. Equally the cast, with faultless direction by Kate Rowland, know how to make that a dramatic asset. Besides Peter Marinker's monstrous Father (never overplayed) and Marion Bailey's all-but-extinguished Mother, there is a gloating, ruthless servant by Kevin O'Donohoe to manage this domestic Hell. Louis Hilyer's prospective son-in-law is loathsome in every detail. Young John Padden cuts a memorable figure as Rafael: doe-eyed, pretty and weighed down by his hump, as prescribed, but quivering with shy Hispanic pride and wariness. And as Dolores, Alex Kingston captures a wild Latin spontaneity beyond the range of most Anglo-Saxon actresses; one might think it a raw natural gift, were her perpetual mood-switches not achieved with such technical control. She is the most dangerous creature on the stage. The Gate, Notting Hill, to May 30</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTOYA CASE: HOW MANY OTHER ROTTEN APPLES EXIST?;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> If Sen. Joseph Montoya is a rotten apple, as a jury of 12 ordinary citizens has  decided, then the next question is: How many other rotten apples are there in  the barrel of Capitol politicians?  </P> <P> Do the keepers of the barrel -- California's voters -- consider it so spoiled  that they will want to throw out the whole bunch this election year? Will they  try to douse the rotten odor with a major dose of political reform?  </P> <P> And to what extent is the Legislature capable of reforming itself?  </P> <P> The preliminary answers to these questions varied widely among politicians and  academicians Saturday, ranging from those who believe the whole Sacramento  barrel is rotten, to those who say it does no good to regulate politics. It's  human nature, they say; crooks will be crooks. Why should Sacramento be  different?  </P> <P> The Montoya jury, described by one academic as "the equivalent of a political  focus group," sent a strong message to the Legislature Friday that public  corruption will not be tolerated. But afterward, the federal jurors emphasized  that this was not their goal; they had concentrated solely, narrowly, on the  evidence against Montoya and wound up convicting the Whittier Democrat on seven  counts of extortion, racketeering and money-laundering.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, several jurors reported being shocked upon learning during the  two-month trial that legislators routinely raise huge amounts of money from  special interest groups seeking legislative action. They heard evidence of  lawmakers collecting hundreds of thousands in campaign contributions and  accepting honorariums of up to $10,000 for a single appearance before a lobby  group.  </P> <P> "It shook me up," said juror Rosemary Talamantez, a UC Davis librarian. "I was  surprised that there was so much money going back and forth. I had never even  thought about honorariums. We elect our officials and have faith that they  represent us. And here was Sen. Montoya playing around with people's money,  playing around with people's lives. I hope not all of them (legislators) are  like this."  </P> <P> Not all legislators are unethical. In fact, the consensus of Capitol politicos  -- lobbyists, observers and legislators themselves -- seems to be that most are  basically ethical, given the high-stakes, pricey political arena with the  gray-area rules in which they play. Still, most lawmakers find their personal  standards of integrity constantly put to the test by the need to raise campaign  contributions and live on a $40,800 annual salary without supplementing their  incomes with honorariums.  </P> <P> And not everyone around the Capitol believes that even most legislators are  ethical. For example, one highly respected, veteran political insider who has  held important posts in the Legislature, the executive branch and also among  special interest groups recently commented, on the condition he remain  anonymous: "In the '60s, it was like there was a barrel with a couple of rotten  apples. Now, I feel like we've got a whole barrel of rotten apples and a few  good ones in between."  </P> <P> The judicial system is in the process of trying to determine just how many  rotten apples there are. U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, working off of the same FBI  sting operation that snared Montoya, also has been investigating five other  elected officials and reportedly is widening his probe to other politicians who  have not yet been publicly identified.  </P> <P> Most legislators now expect the U.S. attorney to push aggressively for more  indictments, several made clear in interviews after Montoya's conviction.  </P> <P> Mindful that voters are becoming increasingly cynical about their  representatives -- a recent Times poll found that a majority of voters think it  is commonplace for lawmakers to take bribes -- legislators for the past year  have been debating various ethics proposals designed to improve their tarnished  image.  </P> <P> One plan will go before California voters in June. It would ban honorariums.  But it also would pave the way for a pay raise by creating an independent  commission with authority to raise lawmakers' salaries.  </P> <P> "I've always said that honoraria is thinly disguised bribery," said Sen. Ed  Davis (R-Valencia).  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) was among those lawmakers Saturday saying  the Legislature should immediately ban all honorariums and not wait for voter  approval of an ethics package tied to a potential pay increase.  </P> <P> "The hard thing is to get members (of the Legislature) to understand that they  may not be doing what Montoya did, but that's not the point," Katz said. "The  point is that what the public expects of us has changed, in the same way that  10 years ago we would never have considered banning smoking on airlines. What  was acceptable behavior then is not today. The public no longer views honoraria  as acceptable behavior."  </P> <P> For the last year, some legislators also have advocated other sweeping ethical  reforms, including limits on gifts and outside income and restrictions on  lobbying once legislators leave office. Such proposals, however, have been  bottled up in the Legislature.  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, as part of his race for governor, is  pushing a November ballot measure that would provide for public financing of  campaigns and impose California's first-ever limits on the number of years  elected state officials could remain in office. He calls Sacramento a "swamp."  </P> <P> But some experts question whether any of these "reforms" can clean up the  political mess. "You can't regulate politics," said Larry L. Berg, director of  the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "What Montoya did already was  against the law. If people are crooks, they're crooks."  </P> <P> Another academician, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the Center for  Politics and Policy at Claremont Graduate School, said "one message is that the  public is not going to tolerate the kind of behavior that the jury perceived."  </P> <P> "This was a jury of peers -- the public," she said. "I looked at it as the  equivalent of a political focus group. I think you could have taken a group of  12 people anywhere and they would have come to the same conclusion. They showed  the skepticism that the public generally feels about legislators. When it was  Montoya's word against anybody else's, it was anybody else they believed."  </P> <P> For the most part, jurors came to the trial with little experience in the world  of politics. The seven-woman, five-man jury included two mechanics, a utility  crew foreman, a former accountant for the state, a secretary, a student and a  postal worker. In fact, federal prosecutors and Montoya's attorneys had sought  to keep off the jury anyone who had personal knowledge of the legislative  process.  </P> <P> Some members of the jury, which included two Latinas, one black and one Asian,  said the prospect of convicting Montoya was emotionally traumatic, and at times  gave them headaches or left them unable to sleep or eat.  </P> <P> Talamantez said she was proud to have served on the jury and now has a better  sense of her duty as a citizen -- and the duty of public officials to conduct  their affairs honestly.  </P> <P> "We as citizens have a responsibility," she said. "The legislators have a  responsibility to us. I think it taught us a lesson: We should all read the  papers and watch the news."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Carl Ingram, Jerry Gillam and Ralph Frammolino contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

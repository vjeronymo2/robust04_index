			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU LOOKING TO START ANOTHER WINNING STREAK;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER BLOWOUT LOSS TO UAB, TOURNAMENT HOST SDSU HOPES TO  GET HEALTHY AGAINST NIAGARA. CLEMSON PLAYS VILLANOVA IN OPENING GAME.  </P> <P> Picked apart like a Christmas turkey last Friday by the University of Alabama  Birmingham, the San Diego State basketball team gingerly returns to the San  Diego Sports Arena tonight wondering whatever happened to its five-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> SDSU (6-4) plays Niagara (1-7) at 9 in the second game of the Texaco Star  tournament. The first game, at 6:30, features representatives of two of the  best basketball conferences in the country -- Villanova (6-5, Big East) against  Clemson (6-1, Atlantic Coast).  </P> <P> The Aztecs have reached the championship of their annual December tournament  each of the past three seasons, and have one title (1987) to show for it. The  Aztecs are in position to make it four in a row this year -- Niagara shouldn't  be a major roadblock.  </P> <P> But then again, who knows? On Dec. 16, the Aztecs were riding their longest  winning streak -- five games -- since 1984-1985 and things were coming  together. But that evening, they were flat in a loss at UC Irvine, and then  they went to the UAB Tournament and played two of their worst games of the  season.  </P> <P> "Basketball is a game played in spurts," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "If  you plot it on a graph, you are going to have highs and lows, and you just hope  the graph shows improvement. You're going to hit the lows, but you hope when  you plot the whole thing there's a nice increase."  </P> <P> SDSU is in need of an increase in several areas -- particularly shooting  percentage. The Aztecs made just 44.6% of their shots during a 67-53 victory  over Southwest Texas Thursday, and they hit a hard-to-believe 30% in their  91-46 loss to UAB the next night. The 45-point beating tied the record for the  most lopsided loss in SDSU history.  </P> <P> For the season, SDSU is shooting 43.4%.  </P> <P> "We need to start playing with enthusiasm," Brandenburg said. "We need to play  with intelligence. It's crunch time, time for us to get going. We have to play  with a great level of intensity."  </P> <P> As for the rest of the tournament, here are six points of interest, in no  particular order:  </P> <P> 1. The Name's the Thing: If college basketball junkies across the country have  a difficult time keeping track of SDSU's tournament, it's no wonder. The name  changes nearly as much as Zsa Zsa Gabor trades in husbands. It was known as the  Cabrillo tournament from its inception in 1976 through 1985, when it became the  Holiday Bowl. Last year, it was the McDonald's. Now, voila, the Texaco Star.  Whew.  </P> <P> 2. Ghosts of Christmas Past: Villanova has been here before. Coach Rollie  Massimino's team won the tournament in 1982, defeating SDSU in the championship  game, 63-57. The tournament has also been won by such high-profile teams as  Iowa, Indiana, DePaul, Virginia, Memphis State and Tennessee. Georgetown and  Patrick Ewing were in the 1980 tournament but were beaten by eventual champion  DePaul in the first round, 72-67.  </P> <P> 3. The ACC vs. Big East Challenge: A special made-for-TV week in the scheduling  in early December pitted ACC and Big East teams against each other. Not much  was settled -- the conferences battled to a 4-4 draw. Tonight's  Villanova-Clemson game is the first this season between the two schools.  </P> <P> 4. Speaking of television . . .: Thursday night's championship will be  broadcast live nationally on ESPN.  </P> <P> 5. The Coaches: The highest-profile guy in town is Massimino, who is in his  17th season at Villanova. It was in 1984-85 that Massimino guided Villanova to  a stunning upset against Georgetown and Ewing in the NCAA championship game.  The other end of the spectrum features Niagara coach Jack Armstrong who, at 26,  is the youngest Division I head coach in the nation. Cliff Ellis, meanwhile, is  in his sixth season at Clemson and Brandenburg is in his third at SDSU.  </P> <P> 6. The Rematch Possibilities -- SDSU vs. Villanova or Michael Best vs. Clemson:  SDSU will play either Villanova or Clemson Thursday. Either matchup should  prove interesting. The Aztecs opened the season with a 66-58 loss to Villanova  in the Maui Classic. Center Marty Dow led the Aztecs in that game with 15  points. Best had eight rebounds. If the Aztecs play Clemson, it will be a  special occasion for Best. He was a two-year letterman at Clemson before  transferring to SDSU.  </P></p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts' advance puts pressure on Campbell ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday announced a sharp rise in first-quarter profits, putting more pressure on Campbell Soup, the US food company, to increase its ADollars 8.80-a-share hostile takeover bid. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said net profits for the three months to September 30 rose by 33.9 per cent to ADollars 17.53m (USDollars 12.59m) from ADollars 13.09m a year earlier. Mr Purdy said the board expected the increase in full-year profits to be 'at least in line' with the the first quarter. Campbell is seeking a 17.2 per cent stake in Arnotts to add to its existing 33 per cent shareholding. The bid values the company at ADollars 1.2bn, but Campbell would pay only ADollars 209m to gain control. Arnotts shares have traded above the offer price since the bid was announced two weeks ago. The shares closed 1 cent higher on the Australian stock exchange yesterday at ADollars 9.13.</p>

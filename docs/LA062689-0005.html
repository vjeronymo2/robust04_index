			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A 72-year-old nun shot in the head by a gunman in El Salvador last week was  writing notes and squeezing the fingers of nurses in Houston's St. Paul  Hospital, good evidence she was recovering, her doctor said. "We have upgraded  her condition today from critical to serious," said Dr. Robert Baker. Sister  Mary Stanislaus Mackey, a member of Houston's Sisters of Charity of the  Incarnate Word, and two other nuns were driving near San Salvador when four  gunmen pulled alongside and fired a shot.  </P></p>

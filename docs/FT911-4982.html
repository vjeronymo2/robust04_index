			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Distortions in farm trade highlighted GATT'S REPORT on the EC spotlights how individual governments complicate the Community's external agricultural policy by setting up farm support programmes of their own and continue to insulate their domestic markets from trade effects. Taking Germany as an example, Gatt shows how the federal government had succeeded in 'defusing reform efforts' by the EC Commission. Germany has changed value added taxes and considerably expanded federal aid to 'disadvantaged regions' which make up half its total agricultural area. In 1988 federal aid amounted to DM445m (Pounds 148.30m) up from DM65m in 1983. Gatt points out that the bulk of farm commodities produced and consumed in the EC are decoupled from the world market through the system of variable levies by which Brussels bridges the gap between high EC farm prices and lower world market prices. This leads to an odd situation from the point of view of the multilateral trading system. The EC's major imports are coffee, soyabeans, oilcakes and shellfish, to which variable levies do not apply, while Brussels pays export subsidies, amounting to Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.14bn) in 1989, to find markets for surplus EC output of cereals, milk products and beef.</p>

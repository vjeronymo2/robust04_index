			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule proposed in the NPRM would apply to any tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission to that event. We stated that we did not wish to engage in line-drawing of the type that would be required were we to publish a list of specific events that would be covered by the rule. In addition, we said in the NPRM that we saw no justification for limiting the applicability of the rule to sporting events. Few commenters specifically suggested such a limitation, although a number of them offered sports contests as examples of the type of event that should be covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We stated that we agreed with the comments that suggested that the rule should apply to any event where a separate ticket is required for admission to the event or where there is limited admission. The proposed rule would apply to any tour to an event of the type described at the beginning of the previous paragraph in which the tour operator has represented that the tour includes admission to the event. If the event is free, or attendance is unlimited, the operator should have no trouble furnishing tickets and this rule will impose no burden. On the other hand, if tours are promoted to an unusually popular event of a non-sporting nature, those tour participants would be just as disappointed at not receiving the promised admission to the event that constituted the entire purpose of their trip as would a fan traveling to a bowl game.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We tentatively concluded in the NPRM that the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled air transportation, as well as to any other form of air service meeting the statutory definition of ``air transportation'' that may develop in the future. Thus, we proposed to apply it to ``scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would apply to all interstate (i.e., domestic) <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  air transportation, and to foreign (i.e., international) air transportation originating at a point within the United States. Applying the rule only to outbound international flights is consistent with the approach taken in the existing Public Charter rule (see 14 CFR 380.23) and with the ``country of origin'' concept of regulation of international air transportation. As a policy matter, the Department has less of an interest in applying this rule to tours originating in foreign countries whose participants are largely or exclusively foreign citizens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory term ``overseas air transportation,'' which referred to domestic transportation to or from U.S. territories or possessions, was abolished in a recent recodification of transportation laws. Such transportation is now included in the definition of ``interstate air transportation,'' and consequently would be covered by this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule that we proposed would apply to any operator of a tour that meets the rule's definition of a Special Event Tour, regardless of whether that operator is a direct air carrier (i.e., an airline), an indirect air carrier (e.g., a Public Charter operator), or a ticket agent (as defined in 49 U.S.C. &sect;40102, e.g., a scheduled-service tour operator, including a travel agent acting as a tour operator). The proposed rule would apply to both U.S. and foreign entities that act as operators of Special Event Tours, just as current &sect;399.87 does.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the comments of ATA and NACA, neither the ANPRM nor the NPRM proposed that this rule should include provisions that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where an airline might choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier of a Special Event Tour would incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common carrier either certificated under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41301 (formerly sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we had suggested in the ANPRM, the NPRM proposed to carry over the provisions from the existing Super Bowl rule that prohibit advertising or sale of such tours before game tickets are in hand or under contract. These provisions would be expanded to apply to all special events. This approach was supported by the comments on the ANPRM, and involves no novel processes since the existing procedures have been in place in the Super Bowl rule for 15 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the provision that prohibits advertising or sale of a Super Bowl tour until game tickets are in hand or under contract, the Super Bowl charter rule requires Super Bowl charter operators to include in the prospectus that is required to be filed with the Department for all Public Charters a certification that they have the game tickets in hand or else a copy of the contract for the game tickets. We did not propose to carry over this additional filing requirement to the new rule. The underlying requirement to have the tickets or ticket contracts before advertising or sales commence would remain and would be enforceable without the filing provision. Moreover, in those instances deemed necessary, we have ample authority under 49 U.S.C. &sect;41708 (formerly section 407(a) of the Federal Aviation Act) to require such information to be provided. The Super Bowl rules that apply to scheduled-service tours have never required a filing of this type. Since the NPRM proposed consolidating regulation of this type of tour in a single rule, we stated that we saw no justification for having a filing requirement for charter tours but not scheduled-service tours, nor did we see a need to impose a new paperwork burden on scheduled-service tour operators. This tentative decision was consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act and with the Department's proposal in Docket 48341 (57 FR 42864) to eliminate unnecessary paperwork burdens on charters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Strength of retail recovery doubted THE RECOVERY in consumer confidence and retail sales may be weaker than suggested by government statistics, according to a survey carried out by NOP for Verdict, the retail market research group. Each month NOP asks 2,000 adults throughout the UK whether they are seriously considering purchasing nine items - ranging from Pounds 100-worth of clothes to a house or flat - in the next six months. It adds the percentage of positive responses in each category together to form a purchasing intentions index. Verdict's index for July is 112, unchanged from June. The figures for the last two months are the lowest this year - after the index reached 125 in May, 117 in April and 126 in March - and are only slightly above the 110 recorded in July last year. Verdict said: 'These data are forward-looking, so that one cannot expect the figures to correlate precisely with current retail sales. But since we began the series these data have proved to be an excellent barometer of trends, and we remain convinced that official data are running seriously ahead of reality.' Verdict said it remained 'agnostic' about official statistics showing an inflation-adjusted increase in retail sales of almost 4 per cent year-on-year. For this increase to be true, it said, retail multiples would have to be experiencing growth of about 6 per cent and independent retailers about 3 per cent. The group said: 'Such levels of growth are not being achieved by the multiples with whom we are in touch.' Its own analysis suggests year-on-year growth across all sectors is about 2 per cent.</p>

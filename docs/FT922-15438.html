			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Kvaerner wins Pounds 196m ship deal Norway's Kvaerner group said yesterday that Kvaerner Masa-Yards, the Helsinki shipyard it owns, was awarded a NKr2.2bn (Pounds 196m) contract to build the fifth in a series of cruise ships for Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The 71,000-ton ship, to be called Imagination, is to be delivered in the autumn of 1995 and will have capacity for 2,600 passengers. Mr Erik Toenseth, Kvaerner's president, said yesterday that the new order brought Kvaerner Masa-Yards' net order book up to an estimated NKr9bn. Two sister-ships to Imagination, Sensation and Fantasy, are due for delivery from Masa-Yards respectively in 1993 and 1994. Kvaerner has two Finnish shipyards, one in Aabo and the other in Helsinki, which combined employ 4,100 people.</p>

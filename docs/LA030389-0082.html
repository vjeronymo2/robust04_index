			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 ARMORIES ADDED TO HOMELESS SHELTER LIST  </P> <P> Because of a surge in the number of homeless people seeking county vouchers for  motel rooms this winter, two National Guard armories in the San Gabriel Valley  have been added to the list of facilities available for use as emergency  shelters on cold and rainy nights.  </P> <P> An armory in Pomona was opened to the homeless Thursday, when Los Angeles  County's cold weather shelter program was activated for the first time since  Feb. 15. A Monrovia armory had also been scheduled for use but remained closed  because Salvation Army workers expected to operate the facility were out of  town, a county spokesman said.  </P> <P> "They assured us by (Friday) they will be available," said Larry Johnson, a  spokesman for the county's homeless coordination office.  </P> <P> The expanded use of armories comes as homeless program officials are preparing  to request extra funds from the Board of Supervisors for the second time this  winter.  </P> <P> Despite the recent stretch of warm weather, the number of homeless people  seeking emergency shelter from the county has nearly tripled from last year.  The shelter program has already received one supplemental allocation from the  supervisors -- $325,000 on Jan. 31 -- but only $50,000 remains, and officials  are planning to ask the board for another $125,000 on Tuesday, Johnson said.  </P> <P> If approved, the new allocation will bring funding for for the cold weather  program this season to $775,000.  </P> <P> "I think the $125,000 will be ample to get us through," Johnson said.  </P> <P> The 2-year-old shelter program runs from Nov. 1 to March 31. After that date,  officials will review the operation, Johnson said.  </P> <P> "We have to redesign the program so we can bring the cost down," he said. "It  really is much more expensive than anyone had envisioned."  </P> <P> The county provides emergency shelter when the overnight temperature is  expected to dip below 40 degrees or when the forecast calls for temperatures  below 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain.  </P> <P> The county has offered shelter at National Guard armories in Long Beach and  Culver City since last winter and in West Los Angeles since December. The  county also houses homeless people at a federal shelter in Bell.  </P> <P> The armories accommodate from 150 to 300 people each, and those in Long Beach  and Culver City have been filled to capacity when opened.  </P> <P> Officials said the two San Gabriel Valley armories were made available after  word spread among homeless people that two social service agencies there -- in  El Monte and Pomona -- would provide them with free housing in motels, rather  than in the mass shelters available elsewhere. Hundreds of people flocked to  the two agencies.  </P> <P> As a result, only homeless families with children now will get the motel  vouchers in the San Gabriel Valley, officials said. The Pomona office is  directing single adults to the armory in that community, while the El Monte  office will send homeless singles to the Monrovia armory.  </P> <P> In downtown Los Angeles and coastal communities such as Santa Monica, where  there are high concentrations of homeless adults, the county from the start of  the program has housed single adults in the armories, while giving families  motel vouchers, according to Verta Nash, coordinator of the county's efforts to  help the homeless.  </P> <P> But in the San Gabriel Valley, where last winter 85% of the homeless seeking  assistance were families, the county had been issuing motel vouchers to all  homeless people.  </P> <P> "We feel that group shelter is not conducive to families, so we voucher them to  hotels," Nash said.  </P> <P> The problem in the San Gabriel Valley this winter apparently arose when  homeless adults in a wide area learned that they could get the more desirable  motel housing there, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drawn From Afar  </P> <P> The voucher applicants have come from as far as Long Beach, Santa Monica and  San Bernardino County, authorities said. In contrast to last year, more than  90% of the homeless served in the San Gabriel Valley this winter have been  single men and women, Nash said.  </P> <P> "It appears that the numbers have increased significantly out there due to  people coming from San Bernardino County," which has no shelter program for the  homeless, Nash said.  </P> <P> In the El Monte service center operated by Catholic Charities, the staff  processed more than 300 voucher applications a day when the bad weather program  was activated. At the Pomona Neighborhood Center, which also has a contract  with the county to administer the program, an average of 50 adults and 10  families streamed through each day.  </P> <P> Paying $16 a night a person for motel rooms, county officials discovered that  the cost for the voucher program was escalating faster than they had expected.  Complicating matters is an unusually cold winter, which triggered more frequent  demand for emergency shelter, despite the recent warm spell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Cold Days  </P> <P> For example, in the San Gabriel Valley, the county had to activate the cold  weather program for only 24 days last winter. This winter, the program has been  activated on 57 days.  </P> <P> So far this season, the county has made available more than 20,000 bed spaces,  nearly double the 10,264 for all of last winter, Nash said.  </P> <P> Housing the homeless in armories, at $9 to $10 a person a night, is a more  cost-effective alternative, Nash said.  </P> <P> The county's decision to make use of the extra armories was welcomed by the  directors of the service centers.  </P> <P> Alma Vielma said her El Monte office has been overwhelmed by the logistics of  administering the voucher program. With just one full-time staff member, Vielma  has had to recruit some of the homeless clients to help her issue the vouchers,  telephone motels to check for vacancies and distribute free food.  </P> <P> The El Monte office, which has a $49,000 county contract to administer the  shelter program, has already spent more than $143,000, Vielma said. The agency  is scheduled to amend its contract with county officials today, said Greg  Fitzgerald, associate director of Catholic Charities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agencies Back Out  </P> <P> Running the shelter program is so demanding that nearly a dozen agencies that  helped administer the program last year backed out this winter, officials said.  </P> <P> "Its' a very difficult program without having armories open," Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> Caught off-guard Thursday when the county announced that the Monrovia armory  was not ready for use, Vielma had to refer homeless clients to the Pomona  armory.  </P> <P> Dorothy Kumar, director of the Pomona Neighborhood Center, a nonprofit  community service organization, said use of the Pomona armory will help bring  costs under control.  </P> <P> Last winter, her office distributed $13,000 in hotel vouchers. This year, the  cost is above $100,000, she said.  </P> <P> Despite the limitation on distribution of motel vouchers in the San Gabriel  Valley, all homeless people seeking assistance in Lancaster -- where the county  has been unable to find a social service agency to oversee an armory shelter --  will continue to be issued such vouchers in cold weather, Nash said. But there  has been no flocking of the homeless to that area because it is remote,  officials said.  </P></p>

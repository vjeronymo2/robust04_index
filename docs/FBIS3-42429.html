			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col-Gen N. Dimidyuk, commander of the Missile </F> and Artillery Troops of the Ground Troops, under the rubric "A  Topical Subject": "To the Arms Market Through Joint Efforts"]    [Text]  <H5>  IDEX-93: Results, Reflections, Conclusions </H5>   The Russian exhibit was the largest at the International  Exhibition of Weapons and Military Equipment held in the United  Arab Emirates this year. It included everything from a  Kalashnikov assault rifle to a transport helicopter and a large  ASW ship. In my opinion the willingness of enterprises in our  defense complex to display the latest items with a view to  selling them to potential clients was greeted with interest and  at the same time with caution by military firms of the USA,  Great Britain, France, Canada and the Republic of South Africa.  And that is understandable. The arms trade today is the most  lucrative business there is. It can be compared to diamond sales  with respect to revenues generated. And one should not seriously  count on mutual understanding among the leading foreign firms.  The competition is fierce.    In order to trade successfully as equals, then, enterprises  in our defense complex will have to take a sharp turn toward the  market. I feel that since this is a state matter, an attitude  corresponding to this status should be taken toward it. The  exhibition demonstrated once again that we must give priority  for the immediate future to the development of the most modern  intelligence equipment, including airborne facilities. So long  as we continue to invest money in the revitalization of  enterprises producing obviously noncompetitive models, this  problem will not be solved properly. Is it not time to  officially designate in the nation a minimum of two or three  competitors producing these products?    Foreign experience has indicated the need for such measures.  The government of postwar Japan, for example, did not permit  firms to produce products for export until a fully competitive  basis had been shaped in the industry. The effects of these  decisions were so great that competition became one of the most  important organizational principles even in relations within  firms. We know that the Sony company is presently developing  computers and video recorders simultaneously in ten highly  competitive areas.    This is typical also for the companies of other Western  nations. Among the largest American companies producing the  latest weapons, for example, only a tenth of the projects now  reach the stage of commercial sale. Their designers always bear  in mind the individual, the team or the crew. A convenient  arrangement of this or that weapon model, well-designed lighting  for the compartment, reliable intercom systems, fans and air  conditioners, and effective fire-extinguishing facilities are a  basic requirement of the arms purchasers. Extremely important  along with the administrative and legal measures are economic  regulators, which include long-term measures (programs,  subsidies and benefits for effecting important structural and  technological reforms in the defense industry), as well as  measures designed to stimulate ongoing legal competition. Along  with foreign economic actions, these measures include the  regulation of prices, taxes, interest and the benefit of state  orders.    It will clearly be extremely difficult for our nation to  take  such a turn, particularly since the removal of the state from  the economy has only begun. And this means that in order to  stimulate competition the state must concern itself with the  viability of those enterprises which are not experiencing the  best of times. This state concern must differ from that of the  present, however. If the state intends to take on the support of  weak competitors, then it must see to the implementation of  measures to improve their health.    Incidentally, it should be mentioned that the reduction of  the defense budget is evoking concern that allocations for basic  research in the defense industry will also be reduced. This  situation could result, as an example, in Russia's artillery  science and technology taking a back seat in world scientific  and technological progress. And we have fine designers, real  professional specialists, working in the military-industrial  complex. Take the team at the Uraltransmash production  association, for example. The MSTA-S 152mm self-propelled  howitzer displayed at the exhibition was developed there under  the supervision of general designer Yu. Tomashov. Comments by  the military experts indicate that its technical-tactical  features are superior to those of American, British and French  guns of the same caliber. Its main merit is its modern ammo-feed  system and its high maximum rate of fire. Nor could I fail to  mention one other prominent designer, S. Nepobedim, who has  developed a large number of missiles--from ATGM to the  well-known Oka and the Tochka missile system, which was  displayed at the exhibition. I believe that books will be  written about Sergey Pavlovich and this designer's extensive  service to the homeland. His creative work is based on a union  of the latest achievements of basic science and advanced  technology.    It is a terrible thing to think that many of these people  will be deprived of the opportunity to engage in basic research  as they should and will lose their scientific skills. In the  conversion of the defense industry basic research should not be  curtailed but, on the contrary, should be enhanced. This fact is  for some reason discussed unwillingly and in different  languages, as it were. Some people discuss it openly and  honestly, while others just give accounts and reports. Still  others are demandingly reproachful, especially when they want to  shift the blame for their blunders onto subordinates. The  latter, they say, underestimate the importance of this factor.  But the language of truth should prevail in this discussion. He  who is afraid to discuss the problem openly and honestly today,  no matter how unpleasant it is, he who has had it with criticism  directed at him is convincingly demonstrating that he has become  a totally new type of conventionalist hiding his true identity  behind the entire discussion.    Given the great importance of these matters, the level of  preparation and organization of the exhibit takes on particular  importance. I would note with satisfaction that in the course of  the joint effort we developed good business relations with V.  Glukhikh, chairman of the Committee for the Defense Branches of  Industry, with his first deputy G. Yanpolskiy and with the  exhibit's board of directors P. Trishin, V. Kartavtsev and V.  Belukov.    It should be acknowledged, however, that, unfortunately,  certain matters were not worked out in the best possible way at  the first stage. In this regard I would have to express regret  over the situation which developed with the loading of weapons  and military equipment onto maritime and railway transport  facilities and their unloading. The experience showed that the  establishments and military departments involved need to give  some serious thought to this matter. There was a shortage of  gear for securing the items (rope, chains, bracing line and  running-gear supports), beams and devices for loading large  pieces of military equipment by means of cranes. This included  design flaws in the equipment models themselves (absence of  hooks, claws and other devices), which hampered their loading  onto these types of transport. How does one account for all of  this?    Or take the following, which should not escape notice. In my  view, the range of the latest weapons and military equipment  selected was so diverse it not only significantly complicated  preparations for the display but also made it impossible to  design the pavilion so as to draw the visitors' attention to  specific models. IDEX-93 was the debut of our defense industry,  except for specific models of aviation equipment, which had been  displayed at previous international air shows. Nonetheless, this  approach could still not be considered optimal. I believe that  in future such large undertakings the weapons should be broken  down into groups: Missile troops, artillery and air defense, for  example; armored and engineer troops; aviation; communication  and radioelectronic equipment, and so forth. This would make it  possible to display not just "bare" models but the weapons  system in its entirety. That is, everything involved with the  system, including the ZIP [set of spare parts, instruments and  accessories], repair assemblies, combat support supplies and  equipment, and modern ammunition for the most diverse purposes.    It is hardly worthwhile to scrimp on funds to develop  advertising write-ups, video films, posters and electrically  operated stands depicting the parts and assemblies of the  components and mechanisms for the models of training equipment  to be displayed. We now need to mesh all of the know-how we have  developed into a single whole and concentrate it all in the  hands of those who produce the weapons and military equipment. I  realize, however, that it will be extremely difficult or even  impossible to do this. This is because the defense industry  enterprises have not yet been granted complete independence.    The equipment is one thing, but its effect in the arms  market  will be predetermined in great part by how well the teams and  crews are prepared. The generals and officers of the MO  [Ministry of Defense] GRAU [Main Missile and Artillery  Directorate] and GBTU [Main Armor Directorate], our directorate  and the military districts deserve high praise in this respect.  Tests involving live missile launchings and live firing were  conducted under their supervision at the Gorokhovetskiy (MVO  [Moscow Military District]) and Kapustin-Yar (PriVO [Volga  Military District]) training centers. A special tactical  exercise involving live firing and conducted under the  supervision of Col-Gen V. Semenov, commander in chief of the  Ground Troops, was successfully fitted into the exhibit  preparations plan and was off perceptible benefit. This is where  the officers achieved a moral victory and acquired confidence in  their capabilities.    And now, as a result of the painstaking and intense work,  top  honors and first prize have been awarded to Russia's missilemen  and artillerymen for firing on the range. They bettered the norm  for combat performance in the desert by 25-30 percent and made  no technical errors in the process. Thanks primarily to the good  professional skills of officers A. Popov, S. Krainov, V.  Polyakov, A. Dyrdin, V. Kuchinskiy, V. Kisov and A Khodul, the  demonstration firing and missile launches took place without  hitches and with highly effective fire.    It goes without saying that when military duty merges with  an  inner need for self-improvement, with a love for the profession,  in this meld are born such professionals. They know what they  are worth and each of them, so to speak, has something to place  onto the scale.    In conclusion, I should mention that the ideas expressed in  these comments do not cover all of the problems involved in  accessing the arms market by far. There can be no doubt about  one thing, however, that we will not travel this difficult path  without joint efforts on the part of state agencies, the  developers of the new weapons and practical specialists in the  forces.

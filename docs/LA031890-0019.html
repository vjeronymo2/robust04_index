			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGEWEEK: D'AMBROSI'S 'PATHOLOGICAL' THEATER  </P> <P> Some of Dario D'Ambrosi's favorite audiences are mental patients.  </P> <P> "I (develop and perform) my theater inside a mental hospital in Rome," said the  Italian performance artist/playwright, whose "La Trota" (The Trout) opens  Tuesday at Stages Trilingual Theatre. D'Ambrosi's two-character institution-set  "Nemico Mio" (Enemy of Mine) concludes there tonight.  </P> <P> "The boys (in Rome) are mostly 14 to 25, sometimes schizophrenic. Since my  plays are about mental people, they recognize themselves. And I'm happy 'cause  I'm helping sick people. It's also nice to come here, make a story about them."  </P> <P> D'Ambrosi, a proponent of what he calls "pathological theater," originally  played "Nemico Mio" at Stages in 1988 -- in Italian. This time he's taking a go  at it in English. "It's very, very difficult," he admitted of the adjustment.  "But if I want to work in this country, it's important that people understand  (me)."  </P> <P> In "La Trota," D'Ambrosi is a poor man who suffers "days and days eating  nothing. Finally a trout comes. He doesn't have (the heart to kill it), so he  decides to live with it. He wants to live like the fish -- without air -- but  cannot, and he dies. He bought the fish to eat, but the fish eats him . . .  metaphorically. It's like poetry," he concluded of his fables. "Like  philosophy."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: When the Upland earthquake struck Feb. 28, some theatergoers got  an extra sound and light show at the Pantages Theatre, where "Starlight  Express" was in the middle of its Wednesday matinee. Fortunately for the cast,  the temblor came during a non-skating sequence: Sean McDermott's solo, "I Am  the Star Ride," which is accompanied by a dazzling laser effect.  </P> <P> "When the earthquake started, people said it was like Sensurround," reported  the show's publicist. "Everyone stayed through the number, but as soon as it  was over, 300 people got up and left." The rest of the audience bravely stayed  on, however, and the performance continued uninterrupted. The theater suffered  no damage.  </P> <P> CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: The Peter Thompson/John Kander/Fred Ebb Depression-era  musical, "Flora, the Red Menace" (1965), is being revived at the Pasadena  Playhouse. Scott Ellis directs.  </P> <P> Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "Ellis has brought 'Flora' a good way down the  road to perestroika, but it still has a distance to go. If it's to be any kind  of menace, there's more work to be done."  </P> <P> From Jay Reiner in the Hollywood Reporter: "The score is mediocre. . . . The  storyline itself unravels in an old-fashioned, overly cute style that feels  more formulaic than daring, despite the political underpinnings."  </P> <P> Said Daily Variety's Timothy Gray: "Other than 'Carrie,' it's hard to think of  a less likely subject for a musical. The fact that the writer and producers  were drawn to it once is surprising; that anyone felt compelled to return to  this material passeth all understanding."  </P> <P> From the Daily News' Daryl H. Miller: 'Ellis' stage images are intriguing,  Susan Stroman's choreography is red-hot, and the cast performances are  compelling . . . 'Flora' doesn't have to be regarded as a political show. It  can be enjoyed as pure entertainment."  </P></p>

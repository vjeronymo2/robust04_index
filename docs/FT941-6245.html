			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: World waits for the second Chinese wave - A look at the batch of companies set for overseas listings this summer The second batch of China state-run companies slated for overseas listings is likely to hit Hong Kong - or, in some cases, New York - around July, roughly a year after Tsingtao Brewery, producer of the only internationally recognised Chinese beer, made its trail-blazing debut. On that occasion the mood was euphoric: the stock rose 29 per cent on its offer price, and up to 100 regulatory and industry dignitaries trooped into the Hong Kong stock exchange gallery for toasts of Tsingtao. But there were also plenty of teething problems, exacerbated by debates over the preferred route the global offering should follow to ensure optimum pricing and whether primary listings should be sought beyond the colony. Things are expected to be altogether different this summer. While analysts reckon there is still sufficient long-term interest in China to outweigh the current raft of uncertainties over the way in which tax and currency reforms will affect companies, the fact remains that increased supply will mop up some of the froth. Looking at the 22 state companies approved for overseas listings, professionals report a far greater will and ability to streamline and adapt operations in order to woo the international investors. The resistance encountered last year is, they say, already history. Mr Meocre Li, managing partner of Arthur Andersen Hong Kong and China, cites the example of one of the early companies which his firm visited. The company insisted it did not want to undergo any restructuring: it wanted the world to see what a socialist-style company looked like. Ultimately, it had to forgo its ideals, but not before other accountants had passed through its doors and delivered the same verdict. So far down the road have China bosses come - only recently, releasing commercial information to foreigners would have landed company directors in jail - that at least four of the 22 are aiming for Wall Street, where disclosure requirements are far greater than in Hong Kong. These include Shandong Huaneng Electricity Joint Stock Power Company and Huaneng International Joint Stock Company, both power supply companies, and perhaps China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airways. The attraction of New York over Hong Kong is broadly threefold: price/earnings ratios are greater and so companies can raise more cash; there are fewer China companies available; and - not at all least important in Chinese eyes - New York is perceived as carrying higher prestige. Some China companies already listed in New York are trading on an average p/e of around 30 times whereas the first batch of H shares (Chinese company shares listed in Hong Kong) came on line in the colony with p/e ratios of around 10 to 15. Some analysts believe one or two companies may achieve a listing in London especially as the stock exchange there has been lobbying in China. Mr Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange is undaunted by the competition - pointing out that this is after all what the free port of Hong Kong thrives on - and says the Beijing State Council's decision to test the waters in New York is very much by way of a small pilot run. Feedback from New York and Tokyo, he says, shows that institutional investors tend to prefer shares having their primary listing in Hong Kong, because Hong Kong can better understand - and more realistically price - the issues. He illustrates this with the case of Shanghai Petrochemical, one of last year's biggest H share issuers. Only about 30 per cent was offered in the colony with the remainder going abroad - mainly to the US. Yet trading over the past couple of weeks has shown that volumes in Hong Kong are four times those in New York. It is inevitable that the bulk of the second batch of companies will wind up in Hong Kong: the colony's stock exchange last year signed a special Memorandum of Understanding with its counterpart in Beijing which smooths the way for mainland enterprises to list, by promoting co-operation between the two parties. H shares per se may no longer be a novelty, but the second line-up offers investors their first bite at some of the hottest China sectors - - infrastructure and aviation, key beneficiaries of a developing middle class and government commitments to breathe life into poor power and transport facilities. Ms Dora Hung, analyst with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, says: 'People expect short-term volatilities following changes in China's policy and the tax structure. No-one yet knows how the government will implement some of these changes. It takes time for things to run smoothly with new regulations coming into force, but for people investing in China they know they must look long term.'</p>

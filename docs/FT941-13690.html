			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Ex-chief of Efim arrested The former chairman of the Efim state holding corporation, Mr Gaetano Mancini, has been arrested on charges of false accounting and fraud. Italian police are also seeking the former chairman of Efim's Alumix aluminium subsidiary, Mr Corrado Innocenti. The charges relate to consultancy fees paid when Efim's aluminium sector was restructured at the end of the 1980s. Investigators are examining allegations that fees in a L5.3bn (Pounds 2m) contract awarded to the Moberis consultancy firm were swollen to provide L1.5bn in kickbacks. Mr Mancini, 70, was the last chairman at Efim, whose large losses and heavy indebtedness underlay the government's decision in July 1992 that it should be placed in liquidation.</p>

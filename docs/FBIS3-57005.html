Therefore, the RPK leader is hopeful he will be able  to come to an agreement with President Kravchuk and develop  relations between the Crimea and Ukraine in accordance with  current legislation and the norms of international law. In the  event of his election as president, Yuriy Meshkov added, one  should not fear that interethnic relations would exacerbate.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SPRAYING FOR ORIENTAL FRUIT FLIES TO BEGIN  </P> <P> County agricultural workers today will begin applying insecticide to a  15-square-mile area in the South Bay, after the discovery last week of two  Oriental fruit flies, one in Hawthorne and the other in Lawndale.  </P> <P> The fruit fly, which is considered a potential threat to agriculture, was  successfully eradicated by the same measures last year after being detected in  four parts of the county, said E. Leon Spaugy, Los Angeles County's  agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> Workers will be applying a sex lure, methyl eugenol, with an insecticide,  Naled, to utility poles and trees. Boundaries for the eradication effort are  Artesia Boulevard on the south, Western Avenue on the east, Imperial Highway on  the north and Aviation Boulevard on the west.  </P> <P> Additional traps have been placed and will be inspected daily to determine how  widespread the infestation might be, Spaugy said.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / NZ votes for poll reform NEW Zealanders have voted overwhelmingly to reject the first-past-the-post election system which the country inherited from Britain. In a national referendum at the weekend, only 15 per cent voted to keep the system, where the winning party usually gains a larger number of seats in parliament than its share of the vote. The majority, 70 per cent, voted in favour of mixed member proportional (MMP), a system used in Germany. The remaining 15 per cent of voters favoured the other options put forward: supplementary member, single transferable vote, and preferential vote. Most politicians from the two main parties, led by prime minister Jim Bolger, warned that any system apart from first-past-the-post would lead to unstable government. However, it is widely believed that the strong vote for change is a public condemnation of both parties for not honouring election promises. A second referendum will be held at next year's general election, giving voters two options: first - past - the - post or MMP. The prime minister has also hinted that the referendum will ask people to vote on the re-establishment of an upper house of parliament. Any change in the electoral system will not occur till the following general elections, probably in 1996. The government will now decide the precise structure of the MMP system to be put to the vote next year. However critics say this task should be left to the Royal Commission which recommended the MMP system in 1986. Leaders of minor parties, who have been lobbying in favour of MMP, contend that the government and the opposition will use the coming months to come up with an unattractive form of MMP.</p>

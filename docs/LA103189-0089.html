			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: ARE ADS SPAWNED BY HUGO, EARTHQUAKE TASTEFUL?  </P> <P> Several days after Hurricane Hugo ripped through Charleston, AT&amp;T rushed a  production crew there to film a promotional video. Originally, the video was  supposed to be seen only by AT&amp;T employees -- as a way to show team spirit  during a crisis.  </P> <P> But the film footage of the devastation aftermath was so graphic, and in the  case of one misty-eyed AT&amp;T supervisor, so heart tugging, that the company  took a different path. It decided to wrap the timely film footage into its  national ad campaign about the reliability of the phone company in emergencies.  </P> <P> "It was that once-in-a-lifetime vehicle," said Burke Stinson, media relations  manager at AT&amp;T in Basking Ridge, N.J. "We had a major show coming up in  roughly the same time frame of a major tragedy."  </P> <P> AT&amp;T also sent a film crew to the Bay Area after the earthquake earlier  this month. After all, AT&amp;T knew that it had gobs of ad time to fill during  Sunday night's airing of "The Final Days" on ABC.  </P> <P> Allstate, too, had film crews in Charleston and the Bay Area. Allstate's ads  from Charleston actually show its agents handing checks to several homeowners  who filed claims. The insurer says it could have its earthquake commercial on  the air next week.  </P> <P> But some advertising experts wonder if all this is a bit too ghoulish. For the  sake of selling some property insurance or telephone systems, are some  advertisers insensitive to people still suffering in the aftermath of these  disasters?  </P> <P> "From a marketing standpoint, a great case can be made that the timing of these  ads is perfect," said Stan Freberg, a Los Angeles advertising consultant and  president of Stan Freberg Ltd. "But from a standpoint of taste, I think it's  terrible for any company to seize upon a disaster to toot its own horn."  </P> <P> Others strongly disagree. "It's very appropriate for a company to sometimes  remind people, 'Hey, we told you we'd do this, and guess what -- we did,' "  said Gene Cameron, president of the Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide. "Of  course, all this has to be done in good taste."  </P> <P> This sort of "disaster aftermath" advertising can directly result in new  business, said John Czepiel, professor of marketing at New York University.  "You can bet there are people who see those Allstate ads and wonder what their  insurance companies would do," Czepiel said. "For that matter, some people have  to be asking themselves: Why isn't my insurance company running ads like  these?"  </P> <P> Executives from Allstate and AT&amp;T insist that they're only letting people  know about their excellent services during times of crisis -- and are not  trying to take advantage of the situations.  </P> <P> "We're showing people that we've perfected how to deal with catastrophes," said  John Flieder, vice president of product advertising at Northbrook, Ill.-based  Allstate Insurance Co., which eventually expects to pay more than $250 million  in claims related to Hurricane Hugo. "When you have a disaster that will be on  people's minds for a long time, that's worth talking about."  </P> <P> The Chicago ad agency Leo Burnett has made similar "disaster" commercials for  Allstate for more than 20 years. In fact, some stand-up comedians have even  been known to parody these ads in their skits. "If Saturday Night Live wants to  make a parody ad of what we do, that's fine with me," Flieder said. "Just so  they spell our name right."  </P> <P> Of course, Fred Ayoub probably wouldn't find a parody ad very funny. After all,  Ayoub's home in North Charleston, S.C., was virtually demolished when a  300-foot radio tower came crashing through it during the hurricane. The  36-year-old Ayoub -- standing among the ruins of his home -- is featured in a  recent Allstate commercial.  </P> <P> "As long as what they say is true, I don't see anything wrong with these kinds  of ads," said Ayoub, in an interview. He said Allstate has paid him three  installments of the $58,000 he will eventually receive to completely rebuild  his home.  </P> <P> In the commercial, Ayoub states just how pleased he is with Allstate's service.  "They didn't pressure me or put any words into my mouth," said Ayoub. "The  whole thing took me by surprise. No one even told me a commercial crew was  going to come by the house."  </P> <P> But Freberg, the consultant, said the Allstate ad is terribly offensive. "It  makes me think that they have a special division that waits around for  disasters to happen," said Freberg. "I suppose they have a vice president of  earthquakes and another vice president of hurricanes."  </P> <P> The three-minute "disaster" ad that AT&amp;T aired Sunday night -- featuring  scenes from the recent hurricane and earthquake -- was originally supposed to  be just about Hurricane Hugo. "We were looking for something that would show  our responsiveness as a corporation," said Stinson, of the commercial that was  created by the agency NW Ayer. Then, days after the Hugo films were completed,  the Bay Area earthquake occurred.  </P> <P> "The earthquake was even a greater test for AT&amp;T," said Stinson. "In the  ad, we're trying to politely blow our own horn. We're showing that by being  fast afoot in a tragedy, we can also be speedy during a communications problem  that is not caused by an act of God."  </P> <P> What about those people in Charleston and the Bay Area who, after the separate  tragedies, have complained about going for days without AT&amp;T long-distance  service? "There might be people who have those complaints," said Stinson. "But  on the whole, the record we exhibited with our fast response was exemplary."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT&amp;T Sponsorship of 'Final Days' Zapped  </P> <P> AT&amp;T says there will be no Watergate-style cover-up over the flak that it  receives for sponsoring ABC's Sunday night telecast about Richard Nixon's last  days in office -- "The Final Days." "Call volumes to our customer service  centers were up 15% to 20% on Monday," said Burke Stinson, media relations  manager at AT&amp;T. On the East Coast, alone, more than 1,000 calls were  received by AT&amp;T officials -- about 50% of them from unhappy customers.  Stinson said that many customers said they would switch to competing  long-distance carriers -- just as an angry Nixon, himself, switched to MCI in  September.  </P> <P> "A number of people who called said they didn't even watch the show," Stinson  said. "They said they had read about it over the weekend and didn't want to see  it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lottery Looking for New Ad Shop  </P> <P> Don't make any bets yet, but the California State Lottery -- one of the biggest  advertisers on the West Coast -- is seriously looking at changing agencies.  </P> <P> The lottery's annual ad budget is $60 million -- and lottery officials are  reviewing agencies. A decision is expected by early December.  </P> <P> Last week, lottery officials quietly named four finalists for the lucrative ad  business -- including incumbent Daily &amp; Associates. Also in the running are  BBDO Los Angeles, Chiat/Day/Mojo and the San Francisco office of J. Walter  Thompson.  </P> <P> Japanese auto makers aside, the lottery is among the most sought-after ad  accounts on the West Coast. Explained Gene Cameron, president of BBDO Los  Angeles, "Everything else that big has four wheels on it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coen Teams With 2 Under a New Name  </P> <P> Once again, a "new" advertising agency has arrived on the Los Angeles scene.  </P> <P> Actually, Coen, Kalis &amp; Moiselle isn't entirely new. It was formerly  Raymond Coen &amp; Associates, an agency that may be best known locally for its  ads for Oh Boy! Frozen Foods. Now, Coen has taken on two partners and hopes to  expand his business well beyond its current annual billings of $8 million.  </P> <P> "The Los Angeles advertising jungle isn't being enlarged," said Coen, "it's  just being improved."  </P> <P> And so is Coen's agency. Joining him as partners are Murray Kalis, who was  formerly creative director and executive vice president at HDM/LA, and Ed  Moiselle, whose agency, Seidman and Moiselle, was acquired by Admarketing. At  HDM, Kalis helped create those familiar ads for Nissin brand noodles, including  the spot for Hardy Cup O' Noodles that features an Oliver Twist-like character  who asks for more noodles.  </P> <P> "We're already pitching against the big boys," said Coen, whose agency this  week will go up against J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather for a local  packaged goods advertiser. Coen said his agency will specialize in consumer  retail businesses with annual ad budgets of $1 million to $5 million.  </P> <P> "There is a trend among advertisers to not necessarily go with the big-name  agencies," Coen said. "Instead, they're going with agencies that can generate  sales."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latino Ad Agency Links Up With HDM  </P> <P> What is the best way for a Latino advertising agency to grow?  </P> <P> Some have merged with big agencies and entirely lost their identities. But  recently the North Hollywood ad shop Castellanos Latina Advertising announced  an unusual "affiliation agreement" with HDM Worldwide -- and will remain  independent.  </P> <P> "We have been searching for a partner whose spirit and philosophy matches our  own," said Julio J. Castellanos Sr., president of the agency.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, HDM will introduce Castellanos to many of its big clients,  such as Westin Hotels, Peugeot and Nintendo. If -- and when -- Castellanos  creates any Spanish-language ads for HDM clients, HDM will receive an  undisclosed "cut" of those billings, said Julio J. Castellanos Jr., senior vice  president of the 3-year-old agency.  </P> <P> "We have no intention or inclination to sell the majority of our company," said  Castellanos Jr., whose agency creates Spanish-language ads for the Broadway and  Pic N Save. "We're in it for the long haul."  </P> <P> As a result of this agreement, Castellanos Jr. said his agency -- which has  annual billings of about $7 million -- expects to pick up $5 million in new  business over the next year. "This is a great way of opening doors with new  clients."  </P></p>

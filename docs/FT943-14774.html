			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Training budget cuts attacked Budget cuts in government funded training programmes are leading to gaps in skills training for young people and the long-term unemployed, the National Council for Vocational Organisations said, Lisa Wood writes. Training providers are being required to produce quicker and cheaper jobs or qualifications to meet targets as they face cuts of 21 per cent in Training and Enterprise Council budgets. Tec training budgets for 1994-95 totalled Pounds 1.7bn as opposed to Pounds 1.8bn last year. Mr Martin Ayton, policy and campaigns officer, said: 'Provision is now being rationed according to financial rather than training needs.' The survey also found that 16 per cent of training providers in the voluntary sector had their total funding cut by more than half, and many were in financial jeopardy.</p>

West Creates Image of  `Willful Russia'"]    [Excerpts] Washington D.C., 23 Feb -- The U.S. capital,  nestling cozily on the banks of the Potomac River, has not  experienced such an outburst of passions over spying for a long  time. Evening newspaper editions, television news broadcasts,  statements by administration officials, including the president  himself, and commentaries by observers and congressmen --  everything on Tuesday [22 February] was devoted to the arrest of  FBI agent and CIA officer Aldrich Ames [as published] and his  wife. [passage omitted]    Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad  interim, was hastily summoned to the State Department. He  received a strong protest from the U.S. side. The local press  reports that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded  that Russia remove Ames' Russian case officers from the United  States.    "If the Russians do not do it we can do it for them," an  anonymous administration official, quoted on television,  threatened.    Local commentators were quick to predict that the Ames  scandal could seriously cloud Russian-U.S. relations. Some  people are already asking whether U.S. aid to Russia, which is  "spying on the United States," should be restricted. Former CIA  Director Robert Gates claims that lately the Russian  intelligence services, the GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate]  in particular, have even stepped up their activities in the  United States. But as a professional, Gates has urged that an  excessive reaction to what has occurred be avoided.    Nevertheless, CNN reports, the double agent's arrest has  already harmed diplomatic relations between our two countries.  Collaboration between Moscow and Washington in the talks on a  settlement in Bosnia has been jeopardized.    The fuss kicked up as if on command over what is, on the  whole, an ordinary event is really surprising. After all, many  local observers are now saying that there is nothing  particularly new in the fact that both the United States and  Russia are continuing to monitor each other.    But the history of mutual relations between Washington and  Moscow features a considerable number of cases whereby  "sensational revelations" and passions over spying proved to be  by no means irrelevant to the carrying out of more significants  acts. Are we not witnessing such a "coincidence" now?</p>

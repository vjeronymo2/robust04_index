These reviews cover one manufacturer/exporter and the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on our preliminary results.

The Department has now completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan. These products include V-belts, synchronous belts, and other industrial belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, and containing textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord or strand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loops) belts, or in belting in lengths or links. These reviews exclude conveyor belts and automotive belts, as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered by internal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lift trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the periods of review the merchandise was classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheadings, 3926.90.55, 3926.90.56, 3926.90.57, 3926.90.59, 3926.90.60, 4010.10.10, 4010.10.50, 4010.91.11, 4010.91.15, 4010.91.19, 4010.91.50, 4010.99.11, 4010.99.15, 4010.99.19, 4010.99.50, 5910.00.10 5910.00.90, and 7326.20.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These reviews cover one Japanese manufacturer and exporter of industrial belts to the United States, Mitsuboshi Belting Limited (MBL), and the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992, and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of the Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of these administrative reviews. We received a case brief from MBL, and a rebuttal brief from the petitioner, Gates Rubber Company. We did not receive a request for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  MBL acknowledges that the Department's resort to best information available (BIA) is authorized under section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, since MBL did not respond to the Department's questionnaire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MBL argues, however, that the Department should use information obtained in the first administrative review (1989&hyph;90) as BIA instead of the rate from the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. MBL contends that the Department is required to consider the most recent information available in deciding upon a BIA rate. According to MBL, the information provided by the respondent in the first administrative review is the most probative evidence of the current margin because the LTFV margin was based solely on information provided by the petitioner for the period October 1986 through March 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, MBL argues that it could not make an informed decision to reply to the questionnaires. MBL claims that since the Department has not completed the 1990&hyph;91 review before distributing questionnaires for the 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93 reviews, the Department cannot infer that MBL would have responded to these questionnaires if it believed the margins for the 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93 reviews would be lower. Therefore, MBL claims that the Department's conduct in this case is punitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, MBL points out that the International Trade Commission's affirmative injury determination is being appealed at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). MBL urges the Department not to assess antidumping duties and order liquidation of their entries in a review where the validity of the underlying order is in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gates argues that the Department should not change its preliminary decision to resort to the LTFV margin from the original investigation as BIA. Gates states that MBL has provided no authority for the proposition that the Department should use as BIA the margin from the preliminary results in the 1989&hyph;90 administrative review. Gates contends that knowledge of results of prior reviews is irrelevant. Gates submits that MBL knew it might receive the highest rate, and that it would have submitted information proving lower margins if it could. Finally, Gates asserts that there is no justification for delaying completion of the reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

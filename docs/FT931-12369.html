			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: This 'Set-Up' asks for music - Theatre Someone was saying at the interval that the new show at the Gate would make a very good musical. I think that's right. The Set-Up has been around in several forms for half a century and is such a marvellous story that it would be sad to believe that this new adaptation at the Gate is the last word. The piece is about professional boxing. It was originally published as a play by Joseph Moncure March in 1929. March was a poet who studied his craft under Robert Frost. Subsequently he became editor of the New Yorker. He was also a Hollywood script-writer. The Set-Up took off as a movie starring Robert Ryan in 1949, though the new script was written by someone else and there were considerable changes to the plot. For example, the original brave fighter who defies the odds in the ring was white and was called Pansy Jones. Presumably that was because boxing in the 1920s was segregated and white-white conflicts were difficult enough without adding the complexities of race. By the time of the movie Pansy Jones had become black and his name was changed to Bill 'Stoker' Thompson, presumably because in the late 1940s to have a black boxer with a sexually equivocal name would have been altogether too much even for American liberals. One thing at a time. The basic story is about is about a fighter who comes from nowhere to win a fight that he did not understand he was being paid to lose. He does it by a mix of guts and skill. How the piece ends depends on whoever does the latest adaptation. The trouble with the version at the Gate is that it has become a one-man show, adapted and performed by Kerry Shale, and written in rhymed couplets. Much as one admires Shale's versatility and powers of endurance, one has to say that it does not completely work. The trouble with English rhymed couplets is that they are a very limited verse form: they can restrict rather that expand freedom of expression. After the first few minutes anyone with even half an ear can begin predicting the rhymes. This is unfortunately true of the fight scenes where the piece is meant to be at its most dramatic. Whenever the word 'yell' comes up, you know automatically that the rhyme will be 'bell'. What Shale has done is to try to construct a narrative ballad, but there is another deterrent in the length. 'Eskimo Nell' may be a technically excellent piece of versification, but I doubt if you would want to watch it performed on stage by one man for a good two hours. It is to be briefly listened to, not seen. That is what Shale has failed to realise in The Set-Up. At the Gate there is virtually nothing to look at, only a mirror slightly cracked and a chair to sit in. The mirror is useful in that its reflexions give you other views of Shale, but it never cracks from side to side. The drama is lacking: however hard Shale tries - and there are times towards the end when he can be quite spellbinding for several lines at a stretch - one man is not enough. Full marks to the Gate for professionalism despite its limited resources. Early in the second act Shale understandably dried up. There came one of the most efficient pieces of prompting I have seen from behind the audience. If the prompter had been nodding, who knows what would have happened? Yet if The Set-Up were a musical, no-one would even dream of nodding. Gate Theatre until February 20 (071) 229 0706</p>

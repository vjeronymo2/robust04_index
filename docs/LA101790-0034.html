			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Alcoa in Japan: Alcoa has entered into a joint venture with Kobe Steel of Japan  to produce aluminum for beverage cans and automobiles.  </P> <P> An industry analyst says it is one of the most important moves Alcoa has made.  The Japanese market is ripe for growth because only 35% of its soda cans are  aluminum, compared to 95% in the United States. Kobe, Japan's leading producer  of flat-rolled aluminum, needs aluminum ingots, which an Alcoa subsidiary in  Australia can provide. The venture, KSL Alcoa Aluminum Co., will also work on  Japanese auto makers' target of reducing the weight of some cars by 40%.  Pittsburgh Press  </P> <P> Cards Foretell Slow Sales: Such major retailers as J. C. Penney and the Limited  have observed two disturbing trends. First, it is becoming increasingly  difficult to market new credit cards. In the past few years, the chains have  lost credit customers to Visa and MasterCard. The decline has steepened since  the Middle East crisis. Equally troubling is that consumers are accelerating  payment of credit card purchases. The inference is that consumers are reducing  personal debt in anticipation of layoffs. Because shoppers typically spend  twice as much when they pay with plastic, retailers are worried as the holiday  season approaches. Atlanta Constitution  </P> <P> Business Layover: With air fares up 5% to 10% since Iraq invaded Kuwait,  businesses are implementing more frugal travel policies, asking in some cases  that employees stay over on a Saturday during a business trip to take advantage  of discounted fares. More commonly, firms are reducing the number of  representatives they send to conventions and canceling companywide meetings.  Dallas Morning News  </P></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis of book market share Sir, I am writing in response to Michael Goldman's comments (Letters, October 17) regarding Dillons' market share. The information I quoted related to six of the leading specialist bookselling chains (which are closely comparable with Dillons). Information on sales from these chains is consolidated by an independent company, Book Marketing, and reported to each chain on a weekly basis. The latest information from Book Marketing shows Dillons' share of these chains has increased to 42.1 per cent. Book Marketing estimates that these chains constitute roughly 30 per cent of the overall retail book market - ie, excluding book clubs and institutional sales. The overall retail book market, on the same basis, is estimated at roughly Pounds 1.3bn, which is consistent with Dillons holding about 12 per cent of the retail book market.

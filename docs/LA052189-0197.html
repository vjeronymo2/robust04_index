			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES  </P> <P> Catherine Collins' article was ostensibly about foreign investment in U.S. real  estate, yet the entire article dwelt on Japanese investments.  </P> <P> It seems that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to author a book or an  article on Japan-bashing because the subject is beginning to hit a responsive  chord with the public, with each publication tending to reinforce and heighten  its fears and, of course, to make a buck or two for the author.  </P> <P> Collins is basically parroting what others have written and adds no new  insights. We are probably the world's biggest owner of foreign real estate, and  yet we can't control even the smallest of nations through that ownership.  </P> <P> In the L.A. Times (Washington Scene, Feb. 26), a Canadian was quoted: " . . .  serious estimates indicate that more than $50 billion have been invested in  U.S. real estate by foreigners since 1983. Somewhat surprisingly (emphasis  mine), 57% of that total investment originated in Canada, 28% in Europe, 7% in  the Pacific Rim, 6% in South America and the balance. . . ."  </P> <P> It is obvious that the fear of foreign ownership is nothing more than fear of  Japanese ownership and the surprise expressed in the quote is quite  understandable, given the emphasis of the media on blaming Japan for our  shortcomings. Our emphasis should be more on how we can become more competitive  and regain our former world pre-eminence in commerce. We seem to have forgotten  we are still the most powerful economic nation in the world.  </P> <P> SHIGEO YUGE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

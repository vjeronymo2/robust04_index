			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diosdado Maso from the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] I am going to speak about the spring sugarcane  planting program. There are 48 hours left in the month of June.  The spring sugarcane planting program is unlikely to reach even  60 percent completion.    For some Cubans, this is a recurring ailment. Seen in cold  blood, this statement is nearly true. In 1994, however, the  situation has been extremely difficult because the over 7,000  caballerias still to be planted were subject to constant rain  since the beginning of April; the fuel shortage that is also  responsible for the power outages we experience at home; and of  course, this or that shortages, although to be truthful,  shortages have not influenced results as much this year.    Nonetheless, the sugarcane that should have been planted by  30 June can and should be planted in July, August, and September  because, in the end, that is the sugarcane that will be ground  in the 1995-96 harvest, and it can be planted, I repeat,  perfectly well.    To date, only Pinar del Rio Province has met its spring  sugarcane planting goal. Havana Province has attained 94 percent  of its planting goal. Havana has demonstrated aggressiveness in  this endeavor. It was the only province to meet its limited  sugar production program and as you can see, is also about to  complete its spring sugarcane planting program. The worst spring  planting situation is in Sancti Spiritus Province, with  39-percent fulfillment; and Villa Clara Province, which has not  even planted 50 percent of the 2,600 caballerias projected.    Planting the projected sugarcane is a life-or-death  situation  for Cuba. Sugar continues to be the source of our cash currency  for any major commercial transaction. Other transactions will be  covered by tourism, perhaps nickel, and tobacco revenues. Only  sugar currency, however, fills the bill. This is why, only by  producing more sugarcane can we acquire more currency. This is  why the goal now is not to feint, but to plant up to the last  caballeria, even if it takes up to midnight on New Year's Eve.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Boris Yeltsin ruled to create  an expert-analytical council, an analytical centre at the  president [as received] and an information-technical centre of  analytical research at the presidential administration in order  "to improve the analytical and information provision of the  Russian president and the quality of preparing the decisions of  the president", the office of the Russian leader said on Friday.  Marat Guriyev was appointed the head of the new  information-technical centre.    The decision came one day after a scandal caused by a  resolution of the president which mentioned Latvia among  possible countries where Russia intends to have its military  bases.    Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov explained on  Thursday that Latvia was mentioned in the document because of a  "technical mistake". However, a source in the presidential  administration told TASS the restructuring was not linked with  the "technical mistake" and was a planned reorganisation. The  source added that Guriyev's appointment was a promotion.    Yeltsin also dissolved his analytical centre for general  policy and the analytical centre for social-economic policy.</p>

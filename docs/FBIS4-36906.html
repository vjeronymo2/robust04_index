			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran has vehemently denied a  report published in the French newspaper LE POINT saying that  Iran has supplied our country with arms.    A statement distributed by the Iranian Embassy in Sanaa  asserted that Iran's principled position on the current Yemeni  developments is clear and unambiguous. This position cannot be  distorted by these suspect media tricks.    The statement pointed out that Iran supports Yemeni unity  and  hopes that the existing problems will be resolved as part of the  unified Yemen.</p>

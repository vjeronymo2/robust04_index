			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Continental submits debt plan CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, yesterday filed with the bankruptcy courts a reorganisation plan which would involve unsecured creditors swapping their claims for equity in the ongoing company. The carrier has had talks with various possible merger partners and potential investors over the past year - including Northwest Airlines and, at a very preliminary level, with the now-bankrupt Trans World Airlines. It said yesterday that the filing of the plan would not preclude a deal in the future, and suggested that it might even induce some parties to enter discussions. Continental added, however, that 'nothing is in the offing' at present. Under the scheme, existing ordinary and preferred shareholders would get nothing. Subordinated debt would also be eliminated. Continental said that obligations to secured debtholders would generally be scaled down, and that the plan overall would reduce long-term liabilities from around Dollars 5.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn. It estimated that the total annual saving on interest and lease payments would be approximately Dollars 270m. On the operational side, however, employees - around 43,000 people - and flight operations would be little affected, Continental said. The plan put forward by Continental, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in late 1990, has the support of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. Some 50m shares of new common stock would be issued to the unsecured creditors, with the company having the initial authorisation to issue up to 200m shares of common stock and 100m preferred shares. Continental noted, however, it had not reached agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over its possible responsibilities towards Eastern Airlines, the now-defunct carrier which was once a sister organisation. It said that the PBGC was asserting a 'priority claim' which, if successful, would leave very little for the unsecured creditors. It added an optimistic note, saying that 'results in January and bookings for the next several months support our belief that the recent progress will be continuing'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F> Vincent Hugeux in Ankara; date not given: "Warning to Europe"]    [Text] Bosnia, gains by the Islamic party, the Kurdish  question: Mrs. Tansu Ciller, Turkish prime minister since June  1993, discusses the "sensitive" issues for LE VIF-L'EXPRESS.    [Hugeux] Is your country suffering from a geostrategic  "devaluation?"    [Ciller] Quite the reverse. Turkey, the link with the Middle  East, the only democratic and secular regime in the region, is  more than ever a key country. We have made many sacrifices in  our European integration effort. During the Iraqi aggression in  Kuwait, Turkey immediately took part in the resistance. But  people here are asking questions. Because that did not bring us  the slightest support. And yet Greece, Portugal, and Spain  received billions of dollars.    [Hugeux] Do you see that as ostracism by the "Christian  stronghold?"    [Ciller] If the aim is to prevent new barriers from being  erected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Turkey has an  essential role to play. The world is being reshaped. The duel  between the market economy and socialism is over. But, we must  now turn away from fundamentalism, be it Islamic or Christian.  That is the real danger of the next decade. My country can  provide a bridge between the two worlds, and hence toward peace.  Neglecting it because it is Muslim would be to fuel  fundamentalism on all sides. If the Bosnians had been  Christians, would Europe have been so passive?    [Hugeux] How do you explain the UN failure in Bosnia?    [Ciller] It is possible to restructure the institutions. But  there is something more serious: a lack of political will. The  international community is showing a lack of determination.    [Hugeux] Should the embargo on arms destined for the Muslims  be lifted?    [Ciller] If, as is claimed, we cannot protect them, the  least  we can do is to allow them to defend themselves.    [Hugeux] How would Ankara react if the conflict were  extended  to Macedonia or Kosovo?    [Ciller] In that case, nobody would be able to stand aside.  Such a threat is a threat to the world not just to Turkey.    [Hugeux] Is this the right time to lift the sanctions  against  Iraq?    [Ciller] We will act in accordance with our allies and will  not abolish the embargo on our own account. Even if it does  impose a heavy burden on us.    [Hugeux] Do you fear a resurgence of Russian imperialism?    [Ciller] Helping Moscow to convert to the rules of the  market  is fine. But does this mean we should ignore the rise of  nationalism? Supporting Russia without defending our values  there, in the name of supporting a particular individual, may be  contributing to this rise in nationalism. And it may feed the  temptation to return to the "good old days" in the empire. It  is for us to be vigilant. Russia is still the only superpower  in the region with nuclear weapons.    [Hugeux] Does the breakthrough by the Party of Prosperity  (Islamic) in the 27 March municipal elections worry you?    [Ciller] Ninety percent of the Turks favor a democratic and  secular state. They have been voting in that way for almost 50  years. But there are two reasons for this phenomenon. One is  the feeling of having been rejected for too long by our Western  allies. The second is the discontent linked with the economic  crisis. Reducing inflation and the debt requires many  sacrifices.    [Hugeux] Why are you giving way to the Army when faced with  the PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan)?    [Ciller] During the municipal elections, the PKK tried to  persuade people not to vote. However, it is in the southeast  that the highest participation was recorded. The safer people  feel, the more they support us. Let us draw a distinction  between citizens of Kurdish origin, whom our Army protects, and  the PKK terrorists. Our efforts to promote the economic  development of the southeast will shortly be felt. There is one  certainty: We will defend our country against any separatist  attempt.    [Hugeux] Is it necessary to modernize the doctrine inherited  from Mustafa Kemal?    [Ciller] Of course. But it is not for the government to  impose its interpretation of the dogma. It must be broadly  debated. The fundamental principles remain: secularism and  democracy. And we will not touch that.</p>

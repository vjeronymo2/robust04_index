			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Belgian governor attacks franc 'rumours' RECENT pressure on the Belgian franc is due to 'false rumours' circulating in the foreign exchange market, according to the governor of Belgium's central bank. Mr Alfons Verplaetse said at the weekend the franc - which last week slipped to BFr21.99 against the D-Mark - was undervalued given the fundamental strength of the Belgian economy. Mr Verplaetse's comments were aimed at stabilising the currency at the beginning of an important week for economic and monetary policy. A committee he heads will present a report to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, tomorrow, giving the outline of a 'social pact' between the government, employers and unions - the first since 1944. The report is understood to endorse the central bank's strict interest rate policy. Mr Dehaene is known for never setting deadlines for tough negotiations but it is thought he may try to achieve a consensus by the end of the week on how to improve Belgian companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and cut the budget deficit. Mr Verplaetse believes the employers and unions will either immediately sign the outline pact or allow the government to push through legislation to achieve the aims of the pact, without giving their formal approval. He again denied at the weekend that the franc might have to be devalued. He also dismissed rumours that the 71-year-old currency association between Belgium and Luxembourg was under threat, or that the central bank's reserves were exhausted. Both the Belgian and the French franc have been the target of speculation in recent weeks, because foreign exchange dealers believe the two countries' strict policy of maintaining interest rates and shadowing the D-Mark is unsustainable.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Four new series start tonight. Borderlands (8.00 C4) is about six regions of Europe affected by economic and political changes, starting with Catalonia in north eastern Spain. As in so many regions on the periphery of larger, more powerful states, the language, culture and history of Catalonia were long suppressed. Firm Friends (9.00 ITV) is a four-part drama in which Billie Whitelaw plays a suburban housewife who sets up in the catering business with her Asian cleaning lady. Madhur Jaffrey who plays this part is, of course, known at least as well for her cookery books as for her acting. Town Hall (9.50 BBC2) is an eight-part documentary series about the ins and outs of local government, made by Malcolm Hirst and producer/cameraman Charles Stewart who specialise in fly-on-the-wall work. The series was made in the Labour controlled London borough of Lewisham. Seven Up - Japan (10.40 ITV) extends the idea used so successfully by Granada in Britain of filming a group of children at seven year intervals to see how their lives progress. Similar long terms sequences made in Germany and South Africa follow.</p>

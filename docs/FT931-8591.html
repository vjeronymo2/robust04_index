			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Skopbank narrows losses to FM3.61bn LOSSES at Finland's Skopbank narrowed to FM3.61bn (Dollars 609m) in 1992 from FM4.90bn the previous year, despite higher credit losses and non-performing loans. The bank, majority owned by the government guarantee fund, said it expected another big loss this year and it warned it would probably need a further FM1.5bn in capital support this year, in addition to the FM5.5bn already received. Its announcement came as two other Finnish banks, Postipankki and Okobank, saw their 1992 performance deteriorate, although the latter still managed to outperform most in the sector by making a profit. Losses deepened at Postipankki to FM700m from FM135m, while profits shrank at Okobank from FM274.8m to FM83.8m. All three banks were hit by the deep Finnish recession, high bankruptcy levels and rising unemployment. They also suffered from heavy write-offs on loans to the former Soviet Union. Skopbank achieved a better result, thanks only to a sharp drop in extraordinary losses, with its 1992 operating loss at FM3.46bn, actually 14 per cent higher than in 1991. Credit losses rose 10 per cent to FM2.78bn from FM2.55bn, with 58.5 per cent of the write-offs stemming from operations in Finland. Income from financial operations amounted to just FM219m, reflecting the burden of non-performing loans which at the year-end totalled FM5bn. Mr Kaarlo Jannari, Skopbank's chief general manager, said its restructuring programme, which cut operating expenses by 24 per cent to FM1.1bn, could not make up for the impact of the high level of write-offs and erosion of net interest income. At December 31 1992, the bank's capital adequacy ratio stood at 8.2 per cent, just above the international minimum of 8 per cent.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Swedish coalition keeps its economic nerve: Domestic risks of the new government's budget THE FIRST budget of Sweden's non-Socialist coalition government, unveiled last Friday, may carry high domestic political risks - its enemies on the left label it a call to class war. But it has won the apparent approval of business opinion at home and overseas. Not only did the Stockholm bourse index rise strongly last week in response to leaked budget details, but market interest rates fell as well. The budget should end speculation that the krona is to be devalued. Mrs Ann Wibble, the finance minister, must be pleased by this reaction to her tough proposals, which will cut government spending by SKr24bn (Pounds 2.3bn) next year. Foreign observers grew accustomed over the past 20 years to seeing Swedish governments attempting to solve their country's economic ills by currency manipulation and public sector spending sprees. Sweden's economy is more dependent than ever on the outside world since foreign exchange controls were scrapped 2 1/2 years ago, the krona was pegged to the Ecu, and Sweden applied to join the European Community last summer. Mrs Wibble signalled in her budget that the government would not be blown off course by the recession and intended to stick to its ambitious medium-term free-market strategy - announced when it took office last October - to make the Swedish economy more competitive and productive through structural reforms to encourage private initiative. This is what has ensured overseas confidence and calmed the markets. The aim of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, and his colleagues is ambitious: to transform Sweden into a high-growth, enterprise economy by the time it is expected to join the EC on January 1 1995. Such an objective continues to give the non-Socialist minority coalition a cohesion, elan and self-confidence that has surprised many observers who feared the four parties in government would spend much of their time squabbling. The aggressive style of the government belies the fact that it lacks a parliamentary majority and must rely on the support of the populist right-wing New Democracy party to ensure that its policies are implemented. The relative success of Mr Bildt's first 100 days can be judged by the exaggerated reaction to the budget from the main Social Democratic opposition. Its leader, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, called it a 'national catastrophe'. The Social Democrats seem to be abandoning the market-oriented strategy they also pursued in their last two years in government, before losing last September's general election. 'Their analysis was similar to our own before they left power,' says Mrs Wibble. There is more continuity between Mrs Wibble's budget and that of the Social Democrats in 1991 than either side cares to admit. But Social Democratic dislike for Mr Bildt seems greater than the party's wish to remain consistent. In fact the present government proposes to spend more on labour market programmes than the Social Democrats ever did, while public spending as a proportion of gross national product will go up to 64.2 per cent next year from 61.7 per cent in 1990. This is hardly a sign Mrs Wibble has embraced the ideology of Thatcherism, as her opponents suggest. The real test of the new government's resolve is likely to come 12 months from now as registered unemployment climbs from 3.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent and perhaps beyond, a figure which is high for Sweden although smaller than almost anywhere else in western Europe. If opinion polls show by then that support for the non-Socialist parties is ebbing, pressure for a change in economic direction may break the coalition. Time is not on the side of the Bildt-Wibble economic strategy. Sweden has general elections every three years and the government must face the voters again in September 1994. This will make it hard for the government to show positive results for its free-market approach before the next polls, especially if the world's recovery from recession is delayed. The government is hoping for an export-led industrial revival next year; it expects 0.2 per cent negative growth this year and a modest improvement of 1.3 per cent in 1993. An even more dangerous threat could yet derail the Bildt-Wibble approach. Leading Social Democrats are warning that the government will endanger Sweden's bipartisan approach to EC membership if people believe its economic policies are a necessary precondition for EC entry. Mr Bildt fears that in opposition the Social Democrats might behave as the British Labour party did in the early 1970s over Europe, and renege on their EC commitment to preserve internal unity. Such a U-turn still looks unlikely, but Sweden will hold a national referendum in 1994 on whether to join the EC on the terms negotiated with Brussels. This could yet split the country.</p>

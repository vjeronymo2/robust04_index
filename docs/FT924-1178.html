			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Hoover stirs up PR dust cloud over free flights deal: A troubled promotional scheme THE Hoover promotion offering free flights to customers may not have been the marketing success the company intended. Sales have increased, but the gloss has been taken off by bad publicity. In September Mr Alex Mills, who lives in Glasgow, and four relatives bought Hoover vacuum cleaners and planned to take advantage of the offer to to fly to the Canary Islands next June for a holiday. Hoover was offering two return flights to one of six European destinations in return for purchases of more than Pounds 100. The Mills filled in the application forms and sent them to JSI Travel, which Hoover is using for the promotion. 'We have not heard anything since,' says Mr Mills. 'I'm fed up with it. My eldest daughter phoned Hoover and asked what was going on. They told her they were busy with the December promotion. That was the last we heard about it.' If Mr Mills' experience is common, it threatens to sour the public relations goodwill the promotion was designed to generate. Hoover is now running a similar promotion, offering two free return flights to the US to either New York or Florida. Applicants are promised they can take flights between next February and April 1994. It is too soon to tell what consumer reaction to the US deal will be, as the offer does not close until December 31. Some within the travel industry doubt whether the promotions make commercial sense. One senior travel industry executive said it was difficult to imagine Hoover making anything other than a large loss on the promotion. 'What profit is Hoover making on that Pounds 100 sale? They might be making a tenner. Out of that they're paying for two tickets to America? It's bonkers.' The main brouhaha concerns the European-bound offer. What appeared to be a magnificent sales, marketing and public relations promotion has turned into a wrangle, particularly in Scotland, where both Hoover schemes have been strongly promoted by retailers. Ms Jenny Axelson, a director of JSI Travel, agrees there has been some chaos, but only because 'the offer has been far more popular than any of us anticipated . . . We have received 100,000 applications and expected no more than half that. There is no cut-off date to the European offer and applications are still coming in.' JSI says so far more than 900 applicants for the European scheme have successfully travelled to destinations in the Canary Islands, Italy, Austria, Germany and Spain. The sheer volume of applicants has forced Hoover to appoint two other travel agents - Your Leisure and Free Flights Europe - to assist JSI. Hoover yesterday said Free Flights Europe, like JSI and Your Leisure, belongs to the Association of British Travel Agents, but that Free Flights Europe is owned by a holding company, the identity of which Hoover is not prepared to reveal 'until next week'. Mr Keith Betton, director of corporate affairs at the Association of British Travel Agents, says: 'Customers who get involved in such schemes need to be fully aware that they are not financially protected by ABTA.' However, Hoover has given an undertaking that all accepted applicants will get their flights even if Your Leisure, JSI Travel or Free Flights Europe fold. Hoover added that from next Monday it will run a free flight telephone helpline. Over the next few days applicants will receive a letter telling them which of the three travel agents is handling their travel arrangements. The US offer is being handled by Your Leisure. Mr Michael Dunkley of Your Leisure denies there is a problem finding flights: 'There is plenty of capacity . . . The media have exaggerated the problems concerning lack of seats.' Retailers involved in the scheme are very pleased. Dixons says: 'It has been tremendously successful, with demand far outweighing supply. (Hoover) stock is walking out the door as fast as it comes in, both for the European and US offers. We have received no complaints from customers. It has been one of the most successful promotions ever as far as we are concerned.' The promotions appear to be prompted by a need to shift product. In October Hoover's US parent, Maytag, reported pre-tax losses of Dollars 50.2m (Pounds 33m) in the three months to the end of September, compared with a Dollars 24.2m profit for the same period in 1991. But a year from now the short-term advantages of shifting product may be seen as a longer-term commercial blunder. One retailer said: 'We now have a distressed market for electrical goods up here in Scotland. Open any newspaper and ads for second-hand unused vacuum cleaners drop out.' Who will benefit from the great Hoover promotion scheme? By the middle of next year Maytag will be in a position to know. JSI Travel promises that Mr Mills should hear from them by January. But unlike vacuum cleaners, goodwill is not easily purchased.</p>

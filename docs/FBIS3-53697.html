This came during a meeting he held today with a delegation from  the International Committee of the Athens International  Conference on Solidarity With Iraq. The conference was held in  Athens on 6-7 November 1993. His excellency added: What we  should do as people -- as well as officials who are aware of  their nation's objectives regarding human relations -- is to  work as hard as we can to reach a sound level in terms of human  ties and relations among nations.    Addressing the chairman and members of the committee, his  excellency, may God preserve him, said: The work you are  undertaking is considered great by almighty God and by the  people of the world, because you are truly democratic and  because you want to see others enjoying what you yourselves are  enjoying. He added: Meanwhile, the others -- those who speak  about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter people  and then continue to kill people by starving them.</p>

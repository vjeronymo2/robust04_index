			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Talk With Live Ammunition" column by Ahmad Sabri] </F>   [Text] Last Saturday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill  banning arms sales to Arab states that are committed to the  boycott of "Israel."    This legislation, which is expected to be approved by the  U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. President Clinton, will  ban arms sales and the offer of any U.S. military services or  advice to any Arab state that tries to convince U.S. companies  to comply with the Arab boycott of Israel.    This U.S. bill is the latest in a series of measures that  seek to eventually end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity  and to intimidate states and companies that comply with this  boycott.    Republican Senator Hank Brown claims the continued Arab  boycott of this entity harms the efforts to establish peace in  the Middle East. However, the contrary is true. This is  because the new U.S. legislation is designed to protect Israel  against the effects of this boycott and shows full bias toward  this entity. It encourages the Zionist entity to persist in  rejecting UN Security Council resolutions and continuing the  policy of settlement building, repression, and torture against  our people in occupied Palestine.    The Arab economic boycott of the enemy was and still is a  necessary measure to protect pan-Arab security against this  entity that was planted by the colonialist West in the heart of  our Arab homeland to implement and protect the West's policies  and to act as its racist, aggressive base against our Arab  nation.    Any talk about ending the boycott of Israeli harms the Arab  nation's vital interests. Its danger stems from the fact that  it will lead to relinquishing and ceding the pan-Arab constants  governing the conflict with the Zionist entity.    Therefore, the U.S. legislation and insistence on passing it  in the wake of Arab concessions in the course of the  Arab-Zionist conflict ultimately aims at shattering these  constants, represented by the boycott and its pan-Arab  justifications, in a bid to impose capitulation on the Arab  nation in accordance with racist Zionist concepts.    Despite the attempts by the United States and its "Israeli"  ally to expand the circle of capitulation and to expedite the  political settlement process, all signs indicate that failure  and a dead end is awaiting them because of the arrogance of the  racist Zionists and the encouragement of the United states,  which cares about nothing but its interests. Any talk about a  just, honorable, and comprehensive peace to restore Arab rights  and territories is nothing but an illusion, something which is  being proved by events.    As shown by the epic of the Mother of Battles and its great  objectives, the Arab nation's only option is to stick to  pan-Arab constants, the unity of their destiny, rejection of  foreign hegemony, refusal to yield to intimidation and the  policy of imposing the status quo, resisting all forms of  extortion and containment, and insisting on self-reliance to  epitomize the Arab nation's unity and protect its pan-Arab  security against any penetration.    What has been taking place in Iraq since its militant  confrontation against the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist military  aggression and the subsequent hostile chapters genuinely  expresses the Arab nation's spirit rejecting capitulation and  aspiring for a prosperous future. The outcome of the Mother of  Battles has begun to concern those seeking to impose  custodianship on our nation and to implant despair in our souls.  Therefore, they are anxiously attempting to contain this light  coming out from the land of Mesopotamia to reach all the free  ones in our nation and the world.</p>

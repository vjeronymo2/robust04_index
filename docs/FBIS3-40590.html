			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sincere Call"] </F>   [Text] The President of Pakistan Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan  Leghari and King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia through a  joint appeal have tried to invoke fear of God in the hearts of  Afghan leaders who are locked in a senseless war against each  other. Both the leaders have reminded Afghan leaders that the  Islamabad accord was authenticated and reaffirmed in the  precincts of holy Haram Sharif in the holy month of Ramadan and  as such they should fear Allah for what they are doing to their  own people. As a first step towards peace, both leaders have  asked the Afghans to effect an immediate and unconditional  ceasefire and then a allow the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization] and its secretary-general, as defined in the  Makkah accord, to secure and monitor a permanent ceasefire  leading to a comprehensive peace and stability in Afghanistan.  The two leaders also discussed other issues and condemned  atrocities being perpetrated in Kashmir and Bosnia.    The cry that in modern warfare no one is the winner does not  seem to have reached Afghanistan where rival factions are still  locked in bloody rocket-lobbing competition against each other  -- former allies. One disturbing part of this warfare is that it  is being repeated with religious punctuality. The Afghans who  fought against the former Soviet Union in the name of religion  are now hell bent upon damaging their religious credentials. The  ground realities of Afghanistan do not leave much space for any  optimistic hope. Today's Afghanistan resembles Lebanon with  different forces controlling different parts of the country and  no one ready to tolerate the other. Lacking democratic  traditions, any difference of opinion among them quickly  disintegrates into a bloody battle due to free availability of  arms. The Afghans don't even accept the Loya Jirga because it  would be a nominated one. They see the UN as a stooge of the  United States. The ICO is being kept at bay by periodic battles.  The only solution under the circumstances is continued dialogue  among themselves in a congenial atmosphere. They have to shed  their narrow, selfish motives and sectarian or ideological  emotions. The Afghan leaders have to show special tolerance and  stop feeding their followers on war-propaganda so that some  common ground is found in a vertically polarised society. It is  high time the Afghans realised the mistake they are committing  by indulging in internecine warfare. Friendly countries are  there to help them sort out their differences so that peace  returns to their country. Let them heed the sincere call made by  President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz  and stop spilling each other's blood.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL WON'T ACCEPT U.N. OBSERVERS;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS HAVE REQUESTED A NEUTRAL FORCE FOR PROTECTION. ISRAEL'S  FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HE IS COUNTING ON THE U.S. TO VETO THE PROPOSAL.  </P> <P> Israel will not allow U.N. observers into the occupied territories to safeguard  the Palestinian population even if the U.N. Security Council approves the  proposal, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said today  </P> <P> Palestinians have requested U.N. observers to protect the 1.7 million Arabs in  the occupied territories from the Israeli army. Most of the 710 Palestinians  killed in the 29-month-old uprising have been slain by army gunfire.  </P> <P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to propose the observer force to a  Friday session of the 15-nation council in Geneva. U.S. Secretary of State  James A. Baker III has said the United States is prepared to discuss the issue.  </P> <P> But Arens said today he hoped that the Security Council would not approve the  force. "I hope that this is not going to take place," he said.  </P> <P> If it does, he said, "Israel would not accept U.N. observers on territory under  Israeli control."  </P> <P> Israeli officials say Israel is legally responsible for administering the  territory, seized in war, and that foreign observers are already present in the  form of U.N. relief staff, Red Cross officials, foreign aid workers and  journalists.  </P> <P> "We feel there is no justification for the stationing of U.N. observers in  areas that are legitimately under Israeli control and came under Israeli  control as a result of Arab aggression in 1967," Arens said.  </P> <P> Arens said Israel was counting on the United States to veto the U.N.  resolution. He said it was crucial that Israel get a chance to explain that a  veto was of "the utmost importance."  </P> <P> Also today, a 15-year-old Palestinian died after being shot by soldiers in an  overnight clash, and the army lifted curfews in the West Bank that had confined  about a million Palestinians to their homes since Sunday.  </P> <P> Refugee camps and towns in the Gaza Strip remained under stay-at-home orders,  except for three small villages. The curfews were to quell rioting that began  Sunday when an apparently deranged Israeli shot and killed seven Arabs.  </P> <P> Labor leader Shimon Peres also rejected the idea of observers but blamed Shamir  for plummeting relations with the United States.  </P> <P> "The question is not one act or another by the United States. The question is  the deterioration in relations between us and the United States that is getting  stronger," Peres said on Israel radio.  </P></p>

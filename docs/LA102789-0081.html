			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PARKING PLAN OKD FOR SAN PEDRO SHOPS  </P> <P> Shoppers in downtown San Pedro would be able to park in an 89-space lot on 7th  Street and reach shops along 6th Street through a pedestrian passageway, under  proposals endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles city transportation officials.  </P> <P> The proposals, which would cost $1.4 million, are regarded as an important part  of plans to resolve a severe parking shortage on 6th Street, the heart of  downtown San Pedro. Merchants have long complained that some shoppers avoid the  area because of inadequate parking, and a study in 1987 identified a deficiency  of up to 120 spaces on the street.  </P> <P> If approved by the City Council, the proposals would create a $1.3-million  deficit in the city's parking revenue fund for council District 15, which  extends from San Pedro to Watts. Transportation officials said they would have  to borrow from the $25.8-million citywide parking fund.  </P> <P> "We need the parking that bad," said Ann D'Amato, deputy to Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, who represents the area.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the Los Angeles Board of Transportation Commissioners  recommended Thursday that the city purchase a brick building, a small parking  lot and a wood house on the 400 block of W. 7th Street to expand an adjacent  48-space city-owned parking lot. Under the proposal, the structures would be  demolished to make way for 41 additional spaces.  </P> <P> In a separate but related vote, the commissioners waived city parking  requirements for the expansion of two buildings on W. 6th Street, directly  behind the city parking lot, which would have compelled their owner to provide  17 new spaces. In exchange, owner Howard Sheldon agreed to set aside 2,000  square feet of the new Harbor Office Supply complex to create a one-story  pedestrian passageway from the 7th Street lot to 6th Street.  </P> <P> Commissioner Larry B. Faigin voted for the deal, but only after expressing some  reservations about giving up 17 spaces when the city is paying $1.4 million to  provide more parking.  </P> <P> "I am concerned that 17 spaces is a lot of spaces to lose," he said.  </P> <P> But city transportation officials said they are willing to trade the spaces for  the passageway because most shoppers will not park on 7th Street and walk  around the block -- via Pacific Avenue on the west or Mesa Street on the east  -- to shops on 6th Street. The pedestrian corridor will be the first public  access to 6th Street from the parking lot, they said.  </P> <P> "It represents such a major enhancement to the project that we are willing to  waive the 17 spaces," said Margaret Sullivan, a management analyst for the  city's Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> Rick Gaydos, president of the San Pedro Revitalization Corp., a nonprofit group  of downtown merchants, said the link between parking on 7th Street and shops on  6th Street is vital to the continued renaissance of the downtown.  </P> <P> "I agree it is expensive," Gaydos said. "But if we didn't encourage businesses  by waiving parking requirements, we wouldn't have anyone coming to town."  </P> <P> The agreement with Sheldon must also be approved by the Planning Department.  The recommendation to purchase the 7th Street properties will be forwarded in  the next few weeks to the City Council, which is expected to approve it. The  council has already set aside $825,000 to expand the parking lot, and Flores  supports spending the additional $641,000.  </P></p>

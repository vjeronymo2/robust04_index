			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Warsaw, 15 Mar--The Civic Committee for the  Defense of Poles in the Vilnius Area [OKOPW] believes that the  already approved text of the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty strikes  against Polish reasons of state and does not protect the  interests of Poles in Lithuania. According to Grzegorz  Dziemidowicz, press spokesman of the MSZ [Foreign Affairs  Ministry], for the time being, the text of the treaty is secret,  and, until it is initialled by the foreign affairs ministers of  both states, the MSZ will not say anything about the issue.    OKOPW Chairman Ryszard Szawlowski said at a news conference  in Warsaw today that there were reservations about both the  preamble to the treaty and the lack of provisions protecting the  interests of Poles resident in Lithuania. Although, in  accordance with earlier announcements, no persons or dates are  mentioned in the preamble, according to him, its provisions  clearly refer to specific historical events.    The statement about the tragic past and losses of both  peoples caused by the Nazi totalitarianism means that the MSZ is  giving the Lithuanians "false moral testimony."    According to the committee, through their policies toward  the  local Poles, the Lithuanian authorities violate international  standards and decisions contained in the Polish-Lithuanian  Declaration, while the present text of the treaty "gives the  Lithuanian authorities an instrument to morally finish off the  Poles in Lithuania." The Polish authorities have not bothered to  ensure that the treaty contains provisions protecting the  interests of the 300,000 Poles in Lithuania, including the  return of land to Polish farmers or property to public  organizations, nor is there an entry concerning a Polish  university in Vilnius.    The treaty is to be initialled next Friday [18 March],  during  Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys's visit to  Warsaw. The committee representatives said they found out the  text of the treaty from "reliable sources" in the Vilnius area.  They told journalists that they had talked about the treaty  with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Luczak but that he did not  say anything about its possible renegotiation. [passage omitted]</p>

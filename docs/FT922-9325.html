			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Sears It is just 10 years since Sears' annual profits went through Pounds 100m. They have now done it again in the opposite direction. The cycle aside, the company has lost its way. The proposition is that its culture and strategy can now be transformed by the new chief executive, Mr Liam Strong. It would not do to count on it. The company's problem is not merely the huge waste of resources tied up in its shoe shops. Selfridges and Freemans, which made up almost two thirds of last year's profits, are not growing either. If these problems prove intractable, Mr Strong promises more radical action. But he gives himself several years. Meanwhile, the valuation of the shares - down 7 per cent yesterday to 97p - rests purely on yield and asset backing. It is vulnerable on both counts. The net asset value per share of 83p is based on property valuations dating back to 1988. The company now reckons its property values are down 8 per cent, the retail part down 15 per cent. As for the dividend, the company's explicit caution about the future is understandable given that the held payment is less than four fifths covered. Last year, Sears spent Pounds 66m on fixed assets. It is now paying out Pounds 81m in dividends. If the directors believe that shareholders' money is better deployed outside the business, it seems sensible for shareholders to take the hint.</p>

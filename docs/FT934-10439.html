			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Nuclear tests for bungee jumpers Project management techniques developed in the nuclear power industry have now been applied to that most unlikely of sports - bungee jumping. Nigel Holloway, chief technical consultant at AEA, of Didcot, applied two safety principles used in the nuclear industry - redundancy and competence - to produce a code of practice for the bungee jumping industry. Redundancy means that any critical component in the jump should have a spare or redundant equivalent - the bungee ropes must be attached to the jumper by two separate means, for example. Holloway is so confident of the procedures that he did a jump himself. AEA: UK, 0235 432439.</p>

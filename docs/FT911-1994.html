			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Yankee paper moves into spotlight A FEW issues emerged in the Eurobond market, even though most of Europe was closed for May Day. But borrowers requiring dollar financing are currently looking more closely at the Yankee bond market - the US market for foreign borrowers - where funding is now cheaper for maturities of seven years and longer than in the Eurobond market, according to traders. Secondary market spreads have tightened due to firm institutional demand for corporate debt at that area of the yield curve. A US unit of ICI tapped the Yankee bond market yesterday via Merrill Lynch, raising Dollars 250m of 10-year senior notes which were priced to yield 75 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. The deal sold out shortly after launch, according to the lead manager. However, Unilever Capital Corporation, which tapped the shorter end of the market, chose to fund in the Eurobond market. Distribution of Unilever's Dollars 250m five-year Eurobond was hampered by the holiday in continental Europe, but lead manager JP Morgan said that much of the issue had already been placed. Competitive rates in the Yankee market have also enticed supranational agencies, historically better liked by European than by US investors, to the Yankee bond market. The Inter-American Development Bank brought a Dollars 300m 10-year issue, via Goldman Sachs. The IADB, paying a margin of 49 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury yield, saved several basis points by tapping the US foreign bond market rather than the Eurobond market, dealers said. It is the second offering by a supranational agency in the Yankee bond market within a week, following a Dollars 300m offering by the Asian Development Bank, at a similar spread, via Salomon Brothers. In the Eurobond market, firm demand for a Pounds 200m mortgage-backed issue reflected the improving performance of the sector, which is still recovering from a slump early this year after the Bank of England announced a potential increase in the capital weighting for mortgage-backed securities held by banks. The Pounds 200m issue of fixed and floating rate notes backed by mortgages originated by National Home Loans, a specialist mortgage lender, was priced attractively, dealers said. Fixed-rate, mortgage-backed securities appear to be becoming better accepted by investors. The Pounds 100m portion of five-year fixed-rate bonds was priced to yield 98 basis points above the five-year gilt, a slight pick-up over the Household Mortgage Corporation's recent issue. The new deal was bid at 97 basis points at the end of the day.</p>

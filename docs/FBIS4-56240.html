			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Jose Maria Monzon] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Aug (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella moved stealthily through the corridors of the  congressional building on 28 April to calm down Justicialist  Party [PJ] senators over what immediate consequences the U.S.  threat to commercially blacklist Argentina, and the latter's  failure to approve the pharmaceutical patents law, may have.    The Argentine foreign minister reportedly explained in  general terms the concrete meaning of the sanctions that  Washington is threatening to levy, although he must have also  dispensed a few sarcastic remarks about the senators' lack of  political acumen in the handling of this issue, which plays a  key role in the relations between the two countries.    This was the minister's reaction to the legislative maze,  where the bill on patents got lost after the national executive  branch sent it to the Senate in May 1993. The truth is that the  bill became the target of a tug-of-war between the ruling party  and the opposition, until it was finally left in the hands of a  complex system of committees, three of them controlled by the  opposition Radical Civic Union and the other two by the JP.    This allowed the opposition not only more elbow room, but  also left it in control of the issue to deal with all the  interested parties. In fact, the person who knows most about  the subject in the Senate is the speaker for the opposition:  Jose Genoud, senator for Mendoza Province.    Genoud favors a new patents law that will recognize the  right  of every inventor to produce and market his medicines, but  unlike the administration he wants the law to set restrictions  to prevent monopolies, and also believes that the law should  give Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories a reasonable period  of time to adjust.    The slumber of the ruling party was shattered earlier this  week when reports from Washington indicated that U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor had officially notified Minister  Domingo Cavallo that at the end of April Argentina will join the  black list of countries that have not approved a pharmaceutical  patents law, as large U.S. pharmaceutical industries want them  to do.    The inclusion of our country on that list make us vulnerable  to commercial sanctions, which does not mean they will be  imposed immediately.    Kantor does not have the authority to determine the type of  sanctions that will be imposed, or the moment for their  implementation. His job is to point out which countries are, in  his opinion, violating commercial commitments with the United  States.    In order to understand the situation it is necessary to go  back to 1991, when George Bush was still president and his  representative was the inflexible Carla Hills. At that time  Domingo Cavallo thought it was a good idea to use the issue of  patents in negotiations. He promised to speed up the approval  of the patents law, which was being pushed by U.S. laboratories,  in exchange for more flexibility on the issue of the debt.    But the initiative could not prosper in Congress. The U.S.  Embassy and Government then started pressuring the Menem  administration to take up the issue with Justicialist  legislators. However, executive branch recommendations have so  far not fared well, and President Menem says only that the  executive branch has sent the bill to Congress, and the issue is  in the hands of legislators.    The government understands that even though the country is  included on the black list, sanctions will not be imposed for at  least a year. This period is enough for Congress to approve the  GATT agreement, which would give Argentina the possibility of  resorting to GATT's more flexible and benign requirements in the  area of patents. If this is the case, the United States will  find it harder to apply sanctions.</p>

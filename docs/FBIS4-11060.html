			<p>BFN     [Text] Praising the Peruvian Government's achievements  during the past two years, which he said he learned about in  detail during his official visit to Peru, Argentine Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella said that hopes for Peru's future have  been revived at a continental level.    The Argentine minister arrived in Peru on the evening of 4  April. Yesterday he had a busy agenda. He said: "Peru's  prospects today are not the same as they were a while ago; they  are now much better, and we want to participate in this process."    He commented that the changes implemented by President  Alberto Fujimori during the past two years are similar to those  carried out by Argentina and other countries.    Di Tella said: "This is why I believe there are new chances  of cooperation and greater collaboration because instead of  rhetoric we now see concrete deeds."    Establishing the Joint Peruvian-Argentine Commission with  his  Peruvian counterpart Efrain Goldenberg, Di Tella said the  commission will assess the integration policies contained in  bilateral projects.    He and Minister Goldenberg reviewed the economic and  political issues of the agenda which, he said, were then passed  for assessment by the commission which disclosed its conclusions  yesterday afternoon.    The Argentine foreign minister then disclosed that on 17 and  18 July, Argentine President Carlos Menem will pay an official  visit to Lima.    He did not announce an agenda because the chiefs of state  will draft it.    Early this morning Di Tella placed a wreath at the monument  of Argentine forefather Jose de San Martin in the square of the  same name.    Referring to Menem's visit, he said it will be a sign of  support for the changes currently taking place in Peru.    Regarding the constitutional reform to allow presidential  reelection in his country, he said it has the support of the  great majority of the people.</p>

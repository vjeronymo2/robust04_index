			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (47): Nightmare for governments - Foreign Exchange / The problems central banks face in currency markets FOR THE banks which deal in the currency markets, the past 12 months have brought huge volatility in exchange rates and huge profits. But for government leaders committed to defending exchange rate targets, the last year has been a nightmare. Events in the currency markets provide the clearest indication yet that the globalisation of capital - one of the most striking developments in the world economy in recent years - is making it difficult for central banks to manage exchange rate movements. In the late 1980s, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries had much success managing exchange rate moves by buying and selling their currencies in intervention operations. The Plaza and Louvre accords helped to control the movements of the dollar. Research has shown that of the 17 episodes of co-ordinated intervention between 1985 and 1991, all were successful at moving exchange rates in the desired direction. But, since the last autumn central bank intervention has been a story of failure. The US authorities failed to prevent a sharp fall in the dollar last August. And repeated intervention by European central banks failed to stop the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism. Discrepancies in national monetary policies partly explain why the ERM's central banks failed to maintain the system's tight fluctuation bands. Foreign exchange dealers realised that the goal of sustaining the value of the French franc through high interest rates was unsustainable at a time of rising French unemployment. But a far bigger problem for monetary authorities has been the growth of cross-border capital flows following the removal of exchange controls in most industrialised countries. Investment flows in the foreign exchange market have increased dramatically in recent years, pushing foreign exchange turnover up to Dollars 1,000bn a day. This dwarfs the reserves of the central banks and makes it difficult for them to intervene in markets. As the International Monetary Fund said in a recent report: 'When private markets, led by the increasing financial muscle of institutional investors, reach the concerted view that the risk/return outlook for a particular currency has deteriorated significantly, a defending central bank can be faced with a run that could easily amount to, say, Dollars 100-200bn a week.' Why have flows in the currency markets reached such huge proportions? The increasing proportion of cross-border holdings of bonds and equities by institutional investors has led to a huge increase inflows. The International Monetary Fund recently reported that cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991 - and the figure is set to rise further. These cross-border funds not only dwarf central bank reserves in size, but fund managers can also successfully hedge exposure to exchange rate movements by shifting the weightings in parallel currency funds rather than selling assets outright. Most of the G7 governments face large budget deficits as a result of expansionary policies in the 1980s. They have raised government bond issues in huge quantities to help meet their borrowing requirements - but they may have undermined their currencies by courting foreign investors in this way. French bond sales go some way to explaining the vulnerability of the franc. According to some analysts, while France's total tradable public debt has recently increased by 50 per cent, non-resident holdings of French paper have risen 1,000 per cent in the same period. Foreign exchange dealing is becoming an increasingly attractive way of taking financial risk without falling foul of central banks' capital requirements. A dealer can quickly move in and out of a currency, making a return but not retaining a large outstanding position at the end of the day's trading. The growth of foreign exchange volumes - and its impact on exchange rates - is not something that central banks are happy to ignore. ERM membership was seen by European countries as a way of importing Germany's tough anti-inflation policy through the exchange rate. Sharp fluctuations in exchange rates are seen as a hindrance to trade. In the summer, the US administration successfully talked down the dollar/yen exchange rate, thereby beating Japan into submission on the issue of its trade surplus. So how can central banks respond to the problem? Some thoughts were recently suggested by Mr Andrew Crockett, the head of the Bank of England's international division. He argued in a paper that the integration of capital markets meant central banks need to come up with more credible ways to move towards exchange rate fixity. Mr Crockett says that the route from flexible to fixed rates should not be the gradual one of progressive hardening through something like an exchange rate mechanism. Instead, countries must first establish a track record of price stability during periods in which their exchange rates are relatively flexible. 'The attempt to use hard exchange rate constraints to enforce price level convergence when the initial position is one of substantial inflation divergence has considerable dangers,' he says. 'International portfolio managers will inevitably be sceptical about whether external disciplines will be allowed to work when domestic disciplines have proved inadequate.' Mr Crockett also argues that countries which fully fix exchange rates have important advantages over those who operate fixed but adjustable policies. 'There are advantages in convincing markets that the instrument of exchange rate adjustment has ben abandoned,' he says. 'The more markets believe that other forms of adjustment will always be used in preference to exchange rate realignment, the less likely is exchange market pressure to arise in the first place.'</p>

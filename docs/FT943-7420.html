			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower on Dollars weakness US Treasury bonds moved sharply lower yesterday as the dollar continued to weaken against other leading currencies. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 27/32 at 99 9/32 , with the yield rising to 7.554 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.227 per cent. After holding fairly steady on Friday, bonds across the board resumed a decline which had begun the day after the Federal Reserve's decision last week to boost short-term interest rates. In the absence of any fresh economic statistics, the focus yesterday was on the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency lost further ground against the yen and the D-Mark amid concerns over US-Japanese trade talks. Bond traders fear a weak dollar may discourage overseas investment in US-denominated securities. There was also concern over this week's influx of new supply. The market faces the auction of Dollars 17.25bn in two-year notes today, followed by the sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow. Amid the current pessimism, demand could prove disappointing. That prospect put the market on the defensive. Bonds across the board registered moderate losses in the early going, but the damage grew more pronounced as the session progressed. However, traders stressed that the damage was exaggerated by light activity. Fears that German inflation could nudge above 3 per cent this month and rumours of a large sell order wiped around a half-point off German government bonds soon after the opening. The weakness in bunds dragged down other European markets in the morning but they later recovered. Dealers said that although bunds stabilised at lower levels, after the rumoured selling failed to materialise, the mood remained bleak and volume thin. Even the continued strength of the D-Mark failed to support bund prices. A further depressant was the Bundesbank's announcement that it would be holding an auction of four-year treasury notes next week. The news focused the market's attention once again on the Bundesbank's large funding programme. Dealers believe the central bank is aiming to raise around DM6bn from the auction. On Liffe, the September bund future went as low as 91.00 at one stage but by the late afternoon it recovered to 91.23, down 0.13 point on the day. Volume was relatively robust for August. UK gilts bounced back from the day's lows and moved into positive territory in the afternoon, though sterling's fall to a 1994 low against the D-Mark was seen to have limited gains. The market was cheered by the second-quarter GDP data which according to Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg showed no inflation, weaker consumer demand and a shift to exports. 'The GDP numbers do promise an appealing future for gilts,' he said. The September long gilt future on Liffe stood  1/4 point higher at 100 13/32 in the late afternoon, off the day's low of 100 3/8 , in low volume of just over 36,000 lots. Elsewhere, the Italian and Swedish bond markets bounced back after last week's weakness which had followed the interest rate rises in both countries. The 10-year Swedish yield spread against bunds narrowed by around 50 basis points to 385 points after reaching almost 500 points last week. Italian 10-year government bonds rose by just over a half-point.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Lonrho board faces big changes LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, will take a big step towards becoming a more conventional public company this week by appointing its first non-executive directors for two decades. The company's directors received a proposal at the weekend for the appointment as non-executives of Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, and Mr Steven Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group. They have been recruited by Mr Dieter Bock, who at the beginning of the year acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho and was then appointed joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's guiding force for 30 years. Mr Walls and Mr Harper - whose remuneration will be Pounds 30,000 a year - are expected to set up Lonrho's first audit committee, to review its financial performance. Mr Rowland, who has been opposed to non-executives since 1973 when the so-called 'straight eight' directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, then deputy chairman, tried unsuccessfully to remove him as chief executive. Mr Rowland is not expected to try to block this week's appointments because Mr Bock made it a condition of his investment in Lonrho that non-executives should be appointed. Mr Bock is expected soon to recruit one or two other non-executives. In the long term, he is likely to seek to reduce the number of full-time executives on the board from the present 12.</p>

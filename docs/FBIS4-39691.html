			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia intends to secure from the Paris Club a  deferment for the repayment of 20 billion dollars, a  high-ranking representative of the Finance Ministry told the  Financial Information Agency, commenting on the recent agreement  on the deferment of the repayment of 7 billion dollars.    By agreement with the Paris Club, Moscow will repay the 7  billion dollars over a period stretching till the year 2010. To  quote this representative, the talks held in Paris on June 2 and  3 were based on the March agreement between Moscow and the  International Monetary Fund on the extension of the second part  of the 1.5 billion dollar systematic transformation credit.    To reach an agreement on deferment, Russia is to secure the  International Monetary Fund's approval and receive reserve  credit from it of about 4 billion dollars.    Talks between the Central Bank and Finance Ministry on the  one hand, and the International Monetary Fund on the other are  to begin next autumn.</p>

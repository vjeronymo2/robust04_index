			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NOTEBOOK: READ HIS LIPS: DRAG PERFORMANCE IS DESIGNED TO BE RIDICULOUS,  ABSURD AND FUNNY  </P> <P> John Epperson imagined a career in straight entertainment would be a drag.  </P> <P> But a career in drag might be great entertainment.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to do something ridiculous and absurd," said Epperson, 35, who  will bring his drag act Thursday to Cafe Largo in the Fairfax District. "I  discovered I could make people laugh."  </P> <P> So he became Lypsinka, the star of a 20-song, 30-minute musical journey. He  deliberately seeks out songs from the unheralded. "I pride myself on finding  the most obscure stuff. If people know the songs, they'll know it's not me  singing, and that will decrease the illusion."  </P> <P> Epperson, who was a rehearsal pianist for the American Ballet Theater and who  has also performed his act in New York, sings the songs of Delores Gray, Kay  Thompson and Mimi Hines, and goes through several costume changes. Eventually,  he hopes to graduate to another career level.  </P> <P> "I do find lip-syncing limiting," he said. "I can do more things with my voice,  and someday, I will. I can sing."  </P> <P> Jean-Pierre Boccara, co-owner of Cafe Largo, considers his club ideal for  Epperson's cabaret-style routine.  </P> <P> "It's all camp," he said. "It moves so fast, the story of camp in a half hour."  </P> <P> Tickets for Epperson's show will cost $6.  </P> <P> John Epperson will present his drag act at Cafe Largo, 432 N. Fairfax, at 9 and  10:15 p.m. Aug. 16. For information, call 213-852-1073.  </P> <P>  A new record of traditional country music by San Fernando Valley artists has  recently been completed.  </P> <P> Called "Down in the Valley," the independent album features 10 songs by 10  country performers. Producer Dave Pearlman said the concept is long overdue.  </P> <P> "There is real traditional country music in L.A.," Pearlman said, "but that's  not what is being recorded. You hear rock 'n' roll bands who bought cowboy  hats; that's not real country. We have people who lean more toward Merle  Haggard and George Jones."  </P> <P> Pearlman said it's too early to gauge the level of interest in the record,  which has just been sent out to the record companies. A release party will be  held at Tuesday's Barn Dance concert at the Palomino in North Hollywood. Most  of the artists involved will sing their tunes from the record. Among the  performers: Eddie Dunbar, Dale Watson, Heather Myles, Joe Williamson, Re  Winkler, Jenny Yates, Dave Austin, Theresa James, R.B. Greaves and Pearlman.  </P> <P> The hard rock group Tuff, which sold out two shows at the Roxy last month, has  signed a record contract with Atlantic/Titanium.  </P> <P> Tuff, which has often played at Reseda's Country Club, is scheduled to begin  studio work in late August. Shelly Berggren, the group's booking agent, said  the band will record many of the songs they've played in Los Angeles the past  three years.  </P> <P> The signing marks the end of an 18-month search. There is no date yet for the  album's release.  </P></p>

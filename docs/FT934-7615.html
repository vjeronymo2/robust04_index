			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Warning tempers welcome from Tokyo - Japan JAPAN yesterday welcomed the US vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement, but warned that it will watch closely to ensure there is no discrimination against countries outside the region. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who himself won parliamentary passage of important plans for political reform only hours after the US vote, praised the US govern JAPAN ment for getting Nafta through the House of Representatives. Nafta will avert protectionist moves in the US Congress, predicted Mr Terusuke Terada, foreign ministry spokesman. However, Nafta should be implemented in accordance with Gatt rules and must not raise obstacles to foreign countries, he added. The foreign ministry's warning was echoed by the Keidanren business federation. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its chairman, said the Keidanren would closely monitor the fair enforcement of rules of origin under Nafta. Separately, banking officials predicted that the accord could encourage more Japanese companies and banks to invest in Mexico. Shares in Tokyo rose sharply just before the Nafta vote, partly in anticipation of success, but the Nikkei 225 average fell back later in the day, to end up 57.61 points at 18,166.32.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Codswollop What can have got into their Lordships? The Earl of Longford, the former Labour cabinet minister, was yesterday complimenting Earl Ferrers, the home office minister, on his ability to preach 'just as acceptably whatever message he is required to deliver, even if a subsequent message contradicts an earlier one'. Ferrers replied that receiving kind words from Longford was 'rather like shaking hands with a fish; it slides all over the place and one does not know whether one has hold of the head or the tail'.</p>

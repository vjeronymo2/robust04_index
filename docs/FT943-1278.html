			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Damned by lack of controversy - William Packer lambasts the judges of the new Jerwood Prize for their unadventurous choice I should have known it would happen, if only on the principle that if things can be got wrong, they will. There is no such thing as a racing certainty, even of failure, as we should know from the example of the splendid Moonax, coming from the back of the field the other day to take the St Leger at 40:1. A couple of weeks ago I wrote in encouraging terms about the new Jerwood Painting Prize - worth Pounds 30,000 to the winner - just as the work of the six finalists went on show. While not intended as a direct reproach and rival to the Turner Prize, it fills a gap in the programme, being confined to painters, of which we have in Britain an inordinate number, and whom in recent years the Turner selectors have largely ignored. The Jerwood is also open to artists of all ages - I mistakenly said the Turner age-limit is 40 when in fact it is 50. And now, in Craigie Aitchison, we have the first winner, and I can hardly believe the judges could have done such a thing. For Aitchison is at once the most unexceptionable and unexceptional of the bunch, neither unpopular nor unsuccessful. It is the safest and, as I can now see with hindsight, the most predictable of results. By this very lack of controversy and adventure, the prize is damned. Given the field the judges had chosen, here was a wonderful opportunity for them to make a powerful statement to the world at large on the current condition of British painting. Here too was the chance to establish the prize itself, at its inaugural test, as an event of the first importance. And they have blown it. In the particular and personal case it is as hateful as it is unfair to pillory Aitchison himself, for he is an inoffensive and, in his own terms, accomplished painter. But it is the judges themselves who have thus set him up and exposed him. Do they really mean to tell us he is the one artist, not just of the final six but of the 250 who entered for selection, who now stands, by the judges' own criterion, for all that is truly excellent in modern British painting? Do they really believe, in direct comparison with the other five, that he is still the best, with his decorative mannerism, his formulaic figuration, his subjective sentimentality? Better than Yuko Shiraishi, shall we say, with her no less seductive surfaces, but infinitely tougher commitment to her own minimalist abstraction? Better than John Lessore, whose apparent reticence is belied by the ever more ambitious scale and scope of his figure compositions? Better than that old war-horse of an abstract expressionist, John Hoyland, the one finalist to have achieved any international reputation and who, after some time in the doldrums, seems to be coming back to his true strength? And I did not think that even these were in with a real chance. I made, and make, no secret of my preferences. Had they chosen Maurice Cockrill, the prize would have gone to a late and still fast-developing artist, one who has never been painting better and will surely soon be stepping out onto the international stage. And had they given it to Euan Uglow, they would have been giving it quite simply to one of the best artists working anywhere in the world today. Where others dissimulate or, at best, fudge an accuracy of scrutiny and statement, he achieves it. But they didn't, and I can hardly say how disappointed in them I am, at the opportunity they have thus thrown away. I shall name names. Hilton Kramer, distinguished critic and editor of the New Criterion in New York who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Uglow in the past, is known to be deeply distressed at the result. So too is Judith Collins, a senior curator at the Tate. Here then are the other four whose fateful decision it was - Sir Peter Wakefield, late of the National Art Collections Fund, Anna Ford of the BBC, Lord Gowrie of the Arts Council, and my opposite number on The Sunday Telegraph, John McEwen. Oh dear. Come back the Turner Prize, all is forgiven - well, possibly. Watch this space. The Jerwood Painting Prize: Winner and Short List Exhibition; Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1, until September 28: sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation and The Sunday Telegraph, in association with Modern Painters.</p>

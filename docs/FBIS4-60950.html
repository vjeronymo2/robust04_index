			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 30/4/1994 -- The Dniester  Republic Women's Union (TWU), which is considered an extreme  branch of the separatist movement in eastern Moldova, sent a  message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev accusing General Aleksandr Lebed [commander of the  14th Russian Army stationed in Dniester] of attempting to  liquidate the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The message  says that if Lebed ignores the Dniester legislation on  Tiraspol's right to possess the 14th Army's property, the women  will enchain themselves arm in arm with their children to  prevent the evacuation of the Russian military troops and  equipment from the Dniester region. The TWU asks Yeltsin to  dismiss General Lebed as the 14th Army's commander. It also  demands Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic. The TWU warns Yeltsin not to use the Dniester region  "as a medium of exchange in political games."</p>

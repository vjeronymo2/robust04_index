			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSAULT SUSPECT CHOSE WRONG WOMEN TO PICK ON  </P> <P> Every morning, Patty Rodriguez jogs before going to work at the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department, where she investigates sexual assaults.  </P> <P> Tuesday morning, she fell victim to one.  </P> <P> Deputy Rodriguez, 37, said she and her running partner, Deputy Kim Thompson,  32, were jogging on Mednick Avenue in East Los Angeles about 7:30 a.m. when a  22-year-old man grabbed her buttocks.  </P> <P> Rodriguez tried to detain the man but let go when he tried to hit her with a  rock, she said in an interview. The man escaped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They Spot Suspect  </P> <P> The two women continued their run, hoping to see the assailant again, Rodriguez  said. Just before completing the course, the women saw him on Atlantic  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to get him," Rodriguez said. "I am so sick and tired of women  not being able to (be safe on) the streets."  </P> <P> As Thompson, the better runner, chased the assailant, Rodriguez went to a house  and called 911. After a 10- to 15-minute chase over more than a mile, Thompson  caught the suspect at Woods Avenue and the Pomona Freeway.  </P> <P> Rodriguez caught up with her just as uniformed deputies arrived.  </P> <P> "When he saw the deputy behind me, he wasn't going to go without a fight,"  Rodriguez said. The suspect struggled about three minutes before he was  subdued, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Put His Hands Up'  </P> <P> "Finally, he just tired out and put his hands up," Thompson said.  </P> <P> Aurliano Diaz of East Los Angeles was arrested on suspicion of assault with a  deadly weapon and sexual battery and was being held on $2,000 bail.  </P> <P> The incident did not stop the women from completing their run. Instead of  riding back with deputies, they jogged half a mile to the East Los Angeles  Sheriff's Station. Rodriguez is based there; Thompson works on gang problems  out of the Firestone station.  </P> <P> The women normally run three or four miles a day. "I got about a seven-mile run  in today," Thompson said. "I was exhausted."  </P></p>

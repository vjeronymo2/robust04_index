			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Monetary credentials still in doubt - America Those wayward financial markets are at it again. This is the fashionable reaction in Washington to soaring US bond yields. Mr Michael Mussa, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, complained last week of a market 'over-reaction'. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, seemed personally affronted that yields could have risen well above 7 per cent when inflation is low and the budget deficit declining. Inflation may remain fairly subdued for a while. But bondholders are not stupid. They are naturally worried about the highly uncertain outlook for inflation in the second half of the 1990s and beyond. Unlike many of its trading partners, including Germany, the US managed to avoid a hyper-inflation this century. As a result it lacks a strong national consensus on the importance of stable prices. There is little appetite among politicians, the general public - or even academic economists - for tough monetary policies. Nobody is anxious to 'defend the currency': the dollar is widely seen as something to be devalued as fast as possible so as to give US exporters the maximum advantage in overseas markets. On Capitol Hill, Senators Paul Sarbannes and Jim Sasser, two senior Democrats, reacted predictably to the Federal Reserve's latest quarter-point increase in interest rates: 'It seems that just as the economy is coming back up for air, the Fed shoves it back down.' The response from academic luminaries was no more enlightened: Mr James Tobin, the revered Nobel laureate, described the Fed's action as an 'unprovoked attack on the economy'. This, note, three years into an expansion and after annualised growth of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. The White House, so far, is holding its tongue. But it is telling that Ms Laura Tyson, President Bill Clinton's chief economist, used a recent New York Times column to deride financial markets' fear of inflation. Such action by a senior official would be inconceivable in London, Bonn or Tokyo. On Friday, Mr Clinton finally decided to nominate Mr Alan Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, as vice-chairman of the Fed and Ms Janet Yellen, a Berkeley economist, to a second vacancy on the Fed's board. Had these been Supreme Court nominations, Mr Clinton would have relished his role as master of ceremonies in the White House Rose Garden. Yet although the Fed's success or failure in controlling inflation is likely to have at least as great an impact on Americans' lives as any legal decision, Mr Clinton failed to turn up in person. And the media, which obsessively analyses the lives and opinions of potential Supreme Court justices, treated the event as a boring technicality. Against this backdrop, what guarantee is there that US inflation will stay under 5 per cent in the medium term? The commitment to low inflation in Europe and Japan is not much comfort because US inflation is largely determined by US monetary policy. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, admittedly says he wants 'price stability', but he has yet to get the core rate significantly below 3 per cent and his second term expires in less than two years. And the balance of power within the Fed is already shifting toward the 'inflation doves'. Mr Blinder and Ms Yellen are competent macro-economists. But as self-proclaimed 'pragmatists' in the Keynesian tradition, they are certain to be less hawkish than the Republican appointees they replace. And as future Fed vacancies arise, the tilt towards 'growth-oriented' policies will become more pronounced. In spite of Mr Greenspan's attempts to re-educate Congress and the public, economic debate in the US is redolent of the 1960s. Policymakers from the president down still believe in a 'Phillips curve' trade-off between inflation and economic growth. Fed tightening - even the mild  3/4 percentage point so far announced - is widely seen as a heartless attack on the jobless. Such primitive fears, of course, are not remotely justified. Indeed, it is hard to grasp how this supposedly pragmatic view ever gained economic respectability. Why should a steady decline in money's purchasing power increase general prosperity? At best the stupid process of raising prices and salaries every year for reasons entirely unrelated to economic efficiency would be neutral for growth. In practice, as Mr Greenspan has stressed, inflation nearly always destroys jobs and wealth. The reason ought to be obvious. A steady rise in the average level of prices reduces the efficiency of the market system - the main determinant of living standards - because it blurs the crucial economic signals relayed by changes in relative prices. In the short run nobody can tell whether the rise in the price of a particular commodity reflects pertinent economic forces or merely general inflation. Nobody should thus be surprised that lower rates of inflation are historically associated not only with higher productivity, but with higher growth of productivity. The ability of the US to generate growth and jobs should not be doubted because this task is (largely) delegated to markets. The nation's ability to control inflation, unfortunately, is far less certain because this task is delegated to highly fallible policymakers. Since the Fed moved late to tighten monetary policy and, so far, has acted tentatively, bond investors are fully justified in demanding an inflation premium. The only reliable route to lower yields - and faster economic growth - lies in more aggressive Fed action. Even that may not be enough to offset unhelpful signals from an ignorant political elite.</p>

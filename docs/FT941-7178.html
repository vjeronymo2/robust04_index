			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Setback for Hollinger earnings Hollinger, the international newspaper holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, suffered a two-thirds fall in earnings last year, despite an 8 per cent rise in the contribution from its flagship, the UK-based Telegraph group. The drop was largely due to higher interest expenses and unusual items, mostly related to Hollinger's acquisition of a 9.3 per cent interest in Southam, Canada's biggest daily newspaper chain. The Telegraph also has a 9.3 per cent stake in Southam. Hollinger's operating earnings were virtually unchanged before taking the unusual items and the cost of the Southam investment into account. Net earnings dipped to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 18.80m), or 31 cents a share, from CDollars 74m, or CDollars 1.14, in 1992. Revenues advanced to CDollars 888m from CDollars 870m. Although the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph reported an 18 per cent rise in operating earnings, the impact on Hollinger's income was dampened by the weaker pound against the Canadian dollar. Operating results improved in all businesses except for Canadian publications. Hollinger recently announced plans to spin off part of its wholly-owned Canadian and US subsidiaries to the public. The net cost of the Southam investment is estimated at CDollars 6.5m in 1994 (assuming constant interest rates and an unchanged dividend), down from CDollars 18.2m last year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the airworthiness authority for Germany, recently notified the FAA that Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders contain a similar wing configuration. The LBA advises that, if periodic inspections are not accomplished on the wing spar of the referenced gliders, then wood rot could occur. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could result in failure of the wing spar and subsequent loss of control of the glider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alexander Schleicher has issued ASW&hyph;12 TN No. 4, dated May 10, 1989, and ASW&hyph;17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989, which specify procedures for repetitively inspecting the wing spar on the Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;12, ASW&hyph;15, ASW&hyph;15B, and ASW&hyph;17 gliders of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;5997, with a new AD that would (1) retain the requirement of repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood rot on the Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B gliders, and replacing the wing spar if wood rot is found; and (2) extend these repetitive inspections and possible replacement to Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with either Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;15 TN No. 23, dated April 21, 1988; Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;12 TN No. 4, dated May 10, 1989; or Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989, as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance time presented in the proposed AD is based upon calendar time instead of hours time-in-service. Rotting of the wood wing box spar is caused by moisture and the condition could exist or develop regardless of whether the glider is in actual operation. For this reason, the FAA has determined that the compliance time of the proposed AD action should be in calendar time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 50 gliders (7 ASW&hyph;12's, 27 ASW&hyph;15's, 6 ASW&hyph;15B's, and 10 ASW&hyph;17's) in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 workhours to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $110 per glider, and the proposed core analysis would cost $185. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,750. This figure is based upon the assumption that no affected glider owner/operator has accomplished the proposed inspection, nor does it account for repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining the number of repetitive inspections an owner/operator may incur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05 required the same actions as is proposed on 33 airplanes. With this in mind, the cost impact of the proposed AD upon U.S. operators is reduced $21,615 from $32,750 to $11,135. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: SKF still in the red but sees profit for full year SKF of Sweden, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, reported a first-quarter loss (after financial items) of SKr34m (Dollars 1.7m), following a final quarter loss of SKr306m in 1991 and a first-quarter profit last year of SKr59m. The group forecast a full-year profit for 1992 and said it does not expect to see a further deterioration in business conditions, although it warned that an upturn was not expected until the first half of 1993. SKF made a loss of SKr221m (after financial items) for 1991 as the world recession hurt demand for its products. Group sales in the latest quarter were SKr7.16bn, up 14.8 per cent on the previous quarter and 3.4 per cent up on the 1991 first quarter. SKF's bearings division reported a first-quarter profit (after financial items) of SKr90m, against SKr79m in the same period last year and a loss of SKr260m in the final quarter of 1991.</p>

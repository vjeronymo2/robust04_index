			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Wilhelm Wilhelmsen up sharply at eight months Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, the Norwegian shipping group, reported a sharp rise in eight-month pre-tax profits, before minority interests, to NKr398m (Dollars 61m) from NKr98m, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The group booked a currency gain of NKr98m, against a loss of NKr38m last year, and benefited from a NKr180m gain on the disposal of its shareholding in the Polar Pioneer drilling rig. Freight income for the period was unchanged at NKr2.39bn but operating profit, before depreciation, slipped to NKr449m from NKr469m. Wilhelmsen Lines, in which the group holds a 55 per cent stake, continued to develop positively but tanker activities suffered from adverse market conditions. The car transport business, however, strengthened during the second four-month period. The shipowner said business activities, other than tankers, would develop steadily during the remainder of the year but warned that because of considerable uncertainties over the development of the tanker market it might be forced to write down the book value of one of its vessels.</p>

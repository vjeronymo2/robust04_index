			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Survey shows recovery is gathering pace Japan's economic recovery is gradually gathering impetus, although weak capital investment suggests the upturn will continue to be slow, according to the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey. The bank's index of business confidence showed that the balance between manufacturing companies reporting poor or good conditions improved to -29 in November, from -39 in the previous survey in August. The index, covering nearly 10,000 companies, is Japan's most authoritative measure of the short-term economic outlook and guides the central bank's monetary policy. According to the survey, big companies plan to cut capital spending by 3.9 per cent this year, slightly more than they were forecasting in August, although less steep than last year's 11.3 per cent fall in investment. Corporate investment caution reflects the weak sales outlook, with turnover forecast to rise by a mere 0.8 per cent this year, after a 5.8 per cent fall in 1993. Excess employment is still a problem, with a balance of 32 reporting that their payrolls are too large. However, manufacturing employment is declining at 2.5 per cent annually, according to the latest labour ministry report, suggesting this problem might soon start to diminish. Surplus production capacity also continues to be a burden, although a declining one, the survey says. Manufacturers told the central bank that profits would rise by 24 per cent in the year to the end of next March, better than the 16.1 per cent increase they were expecting in August. Service companies, dragged down by the financial sector, have revised their expected profits decline to 1.8 per cent, from 5.1 per cent in the last survey.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Tokyo - Other markets With the Japan Tobacco listing and oversupply worries out of the way, investors will focus on corporate results and currency movements this week, writes Emiko Terazono. Interim results so far have proved better than expected for many export-orientated companies, due to demand from the US and Asia. However, profit announcements have failed to move share prices. Life insurers, the leading institutional investors, are still cautious, interest among overseas investors is waning and many analysts believe that public funds remain the only source of buying. While underlying support of the Nikkei around 19,000 is firm, share prices are unlikely to see aggressive buying this week.</p>

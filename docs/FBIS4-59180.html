			<p>BFN     [Text] The Voice of Bosnia started transmission via the  Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the  final minutes of 9 May.    In an interview with our correspondent Pirhade'i about the  reasons for starting the radio program and its effects on the  course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Larijani, the head  of the Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, said:    [Begin Larijani recording] In the name of God, the  compassionate, the merciful. We are very glad that thanks to  the efforts of the overseas department of the Voice and Vision  and those involved in the project, the Bosnian program started,  thank God.    Naturally, in the present world conditions, where in the  heart of Europe there is an innocent nation whose situation is  not understood by any of the superpowers -- you have seen in the  news these days what they have done to the people of Gorazde.  Transmitting the innocent call of those self-sacrificing and  hardworking people was our religious duty. Because of the goal  of the Islamic revolution in broadcasting the message of  Muslims, it was a necessary task. We were able to make  preparations quickly to start the program.    The program is transmitted at 2300 hours Tehran time [1930  GMT] every night, on 9745 kHz, 31 m wave band, which is about  2030 hours their time. We are trying to expand the program. We  hope that we will quickly be able to make preparations to expand  the program.    Of course, a great deal of effort went into the task,  because  they could not speak Persian well and had not received the  necessary training. There were, naturally, problems for us in  terms of translation. However, certain measures have been taken  and I hope that the program will be expanded soon.    Undoubtedly such programs could have very favorable results  in sending useful information to the people of Bosnia,  considering the fact that they are under propaganda pressure,  too. It is a small deed. By expanding the program, we are  trying to transmit the information on time and at an appropriate  volume to them. [end recording]    At the radio's inaugural ceremony, in addition to Voice and  Vision officials, there were a number of officials of the  Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Culture, and Islamic Guidance and  a number of the radio's staff.    The programs of the radio, which will cover the Balkans,  will  include news on Bosnia-Herzegovina, commentary, report,  developments in the world of Islam, and the culture and  literature of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

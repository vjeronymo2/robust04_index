			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Brazil opts to keep its president BRAZILIAN voters yesterday decided overwhelmingly to keep the country's presidential system, according to exit polls. Voting in a binding plebiscite, they also opted to maintain a republican form of government rather than revert to a monarchy. The DataFolha polling service indicated that 58 per cent had favoured a presidential system, against 26 per cent for the parliamentary option; 16 per cent rejected both choices. The republican option secured 71 per cent, according to its exit poll, while only 11 per cent wanted a monarchy. Political leaders who campaigned for a parliamentary system accepted defeat early, partly because polls consistently predicted a big victory for the presidential system. Many opinion leaders said that political reforms had to move ahead even though the system of government would remain the same. They mentioned party reform, the adoption of mixed district elections, campaign finance reform, and changes to increase the number of congressmen in highly-populated states which are under-represented in Congress. Abstention rates were not immediately available, but the lack of queues at polling booths seemed to indicate a low turnout even though voters are required by law to cast ballots. A pre-election poll showed 57 per cent would not vote if not obliged to.</p>

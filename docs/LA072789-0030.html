			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TV'S 'PEOPLE'S COURT' LOSES IN REAL TRIAL  </P> <P> The producers of the television show "People's Court," who have dispensed  justice daily in their televised courtroom for eight years, are tasting the  frustration that can come from being in front of -- rather than behind -- the  judicial bench.  </P> <P> A real Small Claims Court judge has ruled that Ralph Edwards Productions must  pay Louis De George, 62, of Van Nuys, $1,500 -- even though he lost his case  when he appeared on "People's Court" in February.  </P> <P> "Our reaction is the same as some of the reactions of the people who walk out  of our courtroom -- disbelief," said Phillip Vandervort, associate producer of  the show.  </P> <P> De George took "People's Court" to court last week because he felt that he was  misled when he agreed to appear on the show. De George said he was told that  regardless of the ruling by "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner, who presides  over the court-like proceedings, he would receive a $250 appearance fee plus  the $1,500 in damages he was seeking from his landlord.  </P> <P> But the show's policy is to guarantee damage payments only to litigants who win  their cases, Vandervort said. Wapner ruled that De George had insufficient  evidence to prove that his apartment manager's 11-year-old son smashed the  rear-view mirror on De George's pickup truck and regularly played on the  vehicle despite warnings not to.  </P> <P> Five months later, however, De George had sufficient evidence to convince Los  Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Linda Elliott that the show's producers  had misrepresented their payment policy to him.  </P> <P> In court, De George played a taped message left on his answering machine by a  "People's Court" researcher, Richard Velasquez, who regularly scanned small  claims suits filed downtown in search of interesting cases. On the tape,  Velasquez, who no longer works for the show but appeared in court as a witness,  promised "a guaranteed $1,500 as well as $250" if De George appeared on the  show.  </P> <P> "Richard left out the words 'if you win,' " Vandervort said.  </P> <P> Despite four witnesses from Ralph Edwards Productions who said they clearly  explained the policy in subsequent meetings, Elliott ruled that De George was  entitled to the $1,500.  </P> <P> Although she scanned copies of the contracts De George and other litigants sign  before appearing, the judge said they were confusing and did not clarify the  policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plaintiff Elated  </P> <P> "I was elated," said De George, who was notified of his victory by mail  Tuesday. "They are big shots in the movie industry and television industry, so  this was really like David against Goliath."  </P> <P> Vandervort said the show's producers are deciding whether they will appeal.  </P> <P> "People's Court" is not a legal court of law. Although Wapner was an appointed  judge, he is retired and on the program acts only as an arbitrator. When  litigants appear on the program, they sign contracts agreeing not to take their  cases to a real court afterward.  </P> <P> Plaintiffs as well as defendants receive the $250 appearance fee. The producers  pay the damages if the plaintiff wins, freeing the defendants of financial  responsibility.  </P></p>

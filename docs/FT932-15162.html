			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: Brussels discounts French car fears THE European Commission yesterday played down the significance of French concern about the recent EC-Japan deal on exports of Japanese vehicles to the Community during 1993. Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, and Mr Alain Lamassoure, minister for European affairs, have written to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, expressing worries about the deal, which should lead to a 9.4 per cent drop in the number of Japanese cars and vans exported to the EC this year. The Commission has not yet received the letter, but officials said yesterday they believed the concerns were mainly 'technical'. France is one of five EC countries which have had to lift national quotas on Japanese vehicles, as part of a 1991 agreement which should lead to a completely open EC market by the end of the decade. In spite of the overall drop in exports to the EC, Japanese exports to France will actually increase this year from 69,016 to 77,300, as the liberalisation of the French market begins to take effect. The new French government wants to know how the EC estimated demand in the Community for 1993. Japanese and Community officials agreed earlier this month that European demand would fall by 6.5 per cent against 1992, but the French industry estimates that its national market could shrink by as much as 10 per cent. French manufacturers are also concerned about the impact of imports of Japanese cars made in other Community countries. These so-called 'transplants' were taken into account by EC and Japanese negotiators but not included in the agreed figures.</p>

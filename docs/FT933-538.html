			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): Big issues, from guru to guru / Assessing the latest offerings in new media - Management IS THE WORLD economy going through a mere recession or a profound restructuring? What lies ahead for companies and individuals? Large questions such as these have exercised the mind of Peter Drucker, who was the first modern management guru and, in spite of his advancing years, remains the most incisive, original and stimulating management thinker of our time. The difficulty with Drucker's work is that it is dense and demanding: one needs stamina and commitment to carry oneself through even his shorter books. So how to introduce or be introduced to Drucker's seminal insights if one has less stamina and inclination? Warren Bennis is a guru in his own right, and has a personable avuncular manner which enables him to carry off a conversation with Drucker in front of the camera as if it were an everyday event (Facing the Challenge, two videos with trainer's notes, BBC Training Videos, Pounds 395). With video comes variety too - here introduced not merely to provide pace, but tactfully to illustrate and enliven the more cerebral points. And with video comes control: you can stop the recording in mid-flow, if you wish to pause for clarification of precisely what is an Information-Based Organisation or a Knowledge-Worker, or of why change is a particular challenge today. Warren Bennis himself presents Coaching the Team (two videos with trainer's notes, BBC Training Videos, Pounds 345) covering what he believes to be the essential skills of management in the 1990s. These turn out to be Coaching and Team-working; Coaching consisting of Direction, Listening, Observation and Encouraging a Positive Attitude, and Teamworking consisting of Finding Direction, Generating Ideas, Decision Making, Planning, Learning from Experience, Listening, Observation and Encouraging. I remain sceptical about how 'new' the need for these skills is; the great leaders of the past were great coaches and produced great teams, whether one thinks of Alexander or of Jesus. Repackaged for presentation as the concepts of Coaching and Teamworking may be, they remain more common in the world of talk than of reality. Lectures and video packages may not translate talk into reality, but they do help make people aware of the need, and thus contribute at least indirectly to bringing them to birth. In a previous column, I mentioned the far-sighted policy of IMEC Publishing, which issues its reference materials in computer-accessible form as well as in print. Its Directory of Eastern European Management Education (co-published with the European Foundation for Management Development, 40 Rue Washington, B-1050 Brussels; A-4 paperback, 520 pages, BFr 1000) is a pioneering venture, which contains documentation on the educational systems in Eastern European countries, as well as the programmes, profiles and business-related faculty of all universities and business schools. The work is surprisingly comprehensive in the context of a situation as formless, complex and rapidly-changing as any in the world . To make sense of this kind of a world, and to enable your company to survive in it, you need good old leadership. If you think this, you may find your ideas somewhat challenged by The Power of Leadership (two videos, each in a separate pack with a copy of the script as well as a copy of the trainer's notes, Industrial Society, Pounds 500). This started life as a six-part Anglia TV series called Leaders, which took the unusual step of letting an array of putative leaders and experts on the subject speak for themselves without a great deal of editorial shaping or comment, beyond dividing the material into the two broad themes (one per video) of 'What makes a good leader?' and 'Leadership in action'. The result is a fascinating variety of opinion on the subject, some of it contradictory. This makes the videos an excellent discussion-starter on almost any aspect. However, the pack does editorialise to the extent of suggesting a new model of leadership, which goes beyond the now-hackneyed contrast of management and leadership, and includes command-based leadership, team-leadership as well as what it dubs 'Super-Leadership' (focusing on Transformation and Vision-Sharing). This holistic model is quite a useful one for leaders and followers to internalise. After all, the only true definition of leadership is the capacity to create followers. Leadership cannot exist without followership. It follows that if leaders and followers are to be effective, they must be in consonance with each other. Being in tune with each other is more difficult if one is from a different culture, and this is the area explored by Building the Transnational Team (one video with brief trainer's notes, Transnational Management Associates, London &amp; Paris, no price given). Well acted by professional actors, though a shade less well directed, the script explores stereotypically, though wittily, the habits and perceptions of Europeans and Americans in a meeting concerned with solving a simple problem. The resolution of the inter-cultural problems is less persuasive because it is presented with too little preparation - inevitable given the short duration of this video. I wonder what it is that tempts us to want to present a whole issue and the whole solution in 30 or 40 minutes. I make these caveats in spite of my interest in this video, having been invited to comment on the script in draft form. Perhaps video is better for the presentation of issues than for the conveyance of direct instruction. Anyway, there is little material available on transnational management, so this video must be welcome.</p>

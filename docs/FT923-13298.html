			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / No place for bank to call home: The bruising battle over the site for the European central bank The tussle over the site of the European central bank (ECB) centres on the clash of competing national symbols. The bank, which is designed to one day run a single European currency, provides a glittering prize for financial centres jostling to bring money, jobs and prestige to their cities. The ECB is a linchpin of the Maastricht treaty on political and economic union. The weighty national issues at stake ensure that politics rather than economics will determine where the bank eventually finds a home. But, until the wrangling over its venue is settled, highly contentious questions on the central bank's organisation and functioning are being left in abeyance. For some central bankers and economists worrying about how - and, indeed, whether - the ECB will eventually work, the debate over the bank is concentrating too much on public relations, and not enough on practicalities. For the moment, however, the matter is firmly in the hands of the lobbyists. Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord Mayor of London, who heads Britain's bid to bring the bank to the City, leaps from his chair into a corner of his office. He fishes out a plastic-framed 20m Mark banknote printed during Germany's 1923 hyper-inflation, a gift from the Dresdner Bank. This is evidence, says Sir Brian, that the Germans - who want to bring the bank to Frankfurt or Bonn on the basis of their postwar record of monetary stability - have not always been anti-inflation champions. Sir Brian, campaigning on the basis of London's size and prowess as a financial centre, is doing his best to counter a brochure from Frankfurt, recently presented to him by Mr Andreas von Schoeler, the city's mayor. Frankfurt's promotional leaflet, emphasising that Europe's mooted central bank will best prosper in a 'culture' of price stability, points out that the UK has registered a 524 per cent inflation rate during the past 20 years. Germany, by contrast, was top of the EC league table with a mere 113 per cent. Ms Gabrielle Eick, the Frankfurt official in charge of the city's campaign, is keeping up the momentum - even though a majority of EC leaders came out for Bonn by a 10 to two majority at their summit in Lisbon. 'Bonn,' she says scornfully, 'is not a financial centre.' Amsterdam, meanwhile, is also pressing ahead with its own bid. The city knows that its best chance will come from disagreement between Germany, Britain and France. 'Our case is based on the fact that, as a financial centre, we're not a threat to Frankfurt, London or Paris,' says Mr Jan Steinhauser, who is running the city's campaign. An ECB decision is likely at the EC's heads of government summit in Edinburgh in December, which must choose a site for the bank's forerunner, the European Monetary Institute, planned to start in January 1994. Even cities with little chance of winning are not giving up. Edinburgh is sticking to its apparently hopeless quest for at least part of the bank's functions. In an unusual initiative, the Scottish capital is considering going into partnership with other marginal contenders, Barcelona and Lyon, to bid for the whole operation. The ECB would carry out decisions made by a governing council of representatives from national central banks. It would function as a policy-making machine, a collector of banking statistics and as a large operator on financial markets. ised, they would probably be executed in a decentralised way. Existing national central banks would be maintained as operating arms, and some of the bank's central functions (such as banking supervision, computer systems and accounting) could also be split up. For the central bank to succeed in its intention of controlling inflation, location of its head office in a prime banking centre would not be essential. 'With good telecommunications,' says a top official from the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank in Basle, 'it could operate from the top of a mountain.' Backers of London and Frankfurt say, however, that the bank's policy-making touch would be surer if it were based in a city with acknowledged financial expertise. The bank could indeed represent a colossal prize. If all the EC's monetary reserves came under its sway, it would be responsible for foreign exchange holdings of Dollars 300bn. The ECB could start operations by 1999, according to the Maastricht timetable. Plans for monetary union could be heavily disrupted by further problems in ratifying the treaty, as well as by member states' economic difficulties. But, for the moment, most EC leaders assume that the ECB will be a reality by the end of the century. In the political horse-trading, which also involves the sites of about a dozen other EC institutions, Germany has the greatest weight - on account of its economic and political stature. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is arguing strongly for the bank to take root in Germany to help overcome popular German misgivings over giving up the D-Mark. In an accompanying move to win favour from France, Germany could agree to the new European currency being called the 'Eurofranc', according to one idea circulating in the Bonn chancellery. Earlier this year, apparently prompted by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Kohl conceived the idea of proposing Bonn as an alternative to Frankfurt, on the grounds that the small city on the Rhine would be more acceptable to other countries' financial centres. Although it is officially backing Barcelona, Spain is one of Mr Kohl's natural allies in the ECB skirmish. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, deputy governor of the Bank of Spain, said in May that he was 'convinced' that Germany would succeed in attracting the central bank. Britain's own ECB campaign has been intensified since Mr John Major awarded London his personal backing at a Downing Street meeting on May 13. Since then, the Corporation of London, the City's governing body, has been given Treasury help and the support of embassies abroad. However, Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, warned earlier this month that Britain's efforts would almost certainly be in vain. This reflects both the UK's lack of full political commitment to Emu and also, Mr Delors says, the need to provide the Germans with 'assurance' on the bank site as compensation for the D-Mark's demise. For London's Sir Brian Jenkins, however, the game is far from over. Like an obstinate lawyer trying to overturn a solid majority on a recalcitrant jury, London's Lord Mayor is continuing a tour of European capitals to try to persuade governments that putting the bank in London is 'best for Europe'. The Corporation of London still has Pounds 1.2m left of a Pounds 1.5m 'war chest' set up to finance its ECB campaign, while Frankfurt has earmarked DM 700,000. Mr Hans Daniels, the mayor of Bonn, by contrast, has not spent a pfennig on any form of ECB campaign. He says he is 'happy' with the idea that the bank may come to the Rhine - but plainly believes it is much more important that Bonn keeps as many ministries as possible when the German government moves formally to Berlin later in the 1990s. In line with Bonn's low-key posture, the city says the ECB could be built on the site of a recently-demolished Rhineside cement works. The Bank of England, Bundesbank and Nederlandsche Bank have all been helping their respective financial centres in their political campaigning. Top Bundesbank figures have probably been less active publicly than their counterparts at the Bank of England. But the German central bank firmly backs the view that an ECB outside Germany would probably be opposed by the German public. Public attention throughout Europe has concentrated on the sparring over the bank site. Other, highly intractable, problems are, however, bubbling beneath the surface. One focuses on the issue of the ECB's independence. The Bundesbank is dissatisfied with the lack of progress in most countries on making national central banks independent - one of the conditions of the Maastricht treaty. Additionally, European central banks disagree on how the ECB would operate a common European monetary policy. This is one of a series of ECB-related issues on which European central banks are trying to co-ordinate ideas - with little success so far. Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, who has made a study of ECB plans, criticises the lack of clarity on how the ECB would run monetary policy. Excessive debate on the site is an extreme case of 'putting the cart before the horse', he says. EC central bankers have set up three committees and five lower-level working parties to try to make joint suggestions in fields ranging from banking supervision, monetary policy and foreign exchange to statistics, payments systems and banknote printing. In monetary policy, the Bundesbank argues that minimum reserves on bank deposits - levied in West Germany since 1948 - should be introduced throughout the Community to provide harmonised monetary control. The Bundesbank firmly opposes French and British suggestions for holding on to large parts of national monetary practices. The Banque de France and Bank of England argue that this is in line with subsidiarity  - delegating decision-making to as local a level as possible. This argument is stoutly rejected by a top Bundesbank official, who says that the other countries do not want a fully-fledged European central bank, but simply a form of loose 'currency board'. Some EC officials see the US Federal Reserve system as a 'model' for the workings of the ECB. Based on the New York Fed's role as the market arm of the Washington-centred Fed network, Britain backs the view that London could provide the operating arm for a European central bank with its head office, say, in Bonn. As analysts such as Mr Remsperger point out, however, the analogy is faulty. Since European countries linked by Emu will all be operating separate fiscal policies, central banking money market operations  -closely linked to governments' budgetary policies - will have to remain highly decentralised. As the ECB lobbying intensifies in the coming months, such questions may come closer to the headlines. It would not be before time. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, complained last week that wrangling over choosing the ECB site was damaging 'the credibility of the whole Community'. However, the damage would be still greater if the EC agreed on a place to build the bank - but found that there was no consensus on how it should carry out its business.</p>

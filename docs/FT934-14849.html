			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cash call from Austrian rail unit VOEST Alpine Eisenbahn-systeme (VAE), the partially privatised Austrian maker of points (switches) and other specialised railway equipment, is raising about Sch300m (Dollars 27m) in a one-for-six rights issue. The funds would be used to help finance the group's expansion plans at factories in the US, Canada and probably China. Its capital budget for this year is Sch190m and for the 1994-96 period Sch540m. The group's controlling shareholder, the state industrial holding company Austrian Industries (AI), is not taking up its rights and is selling 248,000 of its existing shares to reduce its stake from 51 per cent to a blocking 26 per cent. VAE, which has been expanding rapidly in world markets for high-speed and heavy-duty railway installations, was floated last November on the Vienna Borse when AI sold 49 per cent of its holding at Sch915 a share. The price of the rights shares will be fixed on November 18 and the group said it would be 'close to the market price', which was Sch1,495 yesterday. The new Sch100 nominal shares will qualify for the dividend for 1993, which the company has agreed to raise to 32 per cent from 18 per cent. The rights issue is being underwritten and the placement managed by Bank Austria Investment Bank and SG Warburg. VAE said it expected its net income to rise 6.3 per cent to Sch94m this year. Austria Mikro-Systeme (AMS), a specialised semiconductor maker which was floated off from Austrian Industries earlier this year, reported pre-tax profit of Sch20m in the first half, 43 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992.</p>

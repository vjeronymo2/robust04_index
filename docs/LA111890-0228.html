			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CORONADO WINS FOURTH WATER POLO TITLE IN ROW  </P> <P> The Coronado water polo team wasn't quite sure if its coach, Randy Burgess,  would make it in time to see the Islanders play Poway for the 3-A Section title  Saturday.  </P> <P> As it turned out, it didn't matter.  </P> <P> Coronado (28-4) claimed its fourth consecutive Section title by defeating  Poway, 14-9, at the Jewish Community Center. And Burgess, who did arrive 30  minutes before the game, praised his team's play even though the Islanders had  to play catchup a couple of times.  </P> <P> "They played us tough, but I felt our kids weren't really focused on the game,"  Burgess said.  </P> <P> After a 3-3 first-quarter tie, Poway forced Coronado to play catchup in the  second quarter. At halftime, the score was again tied, 5-5.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, Poway (23-1) took an 8-6 lead. But with three minutes  remaining in the quarter, Coronado went on a scoring spree and led, 10-8,  entering the fourth.  </P> <P> "After it was 8-6 I thought we were in control of the game," Poway Coach Greg  Ormsby said. "They just went on a rampage. They're a very balanced field and  (they have) the best qoalie in the county (Jack Bowen)."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Valhalla defeated USDHS, 17-10, to win the 2-A  championship.  </P> <P> In the 2-A game, USDHS tried, but couldn't stop Mike Nalu, who scored nine  goals for Valhalla. Eric Nielsen added four for the Norsemen. USDHS was led by  Doug Munz, who scored six goals.  </P> <P> "We wanted to try to have two people on Mike when he gets the ball," USDHS  Coach Dan Crane said. "He's so quick that he turns and make things happen."  </P></p>

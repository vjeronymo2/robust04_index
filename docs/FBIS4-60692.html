			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- AL-AKHBAR stresses that  Israel's kidnapping a Lebanese resistance leader from his home  in a south Lebanese village and transferring him to Israel under  the pretext of obtaining information about an Israeli navigator  whose plane was shot down over Lebanon eight years ago is an act  that no country that respects itself and its reputation would  commit. It is a crime of piracy, something we thought Yitzhaq  Rabin's government had abandoned.    The paper says in its editorial of tomorrow, Friday, that  such acts will apparently remain part of Israel's policy as long  as the remnants of the old generation of state leaders, or the  old guard, remain in power. We cannot see any country raiding  the territory of another sovereign state for any reason, the  paper says.    AL-AKHBAR asks whether the United Nations and the Security  Council would have [words indistinct] if such an act, which  flagrantly violates every law and convention, had been committed  by a state other than Israel.    The paper hopes Rabin will think again and ask himself if  the  kidnapping of a Lebanese citizen, no matter what the charge,  merits endangering the peace process, which had begun to bear  fruit.</p>

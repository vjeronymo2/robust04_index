BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UAL STOCK SOARS OVER $7 A SHARE  </P> <P> UAL Corp.'s stock soared more than $7 a share this morning on speculation that  the parent of United Airlines may become a takeover target.  </P> <P> The buying surge apparently was prompted by a report in USA Today that an  investment group headed by Texas billionaire Robert Bass has acquired 2.5% to  3% of UAL's stock.  </P> <P> Susan Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Bass, declined comment on the report. UAL  spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company will not comment on the stock activity.  </P> <P> At noon on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock was trading at $146.50 a  share, up $7.25 from Monday's close. The jump followed gains of $1.75 on Monday  and $15.50 last week.  </P></p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): New dial-in services - Big potential for 'smart phone' systems AS BANKS downsize their operations, they are turning to the telephone as a way to provide a personal service without the overheads of a branch office. On the surface, the telephone offers banks a means of providing more customer services at relatively low cost. The technology is already in place in people's homes, and all the bank has to do is develop the application. And from the customer's viewpoint, it offers the convenience of dialling in from home, at any time of day or night. Customers can do basic banking functions just using the telephone keypad: by tapping in a password and identity number, they can get access to several banking services, including bill payment, money transfers and account balances. Telephone banking today takes advantage of a technology known as computer integrated telephony. One of the latest system is the Call Centre provided by US manufacturer, Aspect Telecommunications. When a call comes in, the Call Centre links to the bank's mainframe computer where account information is stored. It checks the computer for the information requested by the customer. The data bits are then converted to synthesised speech in order to give the customer the answer. The Royal Bank of Scotland is using the Call Centre in a trail service now operating in three regions - Brighton, Preston and Dundee. It claims to have 10,000 customers signed up since the launch in February this year. Take-up rates Nigel Walsh, marketing director of electronic banking specialist, The Software Partnership, claims that such high take-up rates are unusual. With the exception of the Action Line service from Natwest Bank, which has 935,000 customers, few have developed to their full potential - 'most systems in the UK have only attracted small numbers of customers, because they were developed as trials only and were not promoted by the marketing departments.' There are technical reasons why this is so - 'in order to provide a telephone banking service, the bank must do online processing in real time. If there are large numbers of people accessing the system, that would generate large numbers of transactions, and would require a lot of computing power. The bank has to provide that at a high cost for no direct return, unless the move is part of a wider strategy,' says Mr Walsh. But he also points out that today's technology is restricted to a small number of functions: ordering statements, paying bills, obtaining an account balance. This is due to the limitations of the voice processing technology. Services are presented to customers by means of an automated voice, which asks them to press a number on the keypad relating to the service they want: a long list of choices would baffle most customers. However, the next generation of telephone banking systems will use a new technology known as a smart phone. The smart phone looks like a phone with a screen, but has a computer processor chip inside it. The phone can therefore operate in the same way as a personal computer: information can be uploaded, stored and downloaded, and the phone can even send faxes. Smart phone products have been developed by the Dutch electronics company Philips and by the Huntingdon Bank in the US. Another manufacturer known to have product on the way is Canada's Northern Telecom. It is working closely with software company Microsoft, which is keen to adapt its Windows graphic user interface for telephony products. The Huntingdon Bank phone, known as the SmarTel, was originally developed jointly with US telephone company AT&amp;T, although AT&amp;T dropped out of the project earlier this year. Based on an Intel-compatible 386 chip, it has a 4 x 6 ins. side-lit LCD touch-screen display. The touch screen is used to manage all of the telephone transactions, using either icons or text displays to provide a user-friendly interface. The firmware inside the phone uses object oriented programming techniques to take the user logically through the transaction. The Philips product, called the Screen Phone has a small pop-up screen and pull out key board. Inside is an NEC25 processor chip, compatible with the Intel x86 family. This is less powerful than the 386 in the SmarTel, but Philips is working on a 386-based design which will be ready in 1995. It will also replace the key-board with a touch screen. The on-screen menus on the smart phone will permit telephone banking customers to to work through a range of services, which are limited only by the imagination of the bank's marketing department - 'they will have hundreds of menu screens to choose from,' says William Randle, director of marketing and strategic planning at Huntingdon Bank. Furthermore, the flexibility of the screen presentation will enable customers to do much more than they can using today's voice response systems. For example, they could view an entire statement and scroll through it. The Screen Phone will be marketed by Philips Home Services, a US subsidiary of the Dutch company set up specifically for the project. The phone has been on trial with the Post Bank in Holland, and with Citicorp in the US. Citicorp is developing a range of services based on the product; the phone is already on sale in US retail outlets for Dollars 639. Philips quotes a UK retail price of Pounds 350, although the phone is still pending BABT approvals. The SmarTel, retailing at around Dollars 400, is being marketed directly by the Huntingdon Bank to its customer base. One of the services offered is a flexible form of bill payment, which lets customers make payments to anyone, without needing to specify the payee's details in advance. The bank will either pay electronically into the recipient's account, or it can print out a cheque, depending on the instructions entered into the phone by the customer. 'Today, 35 per cent of bills are typically paid electronically. We expect that in four to five years from now, that number will rise to 70 per cent,' says William Randle.</p>

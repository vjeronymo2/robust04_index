			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US tariff deal revives Mexican sugar hopes - An effective common market should give a tremendous boost MEXICO AND the US have agreed to form an effective common market in the sugar sector, which should be a tremendous boost to Mexico's ailing sugar sector but worrying news for present exporters to the US. The as yet undisclosed policy change forms part of the completed text of the North American Free trade Agreement, which negotiators have concluded but still has to be approved by the US congress. The US has agreed to allow Mexico unlimited access to its sugar market after 15 years; Mexico in return has promised to set the same tariff on sugar imports as the US by the sixth year. While Mexico has made no explicit commitment to co-ordinate its tariff-free quotas of sugar imports with the US, the spirit of the agreement is that sugar producers in Mexico will face same prices as in the US. Mexico will manage quotas to ensure this happens smoothly, says one official involved in the negotiations. The only debate in Mexico is whether prices should be encouraged to converge in the first or sixth year. In the US raw sugar sells for 21 to 22 cents a lb, compared with 17 to 18 cents in Mexico. Under the terms of Nafta Mexico is promised its current quota of 7,258 tonnes in the first six years, or 25,000 tonnes if it is a net exporter in two successive years. In the seventh year the quota is increased to 150,000 tonnes, to increase by 10 per cent annually until the 15th year, when all controls are to be eliminated. If Mexico is a net exporter for two successive years after the seventh year, the quota is removed. The tariff quota of 16 cents a lb is reduced by 15 per cent over the first six years, and then to zero over the next nine. Mr Julio Escandon of the consultancy Eximco, who represented the Mexican sugar private sector in the negotiations, says that by raising domestic sugar prices, Nafta will encourage Mexico to become a net sugar exporter once again. Next year he expects sugar production to be 3.7m tonnes, compared with consumption in 1992 of 4.2m tonnes. But, he says, with US prices, Mexico could be producing 4.5m tonnes a year within three years. The relatively liberal - sugar producers say anarchic - import policy of the Mexican government explains part, although not all, of the dire situation of the sugar producers and the recent decline in production. The Mexican government and sugar traders imported about 2.6m tonnes in 1990 and 1991, while the domestic sugar deficit was just 1.2m tonnes over the same period. Mr Jose Pinto, who manages four sugar mills, shares Mr Escandon's optimism, describing Nafta as 'an opportunity for Mexico to be a large producer of sugar in the medium term, if domestic sugar policy is correct.' Higher sugar prices will let Mexico's sugar mill owners earn profits to invest in upgrading technology, and encourage farmers to turn land over to sugar cane production. The stability and security offered by Nafta will encourage long-term investment hitherto put off by uncertainty and the gyrations of government policy over past years. Mexico relies exclusively on sugar-cane rather than sugar beet, has a perfect tropical climate in parts and wages about a tenth of those in the US  -all of which makes it a much more efficient producer of sugar than its highly protected northern neighbour. In ten years Mr Pinto reckons Mexico's production could be 6m tonnes. Mexico was a net sugar exporter from 1954 to 1975, and from 1985 to 1988. But in 1989 the government began to privatise the sugar mills, almost all of which it owned, and simultaneously to dismantle the protection offered to the heavily-undercapitalised industry. On top of that, two corrupt officials in the government sugar agency imported massive amounts of sugar and, by fiddling the invoices, walked off with a small fortune. A warrant has been issued for their arrest but they are still at large. The result has been huge losses among sugar mill owners - one reason why the Mexican government was so quick to embrace the protectionist terms of the Nafta text on sugar. If the industry recovers to become a net exporter the first to suffer will be other countries that export to the US. At present the US imports about 1.5m tonnes of its sugar, but were Mexico to fill this gap the quota offered to other countries would have to fall. For political reasons the US would probably spare the Caribbean from cuts, but more distant producers might lose out. In the longer term, US sugar producers could also suffer. If Mexico becomes a net exporter sugar prices in the US are likely to fall as North American production outstrips demand. In this case the marginal producers in the North American market, that is the inefficient US mills, would have to close.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Malaysia futures trading due soon A financial futures market trading three-month interbank interest rates could start in Malaysia as early as September, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. 'We're working toward a September target,' said the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange. However, the Securities Commission, which will regulate the new market said: 'It all depends on when the regulatory requirement for a single clearing house is in place.' The commission urged the Kuala Lumpur Futures Market (KLFM) and rival Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Kloffe) 'to work harder at bringing about a single clearing house facility'. KLFM, run by the commodity exchange, will initially trade in the three-month Kuala Lumpur interbank offered rate (Klibor). Kloffe, which is not expected to begin operations until late next year, will trade in stock index futures. KLFM officials said it is possible they could set up a clearing house which Kloffe could join later.</p>

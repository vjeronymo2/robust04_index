Yeltsin's edict, Kabardino-Balkaria's President V. Kokov has  issued his own edict envisaging the restoration of the  Elbrusskiy and Cherekskiy Rayons in the republic's foothills  that existed prior to 1944 -- rayons with a predominantly Balkar  population.    This edict orders the formation of a Chamber of  Nationalities  within the republic's current parliament in which the republic's  three main peoples -- Kabards, Russians, and Balkars -- would  have equal representation. The edict was read out during a  sorrowful meeting of the republic's public to mark the 50th  anniversary of the deportation of the Balkar people. It was  also decided henceforth to celebrate 28 March as the day of the  Balkar people's return home. It has been declared a day off in  the republic. Experts think that these measures will stimulate  the economic, social, and cultural development of Balkaria's  population centers.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Arts: Dangerous Corner - Theatre JB Priestley was born a hundred years ago this year, and the West End run of last year's National Theatre production of An Inspector Calls continues. You would think that these two facts would prompt a slew of other Priestley revivals. But no. Chichester, which has just revived his first play, the seldom-seen thriller Dangerous Corner, is almost alone in honouring JBP. Strange. The fun of watching Dangerous Corner for the first time is its suspense. About once every five minutes, Priestley springs another brilliant surprise on you. 1: Who went to see Martin the night he committed suicide? 2: Who else went to see him that night? 3: Was it really Martin who stole the firm's money? 4: Who was in love with Martin? 5: Who else was in love with Martin? 6: Who actually shot Martin? 6: Why was Martin shot? 7: Who was taking drugs at the time? 8: Who knew who killed Martin? 9: What did the killer see after shooting Martin? And there are a few other twists, most of which reveal who else around the room has actually always been in love with whom. Then the two big twists at the end. Not a dull moment. This production is, for Chichester, a sequel to last year's staging of Patrick Hamilton's Rope. Priestley was one of the earliest admirers of the original Rope; last year's Rope (which recently had a short-lived West End transfer) and this year's Dangerous Corner share the same director, Keith Baxter. The pacing is good, and the period style tolerable. The first half-hour has considerably too much restless musical-chairs moving around the stage - I missed one of Freda's main revelations because I got distracted by the posey glide she was making across the room - and a photograph in the programme shows you that the 1938 production created a more authentically lived-in drawing-room than Simon Higlett's model interior-design set. Freda (hostess to the evening's dinner-party, wife to Robert, and sister-in-law to the late Martin) is Gayle Hunnicutt, every aspect of whose glamour and deportment is so synthetic that it is hard to believe in her, though this leads to a good moment when her poised facade cracks and she sobs for the first time. Peter McEnery is Robert - slightly underpowered but expertly focused. Emily Raymond, as the level-headed and well-mannered Olwyn, gives a much more arresting performance than she did across the road in The Rivals. Charles Stanton (one of Robert's co-directors in the firm and in love with *****) is played, perhaps too affably but with just the right assurance, by Christopher Timothy. Betty, a young wife who turns out to be that bit more experienced than we knew, is played, well, by Biddy Hodson. Her husband Gordon (Freda's brother and a co-director in the firm) is Tristan Gemmill, who gives the evening's finest performance, with a good flair for both period elegance and neurotic disturbance. Oh yes - and Jean Boht contributes a little cameo performance as the drawling Miss Mockridge, which she delivers with enough panache to make you surprised that her role turns out to be the smallest. In repertory at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, until August 6.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> In a recent filing with the state of New York's highest court, 12 skippers and  yachting clubs are asking for the overturning of a court ruling that allowed  the San Diego Yacht Club to recover the 1988 America's Cup from New Zealand.  </P> <P> The group claims that if San Diego is allowed to keep the cup, it will "reduce  the America's Cup to a piece of memorabilia and spell an end to a legendary  competition that has endured for well over a century."  </P> <P> Among the skippers supporting New Zealand are John Bertrand, of Australia II,  which won the trophy in 1983.  </P></p>

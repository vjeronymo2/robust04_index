			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The five-year price chart for Betterware is a technical analyst's dream. Having risen strongly and steadily through 1991/92, shares levelled off and went sideways until August this year, since when they have collapsed dramatically. The period of underperformance came not long after the Cohen family sold 13.3m shares at 230p, having previously indicated it was unlikely to reduce its stake. This factor, and the fact that UK growth clearly is slowing, gave the bears an ideal opportunity to hit the price. At the beginning of November, managing director Andrew Cohen bought 400,000 shares from fellow director John Lloyd at 196p, but this did little to stem the flow. The recent purchases were made by three directors, including the chairman and finance director, at 142p. Between them, the Cohens retain more than 45m shares. Regular readers will recognise the name of Richard Peskin, chairman and managing director of Great Portland Estates, one of the UK's larger property companies. He has been a consistent and regular supporter of his shares. His first purchase dates back to August last year: just 104p for 115,000. Since then the price has recovered strongly, and Peskin is now selling 750,000 at 225p. Although he retains 2.1m, there is little doubt that the move to take profits in the property sector is gathering pace. Nor is it particularly surprising to see profits being taken at SG Warburg Group: chairman Sir David Scholey has sold 112,000 shares at 884p. The price has more than doubled since September last year on the back of strongly rising equity markets, not just in the UK but internationally. Brokers have been raising forecasts for Warburg and many of its peers in the merchant bank sector, and expectations are running high.

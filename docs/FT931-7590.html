			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: LDP has new plan to boost economy THE ruling Liberal Democratic party, working closely with Japan's most powerful economic bureaucrats has drawn up a timetable for further measures to stimulate the economy, once the budget for 1993 is passed, according to senior officials familiar with the plans. The measures are largely the result of intensive talks behind the scenes over the past few weeks between Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the head of an LDP economic task force, Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the powerful vice-minister at the finance ministry and Mr Eisuke Hamamoto, director general of the ministry's tax bureau. The finance ministry officials have swung Mr Mitsuzuka away from an early cut in income taxes by suggesting that tax cuts targeted at capital investment and housing would be more effective. The powerful economic bureaucracy and the political leadership of prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa agree the next few months will be critical, either laying the foundations for moderate economic recovery later in the year or confirming pessimistic forecasts of a prolonged period of slow growth. The lower house of parliament will pass the mildly expansionary budget for 1993 early next month. Tokyo is then expected to announce that all public works spending will be brought forward from the second half into the first half of the year to maintain the strong growth in public investment, rising by an annual rate of about 11 per cent. There is expected to be a five stage timetable for fresh measures to stimulate the economy, most of which parliament could pass before its current session ends on June 20. This would allow Japan to present the entire stimulus package to the Group of Seven Tokyo summit scheduled for early July. The LDP will propose tax cuts for investment and housing. It may also propose relaxing the rules governing public borrowing to allow public bodies to buy computers and other electronic goods. A decision on whether to cut income taxes will be delayed until April and May to allow time to see whether the economy is recovering or whether it needs further stimulus. The finance ministry and the Bank of Japan want to avoid repeating past mistakes such as in early 1987 when overstimulation started the inflation which led to the bubble economy of the late 1980s. A further interest rate cut later in the year has not been ruled out. The Bank of Japan, which recently cut its official discount rate to an all time low of 2.5 per cent has refrained from suggesting that this will be the last cut. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor yesterday emphasised that interest rate policy would be guided by the state of the real economy. 'We have to focus upon the real economy. If necessary we have to resolve to cut interest rates.'</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S PAST TIME FOR A RAISE  </P> <P> Congressional Democrats will try again to give the nation's lowest-paid workers  a raise, their first in nearly nine years. Increasing the federal minimum wage  beyond the current $3.35-an-hour has proven a difficult task because of strong  opposition from business interests and a majority of Republicans. Democrats  have accepted the fact that the only chance of getting an increase in the rate  is a compromise that President Bush can live with. They are putting one  together.  </P> <P> The President in June vetoed legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy  (D-Mass.) and Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-L.A.) that would have raised the  hourly rate to $4.55 over three years. He argued that the increase was  excessive and inflationary and would cost thousands ofjobs. Bush, who during  the 1988 campaign promised to raise the minimum wage, indicated he was willing  to approve a more modest boost, to $4.25 an hour, but only if the legislation  includeda lower sub-minimum training wage for new workers.  </P> <P> Compromise legislation, introduced by Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), would  raise the minimum wage to $4.25 as Bush has insisted upon. The increase -- only  90 cents an hour -- would bespread over two rather than three years. The  sub-minimum would last for 60 days. At thispoint, it offers the best chance for  the working poor.  </P> <P> The modest raise would boost a weekly salary based on the federal minimum wage  from $134 to $170. That's not much, and it won't make up for the losses in  buying power due to inflation over the years. But a small raise is better than  none.  </P> <P> An estimated 5.4 million Americans earn the minimum wage. Their ranks include  many teen-agers and new workers, but at least half are older than 25, and many  are working parents who could bring more money into the house with a welfare  check. For a parent with two children, welfare and related benefits are worth  more than a pay check based on the federal minimum wage in 23 states, according  to Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute. Yet thousands of  poor Americans choose to work for less. They deserve more.  </P> <P> President Bush can encourage Americans who are willing to work. He can help  working mothers who are trying to help themselves. He can help working fathers  who are taking responsibility for their families. A compromise on the minimum  wage is the best hope of achieving those goals.  </P></p>

The statement says:    According to reports, Japan will soon ignite monju, its  first  fast breeder reactor. This is an undisguised attempt of Japan  to secure quantities of plutonium by itself and produce nuclear  weapons any moment.    The annual capacity of the reprocessing plant of Japan is  800  tons, the biggest in the world. When it goes into full  operation by the end of the present century, Japan will rank  third in the world in reprocessing capacity after the United  States and France.    Even according to data released by the Japan science and  technology agency, it has already stockpiled 1.6 tons of  plutonium at home and 2.9 tons abroad and will possess 50 tons  of plutonium at all times by 2010, an amount enough to make more  than 6,200 nuclear bombs.    Japan has already developed not only electronic detonating  device and other elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs  and their technologies but also long-range means of nuclear  delivery that can be used as intercontinental ballistic missiles.    Facts tell that Japan's nuclear armament now has reached a  dangerous phase.    In view of the tense situation in which Japan's nuclear  armament is being stepped up around the Korean peninsula in real  earnest, we cannot but follow such developments with vigilance.    Japan's stepped-up nuclear armament means creating an  obstacle to the process of denuclearization on the Korean  peninsula.    Denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized if peace  and security free from nuclear weapons are to be guaranteed  substantially in this region including the Korean peninsula. To  this end, not only Asia but the rest of the world should pay due  attention to Japan which is capable of possessing nuclear  weapons and moving in that direction.    Denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to a total  elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.</p>

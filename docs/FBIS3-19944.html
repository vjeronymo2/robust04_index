The number of  Turkish entrepreneurs investing in Romania has recently been  increasing and currently stands at 2,500. During our visit, we  will also inaugurate a Turkish-Romanian bank. I would also like  to announce that the number of mutual tourist visits between the  two countries has exceeded 1 million in recent years.    Moreover, the existing problems and new developments in the  Balkans as well as in the Caucasus and the Middle East make it  imperative for Turkey and Romania, two important countries of  the region, to hold more frequent contacts at every level. The  restructuring of Europe also makes these contacts necessary.  [end recording]    Demirel explained that ways to developing relations with  regard to bilateral and international issues will be discussed  during the visit. The president added that the possible  contributions by Turkey and Romania to peace, stability, and  cooperation in the region will also be reviewed.    Demirel was seen off at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by  Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly. General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, and  other officials were also present. Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin also left for Romania together with the president.</p>

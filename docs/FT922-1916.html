			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Irish mist descends over Maastricht: The pro-treaty campaign created some suspicion and irritation IF Ireland's voters turn out to have endorsed the Maastricht treaty in yesterday's referendum, it will have been without enthusiasm. It would also have been largely in spite of a pro-treaty campaign by the country's political establishment which created suspicion and deep irritation. Many people are plainly angry at being patronised by what they see as a 'we-know-best' elite which has done well out of Europe and hopes to do even better. Until shocked out of its complacency by Danish voters' rejection of Maastricht, the coalition led by Mr Albert Reynolds had not deigned to explain or promote the treaty. The government hijacked the airwaves, keeping its opponents off television, annoying both the Yes and No camps in its obviously rattled attempts to ram through ratification. The country's leading paper, The Irish Times, in a strongly argued leader on Tuesday in favour of a Yes vote, was lapidary in its judgment of the government's campaign. The government almost certainly erred tactically by overemphasising the expected cash bonanza of IPounds 6bn (Pounds 5.5bn) from the EC's boosted 'cohesion' and regional aid effort for poorer member states - money which is in question because of resistance by net contributors to the EC budget to pay it. The referendum result, in consequence, yesterday looked as though it would be very close. A straw poll by the FT of a hundred or so people in a cross-section of Dublin and in County Wicklow showed a 51-49 margin against the treaty, with a further 18 voters claiming still to be undecided. There were doubts about whether the fabled cohesion money would arrive, and if so, whether this meant jobs. There was concern on both sides of the abortion debate, and about the extent to which Maastricht's aspiration to a future common defence dimension for Europe compromised Irish neutrality. 'I think they're keeping us in the dark about neutrality,' said Fiona Murphy, a waitress. And despite Mr Reynolds' pledge of a new referendum in 1996 if the EC assumes joint defence commitments then, she was voting no. Ireland has done well out of the EC. At one level, it gets IPounds 6 back for each pound it puts into the Community budget. But more fundamentally, it has nearly doubled its tradeable goods sector (from 31 to 51 per cent of GDP) since entry. Europe has opened up markets and allowed this small, peripheral nation to dilute dependence on the UK for the first time in its modern history. But neither Mr Reynolds' party, Fianna Fail, nor the three other main parties supporting the treaty, have been able to activate their powerful machines and appear to have little accurate information on door-step thinking. 'Nobody except the civil service elite is interested in or in favour of Maastricht,' admits one senior Irish Eurocrat, explaining the parties' failure to canvass. Yet this probably sells ordinary Irish voters short. Their ire is not primarily caused by Maastricht, nor do they appear Euro-sceptical. Mr Christy Byrne, a small dairy farmer in the Wicklow mountains south of Dublin, was voting yes while complaining 'there's nothing in this for small farmers.' Yet he felt that Ireland couldn't afford to be without Europe and that if the government were 'more honest' the Yes vote would sweep it. Anger is variously directed at politicians perceived as shifty, and the crozier power of the the church. Under the previous government, these two estates combined to toss the red herring of abortion into the treaty, as a protocol guaranteeing that no EC law would interfere with Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. The government subsequently tried to disentangle the two issues, by agreeing to a separate and later referendum on the rights to information on abortion, and to travel for pregnancy termination. What began as a cynical attempt to get the church on side has ended by ranging anti-abortionists and pro-choice groups against the treaty, leaving very little middle ground for Irish women, whose vote could decide Maastricht's future. Mrs Helen Kelly, a heavily pregnant resident of Glendalough in Wicklow, was undecided on Maastricht. She was cynical about the government, and hostile to the anti-abortion campaign, as 'just a way of trying to package the no vote to throw it (the treaty) over.' Her husband, Tom, a small road haulier struggling through the economic downturn, was voting yes. 'I'd say go with Europe, what choice have we?' In affluent Dublin areas like Donnybrook, Maastricht is not in doubt, yet in mixed class areas of north Dublin like Drumcondra the vote yesterday was nearly 2-1 against the treaty. The gulf was equally visible in Bray, 12 miles south in Wicklow, now easily accessible thanks to a new by-pass part-financed by the EC regional fund. Yet in one hostelry where local working men had gathered to watch the football televised on Wednesday night, Maastricht could not muster a single indigenous vote. 'No, no and no,' said Liam, 'That stuff's for yuppies. There's nothing in it for Joe Soaps and the workers like me.' Irish and EC leaders have tended to take such people for granted. The future of the Maastricht treaty hung on there being just enough voters to outweigh them, even if many were saying yes out of fear of isolation from Europe rather than enthusiasm for a cause no one has bothered to kindle.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Coriolanus thrills Salzburg THE NEW regime at the Salzburg Festival, which took over at the start of the decade, initiated changes affecting the style, presentation and - most important - content of the operatic and musical offerings that are as yet by no means absorbed all through. Bad-mouthing of the new administration flourishes, intrigues simmer, the old guard continue to pray for the miracle that will remove Gerard Mortier and resurrect Herbert von Karajan (or at the very least a Karajan epigone). On the other hand, Mortier's revitalisation of the festival's dramatic component (importantly experimental under Max Reinhardt in the 1920s and '30s, increasingly marginalised since) is already a fait accompli, and one which is bearing rich fruit - in the Guardian the other day Michael Billington proclaimed Salzburg as 'now Europe's major theatre festival'. Peter Stein, drama overseer, set the tone with his Julius Caesar production (new last year, revived this coming week) that simultaneously launched a year-by-year examination of Shakespeare's Roman dramas and reclaimed the Rocky Riding School as the most inspiring of theatrical spaces. He has also found place for worthwhile new plays (this year Botho Strauss's Equilibrium, widely acclaimed) and boldly risk-taking ventures (this year Peter Sellars staging of Aeschylus's The Persians on the Perninsel near Hallein). There is a buzz to the schedule of readings and related events - and, indeed, a buzz to the whole theatre programme that contrasts sharply with the still-to-be-clinched air of the musical. As my business was primarily the latter, I could judge the former mainly from the sidelines; but my single venture into drama-critics' territory, with the new Coriolanus, afforded so thrillingly large-scaled an experience as almost to confirm in itself everything that is being said about theatrical re-birth in the new Salzburg order. Deborah Warner, making her European debut, takes to the spaces of the Rocky Riding School - with its vast, rough-hewn stage, colonnaded back wall and sliding roof that can opened to the skies, all carved out of the Monchberg - as though it were her native habitat. This is a cast-of-hundreds Coriolanus, and its structure of entrances, exits and formations is founded with spectacular virtuosity. Mighty phalanxes of Romans and Volscians do battle, march, assemble and at particularly stirring moments race along the heights with flaming torches. The pit, where on my last visit James Levine and the Vienna Phil were quartered for Die Zauberflote, plays home for a while to live horses before they canter out to battle at Corioli. The sheer physicality of this Coriolanus is at once exuberant, startling and disciplined. It always is in a Warner show, whether it be her Elektra at the Riverside, Wozzeck for Opera North or now this brilliant imagining of a harsh, violence-riven landscape (given added poetic harshness by the rusty-red textures of Hildegard Bechtler's screen-additions) against which this most complete of Shakespearean analyses of the nature of human society and government can be fleshed out. The physical force of the production - wrested from the play out of Warner's twinned response to the text and the chosen auditorium, lacking every element of spurious show - is matched by the lean style of acting, which can yet find place for the remarkable, memorable gesture. Bruno Ganz in the title role is its exemplar and focal point: middle-aged, sparing of movement, his voice capable of terrifying low chill, he can spit out the Tieck translation (updated by Stein) with a vocal scything of the air matched by a climactic command of the entire stage. I was constantly electrified by the force of his presence. But the astonishing feature of this Coriolanus is, indeed, the combination of intimacy and sudden grandeur of all the acting (more astonishing for the fact that the director speaks no German). Whether it be the gloriously rounded Menenius of Hans Michael Rehberg, full of lovable eccentricity covering a deep, pained humanity, or the darkly fiery Aufidius of Daniel Friedrich (who, in a moment of horrifying verismo, throws up in the midst of his defeat-enraged first-act furies), the ensemble shows itself to possess a unified impulse in countless ways. Maria Wimmer's Volumnia, in her mid-80s, suggests, in a brief, arresting moment of caress, that the bond with her son, in his mid-50s, remains troubled, close-knit and deep. The disciplined vastness of the production gives all opposing sides opinions their due: the experience becomes correspondingly more complex, searing, universal. Without a doubt this tremendous Coriolanus was the high point of my five-day stint. Final performance at the Salzburg Felsenreitschule tonight</p>

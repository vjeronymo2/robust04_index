			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Singapore group nears Malayan Credit takeover CYCLE and Carriage (CCL), the diversified Singapore-based vehicle group, is nearing victory in its month-long battle to take over Malayan Credit, the family-run property concern, Reuter reports from Singapore. CCL, which is making the takeover bid in partnership with Hotel Properties, said it had bought an additional 6.1m shares of Malayan. The partners now own 48.88 per cent of Malayan Credit's total shares. CCL offered a price of SDollars 2.25 a share when the bid opened on April 10. CCL, a leading car distributor diversifying into property and food businesses, said last month its takeover offer was conditional on it and Hotel Properties acquiring a combined stake of more than 50 per cent. With a 50 per cent stake, CCL could wrest control of the property group from Singapore's Teo family, which owns about 24 per cent of Malayan. Malayan's land bank in Malaysia and its prime office and residential properties in Singapore and Malaysia are expected to blend well with CCL's property portfolio in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / China and Tajikistan form diplomatic ties CHINA and Tajikistan yesterday established formal diplomatic links as Beijing continued to form ties with the successor-states to the Soviet Union, especially those on its sensitive border, Reuter reports from Beijing. The New China News Agency reported that a joint communique was signed in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital, to establish relations at ambassadorial level. Tajikistan is one of three republics bordering China's Moslem-minority region of Xinjiang in the north-west. Beijing still has to establish ties with Kirgizia in order to have relations with all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on its immediate border. China and Russia set up ties at ambassadorial level on December 27. Beijing subsequently set up full ties with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine. China has recognised all republics of the commonwealth, and Georgia, which has not yet joined the CIS, but has said it will negotiate full ties with each individually.</p>

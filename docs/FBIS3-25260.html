			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Freedom Alliance Non-Participation In Elections  Viewed--"After this week's deadlock in the negotiations between  the ANC [African National Congress], the government, and the  Freedom Alliance (FA), all indications are that important  players like Inkatha and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National  Front] (AVF) will not join the transitional process or take part  in the April 27 election," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES  in English on 13 February in a page-6 commentary. While  conceeding that the alliance partners might be simply  excercising "their democratic right," there is still reason for  concern. The "FA cannot be allowed to pursue narrow political  gains at the expense of the lives of millions of our people,"  what Inkatha leader Buthelezi calls "politics of resistance."  All the alliance partners together, "never said a word when it  was absolutely necessary .... today when people are about to  taste their freedom, they make noises about a civil war."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Only Path for Right Wing is Negotiation -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 8 February says in a page-8 editorial that  "as Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said at the  weekend, there are indeed many shortcomings in the right-wing's  plan to unilaterally demarcate a right-wing homeland." "The  major shortcoming, which he does not mention, is that the right  wing has no territory which it can claim as its own, where they  form the majority of the population." "There simply is no such  region. And that is also the major shortcoming in their other  alternative, which is to fight for the homeland. There is no  homeland to fight for; no territory to defend; no invaders to  repel; no identifiable enemy to shoot dead. Up to now the  fighting has consisted mainly of blowing up power pylons and  railway lines..." "In the final analysis the only way forward  for the right wing remains negotiation, which means give and  take."    Mandela's Tirades Against De Klerk `Unacceptable' -- A  second  editorial on the same page of the 8 February BEELD argues that  "the manner in which Mr. Nelson Mandela continues with his  personal attacks on the state president is unacceptable. His  references to President de Klerk as `an unstable person' and a  `weakling' overstep the bounds a civilized political leader  should go in an election campaign. South Africa rightfully  expects any political leader, who sees himself as a future head  of state, to behave like one. Mr. Mandela's emotional tirade  against President de Klerk excludes him from this category."  "By increasingly playing the man rather than the ball, Mr.  Mandela appears to be seeking a lightning conductor for  criticism against aspects of his policy. We appeal for a  raising of the level of political debate -- otherwise South  Africans will in the future reap the fruits of these outbursts."    Negotiations Reach `Moment of Truth' -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 9 February argues in a page-8 editorial  that "the moment of truth has arrived for the Freedom Alliance's  negotiations with the government and the ANC. With only a few  days left before parties must register for the election, the  negotiation cards are on the table, and it appears that the  government and the ANC are prepared to make several more  concessions in order to remove the alliance's objections to  peaceful participation in the election." "Should the remaining  stumbling blocks in the negotiations be removed, the Freedom  Alliance, in the light of these concessions, will have no other  honorable choice but to participate. Should they do so, they  will be able, as honorable negotiators, to make a contribution  to the political process in bringing about greater peace,  stability, and prosperity for all in South Africa."  <H6>  ILANGA </H6>   Negotiations With ANC Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 7-9  February in a page-4 editorial states that "the African National  Congress' [ANC] decision to accept the double ballot system is  commendable indeed as it is a step forward in resolving problems  plaguing the negotiations on the future of this country." "Now  we hear that because the ANC has agreed to the double ballot, it  now wants the Freedom Alliance leaders to sign documents binding  them to taking part in the 26-29 April election." "People  should not get confused here, because there are other important  proposals put forward by the Freedom Alliance that the ANC has  said nothing about." "What is their story on the Zulu monarchy,  kwaZulu, and the Zulu nation? There is still a lot they have  not said anything about. So do not get confused!"</p>

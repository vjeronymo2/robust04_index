			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 16 (AFP) -- Israel  released the deputy leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement  HAMAS on Thursday among several hundred Palestinians set free,  Palestinian sources said.    Sa'id Abu-Musamih, 47, one of the co-founders of the Moslem  fundamentalist group, was serving life for his activities.    When Israel arrested HAMAS chief Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in 1989,  Abu-Musamih took over as head of the movement before he was  imprisoned the following year.    Yasin, sentenced to life in 1991 for murder and incitement  to  violence, remains in jail having refused an offer of freedom  conditional on a pledge to renounce terrorism.</p>

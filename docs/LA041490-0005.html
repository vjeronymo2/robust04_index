			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS GRAPPLE WITH THE DROUGHT  </P> <P> I don't find it difficult to accept that water rationing is in our immediate  future, perhaps, even, for all time hereafter.  </P> <P> However, I will oppose, with all the conviction I can muster, the granting of  additional building permits -- both residential and commercial -- so long as  the rationing of water is deemed necessary for those of us who occupy existing  dwelling units.  </P> <P> The granting of new building permits will only exacerbate the water shortage:  Every additional dwelling unit will be allowed to consume -- without penalty --  the water "saved" by nine existing consumers who reduce their consumption by  the proposed mandatory 10%.  </P> <P> That's not just unfair. It is simply unconscionable for the City Council and  the Department of Water and Power to allow those new water connections.  </P> <P> ROBERT M. GORDON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

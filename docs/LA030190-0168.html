			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-EMPLOYEE ARRESTED AFTER MAN IS SHOT  </P> <P> A disgruntled construction worker is suspected of having ambushed his former  supervisor in a parking lot about 3 p.m. Wednesday, shooting him in the arm and  chest, police said.  </P> <P> The suspect, identified as Jody Dion Patterson, 26, was arrested at his home in  Sun City in Riverside County several hours later on suspicion of attempted  murder, police said. Matt David Mabry, 27, the superintendent of a construction  site at MacArthur Boulevard and Fairchild Road, underwent surgery at Western  Medical Center-Santa Ana on Wednesday night. Mabry, who lives in Victorville,  is expected to survive, Police Lt. Mike White said.  </P> <P> White said Patterson had recently been transferred to another job site, then  laid off from Raymond Interior Systems in Orange. Witnesses reported having  seen him loitering around the construction area earlier in the day before Mabry  was shot in a nearby parking structure, White said.  </P> <P> "It appears that he was waiting for him," White said.  </P> <P> Mabry was shot as he was driving a pickup truck on the second floor of the  parking structure, White said. The bullets, believed to have been fired from a  rifle, struck Mabry from the passenger side of the vehicle, he said.  </P> <P> For three hours after the shooting, the intersection at MacArthur and Jamboree  Road and also a short stretch of the Corona del Mar Freeway were blocked off as  police searched for the suspect.  </P> <P> Police, believing that Patterson was hiding in the parking structure, used dogs  and called in a SWAT team, White said. He was not to be found there, however.  </P> <P> Riverside County sheriff's deputies, working with Irvine police, went to  Patterson's residence in Sun City and saw that he was inside, White said. SWAT  teams from both departments surrounded the house. Investigators made contact  with Patterson, who then surrendered without incident, police said.  </P> <P> This is at least the second time in less than two months that a disgruntled  employee has been named as a suspect in the shooting of an immediate  supervisor. On Jan. 12, a former auto mechanic at El Gato Auto Repair in Santa  Ana fatally shot Alfonso Romero, who had been his boss, and wounded two other  people after being told he was fired.  </P></p>

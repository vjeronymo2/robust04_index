In his interview with Interfax Friday, Abdulatipov expressed  the opinion that Yeltsin decided to give up further  radicalization of reforms because these moves could pose a  threat to economic transformations themselves. He also pointed  out that the monetarist policy pursued from Moscow irrespective  of regional peculiarities, including republics within the  Russian Federation, threatens Russia's integrity.    "Both the prime minister and the president understood this  principal issue. That is why they have corrected the  composition of the government, and, God bless them to correct  the reform course," said Abdulatipov.    Abdulatipov believes that Gaydar and Fedorov specifically  slammed the door before their resignation in order to have "a  site" to return to the government. He explained that according  to experts' forecasts, 1994 will be a year of hard consequences  of the errors in the sphere of economic reforms "and both Yegor  Gaydar and Boris Fedorov know this quite well." "That is why  Yegor Gaydar will be able to say six months from now, `it was  better when I was in power,'" he said.    To this effect Abdulatipov declared that neither Yegor  Gaydar  nor Boris Fedorov had enough courage "to face" these problems.  "That is why they have placed all expected difficulties on  Viktor Chernomyrdin's shoulders, a bull carrying the Russian  economy," he underlined.    Abdulatipov indicated that the period to verify reformers'  honesty had started after Yegor Gaydar's resignation. "If they  (leaders of Russia's Choice) are in favor of reforms they will  occupy the most constructive position with respect to the  Cabinet's activity. If they are not interested in the reforms'  success and attempt to impose their representatives on the  reformers' group, then Russia's Choice could become a wild  critic of Chernomyrdin's government," declared Abdulatipov.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television This looks like a night to spend just about anywhere other than in front of the box. However, it is a different story if you are minded to listen to Tyndale's Testament (Radio 3, 10.45). William Tyndale eminently deserves to be resurrected from the dog-eared pages of history text-books. A good scholar and a most courageous man, Tyndale was responsible for the first complete translation of the Bible into English and tonight's programme salutes his profound, if unrecognised, influence on English language and literature. If you admire people with a creative flair for handling money, the programme to watch is Arena: On the Road with Boggs (BBC 2, 9.30). J. S. G. Boggs is the American artist who draws and colours his own dollar-bills and spends them as a form of 'performance art' which allows him to be remunerated more handsomely than are most poverty-stricken performance artists. Collectors of Boggs's work are set a merry dance as they try to track down Boggs-bills using the receipts which the artist always asks for and which then, together with the loose change, become part of the art-work.</p>

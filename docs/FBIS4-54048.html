			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, May 24 KYODO -- A Fukuoka travel agency is  planning Japan's first rice-buying tour to South Korea next  month when inventories of the domestic grain regularly grow  short during the rainy season, organizers said Tuesday [24 May].    Rice from the Ichon region southeast of Seoul is reputed to  be as tasty as Japan's domestic varieties at about one-fourth  the cost, said the Fukuoka branch of H.I.S. travel agency.    Overseas travelers can bring into Japan up to 100 kilograms  of foreign rice annually under Japanese law and with Seoul about  an hour's flight from Fukuoka, the agency is hailing the rice  tour concept as a "bargain."    Tour participants will fly to Seoul and take a bus to Pubal,  Kyonggi Province, some 100 kilometers southeast of Seoul, where  they will be able to purchase rice from the local agricultural  cooperative.    According to Kim Kyo-hwan, an official with the farm group,  10 kilograms of rice will cost about 16,000 won or about 2,100  yen. He added that the cooperative can sell about 30 tons of  rice.    It will also be possible for the tour members to have any  rice they cannot carry home with them shipped separately to  Japan by the cooperative, the agency said.    According to the agency, Japanese tourists have brought home  small amounts of rice from overseas as gifts for friends and  family members, but its tour will be the first time that the  participants will be able to bring home 100 kilograms, which can  last an average family two to three months.</p>

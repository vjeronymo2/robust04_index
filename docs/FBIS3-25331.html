			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Joaquim Alberto Chissano by </F> correspondent Salomao Moyana; place and date not given]    [Text] [Moyana] How do you see the implementation of the  General Peace Accord so far?    [Chissano] I think it has been positive because we have not  had war since October 1992. We have taken slow but steady  steps, and I think that people are getting more confident and  more certain that war will not come back.    I even believe that there is more trust on the Mozambique  National Resistance's [Renamo] side now. At least they know  that, whatever the outcome of the elections, they can, if they  wish, continue their political work without harassment. They  have been talking about the difficulties of their work, and the  tendency is to lay the blame for those difficulties at someone  else's door, as if the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] did  not have its own difficulties. Yet, little by little, they are  realizing that those difficulties are inherent to party work and  that, if they have the courage to continue, they will certainly  be able to do their work, irrespective of the results of the  upcoming elections. This gives them a little bit more courage  and that, in itself, is the result of the correct implementation  of the General Peace Accord.    By this, I do not mean to say that there have been no lows  along the way. There were some lows that were discouraging at  times, but they were overcome thanks to perseverance, patience,  and understanding. I would have liked to say that this was a  mutual thing, but the truth is that much more has been demanded  from the government than from Renamo, even though we know that  there have been serious violations of the accord that cannot be  regarded as fleeting, sporadic, or isolated violations. They  have been violations of principle, and those violations have  come from Renamo. There is no doubt about that.    Well, despite all that, I can say that the implementation of  the General Peace Accord has been positive. I think we may  enjoy better days when the process of demobilization and  reintegration of the demobilized soldiers gets off the ground.  That is a process that will also know difficulties, more often  than not because demobilized soldiers will not always be aware  of the state's duties toward them.    [Moyana] Mr. President, do you believe that elections will  be  held in October of this year?    [Chissano] Yes, I do believe that. You will remember that  elections were to be held one year after the signing of the  General Peace Accord. It was believed that one year would have  been sufficient for elections to be held and, as a matter of  fact, it should have been sufficient. There were delays,  however, and we know the reasons for those delays.    These problems have been overcome, and so we now have  exactly  the same time we would have had if everything had gone according  to plan. We are now in January, and we are already preparing to  begin training the principal section of the Armed Forces. Many  soldiers have already been confined. The Electoral Law has been  approved, and bids are under way concerning material  preparations for elections.    With the Electoral Law issue settled, provinces must already  be thinking about who their deputies will be, in other words,  they must be thinking about their candidates. Each party must  already be preparing for elections. I even think that, in one  form or another, people are already being educated with a view  to participating in the upcoming elections.    [Moyana] Mr. President, concerning the delays in the  implementation of the General Peace Accord, what part of the  blame would you lay at the door of your government?    [Chissano] Let me see...there may be some small  things...they  are so insignificant, really....    [Moyana] Concerning the issue of housing for Renamo, does  the  Mozambican Government not recognize that it could have done more  to expedite the process?    [Chissano] I would say no. The issue of housing is not the  government's responsibility. If Renamo had really wanted to  cooperate, it would not even have needed to ask for housing.  There are so many parties whose leaders have come from abroad  but who have not asked for housing. There is the case of the  Mozambique United Front, Fumo, for instance. As an individual,  rather than as a politician, Fumo President Domingos Arouca was  the first to discuss the issue of housing with me. The problem  of housing for Mr. Arouca was only recently settled, but his  party is functioning. Look at the example of Mr. Jeque, who  also comes from Portugal and belongs to Fumo. He looked for a  house and a job. He is employed because he had the will to do  it. I can cite other examples: Mr. Massinga Chicuarra [not  further identified], who had been abroad but who has come back  and found himself a place to stay. There is Mr. Padimbe, who  belongs to another party, and there is [Mozambican Nationalist  Movement President] Maximo Dias.    Thus, if Renamo had wanted to cooperate, it could have begun  its work without having to depend on such housing. Well, the  government has complied with the terms of the General Peace  Accord because this is not a matter of giving houses away. The  government does not carry houses in its pockets like so many  nickels and dimes. The government had to look for these houses.  It did so, and it found them. In some instances, it was even  necessary to remove the tenants, but Renamo only realized at a  later stage that it hd to participate in the search for the  houses it would be using. It was a matter of understanding  things. This understanding was a bit slow in coming, but it  finally came.    Perhaps there are, but, off the cuff, I fail to see the  reason for the government to be blamed for any major delays...    [Moyana] What about the issue of logistical conditions for  Renamo advisers to the provincial governors? Did the government  act within a reasonable time?    [Chissano] Regarding the matter of Renamo's advisers, the  delay was, once again, due to Renamo itself. You will recall  that it was in August that Renamo made that request. We  approved it, but I only received the list before I left on  leave. Those officials were not appointed, not because I was on  leave, but because the territorial administration minister was  not in, either. That happened in December, when everyone was on  leave, but it is my belief that, even if I had continued on  leave, the appointments would have been made as soon as the  territorial administration minister returned.    As for material conditions, once we had the men we would see  why there were conditions that depended on the international  community's good will. When that matter came up for discussion,  the problem of increased expenses and what they would represent  to the state was one of our first concerns.    We also discussed the matter of the premises needed. Now, to  encourage us to make a decision, the international community  expressed its readiness to help us. Unfortunately, that help  did not come with the speed the promises were made. It was a  matter of putting up prefabricated homes in all provinces.  There were even promises that more houses than we had asked for  would be put up so as to meet the needs of state workers but,  yet again, the international community failed to deliver as  rapidly as possible. I remember that that promise was made at a  meeting attended by all ambassadors plus the United Nations.  That promise was made when I handed in a report on the talks  with Mr. Dhlakama and on the material difficulties I foresaw.  The answer: "Do not worry!" Well, I did not stop worrying  because I think that advisers can be received in the required  conditions in some provinces, but not in others, meaning that  other problems would be left unresolved. Renamo itself will need  other premises for its political work.    Once again, though, delays here cannot be blamed on a lack  of  material conditions. They should be blamed, first and foremost,  on the absence of candidates to fill in those posts since  August, resulting in a delay of five months.    [Moyana] Does the lack of regular reshuffles mean that you,  Mr. President, are satisfied with your ministers' performance?    [Chissano] It is my opinion that a government reshuffle  should not occur only when the head of state is unhappy. It is,  in fact, health to reshuffle the cabinet when everybody is still  on good terms. Now, if you talk about reshuffles, there are  people who are outside and who have the desire, or perhaps  because they believe that a certain official is not acting as  wished, and they think a reshuffle would help. [sentence as  published] Perhaps because of the trust they place in me, they  say: "Look, the president is watching and he will change  things. He will replace this person with another." However,  there is one standard that many people do not follow, either,  and that is to give time to people because people who make  mistakes, who have some shortcomings, often feel it themselves  and they know they must find ways to overcome those problems.  So, there is the need to give people time. I might reshuffle  the government today. I might remove this person and bring in  another, but I have no idea what the new person will do. There  is often the need to give time, help, educate, instruct, and so  forth. There will be a time when people will say: "Now, this  fellow is no good for this task." There are times, however,  when a person is moved because he has shown aptitude and we need  that person for other duties where we think he might do better,  or where we might need reinforcements. Then, we shift that  person.    Well, all those assessments have been made. First, prior to  the signing of the General Peace Accord, there was the need to  strengthen some sectors, to change routine. In some cases, it  was not because officials performed poorly. Those measures were  needed at the provincial and central levels, but we decided  that, as we were going through a process of change, it would  have been good for change to occur with the same people at the  helm and then, after that change, we would see how to go about a  reshuffle. Personally, that is what I thought. Well, the peace  accord was delayed and so our decision was delayed.    Now we are preparing for elections, people are doing their  work, and once again there are rumors going around -- they are  rumors because I have never given a thought to what people say  outside, they think it and they believe it is reality -- believe  me, I have been in some very delicate situations. The rumors  were so many that they even affected people who were directly  involved and who began to think that the president was  considering shifting them about without any explanation. It is  not obligatory for me to provide explanations, but, with the  trust that exists among us, there is a bad atmosphere when  people start to talk and the interested party knows nothing  about it. That is because there was nothing like that from my  side. I think that those rumors about a government reshuffle  reflect the interests of an individual or of a group of persons.    I must tell you that the members of government have greatly  improved the quality of their work over the last two years or  so. There is the need to understand that they, too, are human  beings, that they have their weak moments, that they can be  uncertain about the future, and so on. There is good morale  today, however, much better than anyone might expect, this  despite the difficult work they have to do in precarious  financial and economic conditions in all sectors. Thus, I am  satisfied with the members of my staff, but that does not mean  that there will not be a reshuffle for the reasons that I have  indicated earlier. I am going to see when a reshuffle is right,  so that I can count on the input of all involved in the various  sectors.    [Moyana] It has been widely said in national political  circles that citizen Joaquim Chissano should publicly make it  clear when he is visiting a province as head of state and when  he is visiting it as Frelimo Party chairman. It is also said  that you use the same General State Budget in both capacities.  Would you like to comment, Mr. President?    [Chissano] I can tell you the following: I have trouble  traveling as pure and simple citizen Joaquim Chissano. That is  another distinction they are not mentioning. I would like to go  wherever I might want to go. For instance, I might want to go  to that island alone with my wife, but no one will allow me to  do that. There is always the idea that it is the president of  the Republic who is traveling, even though I would have liked to  go there to swim and eat fish like any other citizen -- like  you, for instance.    The fact of the matter is that if I went to some province to  do my party work, even if I paid for my own ticket -- and I  would have liked to pay for my ticket to take an aircraft, a  small aircraft -- people would say: "No, not on such a small  aircraft." Were I to travel by car, they would say: "That is  fine, the car can go, but there must be an escort, the protocol  officials must also go, and so on." I would like to ask: What  would change?    The fact is that, up to now, I have traveled as head of  state  and I take advantage of those trips to do party work because I  have no way to travel as Frelimo Party chairman without that  being linked to the fact that I am head of state. It would be  very convenient for me to separate those functions, but I cannot  be dissociated from my position as head of state. It is  impossible. Nor can I allow my party to be at a disadvantage  just because its chairman is also the head of state.  Nevertheless, that is bound to happen, whether you be head of  state or some other official. For instance, if a minister who  is also a Frelimo Party Central Committee member goes to some  province and is asked questions by party members, he cannot just  turn around and say: "No, I cannot talk because I am here on  state duties." That is impossible, too. It would mean that  parties fighting for power stop being parties when they get to  power. These are party cadres we are talking about, and any  party coming to power will have its cadres. Now, what is  really necessary is to know how to use state property without  impairing state functions. One does not spend more money just  by talking of party matters when on a state visit. One spends  exactly the same....    [Moyana] The fact is, should that be true, Frelimo will  enjoy  great political advantage over the other parties, because a  large number of its members are involved in state duties and are  using state funds to do their party work. There is also the  example of the Frelimo Party secretary general, who is a  minister, traveling to the provinces in his capacity as  minister, thereby using state funds, but going there to tackle  party issues....    [Chissano] But that will also be the case with any other  party. If you have to travel just to do party work as secretary  general, obviously the party will pay the expenses, but let me  tell you something: Even then, that official will also be doing  state work. He cannot stop doing state work simply because the  party has paid his expenses. The truth is, though, that when  the emphasis is placed on party work, we make every effort to  ensure that party funds are made available for that work and not  the contrary.    [Moyana] Do you think that the party that wins the upcoming  elections should take all or that there should be a preelectoral  multiparty accord concerning a government of national unity?    [Chissano] With regard to that issue, it seems to me that we  are beginning to see -- not all over the world but with some  international observers -- a distortion of democracy because of  events in Angola. It is even beginning to seem as though  democracy is of no use to Africa. That is absurd. Some seem to  be sorry that they supported an accelerated implementation of  multiparty democracy, so they start talking about the need to  put the cart before the horse. All over the world, there is  much talk of national unity and of national interests. I also  endorse national unity views because that is the Frelimo Party's  philosophy, and I grew up with it, working for national unity,  so there is no need for anybody to tell me about the need for  it. Purely and simply, national unity must be based on real  foundations. We have created a multiparty system to allow the  people to be consulted in different ways. There is the need to  see what the people's response will be and, on the basis of that  response, to look for the best ways to guarantee national unity.  The people will dictate those ways. Perhaps they will be  dictated even during the electoral campaign. We will have to see  the amount of support the existing parties receive, and we will  to see whether Frelimo needs to consider it. The electoral  campaign and the outcome of elections will provide indications.  The party that has those responsibilities will have enough data  to be able to say what will be needed to guarantee political  stability in the country, what ought to be done to ensure  greater national unity, and what should be done to guarantee  greater participation by the people in all political, economic,  and social matters.    Sometimes there is the tendency to ignore all that and think  that, just because election results were not accepted in Angola,  things must be done artificially. Where does that leave  democracy, though? What is democracy good for, then? What is  the point of consulting with the people? In other words, we  would be consulting with the people and saying: "Elect me but do  not worry; this is just for the sake of electing, because we are  all going to govern, so there is no problem!" You would have me  saying in my campaign: "Give some votes to this party and some  to that other one." That is not my duty. It is each party's  duty to get votes, because we want to know exactly what people  think. So, each party should put forward its program with  sincerity, without thinking whether it will be in power or not.  The people will choose some program and then whoever wins can  say: "The people have chosen me, but they have these national  unity leanings." There might even be the need to reconcile  parts of programs and correct parts of your program. This is  how I see democracy. You cannot go around misleading people,  saying "you choose, but we decide who governs." That cannot be  done....    [Moyana] There are those who insist on a formal signing of  a multiparty preelectoral compromise on this issue.    [Chissano] What does this mean in terms of democracy? Where  has it ever happened in that way? That has never happened  anywhere. The United States, England, and Portugal do not do so.    If the Peace Accord negotiations had taken a different turn,  we would have acted in another way. You will recall that in  1987-88, I was already saying that if Renamo wanted to lay down  their weapons and return, we would all together study how to  reorganize our society. We would adopt new forms of elections.  I even went as far as researching who was who in Renamo, what  rank they held, and what they could do and could not do. In  fact I did not know any of them. I did this because I was very  worried about the transitional phase that would permit all of us  to study what changes could be made. We did not get any reply  until the adoption of a new constitution in 1990 creating  multipartyism. During negotiations Renamo accepted the  democratic challenge. So we are now facing a democratic  challenge, and after all this we are not going to act as if  nothing has happened.    [Moyana] It has been reported by government officials that  there are conflicts about positions and prospects between the  IMF, the World Bank, and the Mozambican Government. Someone in  your government has even said that due to IMF and World Bank  impositions, the Mozambican Government's sovereignty is no more  than five percent. Is there any truth in that?    [Chissano] No, that is not true. In reality our country has  been able to maintain a good relationship with the IMF. We  believe we still exercise most of our sovereignty, and we comply  with the demands posed by international cooperation, like every  country does. This is to ensure coordination in the management  of funds used in monetary and financial activities, as well as  foreign currency, productive activities all over the world, and  transactions in general. So, there is always a part of  sovereignty that one has to give away. I can even say that at  present blocs are being formed and being strengthened. So,  everything we do goes through negotiations. We have spent many  hours and nights negotiating. If we did not respect our  sovereignty, we would not take a long time negotiating. There  have been a number of demands made by the World Bank and IMF  that we have satisfied at once. They may seem to be correct  solutions, but we, as a responsible government, have to study  the consequences they will have for the country. Then we have  to take daring steps wherever we feel we can withstand the  impact for some time, because it is a reality that reforms are  necessary. The economic recovery program is a necessary program.    The IMF has its rules. The government must decide whether to  follow them. We are always sovereign; we can choose. If we  believed there was a better way, we would take it. We will not  be prevented from doing so. In some cases we do so, as for  instance in the devaluation of the currency. We have not  devalued our currency as requested by the World Bank and the  IMF. We were supposed to do so with greater speed, but that  would have been more painful for our population. We have to  administer the medicine in doses, but the impact of the  resistance may lead to the deterioration of the economy, as in  the case of civil servants' salaries and budget deficit; we have  been allowing a comfortable deficit but have to tighten it  little by little. Whenever an economic measure is announced  everyone cries, but this is not an imposition by the IMF or the  World Bank, but by economic laws.    [Moyana] People in this country talk a great deal about the  domination of the south over central and northern Mozambique.  People speak of continued centralization in Maputo of all  mechanisms of economic, political, and cultural decisions. As a  solution, people have a number of hypotheses: federalism and  elected -- rather than appointed -- governors, administrators,  and mayors. I would like to know what do you think about that.    [Chissano] I believe we should continue studying this issue.  As you know, the Constitution left this issue open so that a  study can be carried out. The study is already underway and is  being supervised and financed by international bodies. A  responsible study is underway because a solution cannot be found  with closed eyes. A profound analysis is needed. You spoke,  for instance, about governors. Who can tell whether a governor,  and not any other figure, should be elected? I know countries  where a region has an elected body, and a representative of the  central government with specific powers; who would this  representative be? A governor or administrator? Up to which  level shall we have these figures? One should study all this.  One should study the relationship between elected and  traditional power. All this is being dealt with in the study we  are carrying out.    In fact we have already begun decentralizing where it seems  to us obvious that we should, particularly in the economic  sector. The provincial governments are already making a number  of decisions, and this year we will experience a broader  decentralization in the economic sector.    Now on the issue of north dominating south or vice versa --  some people may choose to view it like that, but I do not see  any domination. Let us be very cold; let us take, for instance,  a place near the Mozambican capital such as Gaza Province, where  the president of the Republic, the first Frelimo chairman, the  second Frelimo chairman and first president of the Republic,  come from. Is there any industry in that area? There are some  cashew nuts industries, which are paralyzed, and a rice peeling  industry. In Cabo Delgado, however, where there was no industry  before independence, now there are textile and marble  industries, and the graphite industry is already in an advanced  stage, and there is already a big cotton complex in Montepuez,  and there is the Pemba harbor. It is not possible now to  enumerate everything accomplished by this government. We could  talk of Massingir but the reconstruction of that infrastructure  began in the colonial era. Gaza has nothing! I do not see  anything there. In what way is the south dominating the north?  I would have said the same concerning Niassa Province if the  infrastructures had not been paralyzed by war. You will recall  that the biggest poultry farm in the country was scheduled to be  built in Niassa, and the pavilions are still there, paralyzed.  The biggest livestock feed factory is scheduled to be built  there. The nation's breadbasket would be in Niassa with a  project of 400,000 hectares, and this was in the north. There  were no 400,000 hectares in the south. There are no Morrua and  Marropino mines in the south; those are in Zambezia. The gold  mines are in Manica Province, and all of these are new things,  developed after independence.    Concerning people who are part of the government, the  secretary general of the party is from Sofala Province and  belongs to the Ndau tribe. The defense minister is from the  north. The south is not a monolithic unit. The prime minister  is from Inhambane, but he was not born in the capital of the  province. He is from one of the districts, not from Maputo or  Gaza. The education minister is not from the south; he is from  Manica Province. His tribe is not Ndau or Sena; he is a Manica,  and no one speaks of this tribe. The minister of culture is not  from the south, but from the north. He is a Macua. Now, what  domination are we talking about? In terms of education and  health all perspectives are turning more and more toward the  provinces.</p>

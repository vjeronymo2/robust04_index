"No member state is fully opposed and the  United Kingdom and Germany have already showed their support,"  Fenech Adami said yesterday in a meeting with several  journalists. The Maltese prime minister was in Brussels for  talks with the European Commission. He also had a meeting with  Prime Minister Dehaene. Malta applied for membership of what was  the European Community on 16 July 1990.    Fenech Adami said that the required reforms, like the  introduction of value added tax, the abolition of capital  controls or reduced customs duties, have either been implemented  or are about to be approved by Parliament.    The membership of this small state located in the  Mediterranean Sea would not pose many economic or budgetary  problems for the EU, which has 345 million inhabitants at  present. This figure would even increase to 370 million  inhabitants if Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria joined. The  country consists of three small islands with a total of 360,000  inhabitants. The reforms requested are intended simply to  prevent membership becoming too great a shock for the Maltese  economy. Nor does the domestic political situation offer any  reason for disquiet to the Union.    The way the Union functions would be the biggest problem  arising from Maltese membership. As a small country with little  international experience and a small diplomatic corps and civil  service, it is doubtful whether Malta would be able to take on  the six-monthly presidency. Out of the present member states,  only Luxembourg has so few inhabitants, but it has been involved  in European integration right from the start.    A modification to the rules will be discussed at the planned  inter-governmental conference in 1996. However, many will be  reluctant to start new institutional discussions after the  difficulties with the Maastricht Treaty. But according to  Fenech Adami, it was senseless to avoid this discussion and  Malta's application should not suffer on these grounds. He  rejected a possible link between the applications of Malta and  Cyprus or postponement, should the talks with Norway, Sweden,  Finland, and Austria become stuck.    Language will in any case not be an obstacle. Malta is  prepared to use English rather than Maltese in the Union, so  that the Union would not have to add another language.</p>

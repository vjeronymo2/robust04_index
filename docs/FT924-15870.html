			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Beijing to retain favoured status CHINA is set to retain the advantages it has in trade with the US under its most favoured nation (MFN) status following a vote in the Senate yesterday which sustained by a 59-40 vote a presidential veto of legislation attaching conditions to its low-tariff status. This follows a 345-74 vote in the House on Wednesday in favour of placing conditions on China's status. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses for the override to stand. MFN status gives China the lowest possible tariffs, with the exception of those granted under free trade agreements. The attempt to use trade as leverage with China to improve its human rights policies has picked up support in both houses since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests were crushed. But the White House argues the US has more influence over China if it keeps close trade ties. Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, yesterday took the administration's case to the senate floor. 'We've had this debate again and again,' he said. 'Denying or conditioning MFN will not push the reform process forward in China one millimetre.' The issue has come up in the presidential election, with Democrats accusing President Bush of being 'soft' on China. In a separate action, US and Chinese negotiators next week will try to reach a settlement on a US complaint that it is denied market access in China. At stake is up to Dollars 3.9bn in threatened US sanctions and counter-retaliation by Beijing.</p>

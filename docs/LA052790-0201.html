			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> HANSEN-DENT CELEBRATES SINGLES VICTORY  </P> <P> After he hit one last unreturnable shot Saturday, Brett Hansen-Dent paused a  moment, reached for the second ball in his pocket and belted it high and deep  into the SeaCliff Tennis Club parking lot.  </P> <P> It was a rare show of emotion for Hansen-Dent, a senior at Newport Harbor High  School who takes carefully measured steps on a tennis court. There never seems  to be room in his game for outbursts.  </P> <P> But there is a time and place for celebration, and Hansen-Dent found it after  defeating Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, to win the Southern Section  singles title.  </P> <P> Later, Hansen-Dent laughed when someone mentioned his home run ball. He  acknowledged it was a dramatic break from his method of operation.  </P> <P> Even when he defeated practice partner Jon Leach of Laguna Beach to win the  Ojai Valley tournament's 18-and-under title last month, his calm demeanor never  waivered.  </P> <P> "I kind of thought Ojai was bigger because all the colleges play there," said  Hansen-Dent, whose father, Phil Dent, was once the fifth-ranked player in the  world. "For high schools this was bigger. This is the real CIF."  </P> <P> Winning the Southern Section title was something of a breakthrough for  Hansen-Dent, who though he is older than Leach, has played in his friend's  shadow.  </P> <P> "Up until this year, my high school career was all right," Hansen-Dent said.  "Now, it's really happening for me."  </P> <P> In the first set, Nathan ran Hansen-Dent ragged, blistering one passing shot  after another.  </P> <P> "No one could have beaten him in that first set," Hansen-Dent said. "Not Leach.  No one."  </P> <P> Hansen-Dent maintained his composure and rallied, winning the second set  easily. When he broke serve for the second set in a game that had seven deuce  points and four set points, Hansen-Dent also seemed to have broken Nathan's  spirit. Nathan didn't offer much resistence in the third set.  </P> <P> "I don't really think I played much different," Hansen-Dent said. "He was just  so hot. I just waited for him to cool down."  </P> <P> When Nathan did, Hansen-Dent was ready to pounce.  </P> <P> Hansen-Dent did not get a second shot at beating Leach this season.  </P> <P> Nathan, down 4-1 in the third set, rallied to beat Leach, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5, in the  semifinals Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Leach, a junior, had advanced to the final the past two seasons, winning as a  freshman and losing last year.  </P> <P> It was his last high school match. He will graduate early and begin classes in  January at USC, where his father is the tennis coach.  </P> <P> "It's funny," Leach said. "My game is getting better each year, even though my  record got worse. I'm improving. I think I'll be ready for college next year."  </P> <P> Mater Dei's Jason Harnett and Adam Jarrett, who began playing doubles together  three weeks ago and only to qualify for the Southern Section tournament, won  the title, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), over Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand  Oaks.  </P> <P> The last time Harnett, a senior, and Jarrett, a junior, played together they  advanced to the quarterfinals of last year's Southern Section tournament.  </P> <P> "They (the Thousand Oaks players) were a lot better than we expected," Harnett  said. "We didn't think they'd be able to raise the level of their game that  much."  </P></p>

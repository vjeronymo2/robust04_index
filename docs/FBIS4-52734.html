			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Thai Talk" column by Suthichai Yun: "Trafficking </F> in Drugs and Uttering Lies"]    [Text] The Chuan administration has produced another  "first" in the country's political annals: This government has  turned an international drug trafficking case into a partisan  incident.    For some bizarre reason, the prime minister, who, under  normal circumstances, would be considered the nation's top  law-enforcement official, has decided to adopt a "hands-off"  policy in the scandal involving 45 tonnes of Thai marijuana  shipped from either Thailand or nearby countries to the United  States between 1973 and 1987 allegedly involving an opposition  lawmaker from Nakhon Panom province.    Strange, incredible and incoherent statements were made by  all concerned from the very first day this story broke into the  open here about two weeks ago. Nobody should have been taken  aback of course when MP Thanong Siriprichaphong denied it all.  That he backtracked somewhat to admit some of the claims made  by the U.S. Information Service was only to be expected.    It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the  leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise  the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major  opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a  certain extent. If the timing of the "leak" was suspect, the  drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the  law -- American and Thai.    But the government has mishandled the scandal from the  outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first  official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was  relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months  later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of  Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at  all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt  to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters'  questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him  all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and  allowing the accused to state his case.    Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry,  presumably the only official channel through which the U.S.  Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment,  failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long.  The country's top drug enforcement agency under the  jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught  offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its  earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in  cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion.    While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party  went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new  party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise  was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political  career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to  the post as party leader -- one year and four months after the  Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the  court case in San Francisco.    That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case  into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of  demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether  or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the  opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have  treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge  been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government.    The House of Representatives may have named a committee to  look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its  own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in  salvaging its reputation.    But the government has yet to come up with any convincing  move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations  are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties  concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall  social and economic fabric -- and the government's political  credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on  drugs and illicit drugs.    Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer  some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this  connection:    1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on  Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency  was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept  under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the  foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics  agency informed about the request?    2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the  case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they  were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told  about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the  public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they  trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of  public servants in this country?    3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own  action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American  authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to  believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the  United States were in no way related to Thailand -- and that  they did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all?    4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to  be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a no-  confidence motion -- and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai  leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government?    In other words, can the government get away with its  apparent  inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the  opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain  and simple, is no.</p>

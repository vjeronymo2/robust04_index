			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Insurers want Pounds 10m limit on company employee risk cover Many UK companies face difficulties in obtaining adequate - or even the legally required - amounts of insurance cover from next year for deaths and injuries at work, corporate risk managers and insurance experts say. Government officials will hold urgent discussions this week with insurance industry representatives about a decision by insurance companies to stop selling employers liability policies with unlimited cover. Insurers plan to impose a basic Pounds 10m claims limit on policies renewed from January. The move has created confusion about the extra protection companies will need to buy. Mr Alan Fleming, executive director of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), said: 'Many companies may be left without adequate cover against possibly very significant losses - to say nothing of the fact that they may not be meeting their legal obligations.' Airmic is alarmed that insurance companies have yet to draw up details of policies that would offer the extra cover companies may require - even though there is little more than a month to go before the new limits are applied. Insurance companies have imposed the cap because of the escalating cost of employers' liability claims. Insurance premiums have already risen sharply, but the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, which resulted in claims for death and injury totalling about Pounds 125m, caused insurance companies to believe that unlimited cover was no longer possible. The insurers' move means companies are having to assess the extra protection needed to meet the cost of possible workplace incidents including large-scale disasters, however unlikely. They also have to ensure that they comply with the 1969 Employers' Liability Act, which says an employer must have at least Pounds 2m of cover. That will not be a problem for many companies. But the definition of 'employer' is unclear and each subsidiary of a large group may need Pounds 2m of protection. That means the total insurance requirement of a large corporate group may be so large that it has difficulty in obtaining the cover needed without excessive increases in premiums. A private report circulated by Sedgwick, the insurance broker, warns that 'insurers we have contacted have indicated that an employer liability policy in the form required by the Department of Employment will be very difficult to achieve'. The Sedgwick report expresses 'concern that such a difference of view about the legislation can appear to have arisen between the government and the Association of British Insurers'.</p>

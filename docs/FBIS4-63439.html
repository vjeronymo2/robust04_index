			<p>BFN     [Text] Interfax learned Friday at the press center of the  Georgian Defense Ministry that more than 500 Abkhaz fighters  were concentrated in the Gali region. The number is constantly  increasing. There is also a high concentration of military  technology. The center reported it had evidence to show that in  the night of May 20-21 Abkhazia was planning wide scale  operations to put an end to the peace talks and provoke a new  escalation of the conflict.    The Georgian Defense Ministry calls on the leaders of Abkhaz  armed formations to withhold from any military actions which  could lead to renewed bloodshed.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Food and Drink: Let's go for a bite at the opera - Restaurant critic Nicholas Lander combines a night of culture with a meal on the town GOING TO the opera or a show in central London? Then where do you go to eat? There are increasing pressures on achieving that elusive sensation of combining an uplifting cultural experience and a good meal. Cost and time are the most obvious as opera, concert and cinema ticket prices rise and managements, in an effort to minimise overtime after 11.30pm, bring forward their curtain-up. Bringing your own sandwiches for the interval may be one way of staving off the hunger pangs. For others this may detract from the pleasures of the first act. And what about eating out after the performance when there are fewer restaurants and cafes open until the early hours? Here are some ideas about where to eat. It is not a definitive list and it is obviously best to book in advance to let the restaurant or cafe know your requirements. For combining an evening meal with a night out I have split central London into areas - the places around Shaftesbury Avenue, the streets near the English National Opera, in St Martin's Lane, and eateries near Covent Garden, Wigmore Hall, the Barbican and the South Bank. They are placed in two categories: the first for special celebrations and when you are on expenses, the second for when you are paying yourself. Bon appetit] SHAFTESBURY AVENUE 1. The Oak Room, Le Meridien Hotel, Piccadilly (734-8000), Alastair Little (734-5183) and L'Epicure (437-2829) Frith Street, Bentley's (734-4756) Swallow Street, Au Jardin des Gourmets (437-1816) and The Gay Hussar (437-0973) Greek Street, Fuji (734-0957) Brewer Street and Manzi's (734-0224) Leicester Street, Quaglino's, Bury Street (930-6767), The Square, King Street (839- 8787) and Le Caprice, Arlington Street (629-2239) offer the chance to stretch one's legs. 2.

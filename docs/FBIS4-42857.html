			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] There are two large groups in the  governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), wrote Fernanda  Mestrinho in the 28 May Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, and they  revolve around Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira and  Minister of Internal Administration Dias Loureiro. While the  latter exerted tight control over the party during his tenure as  PSD secretary general, Nogueira has been able to create his own  "enormous network of dependencies," which could nevertheless  change as soon as this "retinue" would "no longer be fed." At  the ideological level, Dias Loureiro embodies liberal, free  market principles, while Nogueira represents social democracy.  Between the two stand the technocrats, who carefully remain  equidistant from both and tabulate the losses in the conflict.  According to Mestrinho, Dias Loureiro has dropped out of the  race to succeed Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, for he knows that  the next PSD leader will be only "transitory" and prefers to  wait. While he holds "strong" trump cards in his attempt to  prevent Nogueira's rise, he is beginning to pay more attention  to "cold and calculating" Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao  Barroso, whose career in achieving his high position has been  "autonomous," Mestrinho asserted. According to the results of a  May Catholic University/O INDEPENDENTE poll (no further details)  published in the 20 May Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, Durao  Barroso is the most popular minister in the Cavaco Silva  government.    For his part, Nogueira is aware that despite his ability to  secure the succession to Cavaco Silva, he can only do so by  remaining in the government, and will never be able to claim, as  Cavaco Silva has, that "I am the party," Mestrinho asserted. His  ascension will depend on negotiations with other PSD "barons"  eager for action after years of "forced domestication."    Mestrinho then commented on other possible successors to  Cavaco Silva. Former Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao is  one, but he is only interested in the presidency, and thus  depends on Cavaco Silva. Rui Machete is another; however, he was  already PS leader in the past, and "criminals never return to  the scene of the crime." Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Joao  de Deus Pinheiro, now a European Union (EU) commissioner, is  often mentioned because of his openness to dialogue and the  ability to negotiate with the various party factions. Two other  names to remember, Mestrinho added, are Minister of Public Works  Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, a key member of the government with  high visibility because of the large-scale building of roads and  bridges, and former Minister of Agriculture Cardoso e Cunha, a  member of the PSD national political commission now in charge of  Expo-98, a project that will bring changes to half of Lisbon.</p>

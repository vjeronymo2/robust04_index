			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek, 23 Jun -- The economic crisis in Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan] continues to worsen. According to figures  published today by the National Statistics Committee, total  output in May fell by 27.8 percent compared with April.  Sixty-five industrial enterprises have been at a standstill  since the beginning of the year. Losses at unprofitable  enterprises amount to 245.6 million soms.    Over 30,000 employees are sent on compulsory leave every  month and about 34,000 are on short time. At the beginning of  the year about 2,000 people were reporting every month to labor  exchanges, but by the end of April this figure had doubled, and  by the beginning of June it had risen to 15,800. Specialists  reckon that unemployment is becoming a large-scale and chronic  problem, especially among young people up to the age of 30.  Since the beginning of the year, this category's share in total  unemployment has risen by 150 percent.    Economic activity continues to decline in all sectors. There  was a deficit of 298.2 million soms on the consolidated budget  for the first four months of the year -- this is 10.5 percent of  gross domestic product.    During January-April the Republic earned profit of 370.2  million soms. But increased prices account for most of this.    Things are no better in agriculture. Meat production fell by  almost 30 percent. Production of eggs has almost completely  ceased. People have to buy them from private producers. Some  economists had pinned their hopes on privatization, but they now  say it is moving in a strange direction. Only 30 percent of the  population have received vouchers or "shares," as they are  called in Kirghizia. Even so, these people are in no hurry to  make use of them. Privatized enterprises are either abandoning  their original production profile or else coming to a complete  standstill.</p>

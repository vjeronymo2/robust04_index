			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney It must irk Walt Disney Company no end that having struggled hard to learn from the mistakes of the past, it now finds itself in a deep and cunningly constructed Parisian hole of its own devising. In bringing its theme park to Europe, Disney won every concession its executives could dream of. All the company needs now is for Euro Disney to make a profit. Sadly, that looks like a wish that is unlikely to be granted soon. The cash outflow from Euro Disney is likely to be FFr1.2bn this year and at least FFr500m next. Gearing may exceed 400 per cent. Banks will be understandably nervous of adding to the FFr20bn debts of the project, but shareholders have few investment yardsticks to value any rights issue. The company has no earnings and is unlikely to repeat last year's nominal dividend. Euro Disney's asset value of FFr35 a share is also shrinking rapidly. Even the discounted cash-flow model, beloved of those who launched the first equity issue, has shown how present values can swing wildly depending on the initial assumptions. Since neither banks nor outside shareholders are keen, and the original deal was so favourable to Walt Disney, it may be required to make concessions. Disney apparently regards the FFr900m second phase of development as important to build critical mass and fill the resort's hotels. One possibility would be for Walt Disney to cut its management fees, buy the hotels at a price reflecting their future value and then lease them back to Euro Disney, generating cash for the second phase and allowing a rights issue. Certainly Walt Disney's strictly limited financial commitment to the project is an illusion. The last thing the US parent can afford is the publicity that would surround the park's failure.</p>

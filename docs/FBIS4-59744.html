			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former President Amin al-Jumayyil by Kamal </F> Tarabayh; place and date not given; from the "Today's Guest"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Tarabayh] Your Excellency, how do you view  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's withdrawal ['i'tikaf]? Do you  support or oppose his demands and preconditions?    [Al-Jumayyil] The cabinet crisis is one of the results of  the  al-Ta'if agreement. I said at the time that the agreement would  create confusion in relations among the constitutional bodies;  that is, the presidency, the prime ministry, and the parliament.  In any case, the heresy of withdrawal is a novelty. It is not  mentioned in the new or in the old Lebanese constitutions.    [Tarabayh] If you please, Mr. President, it is not so new.  The late Prime Minister Rashid Karami used to withdraw from  time to time.    [Al-Jumayyil] It is good that you asked this question.  Karami did not withdraw. He respected the constitution.  Karami used to resign, tender his resignation. However, for  certain circumstances--in 1969 during the Cairo agreement, or  during my administration--it was impossible to form a new  government for certain national circumstances. Karami would  remain to perform the duties of the prime minister. Karami's  stand was constitutional.    Today, a new heresy is being created, i.e., withdrawal. The  least that can be said about it is that it violates the Lebanese  Constitution. More than that, it is a crime paralyzing  constitutional establishments. In modern democratic countries,  a perpetrator of such a crime would be referred to the supreme  state council.    [Tarabayh] This means al-Hariri's withdrawal is a crime, for  which he should be punished?    [Al-Jumayyil] I believe and I insist on saying that this is  a  disturbance of the constitutional establishment. As I have  said, the word withdrawal does not exist in the constitution.  Prime Minister Karami at the time tendered his resignation to  President Hilu [in 1969] and then tendered his resignation to  President al-Jumayyil in 1985. There was a resignation. But  the heresy of withdrawal, that is, staging a one-man strike,  playing hard to get, and sitting at home and saying come and beg  me--this means paralyzing the constitutional bodies. By law and  by the constitution, this is a crime and a deliberate injury to  the people's interests. Who commits such a crime must be  referred to the High Court.    [Tarabayh] Let us leave the issue of the withdrawal.  Al-Hariri presented the view that the Christian, particularly  the Maronite representation in the government, should be  defined. He called for appointing at least two ministers  representing the Phalangist Party and the National Bloc. As a  Phalangist from outside the party leadership, do you agree to  Phalangist participation in the government?    [Al-Jumayyil] [passage omitted] As in the past, we reject  the  prime minister bringing in some employees who cooperate with him  in his own organizations and appointing them directors and high  state officials. Now, he is following the same method,  consecrating this or that as a Maronite leader or a man  responsible for his community. This is rejected. We want the  government to continue as it is now, preparatory to the people  electing their own representatives, and so that the Lebanese  people--and if you want to use the Christian theme--the  Christians themselves say who they would like to represent them.    [Tarabayh] Would you comment briefly on the detention of the  dissolved Lebanese Forces party, Samir Ja'ja', and the  accusations leveled against him, topped by the murder of the  late Dani Sham'un?    [Al-Jumayyil] I do not want to comment on this matter. The  law will eventually give its verdict. But I demand that justice  be given to all. We do not want biased justice. We do not want  two standards before the law. I demand the arrest of the killer  of my brother, Bashir. The killer is well-known. He is free  and walking safely and happily on Beirut streets. He admitted  the murder at the time and confessed who his accomplices were.  [passage omitted]    [Tarabayh] My last question is: You have recently met with  General Michel 'Awn. What did you talk about? Will you  participate in the political front which he called for?    [Al-Jumayyil] Naturally, he and I consult on current issues  because we share the same views about nationalist issues and  consider the situation in Lebanon to be unbearable, in view of  the current well-known conditions. Together, we are endeavoring  to organize the work of the opposition and to close ranks in  order to deal with the current situation, especially in this  current difficult and historical phase. The entire Middle East  is now put to the test. The peace conference will define a new  map for the Middle East region. This map should not be redrawn  at the expense of Lebanon, its interests, independence, and  sovereignty.    [Tarabayh] Do you make continuous contacts with 'Awn?    [Al-Jumayyil] Indubitably.    [Tarabayh] What about General Raymond Iddih?    [Al-Jumayyil] I hope that the circles of consultations will  expand to include all the leaderships, including that of Iddih.  Perhaps the circumstances are not conducive to this now.  However, we will continue to gather all the sincere leaderships  which have enough courage to confront the current situation in  Lebanon.    [Tarabayh] Thank you.</p>

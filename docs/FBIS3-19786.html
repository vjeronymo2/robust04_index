According to reports by the Foreign  Ministry in Bonn, Ambassador to Turkey Horst Oesterhelt was  instructed on Monday [21 March] to ask the Turkish Interior  Ministry to "observe strictly" its promise to grant the group of  observers at the municipal elections in southeast Turkey  security and freedom of movement.    The Foreign Ministry regrets that the Turkish promise to  grant security and freedom of movement to German observers in  the Kurdish areas has not been kept. The promise had been made  last Friday at a meeting in Washington between Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin. Kinkel  sent a reminder telegram to Ankara on Saturday, when the arrest  of the observers became known.    A delegation from Mainz and Wiesbaden that is to monitor the  human rights situation at the Kurdish Nevruz New Year  celebrations has arrived in Kurdistan, in contrast to other  human rights groups. In a telephone conversation, one of the  participants said the delegation is in the Batman region and  wants to go on to Kozluk after the elections to prepare a twin  city program. The six-member delegation, including Friedel  Gruetzmacher, land parliament group chairperson of the Mainz  Greens, said they can move about freely, but are being monitored  by police.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nagy report: "The SZDSZ on Relations With Neighbors -- </F> Economic Cooperation to the Forefront"]    [Text] Ivan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign policy spokesman of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], discussed the party's  political views in connection with the SZDSZ's relationship  system in our region at a news conference on 25 March. This was  timely in view of the fact that the SZDSZ's leaders had visited  a number of neighboring countries in recent weeks and had  conducted talks with leading politicians.    As Szent-Ivanyi said, the relationship system with the  neighbors is one of Hungarian foreign policy's most important  areas. For this reason, in their view, Hungary's interest is to  have peaceful and well-functioning relations with the  neighboring countries. However, in the past four years most  problems have arisen precisely in this area, which has been  partly due to the government's ideological style of foreign  policy, Szent-Ivanyi said. Unlike the current coalition,  although the SZDSZ considers it very important that the  situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring countries is  settled, it does not make relations solely dependent on this.    According to Szent-Ivanyi, new principles need to be  introduced in regional relations, practical issues have to be  placed to the forefront, and the interests of the other side in  improving the relationship have to be made clear. During their  visits to Romania, Austria, and the Czech Republic, the SZDSZ  politicians found that interest was mainly shown in economic  cooperation.    The SZDSZ considers regional organizations like the Visegrad  cooperation or the Central European Initiative particularly  important. Talking about the Visegrad group, Szent-Ivanyi said  that in the course of their talks with the Czech foreign  minister, it was said that Prague does not want ostentatiously  to break off this cooperation but it has different ideas on it.  Szent-Ivanyi said that, in their view, Romania and Bulgaria  should join the Central European Free Trade Agreement.</p>

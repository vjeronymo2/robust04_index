			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Orient Express arrives in the orient WITH recession in Europe cutting into the revenues of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, Mr James Sherwood - who heads the Sea Containers shipping group and its affiliate Orient-Express Hotels - is launching a luxury train service between Bangkok and Singapore to take advantage of tourism growth in Asia. The new Eastern &amp; Oriental (E&amp;O) Express is already plying the 1,943-km route up and down the Malayan peninsula and is expected to be opened officially on September 19. An initial investment of about Dollars 23m (Pounds 15.2m) and months of negotiations with the Thai and Malaysian governments and railway authorities were required to bring the project to fruition. The E&amp;O is the first scheduled train to take passengers all the way from Singapore to Bangkok - normally they have to change trains at Butterworth in north Malaysia - and a Thai law had to be changed to allow a private company to run trains on the Thai state rail network. Immigration officers from Bangkok are flown down to the Malaysian border at E&amp;O's expense each time the train enters Thailand. Mr Sherwood took the precaution of involving Malaysian and Thai companies with good government contacts in the project. Malaysian property companies YTL and Landmarks hold 32 per cent and 18 per cent respectively; Orchid Lodge, majority owned by the Thai conglomerate Italthai, and Orient-Express Hotels each have 25 per cent. The two-day E&amp;O journey, starting from Pounds 740 per person for a one-way ticket between Bangkok and Singapore, is marketed as an experience, like a luxury cruise, rather than as a means of transport. 'Everything pointed to south-east Asia, which I have got to know well because many of my other business activities are concentrated there,' Mr Sherwood says of his decision to launch the service. Because of the climate, tourism there is a year-round business, he observes. The Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, launched in 1982, suffers from the seasonal nature of tourism in Europe and has recently been hit by recession and a dearth of American visitors. E&amp;O executives say they already have 6,000 advance bookings for the Asian journey, equivalent to more than half a year's trips. Each train can take 132 passengers. Mr Sherwood and his colleagues are already considering other destinations in Asia, including Cambodia - site of the ancient Khmer temples of Angkor Wat - and China.</p>

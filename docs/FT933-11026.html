			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Forminster moves ahead to Pounds 2.21m Forminster, the clothing manufacturer for mail order and chain stores, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.11m to Pounds 2.21m in the year to April 30. Turnover rose to Pounds 23.8m against Pounds 22m. The company had continued to expand, said Mr Ronald Gulliver, chairman, despite difficult trading conditions and the recession. While continuing to manufacture in the UK, the company was also developing its imports side, he said. After an unchanged tax charge of Pounds 725,000, earnings per share worked through at 53.79p (46.7p) and the proposed final dividend of 10.04p (8.75p) lifts the total for the year from 12.53p to 14p.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes of change at Glaxo The retirement announcement from Glaxo chairman Sir Paul Girolami brought a flurry of excitement to pharmaceutical stocks, with speculation that his departure meant the company was about to announce a major acquisition, following the path taken by SmithKline Beecham with its recent Dollars 2.3bn purchase of pharmacy benefit manager DPS. Sir Paul's retirement was described as 'the end of an era' by Mr James Culverwell at Hoare Govett, who added that Sir Paul epitomised an older style of drugs company, which concentrated on organic rather than acquisition-led growth. However, Mr Culverwell was sceptical about the probability of an early purchase. 'Glaxo's route is more likely to be with alliances and relationships with other drug companies, particularly in therapeutic areas,' he said. Glaxo closed 22 higher at 585p following heavy turnover of 11m. Other drugs companies were equally strong on the back of US buying, with Wellcome adding 24 at 618p, Zeneca climbing 19 to 727p and SmithKline Beecham rising 13 1/2 to 419 1/2 p.</p>

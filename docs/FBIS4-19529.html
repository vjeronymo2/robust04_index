			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["wff"-signed report: "Bonn Clearly Reprimands European </F> Parliament"]    [Text] Brussels -- The Federal Government seems to be very  concerned that the laboriously negotiated enlargement of the  European Union [EU] by Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden,  which has been promoted primarily by Bonn, could not be agreed  by the European Parliament [EP].    German diplomats in Brussels think that this could result in  a crisis within the EU. The mood in the Parliament does not  reflect reality, they said, referring to critical voices in the  Strasbourg assembly. There have even been voices saying that  German commitment to the European unification process could  decrease, if the European Parliament refuses its consent. The  Parliament must also ask itself whether, in the event of its  refusal, it will be granted additional rights during the  conference scheduled to discuss further improvements of the  Maastricht Treaty in 1996.    Without the approval of the European Parliament, which has  to  decide with the absolute majority of its 260 delegates,  accession agreements cannot come into force. The ratification  process will begin this week, with the EU Commission, the  Council, and the Parliament meeting to discuss enlargement and  the delegates addressing questions to the Commission and the  Council afterwards. The 700 pages of the agreements were only  presented to Parliament last week. The plenum will vote on them  during its last session in May, before a new parliament is  elected in mid-June.    Over the past few days, criticism within the European  Parliament has increased. It not only concerns the late  presentation of the texts, which makes assessment difficult for  the delegates, but also the compromise on the voting procedure  agreed to by the EU foreign ministers, which removed the last  obstacles for enlargement. For some delegates, such as the  French socialist, former Foreign Minister and EU Commissioner  Claude Cheysson, the Ionnania compromise on the voting procedure  is intolerable. Politicians of the European People's Party EVP  (Christian Democrats), such as Belgian Fernand Herman or French  Jean-Louis Bourlanges, pointed out that an agreement on  enlargement might be difficult to achieve after the compromise.    Guenter Rinsche, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union in the European Parliament, on the  other hand, said that the historic opportunity of EU enlargement  should not be missed. Also, he does not consider the compromise  on the voting procedure to be the best solution, because it can  make controlling the Community under exceptional circumstances  difficult. Klaus Haensch, deputy chairman of the Social  Democratic group, pointed out that the Parliament will make sure  that there is no loophole opened for the right of veto to return.</p>

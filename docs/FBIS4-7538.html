			<p>BFN     [Text] Neither Poland nor Russia can be moved to America.  We are forced to depend on each other. This is the title the  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has given to an interview with President  Lech Walesa.    [Correspondent Andrzej Siezeniewski] Speaking of the tasks  of  politicians in shaping bilateral relations, the Polish president  stressed that, in the first instance, they ought to remove  barriers and open opportunities for contacts for industrialists  and businessmen and constantly repeat to them: Gentlemen, it  will always be shorter from Moscow to Warsaw than to Washington.  That is why Poland is a better partner than the United States.    Asked whether his hopes of help from the West had been  fulfilled, Lech Walesa gave an unequivocally negative answer.  History proves, he stressed, that one cannot seriously count on  support from that direction. Apart from promises, we have  received nothing. The West does not understand what is  happening in our part of the world, said the Polish president.  It does not treat us as partners. It acts only when it sees  some profit in it for itself.    President Walesa spoke against dividing the world into  blocs.  The times when that was how things were are disappearing into  the past. For that reason, Poland or Ukraine will not be  playing the part of sanitary corridors separating the giants of  Europe: Russia and Germany.    Lech Walesa is also against the concentration of troops in,  for example, the Kaliningrad oblast. If we all say that we do  not see each other as enemies, why make such gestures,  underlined the Polish president.    It is his conviction that we should aim at building a system  of pan-European security, which would give all nations of the  continent equal guarantees of a peaceful life.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Observer: Marble halls True, the English could not be expected to go as far as the Irish, who are re-opening the disused public toilets near Dublin's Trinity College as an exhibition hall for two sculpted bronze urinals - one in the shape of Britain and the other of Ireland. But surely there's a case for granting public access to top people's toilets tantamount to works of art in their own right. There are several examples in the City of London alone. Word has it that the Bank of England harbours some sumptuous sanctums, especially for upper rankers. Moreover, the Midland Bank chairman's chamber is decked out with shoe-shine apparatus, three hairbrushes, comb, clothes brush, nail scissors and nail file. Nominations for others deserving tourist-attraction status welcomed.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE SEEKS STATE FUNDING FOR BIKE PATH AROUND MADRONA MARSH  </P> <P> In an effort to improve the appearance of Madrona Marsh, Torrance officials are  seeking state money to help pay for a tree-lined bicycle and jogging path  around the 42-acre nature preserve.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the City Council unanimously approved an application for a $427,000  grant from the State Department of Parks and Recreation. The total cost of the  path has not been determined.  </P> <P> The proposed path, varying in width from 8 to 20 feet, is expected to be  completed by next January if the city can raise the money, officials said.  </P> <P> Madrona Marsh, which is bounded by Sepulveda Boulevard, Madrona Avenue, Maple  Avenue and Plaza Del Amo, is a seasonal wetland used by about 140 species of  migratory birds, frogs, snakes and other small animals. It is one of the few  natural wetlands remaining in the South Bay.  </P> <P> The path, lined with trees, bushes and an irrigation system, would replace the  overgrown weeds and litter along the marsh's perimeter. "Right now it looks  like a big hole in the ground," said Parks and Recreation Director Gene  Barnett.  </P> <P> Barnett said a new fence would replace the deteriorating chain-link fence  surrounding the marsh. He said a new fence is needed to keep trespassers from  disturbing wildlife.  </P> <P> Mayor Katy Geissert agreed. "It will provide a buffer from the noise and  traffic" of the streets, she said in an interview.  </P> <P> The frontage along Sepulveda Boulevard already has a paved bike path, but it is  not landscaped or fitted for irrigation.  </P> <P> "We are happy that the city is applying for this (grant)," said Ken Gaugh,  president of Friends of Madrona Marsh, an environmental group that has worked  for more than a decade to preserve the marsh. "It will be better aesthetically  for the people."  </P> <P> "I'm tickled pink," said Shirley Turner, a longtime member of the group. "I  couldn't be happier."  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees.  </P> <P> "I think it stinks," said Sam Suitt, a former president and current member of  the preservation group. "It's a needless encroachment on the marsh."  </P> <P> Suitt said the proposed path will take away too much land from the sensitive  nature preserve. "A 4-foot-wide sidewalk would be sufficient," he said. "But  the whole point is to keep it as it is."  </P> <P> Barnett acknowledged that the path will encroach on some sensitive portions of  the marsh, but not substantially.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of degree," he said. "Frankly, I don't see it as a significant  impact on the marsh."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Builder Donated Land  </P> <P> Under a 1983 agreement between the city and the developers of Park Del Amo, a  massive residential and office project next to the marsh, the developer won the  right to build 1,482 residential units and 850,000 square feet of office space  in exchange for donating 34 1/2 acres of marshland and selling an additional 8  acres to the city.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, the developer also agreed to pay for a path along  Plaza Del Amo, Maple and Sepulveda. Barnett said the details have not been  settled.  </P> <P> Barnett said he is optimistic about getting the grant but that if the request  is rejected, the city will try for other state or federal money.  </P></p>

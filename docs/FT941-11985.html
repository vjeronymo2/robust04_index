			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks plan strategy Euro Disney's creditor banks will meet today in Paris to map out their strategy for the final stage of negotiations over a rescue package for the ailing leisure group. The banks, which include J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National Westminster, had hoped to discuss an audit of Euro Disney they have commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy company. However, KPMG has been unable to finalise its audit allegedly because of Euro Disney's reluctance to release information. It has prepared a preliminary report. The final audit is due for completion in two weeks. The banks have asked KPMG to analyse Euro Disney's financial position and its future requirements to verify information given to them by Disney at a meeting in November. The US group has tabled proposals to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.4bn) debt by raising FFr10bn through a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. Meanwhile, Adam, a French pressure group that represents minority shareholders, is lobbying for the convertible bond holders (who hold FFr4bn of Euro Disney's debt) to see the KPMG report and to be represented in the negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR LEAGUE THERAPY;  </P> <P> BREWER COACH TONY MUSER TENDS TO PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS AT BURN CENTER  </P> <P> During his playing career, they used to call him Talking Tony Muser. He was  non-stop fun, the butt of clubhouse jokes, the guy who always had a smile on  his face.  </P> <P> He's now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Muser, of Los  Alamitos, recently took three hours away from a pennant race to do something  that always came naturally -- make people smile. But this was different. It  wasn't a laughing matter, and nobody understood that better than Muser.  </P> <P> He was a visitor to the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key  Hospital. He was there to give, and receive, therapy.  </P> <P> Muser knows firsthand of the agony and depression of a burn unit. He knows  about skin grafts, hydrotherapy treatment, body scrubs and the seemingly  endless hours spent waiting for even a slight sign of improvement. He has been  there -- and he is a walking, talking example of the miracles that take place  in burn units every day.  </P> <P> On Feb. 27, 1986, Muser was severely injured in a natural gas explosion at the  Brewers' spring training complex in Arizona. He suffered second- and  third-degree burns over 55% of his body. He was delirious for more than a week,  incapacitated for four months and left with memories indelibly inscribed in his  mind.  </P> <P> That he is a major league coach made Muser a more recognizable visitor to the  hospital, but being able to identify with patients made him special.  </P> <P> "You have to hang in there," Muser repeated again and again. "It takes a lot of  hard work by a lot of good people, but you'll get better."  </P> <P> Within minutes, the visit was paying dividends. Muser spoke with Mike Lorenzo,  who is recovering from burns over 80% of his body. "We haven't seen him smile  like that since he's been here," physical therapist Linda French said.  </P> <P> Larry Lewis wasn't sure how long he had been at the burn center, only that he  knew his accident happened on a Sunday. "My memory fades in and out on me," he  said. But when he was introduced to Muser, Lewis' face lit up -- and he  remembered.  </P> <P> "Tony Muser, yeah," Lewis said. "You used to play first base for the Orioles."  It has been 12 years since Muser finished his three-year stint in a Baltimore  uniform.  </P> <P> In the pediatric unit, 14-year-old Kenwan Watts eagerly talked to Muser and  wanted to see his affected areas. Muser rolled up his sleeves to show where  skin grafts had been performed and discussed the procedures.  </P> <P> The patient visits provided a noticeable uplift, but it may have been during a  one-hour session with the weekly support group that Muser had the most impact.  </P> <P> He shared experiences with Bill Marshall, Mike Rose, Dennis Driscoll, Tom  Sparks and Andy Kraft, all of whom had to deal with personal burn-related  crises. Physical therapists Pat Prescott and French, occupational therapist  Diane Doyle and social worker Gerrie Stancik sat in on the discussion, along  with Nadine Weinstein, executive director of the Baltimore Regional Burn Center  Foundation, who arranged Muser's visit.  </P> <P> "What you have to understand," Muser said, "is that we're dealing with people  who really don't understand. You come to the conclusion that they're not going  to understand. People who have been burned are a special union."  </P> <P> Adjusting to the slow pace of recovery, Muser said, was the turning point of  his mental turnaround. "When you're hurt or sick, you're used to improvement  every day, where one day is better than the one before," he said. "I thought I  was a tough guy who could handle anything, but you don't know how tough you can  be until you go through something like this."  </P> <P> Muser recalled his impatience during the first weeks of his recovery, when he  actually thought he had plotted an escape from the hospital. "I had a plan for  my wife (Nancy) to bring a bike to the hospital and leave it outside," Muser  said. "Then when she'd come to visit, I'd have her wheel me up and down the  hall until nobody was watching, then we'd zip into the elevator, go downstairs,  get on the bike and leave.  </P> <P> "When she came the next day I asked her if she brought the bike. She didn't  know what I was talking about and I got mad. Here I had this great master plan,  which I had actually dreamed up, and she didn't bring the bike."  </P> <P> Gradually, Muser's desire to return to baseball began to dominate his mental  approach to rehabilitation. "Baseball had been such a big part of my life that  when it was taken away from me, and I didn't know if I could get it back, I was  in deep depression," he said. "I had to have a goal of getting back to what I  wanted to do."  </P> <P> Muser credits his recovery to the therapists who treated him, and the unique  relationship he developed with other patients.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I could have made it without those people and support groups,"  Muser said. "When we got together like this, we'd all start talking at the same  time -- and everybody knew what everybody else was saying.  </P> <P> "Another thing . . . I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I was a  macho baseball guy, Tony Muser, I thought I could do it all myself. Then you  find out how many friends you have.  </P> <P> "What happened is that a bad experience turned into a great love affair with a  lot of people. I like talking about it, because I have to talk about it. It's a  reminder (of the accident), but it's also a pick-me-up."  </P> <P> Muser was asked if he was bothered by recurring thoughts of his accident. "I  don't think about getting burned, but if I'm in a car and somebody else is  driving -- if that person is shaky, then I'm shaky, too," he said. "The same  thing about flying, especially at night. It seems like I dream about a plane  crash at least once a month. Those are situations over which I have no control.  </P> <P> "You can't see my physical scars unless I take my clothes off, but the mental  scars are still there."  </P> <P> Which is why a three-hour break from a pennant race was routine for Muser. He  met people he had never seen before, but with whom he shared a common bond.  </P> <P> When he was thanked for taking the time to visit, Muser replied, "You people  did more for me today than I did for you. What is time?"  </P> <P> At the Baltimore Regional Burn Center at Francis Scott Key Hospital that day,  time was worth a few smiles, something Tony Muser used to take for granted.  Now, he knows better.  </P></p>

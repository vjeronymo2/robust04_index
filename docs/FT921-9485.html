			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Company failures highlighted - Prime Minister's Questions MR ROBERT SHELDON (Lab, Ashton-under-Lyne), a former Treasury minister, highlighted the growing number of company failures in an attack on the government's mismanagement of the economy yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. In Commons' question-time exchanges he asked Mr John Major, the prime minister, if he had seen the three pages of advertisements in Tuesday's Financial Times by the receivers and administrators of failed companies. 'This exercise is repeated in the Financial Times three times every week,' he said. He told the prime minister that it was the government's failure which really needed to be brought to account. Mr Major replied that the 'essential basics' for getting the economy right included keeping inflation down, keeping interest rates down, having the right tax structure and maintaining the improvement in industrial relations attained in recent years.</p>

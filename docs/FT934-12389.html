			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / End to ITV company ownership rules could lead to a power struggle AN END to the ITV company ownership rules would lead to a power struggle of 'Scramble for Africa' proportions, the Independent Television Commission told MPs yesterday. It called for the moratorium on hostile takeovers and the ban on nine large ITV companies merging to be extended for at least a year. The moratorium, which effectively blocks foreign takeovers of ITV companies, is due to end by January, and the government is still considering the issue. Small ITV companies, such as HTV and Channel Television, told the Commons national heritage committee that they wanted even longer extensions of the restrictions, to give a period of stability.</p>

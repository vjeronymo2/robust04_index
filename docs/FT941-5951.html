			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Polish budget set to pass and release IMF loan Poland's awkward coalition government of farmers and former communists is set to win parliamentary approval tomorrow for a tight budget which restricts the 1994 deficit to 4.2 per cent of GDP. The budget, once approved, paves the way for a new IMF standby loan. The IMF's agreement is needed to trigger off the second and final stage of Poland's April 1991 debt reduction deal with the Paris Club of official creditors. The first stage, a 30 per cent reduction in the Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22.6bn) official debt in 1991, is to be followed by the final 20 per cent reduction at the end of this month. An outline agreement is also expected later this month on the rescheduling and reduction of Poland's Dollars 13bn debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors. The budget was tabled in parliament yesterday by the acting finance minister, Mr Henryk Chmeliak, a replacement for Mr Marek Borowski. Mr Borowski, from the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), last month lost a power struggle with Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, from the peasant party (PSL). The prime minister sacked Mr Borowski's deputy, Mr Stefan Kovalec, for mismanaging the privatisation of Bank Slaski, one of nine state-owned banks in the process of privatisation. The shares opened on the Warsaw stock exchange last month at 12 times the initial offer price. But few of the 800,000 new shareholders, apart from bank employees, had been able to register their shareholdings. Only registered shares could be sold at the artificially high market level. Mr Borowski protested that it was his prerogative to dismiss his deputy, not the prime minister's, and demanded further concentration of economic decision-making in his hands. The prime minister refused and accepted Mr Borowski's resignation. The ensuing political row between the coalition partners has been papered over and a new finance minister will be nominated after the budget is approved. The budget assumes a 4.5 per cent growth in GDP this year. It forecasts a 36 per cent rise in revenue to Zl 613,000bn (Pounds 19bn) and a 38 per cent increase in spending to Zl 696,000bn. Inflation, on an annualised basis, is expected to fall to 27 per cent from 36 per cent in 1993. The 1994 deficit of Zl 83,000bn (Dollars 3.8bn) is above last year's lower than expected Zl 53,000bn, 3.6 per cent of GDP, but was agreed only after strong lobbying from PSL and SLD deputies to increase spending on pensions, social services and agriculture. The Solidarity trade union, which mounted a protest strike by over 20,000 workers last month, is due to hold a general strike against the government on Monday. But the stoppage is not expected to have a significant impact, either economically or politically, with unemployment at 15.7 per cent and union strength concentrated in declining state industries and public services.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S INFLUENCE  </P> <P> In response to letters (Feb. 17) on Japan seeking world influence:  </P> <P> Some letter writers seem to have short memories, or don't know their history.  The war with Japan was the direct result of trade disagreements between our two  countries. The Japanese do not spend money on defense because they were  forbidden to do so by the United States after World War II. So, while they  became strong economically, we began to weaken because we spent our life's  blood on the military. What do we have to show for it? Nothing but trouble.  </P> <P> BETTY McGILL  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

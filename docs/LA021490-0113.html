			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> ATTACK PROMPTS CALL FOR STRICTER DOG LAW  </P> <P> Residents of a Westminster street on which a 6-year-old boy was mauled by two  Rottweilers asked the City Council on Tuesday night to write an ordinance  restricting vicious dogs.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Kerley was playing in front of the dog owners' home in the 7000 block  of 19th Street about two weeks ago when the two Rottweilers escaped from behind  a six-foot wooden fence and attacked him.  </P> <P> Jeffrey is now at home recovering from bite wounds to his arms, legs, abdomen,  back and buttocks, said his father, Noble Kerley.  </P> <P> "He's doing much better than I am," said Kerley, a manager at the Long Beach  Naval Shipyard. "I don't think there is any place in our society for these  kinds of dogs."  </P> <P> Kerley said his son required 75 stitches but is recovering and "is in good  spirits."  </P> <P> Photographs of Jeffrey's injuries were circulated to council members, who asked  the city staff to prepare a report on ways to strengthen the city's dog  ordinances.  </P> <P> "I was quite unnerved by those photos," said Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie. "Those  weren't just dog bites. That was a mauling."  </P> <P> Neighbors said dog owners need to be conscientious about keeping their dogs  secure and be legally responsible when they are delinquent.  </P> <P> "This was a senseless situation where the dogs weren't secure," said resident  Don Fuson. "It doesn't make any sense that a 6-year-old boy would be mauled by  not one, but two dogs."  </P> <P> Roger Ball, who also lives on the block, said he was concerned for the safety  of his children. "I have little boys, 3 and 5 years old," Ball said. "I'm  afraid to let them out now. It's tragic that someone would be so irresponsible  not to secure such vicious dogs."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Anita Huseth agreed that existing ordinances should be  strengthened. "I think the area that needs to be strengthened most are the  locks on the gates," Huseth said. "Kids tend to walk up to gates and try them  out."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer asked that the topic be placed on the agenda at  the next council meeting.  </P> <P> "We need to find out how we can strengthen our ordinances so that there's more  authority to control the situation," she said.  </P> <P> Kerley said he would not rule out the possibility of filing a lawsuit against  the dog owners. "That's yet to be determined, but something will happen," he  said. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / End of oil strike enhances Abacha's position The collapse of Nigeria's two-month oil industry strike, aimed at forcing an end to military rule has left Gen Sani Abacha's regime in a strong position and the civilian opposition in disarray. It has also left the political and economic problems underlying the recent crisis unsolved. When pro-democracy groups came together in June to challenge the authority of Gen Abacha, and secure the release of Chief Moshood Abiola, widely regarded as the winner of last year's annulled presidential election, his regime had yet to be tested. Now Nigerians can be in little doubt that their head of state responds to opposition with force and is offering a handover to civilian rule on his terms and in his own time. Nupeng, the blue collar oil workers union, and Pengassan, the senior staff association, saw themselves as the vanguard of a movement to restore civilian rule, but soon found themselves out on a limb. Damaging though it was, the oil strike was a long-term weapon in a campaign which had to be won quickly. Nigerian workers lack savings to sustain a long strike and there was a lack of political leadership to direct a protest capable of deposing a regime. The strike paralysed fuel distribution and the refineries and brought the commercial capital Lagos almost to a halt. In the oil fields in the east, output of crude oil, Nigeria's only big export, dropped within a fortnight by 20 per cent. But essential services such as water and electricity survived the crisis. Support for the strike was slow in coming from the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), which represents all the main unions. The general strike they called in July lasted less than two days. 'I feel let down by the NLC leaders. They made a lot of noise but came up with nothing,' said Mr Milton Dabibi, general secretary of Pengassan in Lagos yesterday after agreeing a communique with some of his branch leaders authorising a return to work today. Mr Dabibi admitted that the mass of the unions' members had had enough of the strike and that the government's tactics, which he described as 'brute force', had disrupted the leadership, with four branch leaders in the state-owned refineries and fuel distribution network under arrest for trying to carry on the strike. The army benefited as it took over distribution of scarce supplies of fuel, but in the big cities ordinary people suffered from the lack of transport and the closure of factories and banks. Divisions within the military over whether to appease or suppress the threat delayed the government's response until mid-August when Gen Abacha barred the national executives of Nupeng, Pengassan and the NLC from their posts, closed down the leading independent daily newspaper and arrested Nupeng's general secretary Mr Frank Kokori and several leaders of the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), which was the focus of civilian opposition in the south-west. A wave of attacks on the homes of prominent government critics in Lagos have been blamed by lawyers on the government. Although the allegations are unproven, the attacks increased the climate of fear. The government now has its own administrators in the unions and a partial lifting of the ban on political activity has allowed the largely anti-Abiola delegates at the constitutional conference in Abuja to start creating the nucleus of political parties ready for next year's polls. A purge at the highest levels of the armed forces and the public sector has placed Abacha loyalists in key posts. Mr Abiola is still in jail, needing hospital treatment according to doctors and Nadeco has proved to be a source of rhetoric but little action. By calling the opposition's bluff, the government will feel more secure than at any time since Mr Abiola re-launched his claims to the presidency. But the grievances felt by the Yoruba tribe in the south-west and the minorities in the oil-producing areas towards an increasingly rigid and northern dominated military regime are as deep as ever.</p>

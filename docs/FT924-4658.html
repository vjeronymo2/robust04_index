			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Plan for industrial park in China LIEM Sioe Liong, controller of Indonesia's biggest business group, is teaming up with Singapore government companies to develop an industrial park in China. The first phase, costing an estimated Dollars 190m, should be completed by early 1994. Mr Liem heads the Salim group, a conglomerate with an estimated annual turnover of more than Dollars 8bn. The group is involved in a range of activities, from cement to property. He will team up with two Singapore state companies, Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp and Jurong Environmental Engineering, to develop, supervise and market the industrial park. It is situated in Fujian province, on China's coast. Two of Singapore's biggest listed companies, United Industrial Corp (UIC) and its subsidiary, Singapore Land, are involved in the project. Also participating is Mr Wee Cho Yaw, head of United Overseas Bank (UOB), one of the island republic's top banks. Mr Liem has had a controlling stake in UIC since 1991. Earlier this year he sold a 9 per cent stake in UIC to the UOB. Mr Liem has been actively pursuing projects in several Asian countries and has a considerable financial presence in Singapore. Singapore has recently been urging its generally cash-rich companies to be more outward looking and invest overseas, particularly in China's fast-expanding economy. The Singapore government's Economic Development Board (EDB) said the Fujian province industrial park would attract light and medium industries from Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, as well as multinational corporations. The EDB added that the park would provide investors with a low-cost manufacturing centre for exports and a base for sales into China's growing domestic market.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA WEST TO OFFER DISCOUNT FARES TO BAY AREA;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE PHOENIX-BASED CARRIER WILL GO ALL OUT FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS WITH  A $79 TICKET FROM JOHN WAYNE TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> America West Airlines said Monday that it will enter the competition for  business travelers between Northern and Southern California with fares that  undercut by more than half the cheapest, unrestricted one-way flight between  Orange County and San Francisco  </P> <P> Starting Feb. 1, the airline will offer eight daily flights from John Wayne  Airport at a cost of $79 one-way for last-minute ticket purchases. The cheapest  unrestricted flight now between Orange County and the Bay Area is $168 one-way.  </P> <P> "We feel it's a business market and there are opportunities to attract  businessmen at $79," said Sherril Newton, manager of pricing for Phoenix-based  America West, a regional carrier known for its discount service.  </P> <P> The company also said it will match the $29, one-way restricted fare -- sold on  a limited number of seats usually to non-business consumers -- offered by the  other airlines that fly the route, which are USAir, United Airlines and its  commuter partner, United Express.  </P> <P> America West also announced a $79 unrestricted and $29 restricted one-way fare  between Long Beach and San Jose; currently only United Airlines flies that  route, offering an unrestricted fare one way of $142 and a restricted fare of  $46. The two daily flights from Long Beach begin Jan. 6.  </P> <P> America West's announcement could prompt a fare war at John Wayne, which has  traditionally had some of the highest ticket prices among Southland airports.  "We think that everybody else is going to match the fare," said Peter  Otradovec, planning manager for America West.  </P> <P> High fares at John Wayne have been attributed to noise and other restrictions  that have limited the number of flights and the high percentage of business  passengers, who are less cost-conscious than other consumers.  </P> <P> America West's decision to offer flights from Orange County to San Francisco  comes a month after American Airlines dropped five daily round-trip flights on  the route, saying its airplanes were not full enough to make the trips  profitable.  </P> <P> But Otradovec said the Orange County-San Francisco route should be a profitable  one for America West in the long run, although it may not be initially with  fuel prices as high as they are now,  </P> <P> "American is a very high-cost airlines compared to ours," Otradovec said. "We  have one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry because  we're new."  </P> <P> America West has been in business since 1983. The additional flights announced  by the company Monday will be the first it has started that do not include its  hub locations of Phoenix or Las Vegas. The airlines now has 12 flights a day  from Orange County to Phoenix and Las Vegas and is one of two airlines to have  a frequent flyer club in Orange County, Otradovec said.  </P> <P> Otradovec said America West is using 737-300 planes with a special  high-performance engine, called a CFM-B2. The engine is designed for a larger  plane, the 737-400, and lets the smaller plane gain altitude more quickly, he  said. Thus, the planes are higher when they pass noise monitors just outside of  John Wayne.  </P> <P> Fares between the Los Angeles basin and the Bay Area have been falling since  spring. No-frills Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, began flying between  Northern and Southern California in April with a $58 round-trip fare between  Oakland and Burbank. Before Southwest entered the Burbank-to-Oakland market,  fares were averaging $186. After the entry, the unrestricted one-way fare  dropped to $59.  </P></p>

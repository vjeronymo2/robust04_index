			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Employment data give lift to Dow Wall Street US stocks edged into positive territory yesterday after the bond market reacted to strong November employment data with surprising equanimity, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.96 ahead at 3,704.07, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure, was up 1.78 at 464.89. The American FE composite gained 2.47 to 466.32, while technology stocks helped lift the Nasdaq composite by 5.49 to 772.22. Trading volume on the NYSE was moderate at 268m shares. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,204 to 806. After a string of bullish economic news in recent days, investors' attention yesterday morning was riveted on the release of the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which proved to be much stronger than expected. The Commerce Department's index of leading indicators did nothing to undercut the impression of a bubbling economy. It showed a 0.5 per cent gain in October, compared with revised increases of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent for the previous two months. However, instead of a big sell-off in inflation-sensitive bonds, the 30-year government issue in late trading was  7/16 firmer at 100, to yield 6.244 per cent. At the short end, prices were unchanged. Nerves were steadied in part by a Market News Service report quoting Federal Reserve governor Edward Kelley as questioning whether the strong fourth-quarter growth rate was sustainable. In addition, the employment report may have contained a silver lining ' slow wage growth ' which mitigated any suggestion of mounting inflationary pressure. Retailing stocks were active for a second straight session. In heavy trading, The Limited slipped a further Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 in response to poor sales data released Thursday.

In its first day of trading, Pactel, the mobile communications arm of Pacific Telesis, climbed Dollars 2 1/2 above its opening price of Dollars 23. The parent company's stock was Dollars  1/4 ahead at Dollars 57 7/8 . Corning climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 7/8 and Dow Chemical added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 5/8 after a judge ruled the two companies were not liable for injuries in more than 3,000 federal cases involving silicone breast implants. Shaw, the largest US carpet manufacturer, dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 42 3/4 . Canada Toronto share prices ended slightly higher in moderate trading.

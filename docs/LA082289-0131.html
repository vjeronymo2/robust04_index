			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOOD SAMARITAN WAS JUST TOO DARNED GOOD  </P> <P> Bobbie Lynn Beal's escape plan depended on finding a sympathetic and helpful  motorist, according to Orange County sheriff's deputies. It went wrong Monday  when the motorist turned out to be entirely too helpful.  </P> <P> Beal, 21, a prisoner at the county honor farm in El Toro, was one of nine women  on a work gang cleaning up El Toro Park at Jeronimo Road and Los Alisos  Boulevard on Monday morning, authorities said. About 11:35 a.m. she bolted,  running northwest on Jeronimo away from the park, Sheriff's Department Lt. Bob  Rivas said.  </P> <P> Once out of sight of the work gang, Beal took off her blouse and, dressed in  jail jeans, tennis shoes and a bra, flagged down a passing motorist, Rivas  said.  </P> <P> Beal told the woman in the car that she had been attacked by a man and asked  the woman for a ride home so she could change clothes and report the attack.  The woman agreed to help out, Rivas said.  </P> <P> According to Rivas, the woman took Beal into her car and began to drive off  when she encountered what she thought was a stroke of good luck for Beal: a  sheriff's patrol car driving by in response to the report of the escape.  </P> <P> The woman leaped out of her car and flagged down the deputy, who recognized  Beal's clothing as standard jail issue, Rivas said.  </P> <P> Beal, who was serving time for "a lot of minor violations" and was scheduled  for release in November, was taken to Orange County Jail, where charges of  attempted escape were to be added to the list, Rivas said.  </P></p>

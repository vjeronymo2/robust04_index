			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic said he expected the Bosnian conflict to be settled by  war, in a statement Tuesday [1 February] to the Bosnian Serb  news agency SRNA.    "The international community is going to allow the conflict  to be settled by war, which means that the world will give  Moslems credit for land acquired through fighting. This same  principle should be adopted for the Serbs," he said.    The military headquarters for the self-proclaimed Serb  republic of Bosnia on Monday decided to mobilize "everyone able  to be mobilized, including women," in order to "end the war as  quickly as possible."    A reorganization of the army, as well as the introduction of  "stricter measures regarding deserters" were decided by the  chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army.    Karadzic, quoted by SRNA, said Bosnian Serbs' military goals  were to "modernize its army, increase its efficiency, ensure the  defense of our republic and vanquish our enemies."    This required "the entire nation to mobilize for work or  war," he said.    Bosnian Serb military commanders have repeatedly charged  that  the Moslem-majority Bosnian Government Army is preparing a  large-scale offensive for the spring.    The Bosnian Serb leader also repeated his opposition to  reopening the airport at Tuzla, the Moslem-controlled city in  northeastern Bosnia. "Any reopening of Tuzla airport is not  motivated by humanitarian reasons but by military reasons," he  said.    The stage for more fighting was set after the last attempt  to  negotiate a settlement to the Bosnian conflict, two days of  talks by the warring parties in Geneva last month, failed to  make any progress. European Community negotiator David Owen at  the time said the sides appeared to be gearing for new  offensives after the winter, after 21 months of war.</p>

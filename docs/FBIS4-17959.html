			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow 29 April ITAR-TASS -- Today's national  newspapers led with reports about the signing of memorandum on  civic peace in Moscow.    "Immense work has been done to draft the accord, taking into  account the interests of different sides," presidential council  member Aleksey Salmin wrote in the newspaper ROSSIISKIYE VESTI.  "It has not yielded a balanced result in every instance,  regrettably, and the text itself could do with more editing.  But the main thing is not what the end result of text work is  but what the accord is going to bring about, how it will work."  Salmin thinks that it is necessary to create a mechanism of  implementing the accord. "An important and necessary step has  been taken, but the most important thin lies ahead -- the  concept behind the idea of the document has yet to me  materialized."    "The great number of signatories is creating an illusion of  unity of the country's political forces," PRAVDA says in a  commentary. "But this is not really so. Not only the communists  and the Yabloko faction have refused to sign. The socialists,  democratic christians and a great number of trade unions  declined to sign. This should make the president think why."    "What we watched yesterday (during the ceremony of signing  of  the accord) was only the beginning of a complex and even painful  process of search for concord in Russia", the newspaper TRUD  said.    One other event is highlighted by many newspapers -- the  killing of a Duma deputy, Andrey Aizderdis. The newspaper  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes: "We would not like to dwell on  versions of the murder, for the motive for the crime by no means  reflects its substance. The substance is related to the reform  course against which no minister and no fine programmes of  combating crime can protect us. The redistribution of property,  the formation of a new elite are not amusing trifles, as the  ideologues of the course and their supporters would have us  believe. There are more contestants of room at the top of  Russia's new society than there is room for them. They are going  to compete tooth and nail."    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes a number of versions of the  murder of the State Duma deputy, including political  assassination, contract killing for economic reasons and mafia  revenge. "It is known that Aizderdis was the publisher of the  newspaper "KTO EST KTO" (WHO IS WHO) in Moscow's suburb of  Khimki. In one of its recent issues, the newspaper published a  list of "underworld leaders." The newspaper prefaced the  publication with a statement that it is "the first ever  publication of a near exhaustive list of criminal authorities,  which was not available to law enforcement operatives until now."    The newspaper TRUD said, citing sources in the Russian  Interior Ministry's chief directorate for combating organised  crime, that the murder was prompted by Andrey Aizderdis'  commercial and banking activity. According to ROSSISKIYE VESTI,  before his election to the State Duma, Aizderdis was MKD bank  president and headed a cooperative which built roads and  housing."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports on the work of the president's  security service. Commenting on former President Mikhail  Gorbachev's "unscheduled meetings with crowds," a presidential  security service member, Andrey Oligov, said "former members of  the Ninth Chief Directorate (the former KGB's personal security  department) know that "all unplanned sorties of Mikhail  Sergeevich to shake hands with common people were simply  stage-managed. Out in the street he would sometimes, without  being aware of the fact, talked with KGB agents who were  strategically placed in the right place at the right time."    PRAVDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav Kebich, head of  the Belarusian Government. The Belarusian premier said the only  way out of the crisis was "only through creating, in close  alliance with Russia, an effective model of the economy and fair  and just society."</p>

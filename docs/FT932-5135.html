			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / BBC Radio to seek tenders for shows BBC RADIO 4 plans to 'privatise' programmes such as Gardeners' Question Time and Feedback - the series that airs listeners' complaints. These are part of the first slice of Radio 4 programmes to be put out to tender to the independent production sector. A total of 150 hours of Radio 4 programmes will be on offer from April 1994. Proposals are being sought for comedy, history and travel programmes. Radio 3 also plans to take 200 hours a year from independent producers. BBC Radio is not required to offer a proportion of its output to independent producers as BBC Television is, but has decided to do so to bring in new people and fresh ideas. Mr Michael Green, controller of Radio 4, said yesterday: 'We're looking forward to the response from the independent sector and hope people will be excited by the possibilities now being offered.' The BBC said that, although Feedback would be produced independently from next year, it would continue to be presented by Mr Chris Dunkley, TV critic of the Financial Times.

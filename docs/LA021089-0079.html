			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH BUDGET PRIORITIES;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS REJECT MEDICARE CUTS, ACCUSE BUSH OF 'VOODOO ECONOMICS'  </P> <P> Pledges of bipartisanship began to crumble only minutes after President Bush's  speech to Congress Thursday night when Democratic leaders flatly rejected cuts  in Medicare payments or capital gains taxes and accused Bush of reviving  "voodoo economics."  </P> <P> Although House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) renewed his party's commitment to  cooperate with the new President in devising a budget, the strident tone of the  Democrats' official response to Bush's speech and budget proposals suggested  that America's politically divided government was returning to business as  usual after the heady first days of the new Administration.  </P> <P> "We'll give him our sincere cooperation," Wright said in a televised speech  after Bush's appearance before a joint session of Congress. "That does not mean  obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Desire on Social Causes  </P> <P> Democrats praised Bush's desire to tackle social causes such as improving  education and health care and combatting drug abuse, but they took the  President to task for failing to explain what other federal programs he would  cut to pay for these initiatives without additional taxes.  </P> <P> "I'd say it was a nice laundry list of problems, sure, but it doesn't really  speak to the central issue," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of  the House Budget and Appropriations committees. "Where does the money come from  to pay for all of this? It sounds like voodoo economics revisited to me."  </P> <P> "Voodoo economics" is a term first coined by Bush in 1980 to describe the  supply-side proposals of Ronald Reagan when both were seeking the GOP  presidential nomination.  </P> <P> "He's saying to Congress: 'It's your baby. The hard choices are yours,' " added  Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders viewed Bush's proposals to cut Medicare payments for the  elderly while trimming the capital gains taxes paid by the rich as evidence  that the so-called "flexible freeze" would be unfair. Wright emphasized that  such a strategy is unacceptable to Democrats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flexibility for the Rich  </P> <P> "We would have to reject any kind of 'flexible freeze' that would bend with  flexibility for the rich and powerful, but freeze out the middle-income  families of America," he said.  </P> <P> Wright was particularly emphatic in condemning Bush's proposal to trim the  growth in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. "We will oppose attempts  to cut Medicare," he said flatly.  </P> <P> At the same time, Democrats made it plain that congressional leaders are in no  mood to accept Bush's contention that a cut in capital gains taxes would  increase federal revenues by about $5 billion. Capital gains taxes are levied  on the sales of stocks or other investments.  </P> <P> Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  announced earlier in the day that he would "strongly resist" any changes in the  1986 Tax Reform Act -- "including the return to a preferential tax rate for  capital gains."  </P> <P> "I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a  higher tax than stockbrokers," he said.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said that cutting taxes would  be foolish at a time when revenues are in short supply. "When the most serious  problem we face is the budget deficit, it makes no sense to increase that  deficit by giving a huge tax break to the wealthiest Americans," he said.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski also called on Bush to drop his pledge for no new taxes and "put  everything on the table" in his budget negotiations with Congress. "Spending  cuts and revenue increases must be part of any meaningful compromise," he  emphasized.  </P> <P> He warned that it would be "a mistake to play a game of chicken" between  Congress and the White House that might risk putting automatic budget cuts into  effect under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction legislation.  </P> <P> Panetta said that he and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.)  would meet with Director Richard G. Darman of the White House Office of  Management and Budget early next week to get more details on what programs the  President wants to trim. Sasser, meanwhile, characterized Bush's approach as "a  hocus-pocus flexible freeze."  </P> <P> While pledging to cooperate with Bush's efforts to create "a kinder, gentler  America," Democrats were quick to note that they have long been recommending an  increased federal commitment to education and health programs. "That's old-time  Democratic religion," declared Wright. "We embrace it enthusiastically."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Education Effort Hit  </P> <P> Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education and  Labor Committee, criticized Bush's proposals on education as inadequate, noting  that the federal government is spending fewer real dollars on education now  than in 1980.  </P> <P> "Adjusted for inflation, Bush's down payment of about $300 million in  additional spending really amounts to more than a 4% reduction in current  educational services nationwide," he said. "It is just not enough to provide a  quality education to all the disadvantaged children who need and deserve one  today."  </P> <P> Hawkins said that education should be treated like defense, with an allowance  for inflation, which he said would give it a nearly 5% increase -- meaning an  extra $1 billion for schools. "After eight years of the defense build-up and  domestic cuts, Bush continues to feed the fat and starve the lean," he added.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce  subcommittee on health and environment, said that he was disappointed by the  President's proposed cuts in Medicare and what he viewed as an inadequate  commitment to finding a cure for AIDS. Nevertheless, Waxman credited Bush with  a kinder and gentler attitude toward the Medicaid program.  </P> <P> Likewise, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, praised Bush's approach on the defense budget, which Congress had  trimmed under Reagan. "A zero increase will be more than Reagan got over the  last three years," he noted.  </P> <P> And despite the criticism, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) predicted  that the spirit of bipartisanship would be revived once talks begin on a  compromise budget.  </P> <P> "The American people now expect action, not partisan reaction," he said. "Once  all the instant criticism dies down, even the critics will realize (that) the  President has the only budget plan in town. It's not the final answer; its a  starting point. So let's get started."  </P> <P> Staff writers Josh Getlin and Art Pine contributed to this story.  </P></p>

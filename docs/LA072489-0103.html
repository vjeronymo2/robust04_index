			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRYSLER MAY BE SET TO CUT WHITE-COLLAR WORK FORCE BY 10%  </P> <P> Industry analysts said today that Chrysler Corp. will soon announce a program  under which it will substantially reduce its number of white-collar workers to  raise profitability levels.  </P> <P> Sources said the cuts could affect as much as 10% of Chrysler's salaried work  force, which is now about 31,000 workers.  </P> <P> Although Chrysler declined to comment on the specifics of such a program,  company spokeswoman Karen Stewart hinted that an announcement could be made by  company Chairman Lee Iacocca on Thursday at a weekly meeting of top company  managers.  </P> <P> "Ongoing belt-tightening is simply a way of life at Chrysler as we look for  ways to reduce cost," Stewart said, calling any job reductions a "basic  competitive action" necessary because of incentive costs and increased industry  competition.  </P></p>

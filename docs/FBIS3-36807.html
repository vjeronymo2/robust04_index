Russia's Foreign Ministry, he noted, is drafting a statement  in connection with NATO's decision. He said he hopes that his  own "preliminary view" coincides with the content and tone of  the statement.    As Adamishin said, "if nothing changes, Russia will insist  on  convening the UN Security Council urgently in order to 'dot all  the i's' and return the role of peacekeeper to the UN, or press  for 'peace by force,' if all members of the Security Council  decide so." According to Russia's first deputy foreign minister,  this role cannot be transferred to NATO. "Other countries - our  partners - do not want to convene the Security Council for a  session," he complained.    According to Interfax's interviewee, Russia stands for  resolving the conflict in Bosnia as soon as possible. "Russia's  attitude to the acts of violence and massacre in Sarajevo's  market is as indignant as that of other countries. There is no  controversy in this. The only issue is how to gain the common  goal." he said.    Today the main problem is how to unblock Sarajevo,  demilitarize the city and place it under UN administration  temporarily, Adamishin said. "The Serbs are willing, before a  comprehensive solution is gained, to single out this question  and resolve it on the following basis - demilitarize Sarajevo  and place it under UN administration temporarily. Naturally,  this should relate to both sides: the Serbs and the Muslims," he  said.    According to the diplomat, NATO's ultimatum raises several  issues. "Why should NATO resolve settlement problems, in the  form of an ultimatum at that, and threaten to use military  methods? This belongs to the competence of the UN, not NATO,"  Adamishin said.    He disagreed with the arguments under which the UN  Secretary-  General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, "granted NATO the prerogative of  launching air strikes to unblock Sarajevo." "We do not agree  with such an interpretation, because it is wrong. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali asked NATO if it is prepared to make its aircraft  available, if such a need arises. However he never transferred  UN functions to NATO. This has to be sorted out," Adamishin  stressed.    He also called for considering how NATO's ultimatum will  affect the Geneva talks attended by spokesmen for all Bosnian  warring sides which began on Thursday. "How will the talks on  unblocking Sarajevo proceed, if the Muslims know that this  ultimatum is hanging over the Serbs, that they will have to  withdraw their artillery, if they do not want to run the risk of  being subjected to air strikes? It's clear that the Muslims  will have no great incentive for reaching agreements," the  diplomat said.    According to him, Bosnian Muslims "have already become  virtually the main obstacle on the road to settlement, since  they are preparing for military actions, and are waging military  actions, particularly with Croats." "They are trying to gain on  the battlefield what they failed to gain at the negotiating  table, though at the negotiating table they have gained more  than they would have gained by fighting. It is clear that  NATO's decision undermines the agreement that should be  implemented with the UN participation," Adamishin noted.    According to him, NATO's decision was motivated largely by  the public outcry caused by the heart-rending scenes in Sarajevo  shown on TV. "However, investigations into that affair have not  been concluded yet. In the meantime leaks from the UN office  indicate that the Serbs are not necessarily responsible for it.  There is no proof of their involvement," Adamishin said.    According to him, "there is an impression that NATO's  decision was taken under a scenario worked out by the U.S.,  France and some other countries, while other nations expressed  rather serious doubts on this score." "It's natural that we  shall contact the direct participants. President Boris Yeltsin  has already sent several messages to President Bill Clinton,  warning him against the use of military methods. They will not  only fail to lead to a political solution, but may considerably  aggravate the situation, make it chaotic, uncontrollable,"  Adamishin said.    In the near future the Russian president is to have  telephone  conversations with the leaders of Western countries, including  the U.S. and Germany.</p>

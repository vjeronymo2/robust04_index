			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Gloomy feelings persist at grassroots They may have cheered Mr John Major to the rafters. But yesterday, as the Tory conference representatives streamed out of Bournemouth, many had still not shaken off the cloud of depression that has dogged them all week. 'It's been a marvellous week and there have been some great speeches,' said Mr Bill Brum, a veteran Conservative party activist from Southend. 'But it hasn't made much difference. The party is still in the doldrums.' Throughout the week, the party has shown a decisive and determined face to the television cameras. Delegates have given cabinet ministers standing ovations. They have unfailingly passed the anodyne motions presented by organisers. They have denounced Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, for stealing Tory slogans. But as the glitz surrounding Mr Major's speech faded away, some were wondering how on earth the party could reduce Labour's 30-point lead in the polls. 'The divisions over the Maastricht Treaty weren't nearly as bad as what we have now,' said Mr Robert Halfon from Vauxhall in south London. 'This week everyone has been divided over everything: over tax, Europe, Ireland, you name it. And we have done little to resolve that.' Some feared the party had failed to meet the challenge posed by Mr Blair. 'If Blair can get the Clause 4 issue settled then he is well on the way to victory,' predicted Mrs Kathy Darroch from a constituency in south-east England. Others felt that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had failed to give a clear lead in the fight against crime. 'We needed a far more decisive move towards ID cards,' said one delegate. 'Without it, Labour can still challenge us on the crime issue.' There was plenty of confidence that it will all get better from here. 'One of the best things this week is that Jeremy Hanley saved his reputation as party chairman,' said Mr Robert White-Adams from Weston-super-Mare. But the overwhelming concern of campaigners was that this great annual jamboree would be followed by the grim task of drumming up local support in the constituencies. 'The conference is really a stitch-up,' said Mrs Maureen Mallet, from Maidenhead. 'The reality is that the party is coming apart at the roots. Getting supporters - especially young ones - is a near impossible task.'</p>

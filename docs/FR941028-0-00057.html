			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that State programs already have adequate appeals and notice procedures with respect to permit rescissions incident to improvidently issued permits, OSM believes that the proposed rules should impose little, if any, additional burden upon such States. Under the Act, OSM's responsibility is to establish minimum national standards which approved State programs are required to meet. Accordingly, individual State programs may exceed OSM's standards. A State which has such provisions may respond to any 732 letters OSM sends as a result of this rule by affirming that the State already interprets its program consistent with this Federal provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / New attacks threatened by Karadzic YUGOSLAV peace talks which opened yesterday in Geneva have been immediately undermined by a threat from Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, to launch a fresh offensive throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina. The threat came as an Italian aid aircraft crashed in unknown circumstances, apparently killing all four crew, close to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. It was carrying blankets from the port of Split in Croatia to the capital's besieged inhabitants. All relief flights to Sarajevo were suspended. Mr Karadzic, in a letter to Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said he was drawing up plans to 'stop by force' the flow of weapons to Bosnia's government forces. Bosnian Serbs have accused the international community of supplying the arms. 'I am told that we will face a strategic dilemma within days which will require us to use force to halt the illegal supply of weapons if the international community will not act,' he said. Mr Major's office said it would be drafting a reply 'over the next few days'. The letter stems from recent developments in the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde, which Serb forces had besieged for four months. The siege was lifted last Sunday after Serb forces started to withdraw under instructions from Mr Karadzic. As they did so, forces loyal to the Bosnian government rapidly moved to regain lost territory. Local Serb commanders immediately accused the United Nations of supplying weapons to largely Moslem forces in Gorazde, after a convoy had managed to reach the besieged city late last month. The UN has consistently played an impartial role in its peace-keeping efforts in Bosnia. A Serb commander said at the time that his forces would not make the same mistake again, implying that the UN was partial, and indicating that the Serbs would not be prepared to lift sieges of any other towns or cities in Bosnia. Mr Karadzic's letter clearly reflects the pressures weighing on Serb forces. 'Every measure and sanction against the government of President Alija Izetbegovic (of Bosnia) to halt this escalation must be taken,' Mr Karadzic warned. Since Bosnia's independence was recognised last April, Serb forces have been able to capture more than 70 per cent of Bosnia because they are backed by the Yugoslav federal army. For its part, the Bosnian government has been unable to defend itself because it has not been exempted from the UN arms embargo. Reuter adds: Rescue teams last night reached the site of the crashed Italian relief aircraft, a UN refugee spokesman said in Zagreb. 'Pieces of aircraft are scattered all around.' A French armoured personnel carrier from Sarajevo and a US Chinook helicopter had reached the site near Jasenik in mountains west of Sarajevo. Another six armoured vehicles are heading for the site. While the cause of the crash was still unknown, a UN spokesman in New York said no military activity had been reported in the area at the time the aircraft disappeared from radar screens.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Lecturers lift strike action More than 800 lecturers have suspended strike action at Sheffield College, the country's largest further education college, because of progress in talks with their employer over 'flexible' local contracts. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, has withheld Pounds 50m from college budgets until the new contracts are introduced. The government believes the contracts are necessary to ensure flexible training courses. Members of the Natfhe lecturers' union at Sheffield College had planned to strike for five days. However, strike action was suspended on the fourth day. A joint statement from management and the union said it was planned to reach an agreement for all academic staff from August.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: Charmless Like many UK businessmen schooled in Britain's 1960s car industry, GrandMet's Sir Allen Sheppard speaks his mind with scant regard for delicacies. Even so his minders must have winced at his explanation at yesterday's CBI corporate governance conference of why he doesn't have any women on his board. Sir Allen said he would dearly love to appoint a woman with the qualities of Sir John Harvey-Jones or Sir Dick Giordano, two of his most famous non-executives. But any woman seeking to match them 'would have to have an operation.' His audience, liberally sprinkled with women, didn't entirely see the joke.</p>

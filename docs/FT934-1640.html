			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman returns to profit Sutcliffe Speakman, the activated carbon technology and environmental protection systems group, returned to profit in the six months to September 30 with Pounds 361,000 pre-tax. This compared with a deficit of Pounds 560,000 in the comparable six months and with a total loss of Pounds 6.56m for the whole of 1992-93 - the first year under the new board - which was arrived at after Pounds 5.83m restructuring costs. The shares rose 5p to 54p. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the result represented a milestone in the group's recovery. With the balance sheet ungeared following the July rights issue which eliminated borrowings of Pounds 6.09m and the restructuring he said that the group was seeing a strong recovery at the operating level. Turnover from continuing businesses was Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.91m). The profit was struck after provision of Pounds 576,000 for losses on operations to be discontinued. Earnings per share were 0.38p (2.06p losses). Mr Buckley said that the preference dividend due on December 31 cannot legally be paid because the company will not have sufficient distributable profits. Publication of the report and accounts for 1993-94 will be the earliest opportunity for any resumption of preference dividends. Mr Buckley said that following progress made on the relocation of the group's operations and the improvement in profits in the current year, particularly in the second half to date, the resumption of ordinary dividends will also be reviewed when the accounts are published.</p>

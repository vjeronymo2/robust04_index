He said an Australian energy mission will visit Manila in  May  to coincide with the first meeting of the proposed joint working  group on energy.    "We expect it (mission) to find a lot of trade opportunities  for Australia... and provide opportunities for the Philippines  to take initiatives to resolve its energy situation," McMullan  told reporters at the airport before leaving Manila on Saturday  [19 March].    The trade official arrived on Thursday as part of a tour of  member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and is to visit Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.    Australia had been helping the Philippines in the oil  exploration field.    Only recently, the Australian Government financed the survey  work on several prospective oil-bearing structures in the  Philippines .    The first report on the results of the survey was released  last month and pointed to the areas where oil reserves could  have accumulated over the years.    The drilling season is set to start next month and several  local and foreign oil exploration companies will be searching  for oil in offshore Palawan, Mindoro, and the Sulu Sea.    The Philippines depends on imported crude. Recent oil  discoveries have helped cut these imports. One of the country's  biggest oil strikes, the Linapacan oil field off Palawan,  initially produced at least 15,000 barrels a day until water  started to seep into the pipe.    Two foreign firms -- Shell Exploration and Occidental  Petroleum -- are working on the development of a much bigger oil  structure called the Malampaya field. This structure contains a  sizable amount of natural gas and crude oil.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / OECD meets in effort to fight bribery Senior officials from the 24 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are to meet in Paris today and tomorrow to seek common guidelines for clamping down on bribery and corruption. The industrialised OECD countries agree on the importance of stopping bribery, as a way to improve governance in developing nations, but they remain far apart on how binding a set of rules to adopt. An OECD working group on illicit payments has produced a report containing a list of possible anti-corruption measures. But the US and other countries are at odds over the extent to which the OECD's recommendations should be a fixed menu which members should adopt or a list from which they may select measures. The US will make another effort at the meeting this week for the recommendation to be as binding as possible, requiring OECD members to make bribery of another country's officials a criminal offence, and for it to ensure that companies be not allowed to treat bribes paid abroad as tax-deductible. US officials are also seeking to establish a re-view mechanism to monitor each country's implementation of the recommendations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 makes the US the only country so far to have criminalised bribery of another country's officials. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has complained that US companies are losing vast sums because their competitors can win contracts by bribery. Other OECD countries, however, have legal and constitutional concerns about extending their criminal laws to offences in another country. US officials point out that the UK, for example, had no such qualms in the 19th century about making it a crime for any British citizen to engage in the slave trade. In modern times, Germany has moved against its citizens' involvement in child pornography in Sri Lanka. Some other countries, however, see a closer parallel in the controversial US efforts to extend the reach of its environmental laws, for example by its ban on the import of tuna caught in drift nets. The ban was condemned by a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If agreement can be reached this week, an OECD recommendation could be adopted this spring; if not, the argument may spill into the OECD ministerial meeting in June.</p>

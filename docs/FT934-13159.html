			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa hit five-year high Cocoa prices at the London Commodity Exchange touched the highest levels for more than five years yesterday, with the March futures position peaking at Pounds 991 a tonne, writes Richard Mooney. Most of the gain was surrendered, however, and the price closed at Pounds 975, up just Pounds 7 on the day. As the market was rising dealers suggested to the Reuter news agency that it had ended its recent 'correction' phase and resumed an uptrend based on impending supply deficits and supported by a bullish chart formation. Concern over the state of health of Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny was also a background market factor, they added. The Ivory Coast is the biggest cocoa producer. Confidence appeared weaken with the later retreat, however. 'I don't think it has sufficiently broken the recent high at Pounds 983 to warrant short-term optimism,' one trader said. 'It must be looking to consolidate now for a while.' The retracement began after the New York market failed to sustain its firm opening trend. The technical picture was still good, traders said. but New York's unwillingness to continue the uptrend had sapped the strength of London's rally.</p>

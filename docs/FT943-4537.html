			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: NFC committed to value added business NFC insisted yesterday that there was no management interregnum at the UK's largest transport and logistics group, in spite of the sudden resignation last month of its chief executive, Mr Peter Sherlock, after only 18 months in the job. Mr James Watson, chairman, said the group remained committed to its strategy of focusing on higher value added business, such as logistics and moving services, rather than routine transportation. He said: 'We still have the same opportunities. In fact, I have been a little disappointed about the limited speed of change so far.' A new chief executive would be appointed as soon as possible. Both internal and external candidates would be considered for the post. The leading internal candidate is Mr Robbie Burns. In May, Mr Burns resigned after 23 years with NFC, but rescinded his decision when Mr Sherlock left. Mr Watson has increased his executive role and NFC yesterday spelled out the responsibilities of its management committee, which is being chaired by Mr Trevor Larman, finance director. Mr Sherlock had 15 operational executives reporting directly to him, and the group was anxious to clarify its lines of control. Mr Burns will have direct responsibility for all logistics operation in the UK and will chair the two logistics companies in North America, while Mr Graham Roberts has assumed main board responsibilities for logistics in mainland Europe. Mr Larman will also chair the two main moving businesses, Allied Van Lines in North America and Allied Pickfords Europe. Mr Dennis Olliver will continue his responsibilities for Lynx, the parcels business. NFC confirmed that it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 76.8m in the 40 weeks to July 9. This compared with Pounds 116.3m in the corresponding period, which included an exceptional Pounds 50m profit on the disposal of its waste management business. Stripping out exceptionals, pre-tax profits rose by 23 per cent. Revenue from transport and logistics in the UK was marginally down at Pounds 631m, with operating profit slightly ahead at Pounds 45.2m. Earnings before exceptional items were 8.8p (8.2p). A third interim dividend of 1.6p brings payments for the year so far to 4.5p, an increase of 6.6 per cent.</p>

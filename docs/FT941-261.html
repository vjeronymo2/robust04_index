			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (14): Unravelling the spaghetti - Joint venture profile / Lucas and TVS Management at Lucas-TVS used to call the inefficient production floor at the automotive parts plant on the outskirts of Madras 'spaghetti junction'. This reference to the tangle of motorway overpasses in Birmingham, the home of Lucas Industries, is one of the many cultural legacies left by the expatriate staff of the automotive, aerospace and industrial systems group, during the 30 year life of the Lucas-TVS joint venture. The plant today has a tight production system, is largely automated and is poised to face the challenges thrown open by the Indian Government's industrial liberalisation plans. The venture with TVS, one of India's 20 biggest industrial conglomerates, stands out as an example of industrial co-operation which has endured the political uncertainty that has sent many foreign companies packing from India. Mr K. Seshadri, the executive director, speaks in glowing terms of the assistance and direction that Lucas has lent the company as it has grown through the production of principally starter motors, alternators and dynamos. 'It's good to be exposed to fresh ideas,' he says. 'Englishmen have a different way of looking at things and the company has benefited from this objectivity.' He makes special mention of Mr Ron Flint, one of nine joint managing directors from Lucas during the history of the company. He, in the decade before his retirement last year, helped oversee a growth in sales from about Dollars 10m to Pounds 42m. This expansion rests heavily on the arrival in the Indian market of the Maruti Suzuki, the country's first small car for the urban middle class. Lucas-TVS used its established position as a producer of dynamos for the Ambassador range of cars to capture the lion's share of the market for the new car's starter motor and alternator needs. Lucas-TVS saw off a challenge from a joint venture between SRF, a diversified Indian industrial group, and Nippon Denso, the Japanese components company, for this new market. SRF, as it is known, was established in the mid-1980s but the combination of high tariffs and an appreciating yen against the rupee made its trading conditions difficult. Lucas-TVS developed out of a desire by both partners to extend and diversify their existing operations. Lucas had, for 30 years prior to the establishment of the joint venture distributed its home grown products through a broad geographic dealer network in India while TVS had developed from a small family concern into a national trucking and bus business. Their union put the venture at the forefront the country's fledgling automotive industry which was being buffeted by government interference. The present shareholding structure is evidence of the wish by successive governments to have a firm grip on the industry. The government still indirectly holds 14 per cent as a result of a decision by New Delhi in the 1960s to force Lucas to cut its stake from 60 per cent to 51 per cent and TVS to lower its holding from 40 per cent to 34 per cent. Day to day management has been progressively handed to a local team. Following the retirement of Mr Flint there are no Lucas staff at the site. At its peak there were more that 20 British expatriate employees. There is no plan to appoint a Lucas representative as a joint managing director. 'We have a very strong Indian management team,' says a Lucas spokesman in London. 'We are confident and happy to let the present management run the business.' Mr T K Balaji, who is the sole managing director, speaks about the need to push firmly ahead with automation to counter possible challenges to Lucas-TVS's controlling position in its prime market. In a reference to the possibility of foreign imports which may come from lower import tariffs, he says it is no longer sufficient for the company to rely on its cheap labour costs to provide a competitive advantage. The impact of greater automation at the plant has already been felt. After a decade of steady growth to 3,100 employees in 1988, the number has fallen to 3,000. Highlighting the rise in productivity already achieved, sales in 1988 were only Pounds 18.7m, less than half last year's figure. 'We must automate more and we are talking to many people about this,' Mr Balaji says. Discussions have been initiated with Japanese companies about possible collaboration and Nippon Denso is one of the groups understood to have been involved. The managing director is guarded about his development plans but he stresses the need to expand into diesel fuel injection systems. Mico, in which Robert Bosch of Germany is the biggest shareholder, is the main participant in the Indian market for this component. Lucas-TVS has been looking enviously at the returns the German-led venture has been achieving and believes that a drive into this expanding area is important for longer-term prosperity. Lucas will feature heavily in any decision but will probably approach it with a good deal more optimism about the future than at any time in the past 30 years.</p>

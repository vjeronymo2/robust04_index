			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IN SRI LANKA, STRIFE IN THE VILLAGE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN  </P> <P> Tucked away among palm trees and fertile rice fields, the village of Saddam  Hussein stands as a grim reminder of the bloody violence sweeping the Tamil and  Muslim communities of eastern Sri Lanka.  </P> <P> Six hundred families once lived in Saddam Hussein village, built in 1982 with  funds from the Iraqi government and named after its president.  </P> <P> Today, its dusty streets and houses are deserted. Its population fled after  they were chased away by the Tamil Tiger guerrillas, who are fighting the Sri  Lankan government for an independent homeland.  </P> <P> Crowded into refugee camps, the angry Muslims claim that the man their village  is named after gives them the inspiration for their jihad (holy war) against  the Tamils.  </P> <P> "We have had enough of the Tamils," says Muhammad Rashif, a former resident of  the village. "We are fighting to make Islam strong once again."  </P> <P> Gun battles between armed Muslims and Tamil guerrillas take place daily as the  two sides carry out a series of reprisal attacks. The predominantly Hindu  Tamils are abducted if they venture into Muslim areas. The Muslims, many of  whom are farmers, are shot if they stray into Tamil territory. Muslim youths  have also formed clandestine hit squads to carry out attacks.  </P> <P> The result is the emergence of an ethnic apartheid with the two communities  estranged and polarized.  </P> <P> Violence between the two communities first flared last August, after 300  Muslims were killed in a series of massacres by suspected Tamil Tigers.  </P> <P> Muslims have traditionally made up a nonpolitical, prosperous business  community and have not been involved in Sri Lanka's ethnic politics. But the  massacres sparked a new-found militancy among Sri Lanka's Muslims, which is  drawing much of its strength from the worldwide growth in Islamic  fundamentalism and the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "Saddam is our hero. He is fighting for Islam and we look to his example," says  Faroq Talfiq, a teacher in the Muslim town of Eravur in eastern Sri Lanka.  </P> <P> The violence also marks a significant shift in Sri Lanka's ethnic crisis.  Muslims and Tamils have always lived side by side in eastern parts of the  island, where Muslims, who are the descendants of Arab traders, make up 35% of  the 1.2-million population.  </P> <P> As the violence between Muslims and Tamils escalates, leaders of the Muslim  community have already begun asking for regional autonomy for their people.  </P></p>

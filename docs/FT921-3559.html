			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Computing services seek EC influence EUROPE'S leading computing services companies have joined forces in an attempt to influence the way the European Commission distributes research contracts for information technology projects. They have formed an informal association, known as the Group of Six, with the aim of counterbalancing the influence of the main hardware manufacturers whose views and advice have traditionally weighed heavily with the Commission. The hardware manufacturers, including Groupe Bull of France, Siemens of Germany and Olivetti of Italy, are known as the Group of Twelve. Their advice is automatically sought by the Commission on important community research projects including Esprit and Race. Members of the six are Sema Group of the UK/France, Logica of the UK, CGS of France, Finsiel of Italy, Eritel of Spain, Debis of Germany and Volmac of Holland. CGS and Debis are part of the same group. The computing services industry covers a range of activities including software development, processing and facilities management. It has always taken second place to hardware manufacture in revenue terms, but has assumed a new importance as profit margins have declined. Mr Phillipe Dreyfus of Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computing services company, is chairman of the year-old group, which, he insists, is not a consortium formed to fight for contracts but an advisory body to give the computing services industry a European voice. The problem had been, he said, that the industry comprised several thousand small companies with no clear focus. The answer had been to limit membership of the Group of Six to one company per country. Others argue, however, that the intention of the group is to secure a larger share of community funds for its members.</p>

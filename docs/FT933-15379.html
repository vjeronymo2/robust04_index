			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Hyundai peace talks resume Workers at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, resumed partial walkouts yesterday after staging a one-day general strike as negotiations began again between labour and management over a pay agreement, writes John Burton from Seoul. But the Hyundai trade unions warned industrial action could escalate again if the government intervened with a show of force. The South Korean government indicated it would not prosecute trade union officials for the illegal strike action if they displayed flexibility in negotiating with Hyundai.</p>

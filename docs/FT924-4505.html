			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Harrison-Mee launches new generation of commuter trains for Kent Mr Geoff Harrison-Mee, director of the south-east division of Network SouthEast and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday launching a new generation of commuter trains for Kent, Richard Tomkins writes. They visited the cab of one of the trains at London's Cannon Street station, which is reflected in the windscreen. The Networker trains are made by ABB Transportation (formerly Brel) and GEC Alsthom. Network SouthEast rejected complaints from some passengers that the Networkers were cramped and uncomfortable. 'Some people would complain if you gave them a Rolls-Royce,' it said.

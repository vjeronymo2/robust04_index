Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from February 5, 1994, through February 17, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7685). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By April 1, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos.

This WCAP, which specifically covers the Catawba Nuclear station, has been deemed an acceptable reference by the NRC for use in making plant-specific licensing submittals. Additional Catawba-specific information/ improvements and analyses, as required by the WCAP and associated NRC safety evaluation, have been either completed or committed to, thereby ensuring that the WCAP/SE conclusion that removal of the RHR ACI produces a net safety benefit remains valid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The deletion of the RHR ACI was analyzed in the WCAP for Callaway Nuclear Station in terms of (1) the frequency of an interfacing LOCA, (2) the availability of the RHR system, and (3) the effect on overpressure transients. Callaway is the WCAP's reference plant for Catawba Units 1 and 2, and a Catawba-specific Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) review of the WCAP determined that removal of the ND ACI at Catawba will not invalidate the basic conclusions of the WCAP. Consequently, the following information from the Callaway analysis is considered applicable to Catawba Units 1 and 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the removal of the ACI and addition of a control room alarm, the probabilistic risk analysis predicts a decrease in the frequency of interfacing LOCAs from 1.52E-06/year to 1.16E-06/year, a decrease of approximately 24%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The availability of the RHR system was analyzed in three phases: initiation, short term cooling, and long term cooling. The probabilistic analysis indicated that deletion of the RHR ACI has no impact on the failure probability for RHR initiation. During short term cooling (72 hours after initiation), RHR ACI deletion decreased the RHR failure probability by 12%, from 1.64E-02 to 1.44E-02. The long term cooling RHR failure probability was calculated to decrease by 70%, from 3.91E-02 to 1.17E-02. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D of the WCAP presents the analysis used to determine the effect of removal of the ACI on overpressurization transients. The analysis categorizes the types of initiating events, determines their frequency of occurrence, and then identifies the consequences of these occurrences both with and without the ACI feature. The result is a list of overpressure consequence categories with associated failure probabilities (reference the WCAP's Appendix D, Tables D-14, -15, and -16). For the charging/safety injection event, consequence frequencies increased on the order of 1.0E-12/shutdown year. This is an insignificant increase, as the overall consequence frequency of the charging/safety injection event is 1.25E-01. Likewise, for the letdown isolation with RHR system operable case, one frequency category was increased on the order of 1.0E-15. Again, this is insignificant when compared with the total frequency of these events of 1.25E-01. For the letdown isolation with RHR system isolated event, the overall consequence frequency was reduced from 4.45E-01 to 2.22E-01. This occurs because many spurious closures of the RHR isolation valves cause the isolation of letdown. Removing the RHR ACI reduces the frequency of this event by approximately 50%. It is concluded that the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry has an insignificant impact on the frequency of overpressurization events at Callaway (and thus Catawba) Nuclear Station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The effect of an overpressure transient at cold shutdown conditions will not be altered by removal of the ND ACI function. With or without the ACI function, the ND system could be subject to overpressrue for which the ND relief valves must be relied upon to limit pressure to within ND design parameters. While it is true that the ACI initiates an automatic closure of the ND suction/isolation valves on high NC system pressure, overpressure protection of the ND system is provided by the ND system relief valves and not by the suction/isolation valves that isolate the ND system from the NC system. (Refer to NUREG-0954, ``Safety Evaluation Report related to the operation of Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2,'' Section 5.4.4.3.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the ACI feature is to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when the plant is at normal operating conditions (i.e., heated and pressurized) and not in the ND cooling mode. Thus, the ACI feature serves to preclude conditions that could lead to a LOCA outside of containment due to operator error. The safety function of the ACI is not to isolate the ND system from the NC system when the ND system is operating in the decay heat removal mode. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several methods to ensure that there is a double barrier between the ND system and the NC system when the plant is at normal operating conditions. First, plant operating procedures instruct the operators to isolate the ND system during plant heatup. Second, the alarm that will be installed as part of this change will annunciate in the control room given an open or intermediate valve position signal in conjunction with a high NC pressure signal. This alarm will alert operators that any of the four suction/isolation valves is (are) not fully closed and that double isolation has not been achieved. In conjunction with this alarm, operators will be trained using an annunciator response procedure to ensure that they act to restore double isolation or return to a safe shutdown condition. Third, the Open Permissive Interlock (OPI), which is not being removed, will prevent the opening of the valves whenever NC system pressure is greater than 385.5 psig. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since relief valves prevent overpressurization of the ND system during shutdown conditions and since several methods are in place to ensure that the ND system is isolated from the NC system during normal plant conditions, removal of the ACI will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The ND ACI function is not a consideration in a margin of safety in the basis for any technical specification. Since the probabilistic analysis of the WCAP for Callaway (which is applicable to Catawba as discussed above) indicates that the availability of the RHR system is increased with the removal of the ACI, overall safety will be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, similar amendments for other Westinghouse plants in the past have been determined to not involve significant hazards considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such testing. The licensee stated that this proposed change is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and NUREG-1433, ``Improved Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be manually started and operated at rated load for a minimum time of one hour immediately and once per week thereafter in the event any diesel-generator becomes inoperable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Niagara Mohawk proposes to revise Technical Specification 4.6.3.e such that if a diesel-generator is declared inoperable due to preplanned maintenance or testing or due to a support system being inoperable, redundant diesel-generator testing would not be required. Declaring a diesel-generator inoperable due to preplanned maintenance or testing or due to a support system being inoperable does not affect the reliability of the operable diesel-generator nor does it in any way imply that a common cause failure exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The normally required Technical Specification surveillance testing schedule demonstrates acceptable reliability and assures that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended safety function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to permit an operator to evaluate a diesel-generator failure to determine if a common cause failure exists before requiring testing of the redundant diesel-generator. As noted above, the intent of the additional diesel-generator testing is, in part, to determine if a common cause failure exists. Once the potential for a common cause failure has been examined and dismissed, testing beyond the normal surveillance schedule is excessive and does not contribute to improved diesel-generator reliability. Within eight (8) hours, the determination that no common cause failure exists is required to be completed or the operable diesel-generator will be tested. Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be operated at rated load (i.e., connected to offsite power) to demonstrate its operability in the event any diesel-generator becomes inoperable. As indicated in Information Notice 84-69, when a diesel-generator is operated connected to offsite or non-vital loads, the emergency power system is not independent of disturbances on the non-vital and offsite power systems. Therefore, diesel-generator availability is potentially lessened by a demonstration of operability requiring connection of the diesel-generator to offsite power sources. At a time when at least one diesel-generator is already inoperable, this Surveillance Requirement could add further risk to losing the remaining operable diesel-generator. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes that Surveillance Requirement 4.6.3.e be changed such that a diesel-generator does not have to be operated at rated load. These changes will preclude offsite power source disturbances from affecting diesel-generator reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be started immediately in the event a diesel-generator becomes inoperable. The requirement to immediately test a diesel-generator is overly burdensome when compared to more recent diesel-generator Technical Specification requirements. As previously discussed, Niagara Mohawk proposes to add wording to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e to give an operator eight (8) hours to determine whether a common cause failure exists or to test the operable diesel-generator when a diesel-generator is declared inoperable for a reason other than an inoperable support system or preplanned maintenance or testing. Eight (8) hours is consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing Technical Specification 4.6.3.e requires that the operable diesel-generator be tested immediately and once per week thereafter. Technical Specification 3.6.3.c requires that an inoperable diesel-generator be returned to an operable condition within seven (7) days to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation. Therefore, the requirement to test the operable diesel-generator ``once a week thereafter'' is not applicable. In addition, testing the operable diesel-generator one time is adequate to confirm operability of a diesel-generator. Repetitive testing following initial confirmation of operability is unwarranted. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes to delete the requirement to test the operable diesel-generator weekly following the initial test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the proposed change does not affect the design or performance of the diesel-generators nor adversely affect the reliability of the diesel-generators, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated (i.e., Station Blackout analyses). Because this change does not affect the probability of accident precursors, the proposed change does not affect the probability of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e does not introduce any new operating configurations or new accident precursors and does not involve any physical alterations to plant configurations which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The proposed change does not affect the design or performance characteristics of the diesel-generators nor does the change create the possibility of the loss of both diesel-generators because common cause failure assessments will be performed. The change will delete excessive diesel-generator testing and therefore increase overall plant safety by increasing diesel-generator reliability. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 4.6.3.e will not reduce the number of emergency power sources required by Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.3 or affect the normal surveillance requirements as described in Technical Specification 4.6.3. The normal surveillance tests demonstrate acceptable reliability and assure that the operable diesel-generator is capable of performing its intended function. The proposed change to delete the excessive testing requirements does not affect the design or performance of any diesel-generator and does not adversely affect diesel-generator reliability. Eliminating unnecessary testing will potentially increase diesel-generator reliability by reducing the stresses caused by such testing.

Operator protection is established via the donning of protective breathing equipment. The capability to manually isolate the control room with dampers is retained. The ability of the operators to cope with a chlorine toxic gas hazard remains consistent with the protection measures available for other toxic chemicals stored onsite, stored in the vicinity of the site, or transported near the plant site.

The basis of the chlorine detectors and associated Technical Specifications is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated to be of extremely low probability (a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine within five miles of the plant), therefore removal of the chlorine detectors from the plant design and the associated Technical Specifications will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

The system does not contribute to the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident. The operability requirements as proposed for the revised specification 3.17.A ensure that the Control Room Ventilation system is operable during plant conditions for which significant radioactive releases are postulated consistent with the Standard Technical Specification. The proposed changes ensure the Control Room Ventilation system is restored to an operable status or that actions are taken to minimize the importance of the system function within time frames which take into consideration the low probability of an event occurring which would require Control Room Ventilation system function. Therefore, this amendment will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.17.A do not alter the function of the Control Room Ventilation system or its interrelationships with other systems.

The performance of a new toxic chemical analysis for the Monticello site has demonstrated that a postulated hazardous chemical release due to a trucking transportation accident involving chlorine is of a sufficiently low probability of occurrence that it need not be considered. As the basis of the chlorine detectors and current operability requirements for the control Room Ventilation system is to provide protection against an accident scenario which has been demonstrated to be of extremely low probability, the proposed revision to the Control Room Ventilation operability requirements will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.17.A ensure that both trains of the Control Room Ventilation system are restored to an operable status within a time frame which takes into consideration the low probability of an event occurring requiring Control Room Ventilation system function, the availability of the redundant Control Room Ventilation train and the capability of the safety related Emergency Filtration Train to pressurize the control room without the Control Room Ventilation system.

This surveillance requirement is performed while the plant is in a cold shutdown condition at a time when the safety/relief valves are not required to be operable. The performance of this evolution is not an input or consideration in any accident previously evaluated, thus the proposed change will not increase the probability of any such accident occurring. Current safety analyses conclude that the pressure relief capabilities of the Safety Relief valves are adequate assuming that one of the eight safety/relief valves fails to open upon demand. The proposed change will not adversely affect the reliability of the valves and will therefore not reduce the conservatism of this assumption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the proposed amendment specifies testing requirements consistent with accepted industry codes and regulatory guidance to provide assurance that the valves will function as designed.

The net result of the proposed amendment will be to allow the plant staff the option of decreasing the frequency of safety/relief valve testing to a level that has been acknowledged as acceptable by the ASME Code and NUREG-1433. We therefore conclude the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.

These limits are also used in the fuel thermal-mechanical analysis and transient analysis. Flow dependent APLHGR requirements will continue to be established based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient average planar heat generation rate during these events is not increased above the fuel design basis values. Power dependent APLHGR limits will continue to be established based on analysis and fuel type specific limits determined using NRC approved methodologies to ensure that peak transient average planar heat generation rate during any transient is not increased above the rated fuel design basis transient values.

In addition the proposed amendment adds the NRC approved Siemens' analytical method for the determination of APLHGR limits based on LOCA/ECCS [emergency core cooling system] analyses.

Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection and Engineered Safety Features Systems yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in a[n] increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in core damage frequency (CD) due to Engineered Safety Features unavailability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5 fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of Reactor Protection System instrumentation. This reduction is primarily attributable to less frequent surveillance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reduction in inadvertent core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The values determined by the Westinghouse Owners Group and presented in the WCAP for the increase in core damage frequency were verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff.

No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features. Rather the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System or Engineered Safety Features functioning properly is affected as described above.

The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act.

The first impact is a slight increase in core melt frequency that results from the increased unavailability of the instrumentation in question. The unavailability of the tested instrumentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components is translated to result in a failure of the reactor to trip, an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS), or a failure of the appropriate engineered safety features to actuate when required. The opposing impact on core melt risk is the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency that would result due to the reduced exposure of the plant to test-induced transients. This results in a net decrease in core melt frequency of approximately 4.1x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> -8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Representative fault tree models were developed for FCS and the corresponding changes in core melt frequency were quantified in evaluations CEN-327-A and CEN-327-A, Supplement 1. The NRC issued a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) which found that these evaluations were acceptable for justifying the extensions in the STIs for the RPS and ESFAS from 30 days to 90 days and that the RPS unavailabilities resulting from extending the STIs were not considered to be significant. Estimates of the reduction in scram frequency from the reduction in test-induced scrams and the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency were found acceptable. STIs of 90 days were found to result in a net reduction in core melt risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A plant specific calculation/setpoint drift analysis was conducted, as required by the NRC SER, that analyzed the effect on instrument drift of extending the RPS and ESF instrumentation and controls functional STI from monthly to quarterly.

Therefore, it is unnecessary to change any setpoints to accommodate the proposed extended STI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change, therefore, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve any changes in equipment and will not alter the manner in which the plant will be operated. RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument uncertainties resulting from the proposed STI (calculated using actual plant data) are less than the instrument uncertainties assumed for 30 days. Thus, this proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no changes to the equipment or plant operations.

The changes clarify the Technical Specifications by specifying the modes of operation during which the LCOs and Surveillance Requirements of Specification 3.5 are applicable. The changes also include specific guidance for the operators to prevent or minimize the release of radioactive gases to the environment. These changes can not cause an increase in the probability of, nor alter the consequences of, an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of a threshold below which grab samples are not required will alter procedures by allowing SJAE operation without grab samples to determine effluent content at low levels of radioactivity (i.e., less than 5,000 micro Ci/sec). This will not affect the monitoring system's ability to detect, alarm, and isolate the offgas system if the concentration of radioactive material in the effluence reaches the appropriate setpoint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The surveillance requirement for taking a grab sample after a greater than 50% increase in release rate is intended to assist operators in determining if there is any increase in fuel failure during steady state operations.

The grab samples do not provide any automatic protective function (e.g., MSIV [main steam isolation valve] or Offgas System isolation) for mitigating an accident but provide radionuclide concentration data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The performance of SJAE effluent grab samples is not credited towards detecting nor mitigating any design basis accidents since spontaneous fuel failure is not a FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] accident initiator but a consequence of an accident.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications reflect either established plant practice (i.e., applicable modes or mitigation procedures) or new surveillance guidelines to minimize unnecessary grab samples. In all cases, the proposed changes have no affect on any parameters which would be considered or used in an accident analysis. The changes, therefore, do not pose a safety issue different from those analyzed previously for the FSAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will not alter the intent of the surveillance requirement to monitor for the possibility of fuel failure.

Surveillance testing procedures will be prepared, reviewed and approved in accordance with TS 6.5.3, which will ensure an unreviewed safety question is not created. To support the addition of the new LCO, Action and SR, the existing LCO, Action and SR are proposed to be administratively re-numbered or re-lettered.

The addition of LCs NG07 and NG08 to the technical specifications and surveillances serves to clarify the 480-volt power supply requirements in the technical specifications.

In accordance with the definition of operability contained in the technical specifications, the operability of the ESW MCCs has always been included within these requirements. The existing technical specification requirements for onsite A.C. power distribution systems are intended to assure the availability of A.C. power sources supplying multiple safety systems. The NG05E and NG06E MCCs identified by this proposed change provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment. The use of the 72 hour limit for the ESW MCCs is consistent with the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.93, ``Availability of Electrical Power Sources'' and has an insignificant impact on the Callaway Probabilistic Risk Analysis. LCs NG07 and NG08 also only provide power for a single safety system (ESW) and associated equipment (UHS cooling tower). Since the technical specification requirements relative to the ESW system operability are not lessened by this change, there will be no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the basis for the technical specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / New car sales may fall by 8-9%, warn carmakers LEADING carmakers warned yesterday that West European new car sales could fall by 8-9 per cent this year with a decline of around 1.1m. Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, forecast a drop in new car demand across west Europe to around 12.3m from 13.45m last year. Mr Hughes forecast a fall in new car sales in four of the five main volume markets, Germany, Italy, France and Spain with only a modest increase in the UK. Sales in the five markets, which account for more than 80 per cent of total west European new car registrations, are forecast to fall by more than 1m units to just under 10m this year. The most dramatic decline was expected in Germany where new car sales were forecast to fall by 19 per cent to around 3.2m, a loss of almost 750,000 units from 1992, said Mr Hughes. In Italy, Europe's second largest market, new car sales were expected to drop by 10 per cent to under 2.1m, he said. Mr Hughes warned that the workforce of GM Europe (Opel/Vauxhall) would be cut by around 3,000 this year following a similar reduction in 1992. GM Europe has a complete halt on the recruitment of hourly-paid workers in its European operations. GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations suffered a 31 per cent fall in net profits last year to Dollars 1.36bn from a record Dollars 1.96bn in 1991, the company said yesterday. However, it remained the most profitable volume car maker in Europe. The chief executives of Ford and Peugeot issued similarly pessimistic forecasts for European car demand this year, which will add pressure to the continuing disagreement between the European Community and Japan over the level of Japanese car sales in Europe this year.</p>

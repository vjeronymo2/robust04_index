			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THREE months ago Chillington Corporation appeared in this column because four directors had bought significant amounts of stock. This week they feature because the chairman, Konrad Legg, has sold 200,000 shares at 33p. At the same time he bought 200,000 warrants at just over 4p. Dr Jim Maxmin, chief executive of Laura Ashley, has made a further purchase of ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) lifting his holding by more than 30,000 shares. Fresh senior appointments have strengthened the board. Two weeks ago Southern Business Group, the photocopier supplier based in south east England, reported better than expected final results, together with a 15 per cent increase in the dividend. A week after the announcement, Roger Limpenny, the finance director, bought 17,500 shares at 86p taking his total holding to 50,500 shares. After merger discussions between Stanhope Properties and Rosehaugh were abandoned, seven directors of Stanhope bought a total of 350,000 shares at 24p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        No of Company                  Shares       Value          directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chillington             200,000          66              1 First Leisure            34,662         105              1 Greene, King &amp; Sons       9,397          44              1 Marks &amp; Spencer         438,261       1,289              3* Polar Electronics       300,000         300              1 Portmeirion Pott.         4,900          11              1 RMC                       2,000          12              1 Securicor Grp 'A'         2,536          13              1 Stanley Leisure          56,825         112              3 Steel Burrill Jones      39,000         122              1 Tibbett &amp; Britten       100,000         541              1 Treatt                  186,250         205              2 Waddington (J)            6,000          11              1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashley (Laura)           30,675          28              1 Astec (BSR)             100,000          13              1 BAA                       2,000          11              1 BPB Industries           20,000          28              2 Cabra Estates           500,000          41              1 Expl Co Louisiana        19,800     dlrs 15              1 Fairhaven               250,000          50              1 Freeman                  71,171          53              4 Grand Cent Inv Trst      25,000          10              1 Hazlewood Foods          20,000          28              1 Inchcape                  2,500          11              1 Ivory &amp; Sime             47,400          64              2 Peel Holdings pref       35,000          13              2 Pressac                  20,000          13              4 South Business Grp       17,500          15              1 Stanhope Property       350,000          84              7 Thames Television         8,000          16              2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

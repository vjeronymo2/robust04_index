			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Tapping the phone lines for data A wealth of business and financial information can be accessed from any UK telephone socket through a new interactive communications system, writes Ian Holdsworth. Up to 45 services, including information on share prices in Dublin and London, credit ratings and company reports from Dun &amp; Bradstreet and hotel and travel bookings, are available from the Network North system, a joint venture between ICL and Belfast-based CFM computer services. The network, accessed through a small terminal which plugs into a phone point, also offers telebanking and teleshopping. Developed with help from British Telecom Northern Ireland, it can link into similar systems in other European countries. Terminals cost Pounds 7.50 a month to rent. They can be bought for Pounds 120 in Northern Ireland with an EC subsidy or Pounds 240 in the rest of the UK. Network subscription is up to Pounds 40 a year and most services are charged at 6-15p per minute. Software to convert a PC into a network terminal costs Pounds 25. Network North: UK, 0265 848962.</p>

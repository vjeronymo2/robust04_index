According to the NAEWOE press, a radio Pyongyang  broadcast said it is just unthinkable that North Korean people  try to defect to South Korea.    "Our people remain convinced that away from the bosom of the  Republic, they cannot live even a moment and there is no  rewarding future for themselves and their descendants," it said.  The broadcast said this was clearly evidenced by the case of Yi  In-mo and two people's constabulary unit soldiers who, after  being rescued by South Korea in the sea, chose to return to the  North last month. Yi In-mo was a self-styled North Korean war  correspondent caught in the South during the Korean war as a  guerrilla fighter, who was sent back to the North last year on  humanitarian grounds after refusing to change allegiance. The  radio said that the report about the loggers is a "wild rumor"  invented by South Korean authorities in their attempt to  "placate South Korean people's anti-government struggles and  distract public attention."    A Seoul government official said over the weekend that  hundreds of North Korean loggers escaped from Pyongyang-run  logging yards in Siberia and more than 100 of them came in  contact with South Korean missions in Russia for permission to  come to South Korea. About 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are  known to work at Siberian logging yards under harsh conditions.</p>

This summarizes a number of comments  successively made by some cabinet ministers at their informal  gathering following a regular cabinet meeting on 22 March, in  their apparent efforts to put a check on discussions of  political realignment issues. Recently, stepped up discussions  have been noted among ruling coalition parties over such issues,  including a plan by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the  Japan New Party [JNP] to form a parliamentary group.    Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato (of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]) was the first to begin making the  comments. He first expressed concern about the fact that the  Diet has remained idle for nearly two weeks, as it remains  uncertain as to when the lower house Budget Committee would  begin deliberations on the draft budget. He then asserted: "The  government and the ruling coalition parties have been carried  away with discussing political realignment issues day after day,  neglecting the budget. This is one of the reasons the cabinet  support rating has dropped." "In light of the current situation  regarding deliberations on the draft budget, we should all look  forward to the passage of the draft budget and the `higire'  bills [bills with a time limit] and refrain from commenting on  the political realignment issues," he added.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi (of the SDPJ) joined  Sato  and said: "This is a very important matter. Considering the  trends in the public opinion poll, we should all strive to  strengthen the (cabinet's) centripetal force."    Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi (of the Komeito) followed  suit and said: "It is important to have the people understand  that the cabinet is united."</p>

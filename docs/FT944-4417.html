			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cautious hand holds controls - Raymond Snoddy on Carlton's plans after a period of change Mr Michael Green, the chairman and chief executive of Carlton Communications, is noted for his caution. In the pioneer days of satellite television in the early 1980s Mr Green was enormously interested, but kept his cheque book firmly shut and instead made money by selling editing time, studio space and other back-up facilities to those who rushed in. Mr Green is the first to admit that he is no innovator, but someone who watches carefully for the moment when innovation is about to result in commercial products. Yesterday Carlton announced a 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 190m. The figure was boosted by an eight-month contribution from the acquisition of Central Independent Television, but was still ahead of the most optimistic analysts' forecasts. However, in a small piece of corporate innovation, Mr Green accompanied the results for the year to September with the sort of detailed information on strategy and performance usually reserved for annual reports. It amounted almost to a conservative media manifesto for the foreseeable future of Carlton Communications. Carlton's strategy was not to plunge down 'super-highways' with high-risk ventures dependent upon a particular view of how multimedia markets will evolve. The aim would be to stick to 'sound commercial judgments about what consumers wanted' and to areas where Carlton could bring added value. 'ITV holds the dominant share of the UK commercial market and will retain that position by continuing to invest in new domestic channels,' said Mr Green. The rise of cable and satellite would fragment the television audience and as a result ITV would remain the channel which would deliver the consistently largest audience for advertisers. Yet, since April, Carlton has been turning out CD-Roms to address the educational and games market from an optical media unit within its Technicolor video cassette production plant at Camarillo, California. At the same time, Carlton, the world's largest duplicator of video tapes, expressed the belief that video cassettes have a long future as a means of delivering entertainment to the home. Not only had retail sales of videos doubled over the last five years, but they are forecast to double again over the next ten. Snow White, released by Disney at the end of October, was believed by the industry to have sold 10m copies in the first week. Next year the Lion King, one of the most successful cinema releases ever, was expected to be released on video. Mr Tom Hall, media analyst at stockbrokers SJ Warburg, said yesterday that the City increasingly realised that the video recorder was not going to become obsolete overnight and that network television would remain strong. With strong advertising revenue and growth likely in its professional video and sound products division, Warburg believes Carlton will make between Pounds 238m and Pounds 240m in 1994-95. After that that the crystal ball begins to fade, but some analysts are already starting to talk about a possible Pounds 270m to Pounds 280m for 1996. Mr Hall, and many others, believe there is a degree of uncertainty about what direction Carlton will take in the medium term. Although Mr Green argues that after a period of rapid change and large acquisitions it is perfectly proper to concentrate on organic growth and managing existing assets, it is difficult to imagine that Carlton's acquisition days are over. In the past year, its centre of balance has shifted heavily towards television as Carlton Television produced its first full-year since its launch and Central kicked in with its contribution. As a result, operational profit in broadcast television jumped from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 71.6m. Despite the large growth in earnings from UK broadcasting, more than half of Carlton's turnover and operating profit came from outside Britain. North America contributed operating profits of Pounds 89.7m and the rest of the world added only Pounds 10.5m. As Mr Green looks cautiously forward to the multi-media future, he emphasised yesterday that the one near certainty is that 'irrespective of how they are delivered, original, quality programmes are the key to attracting audiences and advertisers.'</p>

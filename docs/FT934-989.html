			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading index falls again: Jobs at risk as companies review workforce needs Japan's economy is weakening because of faltering consumer demand and a drop in capital spending, the Economic Planning Agency said yesterday after its leading economic index showed another fall for the month of October. The index slipped from 33.3 per cent in September to 30 per cent. The EPA regards any reading lower than 50 per cent as an indication of weakness. In August the index had risen to 50 per cent, inspiring government hopes of a recovery, but economic activity has since slowed and the coalition government is under pressure to introduce a new stimulative package. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said yesterday that no clear signs of recovery had emerged, and companies were reviewing their workforce needs, which could lead to a rise in unemployment. In its report for December, the bank agreed with the EPA that declining personal consumption and capital spending were holding back the economy, although slow lending growth by banks is attributed more to weak corporate demand than to the wariness of banks. Business leaders have called for another cut in the official discount rate, but bank officials said yesterday they were still studying the effects of the most recent reduction, in September, when the rate was cut to 1.75 per cent.</p>

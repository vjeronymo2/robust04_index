			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, June 27, IRNA -- Any new initiatve for  restoring peace in wartorn Afghanistan should also take into  account the suggestions of all those persons who are not related  to the well-known Afghan groups.    This was stated by the United Nations secretary general's  representative for Afghanistan, Sotirios Mousouris in an  exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)  in the Pakistani capital.    Without disclosing the contents of report of the U.N.  special  mission on Afghanistan led by former Tunisian Foreign Minister  Mehmood Mestiri, he said one could have good ideas to formulate  a peace plan out of this report. However, he said it was up to  the U.N. secretary general to decide whether the world body  should make a peace plan for Afghanistan or not.    Mousouris said a large segment of the Afghan nation has  sought the help of the United Nations that range from demands  for intervention to end foreign interference to the making of a  peace plan and then its implementation.    Answering a question as to what he considered would happen  in  Afghanistan after July 28, the end of President Borhanoddin  Rabbani's term in office, he said it is up to Afghans themselves  to resolve their problems. However, he said, countries such as  Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia should also be consulted in this  regard as they brokered the Islamabad accord between Afghan  groups.    Mousouris said complete ceasefire is a pre-requisite for  sorting out political solution to the conflict. He also  expressed his apprehensions that Herat City was bombed before it  hosted a meeting of Afghan leaders to deliberate on the problem  to figure out its solution. He said it seemed some persons are  not interested to discuss any peace plan.    To a question as to what could be a permanent solution to  the  crisis, he said the Afghan youth do not have jobs in the wake of  fighting and thus are forced to affiliate with warring factions  to piece out their livehood.    He said international assistance for Afghanistan has also  gone down because of instability. He said he could not propose  any plan or solution to the crisis but the ideas of the "silent  Afghan majority" are to be taken into consideration in any peace  formula meant for restoring peace and stability in that  war-ravaged country.</p>

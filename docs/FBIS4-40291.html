			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Military Review" by Doctor of Military Sciences Professor </F> Apollon Lelekhov: "United States Improving Command and Control  of Strategic Offensive Forces"]    [Text] The organizational structure and procedure for the  command and control of U.S. nuclear strategic offensive forces  which existed until recently took shape back in the early  sixties. It was then that the first ICBM's were placed on combat  standby in the United States. Along with heavy strategic  bombers, they were organizationally part of the USAF's Strategic  Air Command (SAC) set up at the time. But, unlike the ICBM's  and strategic bombers, nuclear missile submarines (SSBN's) were  not made part of SAC. They were subordinate to fleets operating  in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean.    Thus the U.S. strategic nuclear triad that came about at  that  time was not a unified formation. Operational command and  control of ICBM's and strategic bombers was effected by the  Joint Chiefs through their command centers and the SAC command,  with command and control of nuclear submarines and their  ballistic missiles being effected by the Joint Chiefs through  their command centers and a system of special communications  aircraft. As for administrative control -- responsible for  force organizational development, material and technical  provision and other types of logistics and supply, and combat  training -- it was exercised by the USAF SAC command in respect  of ICBM's and strategic bombers, and by the relevant fleet  commands in respect of SSBN's.    Although this system for the organization and command and  control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was occasionally  criticized, it existed right up to 1993, when an improvement was  made to the structure and system of command and control. SAC  was disbanded. It was replaced by the U.S. Armed Forces' Joint  Strategic Command (JSC), which is operationally subordinate to  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. All the combat-ready forces  of the U.S. nuclear triad -- ICBM's, strategic bombers, and  SSBN's -- have been transferred to the JSC's jurisdiction.    Why did the U.S. military leadership reform the  organizational structure of its strategic offensive forces and  abolish SAC?    The main objective was to enhance the effectiveness of the  combat use of strategic offensive forces by optimizing their  command and control under the new conditions of the disposition  of forces in the world and the adoption in the United States of  a military strategy termed a "regionally oriented" strategy  [strategiya "regionalnoy napravlennosti"]. The U.S.  military-political leadership has for the first time clearly  separated the two lines of command and control of all strategic  offensive force systems -- the operational and the  administrative. Operational leadership is now handled by the  Joint Chiefs and the JSC, which control all combat-ready  strategic offensive forces.    Administrative control of the strategic offensive forces has  not been united. Currently it is exercised in the following way  -- ICBM forces are administratively controlled by the USAF Space  Command (which includes the 20th Air Army), and strategic  bombers are administratively controlled by the newly created  USAF Air Combat Command (ACC), which organizationally includes  all strategic aviation. As for the administrative control of  nuclear submarines equipped with ballistic missiles, those  functions remain under naval command and directly with the  Pacific and Atlantic Fleet commands.    In the opinion of the U.S. military leadership, this  reorganization of strategic offensive forces and command and  control systems should lead to a significant enhancement of  their combat capability and ensure centralization, efficiency,  and flexibility on the part of the U.S. strategic leadership.    The idea of reorganizing the structure and system of the  command and control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was  carefully analyzed and discussed in advance. It was phased in  beginning in 1991. Measures to enhance the efficiency of the  system for command and control of the strategic offensive forces  and the global system for the operational command and control of  the U.S. Armed Forces as a whole were carried out first. Then  improvements will be made in terms not only of organizational  structure but also of technology, taking account of new  technological developments in the sphere of the development of  information systems, communications equipment and systems, and  computers.    The JSC Command and Headquarters are located at Offutt  military base (Nebraska). Planning for the combat use of all  U.S. strategic offensive forces is carried out by the Joint  Chiefs under a single -- or, as is sometimes said -- integrated,  operations plan.    That is the state of play with regard to the organizational  restructuring and reorganization of command and control of the  U.S. strategic offensive forces.    The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 1,000 ICBM launch  vehicles, including 50 MX ICBM's and 950 Minuteman 2's and 3's.  They have more than 2,200 nuclear warheads.    The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 199 strategic  bombers,  including 85 B-1B's and 114 B-52's. They have around 1,700  nuclear warheads.    The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 30 nuclear submarines  with ballistic missiles, including 27 with Trident ballistic  missiles and three with Poseidon ballistic missiles. In total  they have 600 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and more  than 4,000 warheads.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / NFC chiefs clash over values An extraordinary clash between the chairman of NFC and his predecessor marked the annual general meeting of the UK-based transport and logistics group. About 1,110 shareholders heard Sir Peter Thompson, 65, who led an employee buy-out in 1982, accuse his successor, Mr Peter Watson, of putting the group's traditional values at risk. Sir Peter particularly criticised the board's failure to seek shareholders' permission in advance of the group's Pounds 263m rights issue last month, which will dilute the proportion of equity held by employees. He asked Mr Watson, who succeeded him in 1991: 'Why did you find it impossible to seek permission from the people who have supported you all these years?' Mr Watson said advance permission had not been sought because of the possible adverse effect of a deal on NFC's share price, but denied that the 'continuing evolution' of the group posed any threat to its traditional values. Sir Peter was concerned that recent developments had threatened NFC's core values - of employee involvement, participation and frugality. He said: 'We used to be non-elitist - and I now see executive share options are creeping in all over the place.' Mr Watson told Sir Peter he had 'been away for some time,' and said he regretted he had chosen to raise the issues at Saturday's agm. He reminded Sir Peter they had worked closely together for many years, adding: 'I do resent a little bit the suggestion that I don't share these values.' Mr Watson said the rights issue was necessary to develop NFC, and he had clearly flagged that strategy to earlier meetings of shareholders. It was also essential to have a pattern of shareholding which worked for the 1990s  -'we can't always look back to the 1980s'. Sir Peter - describing himself as a 'humble pensioner' - drew warm applause before and after his contributions. However, Mr Watson's robust defence of the board was also applauded and the meeting overwhelmingly approved all the resolutions before it. On NFC's trading, Mr Peter Sherlock, chief executive, said there was encouraging evidence of a steady if unspectacular return to growth in the US and UK, although not in mainland Europe. Overall revenue in the group's UK Logistics business (combining Exel logistics and BRS) in the 12 weeks since October had grown 5 per cent compared with last year. The grocery and consumer sector had started well, but the industrial sector remained difficult.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by retired General Gerd Schmueckle, former NATO </F> deputy commander in chief: "Who Is Going To Save the  Bundeswehr?"]    [Text] Parliamentarians were outraged when they read in  the newspaper that the defense minister wants to reduce the  Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 340,000-320,000 men and shorten  compulsory military service to 10 months. This outrage also --  and not without justification -- included a bit of injured  pride. In this connection it was, however, strange that it was  precisely those who were outraged who had actively participated  in hammering one lump after the other out of the "defense budget  quarry." The fact that less money means less Bundeswehr is  simple arithmetic. No matter how you look at it: If the  Bundeswehr continues to be the target of attacks, then one day  Theo Waigel -- like his Austrian colleague Karl Ludwig von Bruck  in the past -- will have to cry out: "May God maintain the  Army; I, the finance minister, cannot do so anymore."    What else can Volker Ruehe consider aside from cuts in the  size of the Bundeswehr? Of course, he was right that a smaller  and effective Bundeswehr has more political weight than a large  and militarily inferior one. Helmut Kohl should think along  similar lines, because, according to the constitution, he has a  special position vis a vis the armed forces: In case of  emergency he becomes the commander in chief, that is, in the  event for which our state is, after all, maintaining the  Bundeswehr. Even the conceivable use of crisis reaction forces  can -- not in terms of constitutional law but in terms of  constitutional policy -- bring him closer to this burden. Other  things are no less important: Sooner or later NATO will realize  again how essential it is for safeguarding peace in Europe to  return to a policy of balance. We then have to be able to put a  Bundeswehr on this political scale, which constitutes a weight  that must be taken seriously. Therefore, Kohl would have to be  the last person to agree to a further disassembly of the  Bundeswehr. After all, he cannot be interested in commanding a  ridiculous army in an emergency.    In the current controversy in Bonn it is constantly said  that  the Bundeswehr must not be made the playing ball in the party  quarrel. However, it has long since become that, the most recent  instance being the parties' race to the Federal Constitutional  Court in Karlsruhe. As long as we have an army of conscripts,  it will always be an issue in the quarrel among the parties. If  one accepts the former, one should not complain about the  latter. After all, during the years of its development, the  Bundeswehr had to weather quite different political storms than  it does today. However, at that time, it had a clear course  outlined. Today, on the other hand, some political statements  look as if some kind of vivisection of the Bundeswehr were  intended. All too easily it is forgotten that the armed forces  are a living organism. It comprises not only soldiers,  officials, and employees, but also their families. They all  cannot be used for arbitrary experiments without weakening the  Army's combat strength.    Today there are various movements that affect the  Bundeswehr.  One says their reduction to 340,000 men or fewer is bad for  foreign policy. The history of the Bundeswehr says something  different: Franz Josef Strauss reduced the deployment sites of  the Bundeswehr far more dramatically than Ruehe intends to do  now. He convinced NATO that effective units are more important  than militarily inferior ones. German foreign policy was not  harmed by that.    A second movement claims that Ruehe's plans are too vague.  Yes, they lack the basis of solid staff work. The planners  must do additional work if they want to be convincing. However,  the critics are not thinking of that. With justification, in  the super election year they fear a discussion about which other  garrisons must be closed down. This is, indeed, Ruehe's toad --  which these politicians do not want to swallow. Even those  forces that would prefer to reduce the Bundeswehr to zero are  complaining about that. No quarrel about garrisons just now!    A third group thinks that Ruehe's proposal does not go far  enough. They want to reduce the armed forces to 300,000 men.  Who is right could be decided only if a detailed balance sheet  of the situation of the Bundeswehr were available. However,  this has always been lacking. Therefore, all figures are just  rough estimates. Even though the accusation that the official  security policy is conceptually dubious is correct, none of the  three groups of critics offers a convincing alternative.    Helmut Kohl's decision to establish a committee now, which  --  without time limit -- is to clarify the Bundeswehr's future, is  a politically understandable delaying tactic to avoid problems  in the coalition and to get through the election year.  Regarding the matter itself, however, this solution is  dangerous. So far, it has been the task of the military to  present to the minister a very detailed concept, which is  arrived at in solid staff work. This staff work was based on  orders from above and was thus permeated by a unified will.  Things are different in the planned committee. It is  unavoidable that all those differences that are now already  shaking up the field of security policy will clash in it. Then  one will probably settle for the lowest common denominator of  agreement.    This solution corresponds to the general trend in Bonn to  involve as many politicians as possible in the military  decisionmaking processes. How this is supposed to work in an  emergency remains an open question. One can democratize  decisionmaking processes until they are ineffective, even if  Ruehe may then have done everything to make the Bundeswehr fit.  Its efficiency can be negated at any time via decisionmaking.  It is time to think about this seriously.    It is to be regretted that a high-level discussion about the  future form of military service did not take place in the  Bundestag. Even when President Richard von Weizsaecker suggested  thinking about the idea of a "general service duty," the  political echo was just an embarrassed silence. What Volker  Ruehe is now envisaging -- half compulsory military service,  half army of volunteers -- is certainly acceptable as an interim  solution. However, it will not be a lasting solution. Bonn  will not be spared the pain of choosing between an army of  conscripts or an army of volunteers. Hopefully, both models  will be calculated in the Defense Ministry in such a serious way  that the respective costs can be presented to the public at any  time. The potential support of one or the other model with  general service duty should also be included.</p>

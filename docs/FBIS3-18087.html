Japan was asked to make stepped-up efforts to stimulate its  domestic demand in order to make a dent in its 100 billion  dollar current-account surplus, the sources said.    Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven  (G-7) economic powers convened in the Frankfurt suburb of  Kronberg to discuss aid to Russia and world economic growth.    During the meeting, Japan sought to obtain support from its  G-7 partners for cooperation to put a cap on the yen's uptrend,  which quickened its pace after Japan-U.S. trade talks got bogged  down two weeks ago, they said.    Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan  Governor Yasushi Mieno tried to extract commitments from their  G-7 counterparts to the agreement last April against any  excessive volatility on the foreign exchange market.    They emphasized Tokyo's efforts to enliven the groggy  domestic economy and thereby curtail its mammoth trade surplus,  while arguing a sharp upswing of the yen would offset the  effects of such efforts, the sources said.    Fujii detailed the government's steps to shore up the  economy, including a 15.25-trillion yen stimulus package  unveiled earlier this month, they said.    After discussions on macroeconomic issues, the G-7 finance  ministers and central bankers invited Russian delegates,  including Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokin, to join them for talks over the  West's financial assistance to Russia.    The Russian delegates briefed the G-7 officials on the  Russian economic policy under the new cabinet.    The meeting came amid heightening tension over the  trans-Pacific trade dispute on how to ensure a substantial  reduction in Japan's towering trade surplus with the U.S.    With Washington moving toward a tougher posture in the trade  row by President Bill Clinton threatening sanctions, Japan has  pledged to draft a trade package by the end of March to speed up  deregulations and boost imports.    Prior to the G-7 meeting, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen expressed strong dissatisfaction about Japan's  achievements so far in slashing the surplus.</p>

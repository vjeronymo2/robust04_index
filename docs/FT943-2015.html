			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T sees 10% earnings dilution from McCaw deal AT&amp;T, the US telephone group, expects its earnings to be diluted by at least 10 per cent in the first year of its ownership of McCaw Cellular Communications, AT&amp;T said yesterday. AT&amp;T said it would take 18 months to integrate McCaw fully into its operations as a result of regulatory requirements. The Dollars 11.5bn acquisition of McCaw was formally completed on Monday. AT&amp;T said earnings would be diluted as a result of the issue of 209m shares to pay for the merger. There would be further unspecified dilution due to fees and other costs arising from the merger. McCaw, the largest US operator of mobile phones, will be renamed AT&amp;T Wireless Services. Its operational head will be Mr James Barksdale, McCaw president and chief operating officer. Mr Craig McCaw, the company's 45-year-old founder, would sit on the AT&amp;T board, but play more of a consulting role, AT&amp;T said. Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said litigation by regional Bell telephone companies to block the merger was largely a nuisance. 'We've obviously made the judgment that the remaining risks do not warrant delaying any further.' Under US Department of Justice terms, McCaw must offer access to its networks to long-distance telephone companies competing with AT&amp;T, and notify its customers. This would take a minimum of seven months for any one market, and 18 months for all the 105 local systems which McCaw controls. Until then, McCaw could not offer its services under the AT&amp;T brand name, Mr Barksdale said. Mr Allen said AT&amp;T, which is not constrained by the same 'equal access' provisions as McCaw, would start offering wireless and wired services to customers immediately, start-ing with the business market. Mr Barksdale said McCaw's spending on capital investment and marketing would not necessarily rise as a result of the merger. In particular, AT&amp;T had access to cheaper finance than McCaw, which had very heavy borrowings. There would be no job losses at McCaw, he said. The deal leaves British Telecom holding 35.8m AT&amp;T shares, amounting to about 2.3 per cent of the equity, in exchange for its McCaw stake.</p>

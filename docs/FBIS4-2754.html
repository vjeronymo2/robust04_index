			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gabor Kurti] </F>   [Text] Budapest, April 13 (CNA) -- Wu Jianmin, spokesman  for Mainland China's Foreign Ministry, Tuesday [12 April]  attempted to refute accusations that the Beijing government  mishandled the March 31 Qiandao boat tragedy in which 24 Taiwan  tourists died.    "We handled the affair in a very proper way. The accusations  are not true," Wu told CNA Budapest.    Wu also said that criticism over the Mainland's human rights  standards is unwarranted.    "It is not true that human rights are not respected," Wu  said, noting China's success in feeding its people. "There is no  more hunger in China."    Wu, visiting Budapest at the invitation of Hungarian Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Janos Herman, added that Mainland China is  focusing on developing basic shelter and care facilities for its  people.    "Our priority is development. China's net population  increase is 16 million people yearly, we have to care about  them, create jobs and housing for them," he said.</p>

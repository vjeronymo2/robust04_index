			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91&hyph;78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782) which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule which requires Mode C equipment when operating within 30 nautical miles of any designated TCA primary airport from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL, except for those aircraft not originally certified with an engine driven electrical system or which have not subsequently been certified with such a system installed (53 FR 23356). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirements for conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Established a single-class TCA; (b) requires the pilot in command of a civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate, except for a student pilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminated the helicopter exception from the minimum navigational equipment requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 17, 1991, the FAA published a final rule on airspace reclassification (56 FR 65655) of those airspace designations described in part 71 of the FAR. As a result of this reclassification, that airspace formerly referred to as the Los Angeles, CA, Terminal Control Area was reclassified to the Los Angeles, CA, Class B airspace, effective September 16, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Class B airspace (TCA prior to September 16, 1993) program was developed to reduce the midair collision potential in the congested airspace surrounding airports with high density air traffic by providing an area in which all aircraft will be subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic and the type of operations being conducted in the airspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midair collisions. In 1970, an extensive study found that the majority of midair collisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and an air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor common to these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). Class B airspace areas provide a method to accommodate the increasing number of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirements of Class B airspace areas afford the greatest protection for the greatest number of people by giving air traffic control (ATC) increased capability to provide aircraft separation service, thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. To date, the FAA has established a total of 29 Class B airspace area designations. The FAA is proposing to take action to modify or implement additional Class B airspace areas to provide greater protection of air traffic in the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class B airspace areas are published in Paragraph 3000 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994. The Class B airspace area listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

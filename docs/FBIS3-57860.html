"I find Klaus Kinkel's offer to meet with Zhirinovskiy  disconcerting," said Peter Hintze, the secretary general of the  CDU in an interview published in the daily Berlin newspaper B.Z.  [BERLINER ZEITUNG].    "It would be a grave error to minimize or even worse to  politically boost (Zhirinovskiy) by organizing public discussion  with him or by inviting him for a television debate.    "No reasonable political official should allow himself to be  tempted," he added.    Kinkel said Monday that he would be willing to meet with  Zhirinovskiy, who heads Russia's far-right Liberal Democratic  Party and who was refused a visa to Germany last week.    "Personally, I'm not scared of talking with him," Kinkel  said. "We can't deny the fact that based on the number of votes  he garnered he does have a following in Russia."    Zhirinovskiy, who was expelled from Bulgaria last week and  is  unlikely to be welcomed into France where authorities said they  would also deny him a visa, threatened Germany with "a third  world war" after his visa application was turned down. On  Monday he sought to correct his statement by telling a German  television station that he was "a friend of Germany."    He is expected to submit another visa application following  an invitation to attend a congress of European far-right parties  in Cologne next month.</p>

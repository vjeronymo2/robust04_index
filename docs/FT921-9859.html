			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Crunch in the skies: Efforts to ease air traffic congestion Thirty years ago, a British European Airways flight from London to Paris on a Vickers Vanguard turbopropeller-driven aircraft took exactly one hour. Today, the same journey on a new British Airways Boeing 767 jet is scheduled to take five minutes more. Despite advances in aircraft design and the introduction of the jet engine, the average journey time on short-haul routes (one hour or so) takes longer these days because of congestion in European skies and on the ground at busy airport terminals. Even the slump in air travel caused by the recession and the Gulf crisis last year has done little to ease the problem. BA calculates that delays in its operations last year at London's Heathrow airport alone totalled 233 days. Lufthansa says it loses about DM100m (Pounds 35m) a year through delays. The Association of European Airlines (AEA), which represents 22 European airlines, estimates the total cost of air traffic disruptions in Europe at about Dollars 4bn a year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that this is likely to worsen to some Dollars 10bn a year by the end of the decade if nothing is done to improve the situation. The problems of European air traffic control are not new. But the issue is coming to a head with a recent warning from Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the new AEA chairman and managing director of Alitalia, that Europe's fragmented and inadequate system could lead to another hot summer of delays and cancellations, and, in the longer term, to a capacity crunch in Europe's skies. The warning coincides with both a recovery in European air traffic this year after a 7 per cent fall last year and the completion of a detailed report by Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based European air traffic control body, concluding that the problems are much greater than had been thought. The two-year study was commissioned by the transport ministers of the 23-nation European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) in 1990 as the first phase of an overdue programme to try to harmonise and integrate Europe's disorderly patchwork of different air traffic control systems by the end of the decade. Transport ministers will consider the report's findings at a meeting in London next month to launch the next phase of ECAC's European Air Traffic Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme. Of 52 European air traffic control centres evaluated, half were found to have 'significant deficiencies' requiring 'a major system upgrade'; 24 per cent had 'major deficiencies' needing a completely new system; 9 per cent had 'some deficiencies'; and only 17 per cent had 'no deficiencies' at all. However, all the centres share one big deficiency. They are incompatible. 'The 51 centres from which information is available have some 31 different systems, using computers from 18 different manufacturers with 22 different operating systems and 33 different programming languages,' the report says. By contrast, the US, which controls nearly three times Europe's airspace, operates a single system in 20 centres. Investment in air traffic control systems in Europe has also lagged way behind spending in the US. But perhaps the biggest problem is political. Some countries, such as Greece and Portugal, have low priorities in their national spending targets for new aviation infrastructure programmes compared with Britain, France or Germany. But even these countries are divided on how to resolve Europe's air traffic control problems. Germany, for example, has been pressing for the development of a single, unified system using the same equipment throughout Europe. But the UK argues that the German proposal is unworkable and is recommending integrating the existing European systems. 'You cannot stop traffic for even one day while you develop a parallel system,' says Mr Derek McLauchlan, chief executive of National Air Traffic Services at Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. According to Mr McLauchlan, the multiplicity of air traffic control equipment in Europe is not a fundamental problem. He says a more realistic approach to improve European air traffic controlis to adopt common standards to enable them to communicate. But many in the industry are sceptical about the prospects of improvement. 'The chances of getting governments to agree are limited,' says Capt Philip Hogg, who is in charge of air traffic control affairs at BA. 'But if there is not the political will, the public outrage in 10 years will be so great that no government will be able to withstand the political pressures.' The airline joke is no longer 'breakfast in London, lunch in New York, baggage in Rome', but 'breakfast in London, lunch at Heathrow'.</p>

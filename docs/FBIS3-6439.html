			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 16 March, the Japanese automobile industry  decided on the outline of its voluntary plan to increase  purchases of U.S. products. Following the breakdown of the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in February, the industry  has been studying measures to increase purchases of U.S.-made  products at the private-sector level. The two main points of  the plan are: 1) to set up a new consultative organization  between the U.S. Big Three automakers and Japanese car dealers  in the field of finished cars; and 2) to increase members of the  existing consultative body between Japanese automakers and the  U.S. auto parts industry in the auto parts field. The Japan  Automobile Manufacturers Association [Jikokai or JAMA] (chaired  by Yutaka Kume) and other organizations will brief the U.S.  industry on the plan. Together with voluntary plans now under  study by individual automakers, including Toyota Motor  Corporation, the Japanese industry intends to make a final  decision on its plan by late this month when the government is  to issue its study on a package of market-opening measures.    As far as the expansion of imports of finished cars is  concerned, JAMA will serve as mediator in urging the Big Three  automakers to set up a consultative body between the Japan  Automobile Dealers Association (chaired by Keishin Kato) and the  U.S. Automobile Manufactures Association, an organization of  U.S. automakers. JAMA has maintained that "the increase in  sales of American cars on the Japanese market is decided by the  thinking of consumers," (as stated by JAMA Chairman Kume).  Because JAMA has stated the need for U.S. makers to negotiate  directly with Japanese dealers, it plans to establish a venue  for negotiations between the two sides.    Meanwhile, JAMA and the U.S. Motor Equipment Manufacturers  Association (MEMA) have already set up a consultative body in  the auto parts field. The Japan Auto Parts Manufacturers  Association (Bukokai, chaired by Masao Itagaki) plans to join  the consultative body. Because about 140 auto parts makers of  Bukokai, which has approximately 500 members, own production  bases in the United States, the association intends to increase  those Japanese-affiliated makers' procurement of auto parts in  the United States.</p>

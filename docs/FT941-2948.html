			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Burgin joins Max and Polly at Bluebird Mighty Max has a fairly low City profile, nothing to do with his height of less than one inch. Max is one of Bluebird Toys' success stories, a miniature figure now selling in 60 countries, along with Polly Pocket and other tiny creatures aimed at capturing children's hearts. Max and Polly have just got a new boss, Christopher Burgin, 44, who has been made chief executive of the company. Burgin has been picked by Bluebird's founder, Torquil Norman, 61, who is giving up the chief executive's job - but remaining as chairman - to concentrate on new product development. Angus Fisher, group operations director for the past four and a half years, is leaving. Norman says that because of the board restructuring, Bluebird 'needed someone with more of a marketing background as chief executive', but adds that the parting with Fisher was amicable. Burgin will be working closely with Norman and also David Laxton, whose title is technical director but who Norman says plays a much greater and vital role in product development than the title reveals. Bluebird has gone through its ups and downs. Established in 1980, voted British toy manufacturer of the year in 1984, it was listed on the USM in 1985. It seemed unable to put a foot wrong, until in 1991 its shares nosedived from a 1987 peak of 506p to 26p; losses hit Pounds 3.5m, partly a result of the Gulf War but also from a failure to keep a tight grip on inventories. These days it's flying high again; its shares have moved from 178p to a recent high of 842p over the past 12 months; profits rose to Pounds 9.8m from Pounds 1.5m, while sales increased 50 per cent to Pounds 69m. Now Max has been adopted by a television production company; 40 half-hour animations are booked for the US, Bluebird's second biggest market. The appointment of Burgin, who has an 18-year background in the industry with toy giant Hasbro, ultimately as Hasbro UK's group sales and marketing director managing brands such as Trivial Pursuit, Action Man and Play-Doh, comes at a moment when Bluebird looks set to fly further.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Porsche cuts costs to stay in the black PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car manufacturer under pressure from a steep decline in profits, is managing to stay in the black at a time of slack sales by cutting costs, Mr Arno Bohn, the chief executive, said in a German press interview. But he admitted that Porsche's administration was overweight and that the company had contributed to its negative image, notably through failures in motor sport and a rapid turnover of top management. In the US, where sales collapsed last year to 4,400 cars from 9,100, the company said Mr Brian Bowler had left as president of Porsche Cars North America to be replaced by his deputy, Mr Frederick Schwab. 'The resignation was the result of differences over the direction of the company's future efforts in the important US market,' Porsche said with no elaboration. When the company sold 50,000 cars a year in the mid-1980s, around 30,000 went to the US, Mr Bohn said. While the US market has fallen drastically - first as a result of the stock market crash of 1987 and the dollar's weakness, and then of the US recession - the company's sales elsewhere have risen, especially in Germany and Japan. For this year the company already forecasts a decline in car sales from the 26,200 sold last year. But Mr Bohn said Porsche could now break even by selling around 21,000 cars a year compared with 29,000 two years ago. Porsche is putting 4,000 of its 9,000 employees on short-time working up to June and cutting its production workforce by 550 people. Mr Bohn said the company, whose net profits fell by 70 per cent last year to DM17m (Dollars 10.6m), would not undergo a rapid improvement in the next year or two; this would take four to six years, as long as it took to develop a new car.</p>

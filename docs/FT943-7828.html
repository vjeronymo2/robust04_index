			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Czech millionaire bandwagon: Emotionally and culturally ravaged, a repressed country is regaining its self-confidence The police were waiting to arrest Michal Horacek at Prague airport when he came back from his first trip to America in 1974. Now one of the Czech Republic's fast-growing club of millionaire-entrepreneurs, he had refused to join the communist youth movement and had forged the movement's stamp, one of many bureaucratic hurdles which had to be circumvented before gaining his coveted exit visa. Fifteen years later, in 1989, Horacek, a song writer, together with Michal Kocab, his pop-star brother-in-law, was called in to help Ladislaw Adamec, the last communist-era prime minister, come to terms with the break-up of the old regime. Now, as central Europe prepares to celebrate the fifth anniversary of communism's collapse, the Czech republic is emerging as a rejuvenated force and an example to the rest of the eastern bloc. The extent of its transformation would have seemed astonishing to Adamec at that meeting in his Prague flat on the eve of the 'velvet revolution'. The communist leader, frightened by the domino-like collapse of other communist regimes, had called on Horacek as the founder of an organisation called most, or 'bridge'. 'Dissidents could not talk to the government and the government could not talk to the dissidents. So Kocab and I decided to form most. At the time both of us enjoyed a sort of cult status thanks to our bitter-sweet songs and a column called 'letters of love and hate' in the magazine Mlady Svet (Young World),' Horacek recalls. 'Suddenly the government found itself isolated and desperately needed to find a 'bridge' to the people. So they called on us,' he says. 'The most unforgettable moment in my life took place a few days later when I appealed to a vast crowd in Wenceslas Square to forgive the secret police. After a silence, voices started chanting back 'we forgive you' and the crowd took it up. Many people now say we did the wrong thing. But the police were armed, anything could have happened and suddenly what could have been a vicious circle of recrimination and violence was broken.' Five years later Horacek, sits in a spartanly furnished office on the top floor of a grim, Soviet-era hotel block in an unfashionable Prague suburb. He is plotting the future growth and direction of one of the post-communist Czech republic's fastest-growing private companies, a betting company felicitously named Fortuna. 'I started the company in March 1990 as Czechoslovakia's first private, joint stock company. We are the local bookmakers who allow ordinary people to place a bet on anything.' Fortuna, which operates in more than 70 towns and villages around the country, replaced the tired state-run lotteries. 'We became an immediate, incredible success across the country,' he says. After four years of rapid growth the company is 'highly profitable', employs 440 people and will turn over an expected Dollars 40m this year, he adds. 'All new entrepreneurs in this part of the world have had to learn everything from scratch. Four years ago I went to the World Bank and they gave me a comic book to explain the basic principles of a capitalist economy,' he recalls. 'We started off in a maelstrom of changing laws, many of them retroactive. But it is at times like these that fortunes are made, and it is wonderful to be in the midst of it all.' Giving people what they want, after 50 years of a centrally planned economy devoted to steel, heavy engineering and guns, is an essential element in the emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurial business men and women who are transforming the Czech economy at breakneck speed - and making fortunes in the process. Many are close friends steeped in the free-thinking, Bohemian traditions of this quintessential middle-European country which neither Soviet tanks nor the plodding, unimaginative communists they kept in power were ever quite able to suppress. Lubomir Kratochvil, another entrepreneur, used to write the music for Michal Horacek's lyrics. Vladimir Dlouhy, then a card-carrying communist party member and now minister of industry, played bass in their band, Jazz Q. A couple of years ago Kratochvil founded the Golem Club, Prague's exclusive club for millionaires which meets in the cellar of a former medieval monastery in the heart of historic Prague. He whizzes around in a soft-top sports car, and presents a business card which includes the telephone number of his private aircraft and helicopter. Clearly he is having a ball as the prime mover behind Bonton, a fast-growing music and media group, at least partly inspired by the example of Richard Branson, whom he recalls meeting in London in the late 1960s when Branson was setting up Virgin Records. Bonton is currently raising Dollars 15m through a private placement organised by CS First Boston. The fact that Prague, the centre of Czech political, cultural and economic life, is a small town gives a special flavour to the Czech economic revival which has been master-minded by its spiky, self-confessed 'Thatcherite' prime minister, Vaclav Klaus. Today, Klaus dresses in smart suits, is an habitue of the international conference circuit, noted for his sharp tongue and inability to suffer fools gladly. It was different five years ago. He then emerged from 20 years of obscurity in the central bank and other institutions, devouring western economic literature as the man with the clearest idea of where the Czechoslovak economy should go. 'Klaus came and offered his services as an economist. He was there, he was intelligent and he was against chaos. It was vital for us not to be seen as just a bunch of dreamers and philosophers. He was modest, used to drive a Trabant and seemed to know what he was talking about,' Horacek remembers. Now, like other leading entrepreneurs, Horacek is unstinting in his praise. 'Without Klaus we would have gone through a very painful and difficult transition. He has shown what a difference one man can make.' As Klaus, initially the finance minister, enters his third year as the country's premier there are growing signs of economic nationalism accompanying the self-confidence which is returning after the end of 50 years of foreign occupation. It is reflected in the desire of the Czech republic's smartest and most talented people to recreate, by themselves as far as possible, the wealth and style which made the inter-war Czechoslovak republic richer and more culturally dynamic than Switzerland, and technically on a par with Germany. The task of catching up, after 60 lost years under Nazi and Soviet occupation, has been made more difficult by the cultural and economic loss caused by the destruction of Czechoslovak Jewry and the exodus of the educated people during communist rule. However, for many Czech and other expatriates from east and central Europe, life in the diaspora provided an opportunity to refine their skills and educate their children in good schools and universities. Many who stayed retreated into a form of 'internal migration' where they nurtured their private beliefs. Both experiences are now reserves to be drawn on. This new energy, aided by access to technology and wages less than one-tenth of German rates, is being harnessed to modernise the technical skills and ingenuity which made Czech lands the industrial powerhouse of the old Hapsburg empire. Industry is being refocused by new companies while the old communist behemoths are being slimmed and privatised - such as the former state-owned engineering company Skoda Pilsen - or sold. Foreigners have acquired Volkswagen/Skoda Automobilova, the glass company Sklo Union and the state tobacco monopoly. With increasing frequency German companies, or foreign companies operating in Germany, such as AVX, the UK subsidiary of a Japanese electronics company, are simply unbolting their equipment from plants in high-labour-cost Germany, shifting them by rail or truck and reassembling them over the Czech border where skilled labour is prepared to work for wages kept low by heavy government excess-wage taxes and weak or non-existent unions. Some companies, such as AVX, work their plants on a seven-day basis around the clock. Low wages are thought to be a transient phase. Real incomes have been rising thanks to trade liberalisation, a stable exchange rate, a low inflation rate and wider availability of goods and services. But the most dynamic growth in the rapidly emerging post-communist economy is concentrated in the long-neglected service sector. In tourism, retailing, banking, finance and property refurbishment - as well as betting shops and record companies - jobs are being created to absorb the shakeout from heavy industry. The service sector is also where fortunes are being made. Ravaged emotionally and culturally this century, Czechoslovakia nevertheless escaped the physical destruction which afflicted most other countries in the region and saw entire Polish cities, such as Warsaw, razed. Ironically, 50 years of communism preserved hundreds of medieval, renaissance and baroque towns and villages in both the Czech and Slovak republics as the communist leaders let old centres decay. These jewels are now being refurbished, repainted, regilded and polished - and foreign tourists are flocking to them. The Czech republic's stable currency, growing reserves and healthy current account surplus would not be possible without the billions of dollars spent by tourists to Prague and the famous spa towns such as Karlsbad. As central Europe marks the fifth anniversary of the domino-like collapse of communism, the explosive growth in Czech tourism and the emergence of service-orientated companies shows how far economic transformation has progressed - and how one of Europe's most repressed countries is regaining its wealth and self-confidence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic on Tuesday said that U.N.-sponsored air  strikes against Bosnian Serbs and the biased view of the Bosnian  civil war must stop. Otherwise, the international community  would be directly responsible for an escalation of the conflict  with unforeseeable consequences for the entire region.    U.S. NATO aircraft on April 10 and 11 raided Bosnian Serb  army positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe haven"  which should have been demilitarized last spring.    In late March, about 10,000 Moslem troops from Gorazde  mounted an offensive on Bosnian Serb positions surrounding the  area. The NATO aircraft intervened when the Serbs crushed the  offensive and launched a counter-attack.    Simic told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Government had most  categorically condemned the U.N. decision to engage NATO  aircraft as a direct and open engagemement in the civil war in  Bosnia- Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems.    The Yugoslav Government remains consistent in its long-term  foreign-policy orientation that all hostilities must  unconditionally cease in Bosnia-Herzegovina before overall  solutions are found, Simic said.    He went on to say that solutions which should not  dramatically clash with the real situation and the democratic  principles by which the international community should be guided  can be sought only on the basis of lasting peace and easing of  the malignant tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Unfortunately, these principles have long been abandoned and  grossly abused in the Yugoslav crisis and replaced by an open  imperialistic policy on the international political scene which  the U.N. obeys and duly implements although by its very nature  it should oppose it, Simic said.    The U.N. decision to bomb Serb territories, which was also  highly controversial as far as the required procedure was  concerned, shows that the contemporary world has gone too far in  belittling the values without which peace cannot be even  imagined, he said.    The key international factors should sober up and abandon  their arbitrary, aggressive and reckless actions, and pursue  instead a realistic policy of negotiations on an equal footing  as the only way to the ultimate goal -- peace and a lasting,  just settlement acceptable to all in Bosnia, he said.    In this, the international community can always rely on  Yugoslavia's peaceful policy of active mediation, said Simic.    Paradoxically, the future of the peace process in former  Yugoslavia depends on whether political developments are really  heading in the direction of peace. If the international  community is really interested in peace, then the means to  attain this goal should be corresponding, he explained.    Force which only prolongs the war and continues the  bloodshed  cannot be justified by aspirations for peace, said Simic.    It is utterly cynical when some diplomats say they hope the  Serbs would join the peace process in the future, because the  Serb side has always supported negotiations as the only way out  of the crisis, he said.    The Serb side had accepted the latest Bosnia peace plan of  the European Union which, following the Moslem rejection of it,  simply forgot it had made any proposal at all, discrediting  itself as an international factor which could have helped find a  favourable solution to the crisis and the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.    Yugoslavia remains consistent in its position that the peace  process should be based on negotiations in which all sides would  participate on an equal footing, said Simic.</p>

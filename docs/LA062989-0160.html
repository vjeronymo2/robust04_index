			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUE DEAL SET FOR 20 FAILED BANKS IN TEXAS  </P> <P> Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, agreed Wednesday to take over 20 failed banks  of MCorp, a Dallas-based holding company with $13 billion in assets, federal  bank regulators said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. refused to discuss details of  the transaction before a news conference today, but private analysts believe  that the deal will constitute one of the largest bank rescues ever, involving  an infusion of about $2 billion in federal money.  </P> <P> The agency, which insures commercial bank deposits, said Banc One will assume  management of the failed banks July 5. Its chairman, John B. McCoy, will assume  the chairmanship of the McCorp banks under the name of Bank One Texas, it said.  </P> <P> In a written statement, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman confirmed that Banc  One had been selected in "a highly competitive process," but he did not  elaborate. A number of other major banks considered making bids, including  Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seized in March  </P> <P> FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Banc One is investing $500 million in the new  Texas operation, but he declined to say how much the government is injecting.  Many of the big banks in Texas have failed or been taken over because the  state's real estate market collapsed after crude oil prices plunged in 1986.  </P> <P> Hammered by huge losses in 1988, the MCorp banks were seized by the government  in March and have been operating under the name of the Deposit Insurance Bridge  Bank. That new entity was formed when regulators declared 20 MCorp subsidiaries  insolvent, leaving five subsidiary banks still operating under the private  ownership of the original holding company.  </P> <P> If analysts are correct about the $2 billion in federal assistance, MCorp will  become the nation's third-largest commercial bank failure, ranking behind  Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984 and First Republic Bank of Dallas in  1988. They required initial government pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion,  respectively.  </P> <P> A Banc One spokesman in Columbus said it was not clear how much federal help or  overall funds the deal would require. The bank has made an estimate of the  cost, which he declined to disclose.  </P> <P> The FDIC will take over problem loans and "bring the balance sheet to a zero  position," the spokesman said. Banc One, he added, will manage Banc One Texas  for 120 days, identifying the problem loans and inflated assets, before the  purchase is completed.  </P> <P> In addition to Wells Fargo, other prominent banks that showed interest in  failed MCorp banks were NCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C.; New York-based  Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixth-largest banking company; First City  Bancorp of Houston -- itself the recipient of an earlier federal bailout, and  the New York-based leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. It  is not certain whether banks actually submitted bids for MCorp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disappointment Voiced  </P> <P> The announcement marks another setback in the expansion plans of Wells Fargo,  which sent a team of auditors to inspect MCorp's books last December but  reportedly never submitted a formal bid. Wells Fargo lost a bid last year to  buy First Republic Bank, which was sold to NCNB. Wells Fargo officials could  not be reached Wednesday.  </P> <P> Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of First Republic Bank, said  his firm was disappointed with the FDIC's decision. He added: "We remain  committed to serving the Texas market by expanding our franchise throughout the  state."  </P> <P> Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement: "We are extremely disappointed. We've  spent an enormous amount of time, resources and effort on this matter." It  noted that its proposal would have maintained an independent bank in Texas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoided Buyout Deals  </P> <P> Banc One, the 25th-largest banking company in the nation, has pioneered retail  innovations. It was one of the first banks to offer automated tellers and has  been a leader in the packaging of obligations owed by credit card holders to  sell as securities to investors. It allocates more of its earnings to research  and development than most banks.  </P> <P> Unlike other large banks, it has shunned participating in corporate buyout  deals. Instead, its bread and butter has been credit cards, auto leasing and  student loans. Still, it's had some missteps. An effort to create a  computerized home banking network fizzled.  </P> <P> With the Texas acquisition, Banc One obtains an extensive branch network with  offices in Abilene, Austin, Houston, Ft. Worth, Dallas and other cities in the  state.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The signatories to the treaty on CIS common security  called on the UN Security Council to adopt an urgent decision on  a peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia where the  Georgian-Abkhazian military conflict has been going on for a  year and a half already.    The statement by the Council of CIS Common Security  circulated in Moscow today says the participants in the treaty  on CIS common security could bring their military contingencies  to the conflict zone as peacekeeping forces with the consent of  the conflicting parties. This could be done in accordance with  the treaty on CIS common defense if no decision on the issue was  made in the future for whatever reasons.    The Council of CIS Common Security adopted a statement on  implementation of a peacekeeping operation in the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia,  Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan,  and Uzbekistan.</p>

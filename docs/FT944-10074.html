			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Not just the economy The US electorate said two things loudly on Tuesday: 'it's not the economy, stupid' and 'not the Democrats, stupid.' The question is what these statements mean, since the US electorate has, like most oracles, spoken ambiguously. It is tempting to argue that what happens in the US has no bearing on politics elsewhere. The constitutional framework, institutions and political issues are, after all, so distinct. Where else can politicians be pitched out for voting against the citizen's right to own assault rifles? Where else, for that matter, do voters insist on children being taught that God created the universe a few thousand years ago, along with evidence suggesting it was really several billion more. However barmy US politics sometimes seem to outsiders, it would be wrong to ignore the lessons altogether. What is interesting about these elections is that the electorate's reaction to economic insecurity is to become more conservative. The lack of a political dividend from the recovery is surprising. Elected when the economic tide was gaining strength, but before that strength had become obvious, President Clinton has watched the economy deliver all he could have hoped for. Gross domestic product rose 3.1 per cent in 1993 and is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow another 3.7 per cent in 1994. Inflation is securely under control. Unemployment is already less than 6 per cent, close to full employment on most economists' estimates. Changing conditions The answer to the puzzle is, it is suggested, the changing conditions of US economic life. According to statistics compiled by the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, the incomes of families in the top 1 per cent of the US income distribution grew 63 per cent during the 1980s, while the bottom 60 per cent of families experienced an income decline. What income growth there was over the period was, for most families, the result of more work at lower wages. Part-time and temporary employment has become increasingly important, while the availability of secure, good-paying jobs has shrunk. These characteristics of the 1980s have continued into the 1990s. The white-collar unemployment rate rose by an above average amount during the recession and the absolute rise in white-collar unemployment was greater than for blue-collar workers. The recovery has not reversed these adverse trends. It is hardly surprising then that the majority of Americans feel disgruntled. What is surprising, however, is that the party of redistribution and government intervention has - apart from in Bill Clinton's less than sweeping electoral victory - made no political mileage out of the woe. Insecurity and inequality may explain the lack of a 'feel good' factor. Yet they have not encouraged American voters to turn to those who believe government is the solution, but to those who say it is the problem. Who better encapsulates this mood of conservative populism than Congressman Newt Gingrich, virtually certain to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives? Election lesson The lesson of these elections is neither that the American people are fed up with Mr Clinton nor that they are fed up with incumbents. It is that they are fed up with the Democrats. The Democrats have lost 11 governorships, which can hardly be explained by the unpopularity of either the president or of Washington. As for the alleged hatred of incumbents, no Republican incumbent has so far lost a governorship, a senate race, or a house seat. The turnout of less than 40 per cent may be a partial explanation for this conservatism, with the economically marginal marginalising themselves politically as well. But low turnouts are normal in US mid-term elections. In any case, the proportion of the American people that has failed to prosper is too large for this to be the main explanation. If the lesson is indeed the appeal of conservative populism, it has echoes elsewhere. Silvio Berlusconi is prime minister of Italy because of it. Similarly Helmut Kohl, who managed once again to run against Bonn and win, despite poor German economic performance during his last term of office. Jacques Chirac, too, is mounting his bid for power as a conservative populist. Margaret Thatcher was one, as was her friend Ronald Reagan. John Major is not and poor defeated George Bush failed to be one either. Where does this election leave the view that incumbents win when economies are doing well and lose when they are in recession? In tatters. And where does it leave the other conventional view, that parties of the left should capitalise on economic insecurity and growing inequality? Also in tatters. In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Tories have been forcibly reminded that recovery does not guarantee victory. But Mr Blair must realise that Tory failures and widespread economic insecurity are no guarantee of his party's electoral success, either.</p>

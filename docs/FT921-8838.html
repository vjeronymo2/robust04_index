			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / China and Vietnam to end rivalry CHINA and Vietnam, whose rivalry fuelled the Cambodia conflict, agreed yesterday to boost economic co-operation and help ensure the success of the UN peace plan in Cambodia, Reuter reports. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam told a joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Hanoi that Chinese Premier Li Peng had accepted an invitation to visit Vietnam in the second half of the year. Cam signed an agreement with Qian yesterday covering economic co-operation between Vietnam and China and another lifting visa requirements for diplomats and those travelling on official business between the two countries. Qian's trip was the highest level visit from Beijing since China launched a border war against Vietnam in 1979, when the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia was defeated by an invading Vietnamese army. China and Vietnam promised to help ensure the implementation of the Cambodian peace plan signed in Paris last October by their warring proteges.</p>

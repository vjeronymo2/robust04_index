			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jin Man: "Foreign Trade To Account For Half of GDP in </F> 1994"]    [Text] Foreign trade will make up nearly half of China's  gross domestic product (GDP) this year, if the devaluation of  renminbi yuan is taken into account.    The proportion was 37 per cent last year, with a foreign  trade volume of $195.7 billion versus a GDP of about 3 trillion  yuan. (The official exchange rate then was 5.7 yuan to the US  dollar.) A conservative estimate puts China's 1994 foreign  trade volume at $200 billion, which would be tantamount to 1.74  trillion yuan at the current exchange rate of 8.7 yuan to the  dollar.    Ji Chongwei, an official with the State Council Development  Research Centre, says the country's foreign trade is expected to  continue double-digit growth in the remainder of the 1990s,  faster than that planned for the national economy.    China's foreign trade accounted for only 9.9 percent of GDP  in 1978 when the country first opened itself to the outside  world.    The export volume accounted for about 18 per cent of the  country's GDP last year, compared with 10.4 per cent in 1988.    "This high ratio is rare among the world's major countries,"  Ji noted.    China's exports saw a heady recovery in the first four  months  of this year from the corresponding period last year.    Experts are predicting that exports are unlikely to be so  sluggish again this year because the hectic domestic market has  calmed down.    A recent report from the State Planning Committee said that  more than 90 per cent of the country's commodities supplies  balance or even outweigh demand.    The report also said that investment in fixed assets -- a  key  factor affecting inflation -- has been brought under control.    The latest statistics indicate that the country's commodity  retail sales prices in April grew by 19.5 per cent over the same  period last year. This was lower than in March, when the growth  rate was 24.5 per cent.    A more mild domestic market is generally conducive to export  growth.    Last year, a hectic market at home, compared with a sluggish  international one, drew a lot of resources that should have been  exported.    Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi says that the adoption of the  uniform rate 8.7 yuan to the dollar has also boosted exports.    But analysts have expressed concern that a drastic price  spiral at home has virtually offset all the benefits brought by  the yuan's devaluation.    Chinese companies are now facing prohibitive export costs  and  demands by foreign importers to cut their export prices.    The State has made it a top priority to curb spiralling  prices this year, but the battle continues.    Another problem facing China's exports is that there are  only  a few kinds of money-spinning items available.    The biggest generator of export income, textiles, faces  strict import quotas in the United States, the European Union  and other importers.</p>

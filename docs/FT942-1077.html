			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Motoring: The car substitute with a wiggle Will the new wave of multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), such as the Peugeot 806 I wrote about last week, put a stop to the growth of on/off-road 4x4 sales? I suspect so. But Land Rover most definitely hopes not: all its eggs are in one massive, permanently four-wheel-driven basket. It follows that any move in life-style aspirations away from waxed cotton jackets, green wellies, jodhpurs and knobbly tyres would be bad news. Ask typical urban or suburban owners why they chose this sort of vehicle instead of a normal car and most will praise the high seating position and interior space, even though this can be more apparent than real. The one thing they never mention is cross-country capability - because they have no intention of leaving the tarmac and would not know what to do if they did. Thus, the benefits of the complicated transmission and high-slung suspension designed for off-road work are never exploited. A much more logical and effective form of transport would be one of the growing band of MPVs, which combine lots of interior space with a high driving position. But when did logic guide car purchase? So, without taking back a word of the above, I have to say that the Jeep Grand Cherokee I drove for a week recently was vastly enjoyable to use as a car substitute, even if the back end sometimes wiggled like Marilyn Monroe's. The 5.2-litre, 212 horsepower, V8-engined Grand Cherokee, with four-speed automatic transmission and permanently engaged four-wheel drive, is as American as mom's apple pie. Never mind the little wiggle; it is wonderfully comfortable because it rides shock-absorbently with finger-light steering and has enough power and traction to master any driving situation. It will out-accelerate most executive cars and cruise as quietly as they do at business drivers' speeds on the motorway. It corners capably, with no more body roll than most of its kind. While a big car, it does not feel intimidatingly bulky in narrow country lanes and is easy enough to park. The soft but supportive seats are leather-trimmed and the interior is not in the least American flash. With its sober colours and polished wood veneer, I thought the Grand Cherokee as understated as a quality European car. It is full of electronic novelties. Display panels tell the driver the day, date, time and outside temperature, when the next service is due, and even the direction in which they are driving. Super-efficient air-conditioning, cruise control, anti-lock brakes and a good six-speaker stereo are part of the package. You cannot expect any hefty on/off-roader with an engine the size and power of this one to be frugal with fuel but the Grand Cherokee is by no means a heavy drinker. The transmission is so eager to get into the high top gear that a driver content to cruise at the US legal maximum of 55 or 65mph (88 or 105kmh) should see well over 20mpg (14.1 litres per 100kms) on a journey. An enormous spare wheel and tyre takes up about 20 per cent of the load floor but there is still a lot of room for luggage. And roof rack side-rails, which are built in, have instantly-adjustable crossbars for carrying things such as windsurf boards. At Pounds 27,995, the Grand Cherokee is about Pounds 7,000 cheaper than a comparable Range Rover Vogue or Mitsubishi Shogun, but it would look just as much at home at a smart country occasion. The snag is that it only comes with left-hand steering, although there are plans to introduce right-hand drive versions, possibly by late next year. Unlike Land Rover, Jeep (part of the Chrysler organisation) has hedged its bets. If the trend by then has moved away from on/off-road 4x4s, Chrysler's Voyager MPV will be waiting in the wings, complete with right-hand steering.</p>

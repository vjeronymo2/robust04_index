The al-Hamra' position came under attack from machine-gun  and  rocket fire at dawn today. There were no casualties among the  personnel manning the position, who returned fire.    All this happened in the western sector of the security  strip. In the eastern sector, a South Lebanese Army [SLA] patrol  in Zummarayya was the target of gunfire and rocket fire from the  Hirbaya Hill north of the Zummarayya crossing. The  Zummarayya-Hasbayya-'Ayn Qinya axis was bombarded with 120-mm  guns from the saboteurs' position in Libbaya. There were no  casualties. SLA and Israeli artillery returned the fire.    In the Jazzin area, the Taw'amat Niha position came under  artillery fire from hostile positions in Mashgharah. Again  there were no casualties.    Yesterday our correspondent was informed by official  military  sources that the Israeli army and the SLA forces in the border  area have been placed on a higher level of alert during the past  few days. This follows expectations that the Nayif  Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP] will escalate its activities and attempt acts of sabotage  in the border area on 28 February, the anniversary of its  founding. The sources added that the DFLP has in the past few  years tried to intensify its activities on this occasion.</p>

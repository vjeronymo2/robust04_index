			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Johnston Press up by 11% to Pounds 6.7m Johnston Press, the Edinburgh-based group which owns weekly newspapers throughout Britain, increased pre-tax profits by almost 11 per cent to Pounds 6.67m, against Pounds 6.02m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover improved from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 44.3m. Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, said market conditions were generally improving but growth in advertising revenues varied between different business sectors and regions. The group is to disengage from its printing businesses which lost Pounds 195,000 (Pounds 64,000). It hopes to sell the two companies - Wood Westworth at St Helens, Merseyside, and Yorkshire Communications at Wakefield, West Yorkshire - but if not they will be closed. A provision of Pounds 507,000 has been made against either course of action. Operating profit, which excludes the provision, was up 18 per cent at Pounds 6.96m (Pounds 5.9m). The results included a two week contribution from Halifax Courier Holdings, acquired in June for Pounds 29.4m. This was the group's largest purchase and brought it its first daily newspaper, the Evening Courier in Halifax, as well as titles in West Yorkshire and the Isle of Man. The acquisition will boost annual turnover by between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m. Among the group's other newspaper interests, Scotland did well, with a strong rise in profitability. Newspapers generally improved their profitability in the north of England, the Midlands and Sussex. Net borrowings were Pounds 2m at June 30, the group having been cash positive at the end of 1993. Gearing was 7.1 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 12.9p to 13.9p. The interim dividend is raised to 2.75p, against 2.5p. COMMENT The shares have fallen from a peak of 669p in recent months, partly because the market assumed that as a newspaper company it must be suffering in the national price war. In fact only 6 per cent of its revenue comes from newspaper sales, the bulk coming from advertising. Yesterday the shares advanced 15p to 605p in recognition of its good performance and reliable growth record. UBS, the house broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.4m for the current year, for earnings of 31.5p and a multiple of 19. That seems realistic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 14 (CNA) -- The Council of Labor  Affairs at a screening meeting Tuesday [14 June] adopted a  formula tying the minimum wage to the consumer price index (CPI)  and labor productivity rate.    Aimed to reduce conflicts between management and labor over  wage hikes, the formula pegs the minimum wage to the CPI  recorded in the previous year plus half the labor productivity  growth rate.    In 1993, the CPI went up 2.94 percent on a year-earlier  level  while labor productivity gained by 3.44 percent, according to  tallies of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and  Statistics.    The minimum wage therefore will be raised by 4.66 percent,  the council said, which would make the minimum monthly wage  NT$13,917 [new Taiwan dollars] (about U.S.$516). A council  official stressed that the figure would need to be slightly  adjusted to take into account employees who are paid on an  hourly or daily basis. The wage hike will take effect on July 1.    "The formula is simple and makes the accounting of wage  hikes  easy," Tung Tai-chi, the director of the council's labor  conditions department, said, speaking of the new formula's  merits.    Generally speaking, Tung added, the minimum wage will only  increase or stay steady in the future. "Even if the CPI and  labor productivity decline, the minimum wage at most will be  frozen," he said.    Also on Tuesday, Premier Lien Chan approved in principle a  proposed 3-percent wage hike for government employees, teachers  and servicemen, also beginning on July 1. The proposal will  cost the government an estimated NT$11.2 billion.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / When efficiency is not enough: Problems faced by Nuclear Electric as it aims for privatisation YESTERDAY was Nuclear Electric's chance to shine before the government's review of nuclear power is launched later this year. Armed with impressive statistics on market share and job reductions, it put up a creditable performance. Nonetheless the company has an uphill, perhaps impossible, task in achieving the targets it has set for itself. In the coming review Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its counterpart north of the border, will be attempting to demonstrate that the City was wrong. Not only is the industry a commercial success, it is capable of thriving in the private sector without subsidy, they will argue. The country should also invest further in the sector by commissioning the pressurised water nuclear reactor, Sizewell C, to enable it to start producing electricity from the middle of the next decade. If decisions about the nuclear industry were based on improving efficiency alone, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would stand every chance of winning their arguments. In the past three years, Nuclear Electric has improved productivity from 2.9GW to 4.5GW per hour and return on capital is up from 4.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent. Figures like these enabled Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric chairman, to reiterate yesterday his assurances that the company will make an operating profit in 1995-96 even before taking account of the nuclear levy which is charged to every electricity consumer to pay for the decommissioning of plants inherited by Nuclear Electric. In addition the company says the levy will not be needed at all beyond 1998. Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth are not convinced. More important for the future of privatisation, neither is the City. Fears over the costs of future waste management and decommissioning lay behind the aborted privatisation of the nuclear industry in 1989. Yesterday's accounts showed that accumulated provisions for nuclear waste and liabilities are Pounds 10.46bn, against Pounds 9.88bn in the previous year. A critical factor in these figures is Nuclear Electric's assumptions that decommissioning will take place over 100 years, which it wants increased to 135. But environmentalists say, and the City fears, that both timescales will have to be revised downwards, dramatically increasing the cost. Further uncertainties are raised by Nuclear Electric's negotiations with British Nuclear Fuels for fuel services which amount to more than a third of Nuclear Electric's costs. The deal is having to be revised following the government's refusal to underwrite the risks of costs rising. Mr Collier said yesterday he would like the government to take over the liabilities the company has inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board and the levy that goes with it. This would enable Nuclear Electric to widen its appeal to potential investors since liabilities from pressurised water reactors are lower and, arguably, easier to predict than from the ageing magnox reactors inherited from the CEGB. The government last winter declined to do this. It seems unlikely to change its mind. The nuclear industry's best hope in the forthcoming review is that the government will set wide terms of reference which compare the environmental impact of all forms of energy for making electricity, including their emissions of carbon and sulphur. The signs from Whitehall are that the review will only ask whether the private sector is prepared to fund the building of Sizewell C. The key to that, and to the privatisation of Nuclear Electric, will be the attitude of the government on underwriting decommissioning and waste disposal costs.</p>

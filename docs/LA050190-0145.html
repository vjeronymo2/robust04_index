			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COLLEGE WILL TRY AGAIN ON SWAP MEET  </P> <P> Fullerton College officials will ask the City Council tonight to allow the  college to resume its automobile swap meet.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 in November to halt the weekend auto sales from the  campus parking lot, saying that the sales were an inappropriate use of public  property and that the swap meet was unfair competition for commercial auto  dealers.  </P> <P> The college is part of the state community college system.  </P> <P> College officials contend that the swap meet, run by CarFaire Inc. of Irvine,  was a legitimate fund-raising function.  </P> <P> The City Council voted to stop the swap meet after a city code-enforcement  officer determined that the event required city approval and a business license  and after one of the auto dealers in the city complained about unfair  competition.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

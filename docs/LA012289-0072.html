			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAW CLEARS WAY FOR MORE FACTORY UNITS;  </P> <P> ZONING ISSUES SET, BUT GOOD FINANCING REMAINS HARD TO FIND  </P> <P> A new California law makes it easier to put manufactured homes in residential  neighborhoods, clearing a roadblock that has prevented many people from  purchasing low-cost, factory-made houses.  </P> <P> However, some industry experts complain that financing the purchase of a  manufactured home generally remains more expensive than financing a  conventionally built house -- a problem that keeps many consumers from  benefitting from the factory-made homes' lower price tags.  </P> <P> "The new law has pushed the zoning problems out of the way," says David J.  Leichey, president of Meetings+Plus, a consulting firm to the manufactured home  industry.  </P> <P> "Now, if we can solve the financing problems, sales could really take off."  </P> <P> Thanks to technical advances and new designs, most manufactured homes produced  today look exactly like conventionally built houses and the quality is just as  good, industry officials say.  </P> <P> The primary difference between manufactured homes and traditional houses is  that most of the components of a manufactured home -- from the walls to  completed bathrooms -- are built in a factory instead of on the lot where it  will sit. The home is then trucked to the site in two or three pieces,  minimizing the need for on-site construction.  </P> <P> The savings that result from factory production can be dramatic: Manufactured  homes can cost as much as 30% less than conventionally built houses of  comparable quality.  </P> <P> Producers say wider use of manufactured homes could help solve affordability  problems in California and other high-cost housing states. But they have long  complained that many cities "discriminate" against factory-built homes through  prohibitive zoning and planning laws, such as ordinances that require the homes  to be placed in run-down mobile-home parks or other undesireable areas.  </P> <P> The new California law, which became effective Jan. 1, prohibits cities from  dictating where manufactured homes must be placed. Instead, cities must now  allow installation of factory-built homes on all residential lots, as long as  the units meet the same standards as conventionally built homes and are in  architectural harmony with surrounding houses.  </P> <P> However, cities will be able to turn down a request to install a manufactured  home if the house is more than 10 years old, or if it doesn't meet certain  requirements for roof overhang, roofing material or siding.  </P> <P> Cities can use the provision to reject the placement of old-fashioned  mobile-homes in residential neighborhoods, but won't be able to use it to  reject modern, manufactured houses.  </P> <P> The new law "bascially puts manufactured homes on an even-footing with  conventional houses," says Jess Maxcy, president of the California Manufactured  Housing Institute, a trade group that played a key role in the legislation's  passage.  </P> <P> "If a manufactured home is compatible with other houses in the neighborhood, a  city won't be able to turn it down."  </P> <P> Maxcy thinks that the legislation could boost the popularity of manufactured  homes, in part because buyers will have more freedom to place their houses  where they wish.  </P> <P> According to Leichey at Palm Springs-based Meetings+Plus, about 10,500 new  manufactured homes were sold in California last year. That's equal to about 5%  of all the houses, condominiums and apartments that were constructed in the  state in 1988.  </P> <P> Still, no one is predicting that the new law will send sales of manufactured  homes skyrocketing -- in part because financing the purchase of a manufactured  home is still expensive.  </P> <P> Leichey says interest rates on manufactured-home loans now stand at about 14%,  roughly three percentage points higher than rates on loans for conventional  homes.  </P> <P> He says lenders charge higher rates on manufactured homes "under the mistaken  assumption that the loans are riskier. The foreclosure rate on manufactured  homes is actually quite a bit lower than the foreclosure rate on conventional  houses."  </P> <P> Compounding problems, many lenders require that the loans be paid off in 10, 15  or 20 years, compared to the typical 30-year term for loans on conventionally  built houses.  </P> <P> Ironically, the higher rate and shorter repayment term sometimes combine to  push the monthly payment on a manufactured home higher than the monthly payment  on a more expensive, conventionally built house.  </P> <P> For example, a borrower who purchased a manufactured home with a $60,000,  10-year loan at 14% would have to pay about $932 each month toward principal  and interest.  </P> <P> But if the borrower instead took out a loan for $30,000 more -- a total of  $90,000 -- to buy a conventional house with a 30-year loan term at the current  11% rate for a typical mortgage, the monthly payment would be just $858.  </P> <P> "The manufactured home would cost you a lot less, but the financing would cost  you a lot more on a monthly basis," says Leichey.  </P> <P> Some lending institutions have been working with manufactured-home producers  and retailers to bring the cost of the loans down, Leichey says. As a result of  those efforts, a small but growing number of lenders are now charging the same  rate on manufactured-home loans that they do on conventional mortgages.  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Washington's new anti-trust vigour: George Graham reflects on the American initiative against a British glassmaker The US justice department's anti-trust order yesterday against Pilkington, the British glassmaker, marks one of the first concrete results of the new vigour in anti-trust enforcement promised by the Clinton administration. The Pilkington suit - as a result of which the British company has agreed to end the restrictions it has imposed on licensees for its float glass technology - is the first big anti-trust suit brought in the US against a foreign company since 1992, when the department reinstated an old policy which had allowed it to undertake broad actions against overseas companies. In 1988, the Reagan administration's justice department had announced that it would pursue anti-competitive conduct in foreign markets only when there was seen to be direct harm to US consumers. The 1992 reversal allowed the US also to pursue conduct that had harmed US exports. Besides marking a new aggressiveness - which has otherwise been symbolised mostly by the present justice department's determination to tackle the domination of the computer software industry by Microsoft - the Pilkington suit also carries echoes of the Clinton administration's broader goals on industrial and competitiveness policy. The principal goal of the suit, the department said, was to allow US companies to compete freely in overseas markets, not so much for sales of plate glass itself but rather for the construction of an estimated 50 float glass plants which are expected to be built in regions such as eastern Europe and south-east Asia over the next decade. 'Before this case was filed, US firms basically would have been locked out of this market entirely. Now that this consent decree has been filed, and hopefully after it is approved, we think that as many as half of these plants could be built by US firms,' said Mr Robert Litan, deputy assistant attorney-general in the department's anti-trust division. Mr Litan said that the department had also challenged Pilkington's licensing agreements because they were impeding innovation by US companies, since they restricted the benefits a licensee could reap from any improvements to the technology it had developed itself. As a sign that the Clinton administration sees anti-trust enforcement as a legitimate policy tool for improving the efficiency of the US economy, rather than just a last resort against truly egregious examples of business collusion, the Pilkington suit could herald a number of new cases against both foreign and US companies. Ms Diane Wood, who heads the international anti-trust division at the justice department, said yesterday that the case would be regarded abroad as 'a broad assertion of jurisdiction' by the US. 'We won't bring these cases unless there is a big impact in the US market and the company is present here in the US,' she said. Anti-trust enforcement in general, under the Reagan administration of 1981-89, was reduced to a bare minimum, with the number of justice department investigations initiated under the major US monopoly, merger and restraint of trade acts dropping by half to two thirds of the rate during the Carter administration of 1977-81. Under the Bush administration, which ended early last year, the number of enforcement actions dropped even further, although Mr William Barr, then the attorney-general, took some steps to swing anti-trust policy back to earlier principles. Those steps included the 1992 reversal of the policy on the overseas reach of US action, a measure seen at the time mostly as a vehicle for attacking the cartel-like practices of Japan's keiretsu groupings, but now implemented for the first time against a UK company.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Maytag decides against Australian flotation Maytag, the US home appliance manufacturer, is abandoning plans to float its Australian and New Zealand-based white goods and floor care appliance operations. It blamed the recent deterioration and weakness of the Australian stockmarket, especially for new offerings, and said it could see greater value in retaining the operations, rather divesting them 'into a down market'. The decision to abandon the flotation of Hoover Australia follows several days of rumours that the sale was in trouble. Earlier in the week, there was speculation that the price at which the shares were to be sold might have to be cut from ADollars 1 to 85 cents because of lack of interest among institutional investors and potential sub-underwriters. Maytag first announced plans to sell the businesses in May, saying it would prefer to do so by way of a stockmarket flotation. The operations were formerly part of the Hoover group, which was taken over by Maytag in 1988. Hoover Australia is reckoned to have about 18 per cent of the white goods market in its home country. Analysts had expected the sale to raise between ADollars 100m (Dollars 73m) and ADollars 150m.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Lyell reinforces stance on Levitt Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday again defended the Serious Fraud Office's handling of the trial of Mr Roger Levitt. He insisted prosecuting lawyers had not been told the businessman's barristers intended to cite other cases where fraudsters received suspended sentences before the SFO agreed to Mr Levitt's guilty plea. The controversy of the plea bargain arose after Mr Levitt received a 180-hour community service order having admitted a single charge of deceiving Fimbra, the Levitt Group's regulator - only one of a number of charges the SFO had brought against him. Controversy afterwards centred on whether the SFO was aware Mr Levitt might receive a non-custodial sentence after making such a plea. Yesterday Sir Nicholas said in a parliamentary answer that he had been told by prosecution counsel that they had not been informed of any intention by Mr Levitt's lawyers to use examples such as Mr Terry Ramsden, the former Japanese-warrants dealer given a suspended sentence after admitting fraud, during their plea-bargaining efforts. However, earlier this week the trial judge, Mr Justice Laws, agreed that transcripts of the plea-bargaining discussions could be made public. In these it is disclosed that before the SFO accepted Mr Levitt's plea, his barrister, Mr Jonathan Goldberg QC, sent a letter to Mr David Cocks, QC for the SFO. It ended: 'If you are instructed to accept such a plea, I am instructed to seek an indication from the judge on sentence and Mr Levitt will then decide what to do.' The attorney-general also enlarged on a previous statement to MPs when he admitted that discussions over the possible plea might have taken place before November 22 - the day Mr Levitt made his plea in front of the jury. In an earlier parliamentary answer Sir Nicholas denied that the SFO approached Mr Levitt about a possible plea before then. Yesterday he said discussions may have taken place before, adding: 'I have been assured by prosecuting counsel that although potential pleas may have been discussed on a counsel-to-counsel basis no offers were made by the Crown to Mr Levitt.'</p>

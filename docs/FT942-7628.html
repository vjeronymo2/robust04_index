			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Privatisation to devastate jobs Privatisation in Europe could cost more than 800,000 jobs by 1999 as sheltered nationalised industries face tougher competition, a study by six European economic research institutes warns today. The Ereco network of research institutes says that more than 120 companies in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, employing more than 3.5m people and with annual sales of Ecu400bn (Pounds 308bn), are candidates for privatisation. Ereco's forecast suggests more than one in five of the labour force in these companies will lose their jobs. The job losses would be concentrated in France, where 290,000 are expected to go, while Italy would lose 180,000 and Germany 140,000. Many jobs will disappear in telecommunications, an estimated 268,000, followed by energy (250,000) and transport (77,000). The Ereco estimates are based on Britain's experience of privatisation and subsequent corporate restructuring. UK privatised industries including British Telecom, British Gas, British Airways, British Steel and the electricity supply companies shed more than 300,000 jobs in the 1980s. It predicts that more than 1.1m jobs could be lost if restructuring is especially severe. But 'perhaps only 500,000 jobs will be shed' if output growth turns out to be particularly strong in the newly privatised industries or if governments take action to save jobs.</p>

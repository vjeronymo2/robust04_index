			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (10): Pace quickens 'IT IS happening faster than we thought it would,' says Michael Butt, chief executive of Mid Ocean Re, the first of a new generation of catastrophe reinsurance companies formed in Bermuda during the past 12 months. Mid Ocean underwrote gross premium income of Dollars 247m in its first nine months of business, recording profits of Dollars 44.4m. On a few contracts it is acting as a lead rather than simply offering a following market. And in the run-up to the January renewal season when many of the biggest reinsurance contracts are renegotiated, the company is building up its underwriting team. Jeremy Hindle joined from Swiss Re as deputy to Henry Keeling, a former Lloyd's underwriter, in October. Investors have clearly been impressed with progress to date, with the company's capital base doubling to Dollars 738m, following a successful initial public offer in the summer. And so are Mid Ocean's competitors, judging by the speed at which the world's leading reinsurers are following Mid Ocean's example. At least nine companies have been formed since the middle of this year, increasing the capital base of the catastrophe reinsurance market to more than Dollars 4bn. Among the big names investing in the island are General Re, the United States' biggest reinsurer, SCOR, France's leading reinsurer, and Swiss Re, the second biggest reinsurance company in the world, which has joined forces with Manhattan investor, John Head. The American International Group, the world's best capitalised company, which first established subsidiaries in Bermuda in 1953, has set up a new catastrophe reinsurer, IPC Reinsurance, capitalised at Dollars 300m. Indeed, among established players only Munich Re, the biggest reinsurer in the world, and Lloyd's of London are absent, although many of the new Bermudian companies intend to underwrite shares of catastrophe business originally led in London. Overall net assets held by Bermudian insurance and reinsurance companies now amount to more than Dollars 24bn. Jeffrey Conyers, of First Bermuda Securities, a local securities house describes the developments as 'absolutely astonishing'. David Saul, finance minister, says the companies represent a 'seal of approval' for Bermuda's business sector. Critics suggest that capital has been formed at such a rapid pace that it could lead top a resumption of the rate competition, undermining the 'hard market' - high rates and tight conditions - that made catastrophe reinsurance so attractive to investors in the first place. Mr Butt - and most of the rest of his colleagues in the local market - disagree. For a start underlying rates are much higher. According to Charles Skey, an underwriter who works with Mid Ocean in its London office, 'the rating basis has changed totally' in recent years with rates for all major catastrophe risks at higher levels than at any time during the past 30 years. Capital is being deployed more cautiously. Mid Ocean is underwriting on a much higher solvency margin - with premium income equal to only about a third of the company's capital base. Mr Butt suggests that by introducing tougher conditions on their proportional policies, European reinsurers are pressing many of their customers into the catastrophe reinsurance market, fuelling demand and sustaining prices.</p>

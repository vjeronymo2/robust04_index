			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Haruyuki Aikawa, member of the MAINICHI SHIBMUN </F> economic department]    [Text] It seems that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor's visit to Japan from 1 to 4 February ended as a  "disappointing trip." This is because Japan's stance of  rejecting numerical targets was firm and an attempt to find a  political compromise by holding ministerial negotiations fell  through. On the contrary, Kantor, who had demonstrated his  stance of not resuming trade negotiations unless Japan agrees to  accept the numerical targets, was forced to agree to the  resumption of vice ministerial talks.    On the evening of 2 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, international  trade and industry minister, greeted Kantor by jokingly saying:  "I met with Deputy Prime Minister Hata a little while ago. His  face was swollen up because you gave him a strong punch." At  his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently  foreign minister, Kantor, while hinting at the possibility of  applying sanctions against Japan, urged Hata to accept the  numerical targets. Kantor's appeal was so strong that Foreign  Minister Hata had to call for resumption of the meeting. Hata  felt that it would not be "beneficial to Japan if Kantor goes  home angry."    "Japan drops out of a poker game if you bluff regardless of  your cards in hand." Comparing negotiations with Japan to a  poker game, U.S. officials are reportedly cracking a joke,  saying that the best way to carry out negotiations with Japan is  to assume a hard-line stance. Kantor faithfully put this tactic  into practice.    However, many Japanese Government officials were saying,  even  before Kantor came to Japan: "All we have to do is to make  counterarguments even if Kantor strongly insists on his  demands." "Probably, Kantor himself does not think that he has a  change to win. He must be thinking that it will be a bonus if  he manages to extract a compromise from Japan." It can be said  that the Japanese Government officials knew Kantor's tactic.    On 4 February after the resumed meeting with Foreign  Minister  Hata, Kantor called his trip a "significant trip." However,  some Japanese officials analyzed Kantor's remark coolly and  said: "What he means is that he recognized the differences of  opinion between Japan and the United States and that he  confirmed Japan's stance of not making a compromise over the  numerical targets."    In addition to putting finishing touches to mapping out an  action program (action plan) regarding government procurement,  Japan is doing its best in buckling down to the task of  preparing a cooperation plan, based on efforts by private  companies, in the field of car and car parts as well. Members  of the Japanese negotiation team are saying: "The United States  will withdraw its demands at the end because Japan is doing its  best. Possibility of cooperation will expand only if the United  States withdraws its demands on the numerical targets." It is  still unknown if the negotiations will turn out as the Japanese  delegation team has figured. Everything depends on the vice  ministerial talks, which will start on 7 February in Washington.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Third Credit Auction Did Not </F> Go Ahead"]    [Text] The third credit auction to place Bank of Russia  centralized loans with Moscow banks was to have been held in  Moscow 26 April, but like the second one it did not go ahead.    According to the Central Bank of Russia's Moscow  administration, a total of 9 billion rubles was put up for  auction at an annual interest rate of 203 percent, that is 5  percent below the Central Bank rate. However, none of the  Moscow banks applied to take part in the auction.    It is thought that the reason for this is the extremely  tough  requirements that auction participants have to meet, and  therefore people wanting to buy money were simply afraid of  showing "Central Bank operatives" the state of their affairs.  At the same time "robust" Moscow establishments which could  quite easily have gained access to the auction already have  adequate resources. There is no reason for them to acquire  credit: An interbank market developed in Moscow long ago, where  money can be bought far more cheaply.</p>

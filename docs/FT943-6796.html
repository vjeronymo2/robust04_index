			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / People: Builder's charter - The costliest mistakes occur at the design stage - not on site The UK's Millennium Fund offers an opportunity to reverse the history of public building catastrophes. The Fund, which will use money raised from the country's national lottery to finance 'celebratory' capital projects, could also mark a turning point in British architecture and construction - if architects were allowed to participate with enlightened clients and produce practical and cost-effective buildings. How do some projects valued at Pounds 90m with a completion time of 24 months end up costing twice as much and taking twice as long to finish? A lack of knowledge by the lay client has encouraged poor cost-control and lax competition times. But the supply industry must share some of the blame. Professionals continue to be appointed in the wrong sequence, and are not given parity in their contracts - and gaps between contracts become a cost to the client. All contracts should be administered as part of a seamless process. Selection of the team with clear, long-established relationships between members is a prerequisite for success. What frequently happens is that each professional adds his embellishment at successive pre-construction stages. These layers of 'improvements' must be paid for and the client may be presented with costs for unwanted changes. The UK construction system generally divides into different departments the tasks of cost planning, project planning procurement, site management and commissioning, with the overall team leader far removed from decision-making. More effective would be a contractor controlling a small staff with the technical back-up and solutions which are based on the current brief rather than overcoming earlier failures. Spending more money does not ensure a better result. Developments in the commercial office world have proved that cost does not equal quality. What must be avoided is fashion-engineering where the patron is the guinea pig in the architect/builder's laboratory. A contractor's flair for cost-cutting must be counter-balanced by a robust design to protect the clients' interests and the architectural integrity. Design competitions produce stimulating new ideas, but the risk of every task of the project being subject to competition is such that it can prevent a collaborative approach between the architect, the team, the craftsmen and the client. Design-and-build and other supposed cost short-cuts allow the client to pass responsibility to the builder who then designs to a price not a quality. Construction is a difficult task, but should be a matter of logic and quality control. But construction and design must not be separated. Most clients find the building process a mystery and yet they foot the bill and carry a subordinate role in the management of the process. Such difficulties typically cost the client 30 per cent more than he should pay. All large, new projects should have patronage as well as a client. A patron must be the decision-maker, the budget-holder and must have the final decision on the project brief. The value of this role was demonstrated in the rebuilding of Glyndebourne Opera House, which was completed on time, on cost and with just one closed season. Sir George Christie, chairman of Glyndebourne, was the patron. Glyndebourne Productions performed the role of client, representing the different interests of finance, artistic, musical direction, props, wardrobe and so on. Such an arrangement is equally applicable to a gallery, a library or a bridge. Good clients have a fine understanding of their own needs, and respect professional disciplines. Likewise, many clients think they are unique in their property needs and yet when they build their one building - often their most complex undertaking - they put insufficient time and effort into pre-contract analysis. Although not as technologically advanced as, say, building an aircraft, the design and construction of property requires sophisticated management techniques, the application of ingenious engineering solutions and logistical exercises. Yet the average building still uses 1960s technology. Roofs still leak; contract periods are not met and cost over-runs can embarrass the client. In spite of its dismal record the industry has made progress in the past decade in overcoming these problems, with co-operation from trade unions, research and development by contractors, and new contract procedures, all with assistance of a new breed of architects. So can the needs of clients commissioning buildings under the Millennium Fund be translated into buildings of high quality? And can this be achieved for a price which represents good value? The construction process of any building need not be complex. It relies on a clear vision and a well-researched brief. Visits abroad to see comparable buildings are much less expensive than experimenting at home during construction. The costliest mistakes occur on the drawing broad - not on the construction site. Rectifying mistakes can cost 15 per cent of total budgets. The procurement of construction is shrouded in mystery. Good factual 'bench-mark' information on construction performance, for example, is difficult to find or jealously guarded. We all tend only to see the end-product - the building. Yet excellence in this end-result can only be achieved by excellence in the complex process by which it is achieved. Both in UK and continental Europe, there now exist architects of extraordinary talent. They must be awarded contracts based on design skills rather than lowest fees. Their knowledge will contribute to efficient construction, design excellence and innovation, all leading to better cost control. In the UK, once the professional team is signed up, the architect and contractor end up in pivotal positions. Consequently the project tends to be design- or construction-led, with the 'client' taking a subordinate role. But design and construction are just two stages in a building project. For the project to succeed, the design process needs a clearly defined target backed by a collaborative team approach. Quality is not an optional extra - whatever the budget. The lead must come from a committed client. This requires an integrated approach by an experienced client, able to add value to the procurement process: first by identifying what represents quality and value; and second, by ensuring the realisation of that value. This approach rests on a belief and a need to control the risks of procurement, coupled with the task of sustaining an overall vision. Only then will we get buildings worthy of the millennium celebrations. The author is chief executive of Stanhope Properties</p>

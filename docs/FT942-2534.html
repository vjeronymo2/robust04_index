			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: In from the cold at last - The resurgence of the Johannesburg stock market Despite South Africa's years of isolation, the Johannesburg stock market is no stranger to foreign investors - indeed, the exchange was set up largely at the behest of British financiers involved in the gold industry at the end of the last century. Rather than speculators, however, the market now is trying to attract the new masters of the global market place: fund managers and their investors. Helping the drive is the fact that, in a sharp turnaround, South Africa now is regarded as an ethical investment by many of the individuals and institutions that shunned it for its racial policies during the apartheid era. It is not just changing political considerations, however, that have led to the increased interest in the market. The JSE has performed very strongly over the past 18 months, providing attractive returns virtually across the board. And although price/earnings ratios and yields are near historical highs by local standards, the market remains relatively undervalued when considered in a global context. The JSE's recent inclusion on several global market indices - most notably the International Finance Corporation, which tracks emerging markets - also has boosted confidence. Many funds which base their portfolios around such indices are expected to shift their weighting in favour of South Africa over the next few months, with a potential windfall of billions of dollars. Yet, although classified as an emerging market, the JSE is better regarded as a re-emerging market. It is a mature body with a wide range of stocks; a market capitalisation around Dollars 160 billion, putting it just outside of the world's top 10; and a well developed regulatory and legal framework. There are, however, a couple of peculiarities about the market of which the prudent investor needs to be aware. Most important, and confusing, is the country's two-tier currency. Non-residents invest using the financial rand exchange rate; this operates at a variable discount (now around 25 per cent) to the commercial rand, the country's main trading currency. Intended originally to deter foreigners from withdrawing their capital during the sanctions and disinvestment era, it also provides an attractive incentive for new investment. Because all dividends are paid in commercial rands, foreigners stand to augment substantially their yield on local shares. Nonetheless, the currency is quite volatile, especially during times of political uncertainty, and investors could just as easily see their capital gains negated from currency depreciation, even while yields soar. Another problem with the JSE is its low liquidity; annual turnover last year amounted to only 7 per cent of market capitalisation, far below global norms. This is, largely, the result of two factors: the existence of large conglomerates unwilling to trade their shareholdings; and exchange control restrictions which make it illegal for domestic investors to send funds abroad, so encouraging them to retain local blue chips. This can be irritating for foreigners who, sometimes, find their stocks have low tradeability. But the exchange authorities recently have made a number of proposals to try to improve the situation. And with further pressure coming from both inside and outside the country, it is likely things will continue to improve. Even with these problems, though, the JSE remains a relatively good bet. Just as a century ago, the most popular investments among foreigners are gold stocks, which tend to be relatively undervalued compared with their American and Australian counterparts and remain a good hedge against inflation. But several industrial shares, particularly those in building and construction, have been performing very strongly recently because of the expected rise in spending on housing under the new government's reconstruction and development programme.</p>

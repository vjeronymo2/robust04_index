			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chrysler to appeal wipers fine CHRYSLER, the US car-maker, is to appeal a federal jury's decision to fine it Dollars 11.3m for infringing inventor Mr Robert Kearns' patent for intermittment wipers, Reuter reports from Detroit. 'We believe the amount of the verdict is unreasonable and excessive, and far exceeds any possible value of the Kearns' patents,' Chrysler said. 'Chrysler developed and patented its own intermittent windscreen wiper system, which we believed and continue to believe did not infringe Mr Kearns' patents.' Mr Kearns, 64, won the patent case against Chrysler last December. A federal jury found that Chrysler infringed on four patents for intermittment wiper systems designed by Mr Kearns. However, in the latest decision, the jury ruled Chrysler's infringement was not wilful and ordered the company to pay Mr Kearns Dollars 0.90 for every vehicle sold with the wiper system between May 1977 and August 1988. According to court documents, Chrysler sold 12,564,107 vehicles during that period. Mr Kearns said he was seeking anywhere from Dollars 3 to nearly Dollars 30 per car, or Dollars 37.7m to Dollars 377m in damages. Had the jury found Chrysler's actions wilful, US District Court Judge Avern Cohen could have awarded Mr Kearns triple damages. Mr Kearns, a former engineering professor, said he would also file an appeal with the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit to seek an extension of his patents, which expired in 1988.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's mountain OPTIMISM HAS been back in fashion this week, certainly in the stock market, where the indices have been hitting new highs in London and - almost - New York. Investors, it seems, are becoming less inhibited by the patchy evidence of underlying economic improvement. In the UK, new houses have started to sell faster and the car market is coming off the bottom. Against that, the astonishing news that Sheffield council workers have voted to accept a 3.25 per cent pay cut is evidence of the weakness of the labour market as well as the growing realism of workers. Even in the US, where the recovery is much better founded, some of the data are looking less bouncy. The underlying explanation for stock market buoyancy is not to be found in the real economy but in the remarkable surge in bond markets around the world. Yields on dollar and D-Mark bonds have dropped by half a percentage point over the past month. Little has been happening to short-term interest rates so far - although the Bundesbank is sending out ever-clearer smoke signals that a cut in its officially posted rates is imminent - but long-term rates have been tumbling. Gilt-edged yields have fallen a little less rapidly than those in many other government bond markets, yet even so their showing represents an unexpected bonus for Mr Norman Lamont as he finalises his Budget. Last autumn, when gilt-edged yields reached 9 1/2 per cent, the fear was that the 1993-94 fiscal deficit might look intimidating. Today the market is eagerly lapping up gilts on yields of well under 8 1/2 per cent. The pressure is off, and in this mood the markets might scale a borrowing Everest. But the chancellor would be unwise to take his good fortune for granted. Sterling, too, has bounced off the bottom. From a low of around DM2.33 last week it has flipped back up to DM2.41, partly on a Bank of England declaration that the UK would not follow German interest rates downwards. Continental alarm Concern in continental Europe about the recession now setting in has turned to something closer to alarm. Grim figures from Philips on Thursday confirmed the structural inadequacy of much of European manufacturing industry, which has been made worse by currency overvaluation. In the past the Bundesbank has been prepared to cut interest rates very sharply when the German economy has turned weak. Once it is confident it has broken the back of inflation, there is scope for short-term rates to come down a long way. For the financial markets that implies a weakening of the D-Mark and the other ERM currencies, and suddenly British assets are beginning to look more interesting as the conviction becomes more widespread that sterling may have turned. The UK is some way ahead of the Continent in the cycle of recession, so that although the past few days have seen Barclays Bank writing off an unprecedented Pounds 2.5bn in bad debts, at the same time share prices in general have been advancing to new peaks. The cautious money may now try to tap into the upsurge in UK financial assets, but bolder spirits may try to anticipate the eventual turnround in Germany and France. UK implications For the UK, the continental recession has conflicting implications. The release of financial resources across Europe will bring down interest rates and exchange rates, reducing some of the Bank of England's fears about imported inflation. Surplus capital flows will make it easier for the British government to attract foreign finance for its deficit. On the other hand, the prospects for exports are obviously damaged, despite the gains in competitiveness that have been brought about by the escape from the ERM. Whatever the financial green shoots, employment prospects have become scarcely less grim. Social strains are growing. And this week has brought a rare dispute at Ford, as the company seeks to exploit its greater bargaining power in a rapidly weakening labour market. A symbolic statement of the dramatic shifts taking place in the global economy has come with reports that the Ravenscraig steel plant so controversially closed down is likely to be shipped to Malaysia and reassembled by an Indonesian company. So although the London stock market is making new highs the momentum is not great, with the FT-SE 100 Index up less than 3 per cent since the beginning of January. In the UK bonds are outperforming equities so far in 1993, as they have in most other countries for the past two years. The markets are in long-unexplored territory here, because gilt-edged yields are lower than for 20 years. The evidence from the US, however, is that the buoyancy of the bond market can survive even a reasonable economic upturn, although the US bond market has at least had the benefit of promises (though not the fact) of greater fiscal virtue. For gilts the global bull market in bonds has brought unexpected stimulus, but Mr Lamont will still have to do his stuff.</p>

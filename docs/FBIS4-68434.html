			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. Temchin, under the rubric "Investments": </F> "Where to Put Capital: In Snickers or Lathes?: Commercial  Structures Offer Their Assistance to State Enterprises"]    [Text] Something seems to be starting to change in our sick  economy: for the first time a group of major businessmen, at  their own initiative, have approached Anatoliy Ogurtsov,  chairman of Roskommash [RF Committee on Machinebuilding], with  an offer to collaborate. It used to be just the opposite:  Roskommash sought out partners among commercial structures. But  didn't find any. It is more profitable to invest capital in  Snickers than in lathes or turbines. There is practically no  risk involved, and a speedy accumulation of capital is ensured.  Machinebuilding is a long and risky affair.    Russia's machinebuilding complex finds itself in a very  difficult position--mutual nonpayments, a lack of working  capital, difficulties with the market and output, and so on.  Last year mutual nonpayments and creditor indebtedness reached  nearly 6 trillion rubles [R]. In January another more than R1  trillion was racked up. Tractor and combine plants are standing  idle; the collectives of our glorious auto giants have been put  on forced leave; and our lathe builders and instrument makers  are just barely working.    One of the instigators of the meeting with the  industrialists, Aleksandr Yefanov, chairman of the board of  directors of the Mikrodin AO (joint-stock company), stated that  commercial structures possess sufficient capital to support  financially several sites of the machinebuilding complex, but  doing this will require above all strictly selecting, with the  help of experts, pilot projects for potentially progressive  output that is certain to be competitive and that will enjoy  elevated demand on the domestic as well as the foreign market.  "Mikrodin AO," he said, "is a happy exception. We have no  problems with marketing our output or with nonpayments." He  explained that it is just a matter of the system he put  together: NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design  work]--financial organization--marketing. These are the three  whales on which the Mikrodin association rests. First an  interesting and promising project, then a study of its marketing  possibilities, and, after that, its financing. The main  misfortune of many enterprises is that they do not use this kind  of system, or in any event they lack the two most important  links in the chain--marketing and financing. Abroad, banks work  with industry in the closest possible way. This has not been set  up here.    One person who spoke in the wake of the industrialists said  that work in this direction is our last hope. Someone else added  that this meeting between financiers and industrialists could  become a historic turning point in machinebuilding. In short,  fine words were spoken at this conference, hopeful words.    But I sat there and listened and thought that many fine and  hopeful words had been spoken in recent years, but the reality  is much worse. Tens of plants have come to a complete  standstill, hundreds are working three or four days a  week--there is no money even for salaries. The reasons for this  misfortune are well understood by everyone, and there are plenty  of plans for getting out of this labyrinth, but just which of  them will lead us out into the bright market future? We are  drowning in macroprograms, of which we are periodically  informed, but how do are they going to be carried out on the  microlevel? What specific plans are there on this score?    Anatoliy Ogurtsov, Roskommash's chairman, told me that a few  days ago the leaders of the industrial committees, famous  academicians, and representatives of bankings structures had  gathered and discussed how to get out of the present impasse,  and they never did come to a unanimous opinion. Each group has  its own macroprogram, each of which contains good ideas, but  they mesh badly. At Roskommash they made an attempt to  synthesize them. A working group of 11 highly experienced  financial analysts was created. They got hold of "outsider"  programs (although this is not always easy; we have retained the  old habit of not showing "outsiders" our "secrets"), subjected  these programs to painstaking analysis, selected the most  far-sighted elements, and added their own.    At the meeting between the machinebuilders and the "sharks"  of capital, several contradictions were noted in the goals of  industrialists and financiers. Most important to the former, in  order for such giants as ChTZ [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant],  Rostselmash, and others like them to take up work again, was  that their investment return workers and engineers from their  forced leave. The other side was interested in something else.  The president of the inter-branch commercial Resurs Bank, Semen  Epshteyn, said sternly that bankers were acting in this instance  not as altruists or as patrons, but were guided above all by the  desire to defend our market against foreign intervention. And  there is only one way to do that: by investing in pilot  projects. But these have to be selected very carefully, not only  for their technical characteristics but also for their marketing  possibilities as well. Banks are not going to invest capital in  something that the market doesn't demand and that will not yield  a definite profit.    In his opinion, it makes no sense to invest capital now in a  tractor or combine giant, because their current mass output is  not in demand in the market. All you can do here is get bogged  down and go bankrupt. It would be another matter if there were  new developments that were promising from a marketing aspect. In  that case there would be food for thought.    After the second meeting, Roskommash created in quick order  its own expert commissions, which must choose what they think  are the most promising projects.    These will be subjected to expert banking analysis, and then  they will see.    The fact itself is important. For the first time in the  years  of economic reforms, commercial structures have turned away from  Snickers and toward machinebuilding, which never yields quick or  large dividends anywhere in the world but does ensure the  prosperity of all other branches.    This meeting of young native capital and our old  machinebuilding may set off a saving spark. We will have to wait  a month. That was the deadline set.</p>

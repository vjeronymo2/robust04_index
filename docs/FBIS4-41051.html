			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- Having the tendency to further  aggravation was the description of the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan frontier given at the press bureau of the Russian  border guards where the ITAR-TASS correspondent inquired today.    According to the border guards' reports, the movement of  groups of fighters from the provinces of Konduz and Takhor in  Afghanistan toward Badakhshan continues, for the purpose of  further dispatch to the territory of Tajikistan. By 22 June the  number of fighters has reached some 900 men.    The personnel of the Pyanj, Moscow, and Khorog frontier  detachments have since 18 June, in five instances prevented  illegal crossings of armed gangs of Tajikistan's Islamic Revival  Movement into the territory of the Republic. Leaders of the  irreconcilable Tajik opposition and field commanders have been  given instructions to mount a series of armed and diversionary  operations against the subunits of the Pyanj and Moscow frontier  detachments, and also against the civilian population of the  frontier regions of Tajikistan.    At the press bureau of the Russian border guards it was  reported that on the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous  Oblast, in the past few days narcotics traders have twice  attempted to blockade the frontier detachment's base so as to  provoke the Russian border guards into taking counter measures.    The border guards are taking the necessary measures to  prevent any provocations or cases of frontier violations and are  prepared to act with utmost decisiveness.</p>

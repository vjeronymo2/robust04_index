			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Time spent on the freeway isn't necessarily wasted, despite what some critics  of Southern California say. First, an automobile trip is the ideal opportunity  to shape up your body, as two Northridge authors made clear in "Commuter  Calisthenics" a couple of years ago. The book outlined 70 on-the-road  exercises, from the two-handed ceiling push (not recommended at high speeds or  in convertibles) to the seat-belt sit-up.  </P> <P> And now, for the motoring chef, comes "Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only!  Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine."  </P> <P> Among the recipes offered by authors Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller is  "Melrose Avenue Chicken," a chicken-olive oil concoction that should be wrapped  in aluminum foil (thoroughly), placed on a suitably hot part of the engine  surface (they prefer the exhaust manifold) and cooked "for one hour, turning  when halfway done."  </P> <P> (Thus, if you throw your Melrose Chicken on the engine as you head out for  Thousand Oaks from downtown L.A. in rush-hour traffic, it would probably be  best to exit in Encino to flip it. More sophisticated chefs might want to  consider the purchase of a Mazda equipped with a rotisserie engine.)  </P> <P> The authors point out that since Angelenos "spend a good part of each day in  their cars," anyway, engine cooking (in lieu of restaurant dining) will enable  them to save "money that would be better spent on real estate."  </P> <P> Then there's the energy-savings angle. This form of cuisine gives new meaning  to the phrase, "cooking with gas."  </P> <P> It could rank as the most unusual taped replay of the basketball season.  </P> <P> On Sunday, several viewers called CBS to complain that a Laker ball boy had  flashed a gang sign during a break in the Lakers-Celtics game at the Forum.  </P> <P> Laker officials confronted the teen-ager, who admitted only that he had given  the Celtics a one-finger salute.  </P> <P> Gang experts from the Inglewood Police Department were asked to referee the  matter. They watched a videotape and ruled that the gesture was a gang sign.  </P> <P> "The incident is very regrettable and quite obviously does not reflect the  feelings of the Lakers players, fans or organization," said Forum spokesman Bob  Steiner.  </P> <P> The ball boy, Steiner added, "will not be back."  </P> <P> Thad Taylor, who founded the Shakespeare Society of America in 1964 and created  West Hollywood's Globe Playhouse in 1972, first tried to get The Bard a star on  Hollywood's Walk of Fame 13 years ago.  </P> <P> Lord, what fools these mortals be.  </P> <P> The quest is hopeless, and not because some critics have charged that everyone  from Christopher Marlowe to Neil Simon wrote plays credited to Shakespeare.  </P> <P> The main problem is that Walk of Fame politics conspire against the dead  playwrights society. Hollywood prefers personalities who are willing and able  to appear at the star-unveiling ceremonies. Alas, long-gone Will can't supply a  "photo opportunity."  </P> <P> But on Tuesday, Terry Tamminen did stand in for The Bard as he unveiled a  plaque for Shakespeare outside the Globe. Makes you wonder how the boy would  have done if only he'd had an agent.  </P></p>

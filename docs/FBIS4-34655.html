			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Bardial] </F>   [Text] Luis Paulo Rosenberg told PAGINA 12: "If Lula [Luiz  Inacio da Silva] wins the October presidential elections he will  probably impose a style of government that is nearer to Mexico  than to Argentina. He will dedicate more money to social  programs; he will slow down the privatization process; and he  will open up the economy and maintain a social balance."  Rosenberg wrote a document entitled: "The PT [Workers Party] In  Government," which has lately become something of a best seller  among Brazilian businessmen, executives, and industrialists.    The authors spent three months researching the subject and  published only 500 issues of the document on 31 May. It has 40  pages and it sells for $100 among powerful Sao Paulo  businessmen. Wladimir Pomar, former Lula campaign manager  during the 1989 presidential election and current PT dissident,  is one of the authors.    Rosenberg currently directs a private consulting firm in Sao  Paulo. He was one of the advisers of controversial former  Economy Minister Delfim Netto, one of the gray eminences of the  so-called "Brazilian miracle" during the military regime  (1964-83).    PAGINA 12 has had access to the document. It is based on  the assumption that PT leader "Lula" will probably be elected  president in October. To charge $100 dollars for something that  almost everybody knows seems a bit steep, especially in light of  surveys which in the past months have given the PT candidate  nearly 40 percent of the vote, the highest among all candidates  seeking to get to the Planalto Palace in Brasilia. Rosenberg's  work, however, summarizes the history of the PT since its  foundation in 1978. It analyzes relations among its diverse  internal factions and presents a biographical-political profile  of its main leaders, which makes it a Who's Who [previous two  words in English] of essential reading for those who believe the  future is fraught with dark "red" forecasts.    The book explains that the organization include movements  from a broad spectrum of political positions: liberals,  Christian socialists, social democrats, revolutionary  socialists, Trotskyites, and ultras, who are known as "Shiites"  due to their fundamentalist radicalism. The document stresses,  however, that "within Lula's pendular system of politics, the  center holds the balance."    Regarding military reaction, Rosenberg rules out any  possibility of unrest in the barracks if Lula wins. "The Armed  Forces will not interfere in the electoral process," he  categorically states.    The Sao Paulo consultant believes sociologist Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister and presidential  candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), who is  currently second in the surveys, also has "a very good chance."  The document states that this is the case even though he "has  no charisma and his political campaign is somewhat amateurish."  Rosenberg assumes Cardoso's economic plan will lower inflation  and stresses that "Brazilian gratitude toward anyone who reduced  inflation from 45 percent a month to 3 percent is bound to be  enormous."    Lula proposes a pact between the government, entrepreneurs,  and workers to lower the inflation rate. His plan contemplates  strong state intervention in the economy, changes within the  financial system, and measures such as price control and a fight  against oligopolies.    Rosenberg gives no chance to Orestes Quercia of the  Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) or Leonel Brizola, former Rio  de Janeiro State governor of the Democratic Workers Party (PDT),  who are the other presidential candidates. Rosenberg says the  former "is unparalleled in his political professionalism and is  a born winner, but his past is so full of corruption charges."  Rosenberg briefly describes Brizola as "an unburied corpse."    Political scientist Francisco Weffort, one of the most  brilliant minds within the PT, has explained the new winds -- or  rather, the new breeze -- blowing through the organization.  Tactics have changed since the 1982 election when the PT  campaign slogan was: "Vote for number three, the rest are  bourgeoisie." Lula's ballot number was three.    "The PT currently has a more open alliance policy than in  the  past," Weffort says. The PT "under Lula seeks alliances with  entrepreneurs and the middle class, although not exclusively.  He has done a good job in overcoming the mistrust of  entrepreneurs, but Fernando Henrique Cardoso has more weight  with them."    Weffort gave an example: "Making alliances is not easy. It  is like getting married. It is not enough for one side to want  it, the other side must want it too." Weffort said the PT  "always wanted an alliance with the PDT, but Brizola speaks out  against Lula almost every day." Weffort does not rule out a  possible approach to Fernando Henrique Cardoso's party.    This possibility is not so very far fetched (in fact, the  closer the date of the election, the more far fetched is  everything else in this country, which is filled with apparent  irrational political attitudes). Edmar L. Bacha, economist,  academician, author of the plan that seeks to rescue Brazil from  its high inflationary process, and Cardoso's assistant during  his administration at the Economy Ministry expressed himself in  similar terms last March: "Lula cannot govern alone. He will  have to seek alliances." To avoid any doubts, he added: "PT  deputies are very responsible and highly trained people. It is  true that the party has many radicals at the grassroots, but  there is nothing to prevent what we call the light [preceding  word in English] PT faction prevailing once Lula is in  government."    Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva usually listens to his advisers'  proposals. The 21 members of the National Executive Committee  participate in his campaign planning. Its most important  members are:     -  Jose Graziano is an agronomist with a PhD from  the University of London. He has listed the most serious  problems that the PT must address. He carries a folder on  important issues and advises the candidate on how to handle  problems.    -  Ricardo Kotscho is a journalist. He is not a PT  member; he is a public relations adviser. Those who know him  well say he is "a propaganda producing machine" who specializes  in special effects.    -  Wander Bruno do Prado is Lula's personal  secretary. He organizes Lula's famous "caravans" throughout the  country. He establishes the routes, the length, lunching  places, hotels, and transportation 40 to 50 days in advance of  each electoral tour.    -  Gilberto Carvalho is a former seminarist  and employee of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops.  It is said that very few people know better what each important  religious figure thinks in the country. He is a close friend of  Lula but has less influence than those listed above. He is  Lula's main contact with the Church.    -  Hamilton Pereira is a  former guerrilla and former political prisoner. He takes care  of the candidate's engagements agenda. He is a poet who won the  House of the Americas' prize with poems he wrote while in jail.</p>

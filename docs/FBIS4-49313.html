			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China appreciates the  remarks made by U.S. President Clinton that his government is  willing to make efforts to develop and improve U.S.-China  relations, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.    The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, was commenting on the remarks  made  by Clinton when he was answering a question from a correspondent  of the Cable News Network (CNN) here this afternoon at a weekly  press conference.    Wu said that the Chinese side has already made tremendous  efforts to improve and develop relations between the two  countries, and that it is willing, together with the U.S. side,  to make continuous efforts to this end.    China and the United States are two influential world  powers,  and the development of stable and constructive relations between  them conforms with the fundamental interests of the two  countries and their peoples, and also serves to promote peace  and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at  large, he said.    Wu said that there exists broad common interests between  China and the United States, and there are also some differences  between them on certain issues.    The spokesman stressed that what is important at present is  that the two countries should develop their common points and  handle their differences properly, in strict accordance with the  basic principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint  communiques and on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference  in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutually  beneficial cooperation.</p>

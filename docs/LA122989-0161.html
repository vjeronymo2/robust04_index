			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACISM TOPIC REAPS THREATS ON RADIO HOST  </P> <P> A radio talk show host who had just finished a program on racism said he  received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio personality whose  murder was linked to white supremacists.  </P> <P> Mike Gallagher, whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he  had just completed his shift Thursday when he received a telephone call from a  man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina  town.  </P> <P> Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk  show host who was gunned down in 1984. The slaying was linked to a white  supremacist neo-Nazi group.  </P> <P> Gallagher, who reported the incident to station officials, left WFBC around 2  p.m. to go to lunch. He said he found a note on his car windshield that  included a racial remark, another reference to Berg and a warning that "you're  a dead man."  </P> <P> After the letter was discovered, station officials contacted authorities.  </P> <P> The threat came after Gallagher and his callers discussed the controversy over  a South Carolina sheriff who had been accused of using a racial slur.  </P> <P> "I was very adamant about it, and we were batting it back and forth, and it got  emotional," Gallagher said. "Apparently, a guy called the switchboard during  the show and threatened my life."  </P> <P> Greenville Police Detective Randy White said a preliminary investigation did  not determine whether the threat was serious.  </P></p>

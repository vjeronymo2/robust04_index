			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Excerpts] The immediate objective of the PT [Workers  Party] is to attract the support of former Rio de Janeiro  Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] in order  to win the presidential election in the first round. This move  seeks to confront the broad alliance being created around the  candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso  of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. This was the  main issue on the agenda of the PT national executive board  meeting with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign coordinating  board in Sao Paulo yesterday.    PT leaders are scared and do not want to waste time. They  want to create in Brasilia today -- during a meeting of the  parties allied to the PT -- a commission headed by Lula and PSB  [Brazilian Socialist Party] President Miguel Arraes to talk with  Brizola. They are even hinting of offering the vice presidency  to the PDT. "We have an agreement with the PSB, but if the PDT  joins the front we will reevaluate the matter," Lula admitted.  [passage omitted]    During the middle of last week, PT Vice President Aloizio  Mercadante said an alliance with Brizola "was not at all  viable," but yesterday he was considering inviting the former  governor to attend the next meeting of parties that support the  PT -- which until now just included the PC do B [Communist Party  of Brazil] and the PSB. "We want to broaden the scope of the  next meeting by inviting Brizola and other left-wing leaders,  and intellectuals and artists." The date for such a meeting  will be announced in Brasilia today. PT Secretary General  Gilberto Carvalho said that on Tuesday [not further specified],  he and another of Lula's other trusted men, government program  coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia, met with a PDT legislator and  one of Brizola's assistants in Rio to discuss the possibility of  meeting with the governor to ask him for his support.</p>

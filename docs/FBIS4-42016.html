			<p>BFN     [Text] On 29 June Lionel Soto, vice president of the  Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, who is on an  official visit to Ukraine, and Ukraine's Transport Minister  Orest Klympush signed a merchant shipping agreement. There has  long been a need for this document, Lionel Soto said. I am  convinced that the agreement initiates a new stage in our  relations. As of today we can carry on trade right across the  sea, because Cuba is an island state and this is the only way to  communicate with the outside world.</p>

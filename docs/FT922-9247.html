			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Competitiveness of exports bears up under pressure THE COMPETITIVENESS of Germany's exporters has been dented by rising wage inflation since unification, but it will take a few more high pay settlements before the gains of recent years are whittled away. German unit labour costs  - the wage cost per unit of output produced - are now rising faster than those of its main European competitors and, with exchange rates fixed in the European exchange rate mechanism, this growth feeds directly to lost export competitiveness. However, the rise in the unit labour costs of German manufacturing industry since 1987 is still lower than for manufacturers in France, Italy and the UK, as the right-hand chart shows. German wage earnings have grown faster than those in France since 1987, the year of the last important realignments within the ERM. But Germans' superior productivity growth record has meant that its unit labour costs have risen by less than those of French industry. The UK and Italy have seen larger increases in both earnings and unit labour costs than in Germany. In part, the rise in German wage inflation results from the economic consequences of unification and the demand boom sparked off by a rise in consumer spending by east Germans  - funded largely by hand-outs from the western government. However, it is also a product of pre-unification tensions. The latter half of the 1980s was a period of unusual wage restraint. In return for a drop in working hours, the unions agreed to moderate their wage demands. With hindsight, the unions overestimated the cost to employers of the fall in working hours. As a result the share of national income distributed to labour fell to levels not seen since the early 1970s. The strikes are partly the result of union attempts to claw back labour's share. The Bundesbank has responded to rising inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates across Europe; while the government, faced with a ballooning fiscal deficit, has pushing up income taxes. The recent crop of wage demands is the direct manifestation of the refusal of west German workers to accept a fall in their after-tax incomes. Despite Germany's boom, and slow or zero growth elsewhere in Europe, UK and Italian wage inflation remains higher than in Germany.</p>

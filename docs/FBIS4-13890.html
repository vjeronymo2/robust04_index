			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA) -- Tariq 'Aziz, official in  charge of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party, today received here a Jordanian Islamic Action  Front delegation. The delegation, which is currently visiting  the country, is led by 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah.    Tariq 'Aziz stressed that thanks to the wisdom of President  Saddam Husayn and the resolve of the Iraqi people, Iraq has  managed to rebuild what the evil and arrogant forces have  destroyed, despite the continuation of the unjust blockade  against it. He said that when people have sincere and faithful  leaders with clear objectives, they manage to hold fast and  attain their objectives. Such is the case in Iraq, he noted.  He added: Despite all difficulties, we in Iraq are optimistic  about the future.    Al-'Akayilah praised the Iraqi people's steadfastness and  courage in confronting the aggressors and the iniquitous  blockade. He said that Iraq has initiated the phenomenon of  defying the world's arrogant powers, and that Iraq represents  the Arab nation's ammunition for confronting the serious plot  targeting Arabism and Islam.    The two sides stressed the importance of cooperation and  coordination between pan-Arabist and Islamic forces and  movements in the joint struggle against the imperialist and  Zionist plots and threats.</p>

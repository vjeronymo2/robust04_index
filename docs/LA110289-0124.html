			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALINAS, AMID JEERS, DEFENDS HIS ECONOMIC PROGRAM;  </P> <P> MEXICO: THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST STATE-OF-THE-NATION ADDRESS ALSO CRITICIZES BIG  GOVERNMENT.  </P> <P> In a display of Mexico's growing political pluralism, President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari delivered his first state-of-the-nation speech Wednesday amid jeers  from hostile lawmakers, then flew to this northern city to attend the  inauguration of the country's first opposition governor.  </P> <P> Salinas made a dramatic break with the past during his nationally televised  speech, criticizing the big, paternalistic government that emerged from the  1910 Mexican Revolution and has prevailed for the last 70 years.  </P> <P> The president defended his controversial economic "modernization" program,  which has allowed the sale of valuable state enterprises once considered  untouchable. He said the role of the state now should be limited to defending  the country's sovereignty and carrying out justice.  </P> <P> "The reality is that in Mexico, a larger state has resulted in less capacity to  respond to the social demands of our fellow citizens," Salinas said.  </P> <P> "The state concerned itself more with administering its properties than with  meeting pressing social needs."  </P> <P> Salinas also declared that the massive agrarian reform program that stemmed  from the revolution is all but over.  </P> <P> "Large-scale land distribution has been completed. Anyone who asserts that  there are still millions of acres of land to be distributed is lying," he said.  </P> <P> As Salinas addressed a joint session of Congress at the Palace of Fine Arts in  Mexico City, more than 10,000 teachers, musicians and government health workers  demonstrated outside for higher wages and union democracy.  </P> <P> Salinas was interrupted and booed at least 10 times during his two-hour speech  by lawmakers from the left-of-center Democratic Revolutionary Party and small  parties that oppose his economic program and charge that his government is  undemocratic.  </P> <P> Nearly half the lower-house Chamber of Deputies is made up of opposition  members as a result of the 1988 national elections in which the official  Institutional Revolutionary Party received its lowest vote ever in 60 years of  rule. That event has changed the face of politics in Mexico, allowing for  once-unheard-of practices such as jeering the president's annual speech.  </P> <P> Salinas praised the clean gubernatorial election in Baja California, which gave  victory to the conservative National Action Party's candidate, Ernesto Ruffo  Appel, while National Action legislators chanted, "Ruffo! Ruffo!"  </P> <P> A former mayor of Ensenada, Ruffo beat the ruling party's candidate in a hotly  contested election last July. Salinas' national party chairman recognized the  opposition victory over the protests of state party officials.  </P> <P> National Action also won the mayoralties of Tijuana and Ensenada, but the  ruling party, called PRI, held on to Tecate and the state capital, Mexicali.  </P> <P> Ruffo attended the president's speech in Mexico City. The two of them then flew  aboard the president's plane to Mexicali to attend Ruffo's inauguration for a  six-year term.  </P> <P> Ruffo took his oath of office in a state auditorium amid the deafening cheers  of thousands of supports. Addressing Salinas, Ruffo said, "We know we are  beginning a new stage in the history of Mexico here and we sincerely want the  best for our nation. . . . I believe you govern for all Mexicans as I will  govern for all Baja Californians."  </P> <P> Salinas, who lost Baja California in last year's presidential election, was  greeted with a standing ovation. In a receiving line afterwards, hundreds of  people shook his hand and thanked him for honoring the elections.  </P> <P> But earlier, during Salinas' State of the Union speech speech, members of the  Democratic Revolutionary Party shouted, "What about Michoacan?" and "We  repudiate electoral fraud!"  </P> <P> Their party, led by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, accuses the government of stealing the  Michoacan state legislative election on the same day as the Baja vote. National  Action leaders also charge the government with fraud in the Mazatlan and  Culiacan mayoral races last month in Sinaloa state.  </P> <P> In his speech, Salinas applauded a controversial electoral reform package  approved by the Congress last month that is supposed to ensure fair national  elections in the future. He noted that for the first time, the PRI needed  opposition support for the two-thirds majority required to pass a  constitutional reform.  </P> <P> National Action voted with the government party, but the Democratic  Revolutionary Party charged that the reform accomplished nothing.  </P> <P> "Counter-reform!" they shouted as Salinas spoke.  </P> <P> Without mentioning their party by name, Salinas lambasted "small groups that  dogmatically insist on all or nothing."  </P> <P> National Action Party deputies apparently did not take part in the verbal  hostility, but they refused to stand or applaud the president.  </P> <P> Their congressional leader, Abel Vicencio Tovar, defended his party's support  for slow, moderate reforms.  </P> <P> "An all-or-nothing strategy has resulted in a history of leaping from failure  to failure," he said.  </P> <P> Salinas attempted to show that his economic reforms are paying off. His  government has sold the nation's largest airline, Mexicana, as well as parts of  the basic commodities company, Conasupo, and parts of the state telephone  company.  </P> <P> He is allowing private investment in petrochemicals production, although the  national petroleum company, Pemex, remains in government hands.  </P> <P> Salinas said the nation's economy grew 2.5% the first six months of the year,  and he projected a year-end growth rate of 2.5% to 3%. He said inflation is  running 17.3% annually -- a rate that he called the lowest in more than a  decade. Mexico's foreign reserves are $7.3 billion. Salinas said his  government's agreement with commercial banks to reduce a $100-billion foreign  debt was "sufficient," but opposition legislators shouted their disagreement.  </P></p>

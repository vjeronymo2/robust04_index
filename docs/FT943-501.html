			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Opposition forms voting bloc in Japan Nine Japanese opposition parties and groups yesterday formed a parliamentary voting bloc, a decisive step towards creation of the first strong opposition party in nearly 50 years. The new Kaikaku, or Renovation, group commands 187 lower house seats, slightly less than the 200-member Liberal Democratic Party, the biggest member of the three-party government coalition of conservatives and socialists. Renovation's birth fruit of intensive backroom negotiations over the summer puts pressure on the three-month-old government as it prepares for its first parliamentary session, due to start tomorrow. Group members aim to turn themselves into a party proper in November, once they have settled on a leader. Former Premiers Tsutomu Hata and Toshiki Kaifu are top contenders, a TV poll showed yesterday. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who brought together the previous two government coalitions and helped form the group, will take behind-the-scenes control of Renovation as chairman of its action committee, similar to a chief whip. He is unlikely to stand for the party leadership, preferring to exercise influence from the wings. Renovation's moderate policies are close to those of the government, though its leading members lean toward a slightly more assertive foreign and defence stance. A statement yesterday promises to pursue 'a politics of responsibility that does not postpone problems'. Its members broadly support the most important bills due to come to parliament this autumn, on electoral and tax reform, but will seize on any weaknesses in the government coalition to woo defectors. Mr Ozawa's 62-seat Japan Renewal Party, dominant member of the previous two coalition governments, is Renovation's largest member, followed by the 52-seat Komeito (Clean Government) party, supported by Soka Gakkai, a cash-and-vote-rich Buddhist organisation. Renovation's arrival springs partly from the financial and political incentives for the opposition to close ranks before a new political and electoral system takes effect at the turn of the year. From January, political parties will qualify for a Y30.5bn (Pounds 198m) annual public subsidy, designed to reduce their dependence on corporate donors. Larger parties will qualify for a disproportionately larger subsidy than smaller ones, because the share-out is determined by parties' spending in the previous year. The parties in Renovation have little chance of a combined majority if they individually fight a general election under the new system, voting projections by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper show. How much power to be accorded Mr Ozawa is another issue yet to be clarified. before the merger can be consummatedMr Ozawa's allies value his political skill but this is tinged with wariness of being dominated by him. Soka Gakkai's position is sensitive because of Japan's separation of state and religion.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA VERNE ALSO MUST CONSIDER ECONOMICS  </P> <P> I am all for preserving the small-town atmosphere in La Verne. In fact, it is  one of the qualities that makes La Verne a special place to live.  </P> <P> However, the reality of our time dictates that there must be a balance between  the small-town quality and the economic stability of the community.  </P> <P> Mr. (Bob) Mastro (Times, July 8) says that Edwards (Cinema Co.) refuses to  compromise on the size of the theaters. Edwards owns numerous successful  theaters and knows what works and what does not. How many does Mr. Mastro own?  </P> <P> Although I am not in the pharmacy business, using Mr. Mastro's logic, I am  qualified to tell him how to run his business.  </P> <P> Mr. Mastro should reduce the size of his pharmacy to no more than 10 feet by 10  feet. This would make a very quaint little store that would fit nicely into the  small-town atmosphere he so desires.  </P> <P> JANE SPAW  </P> <P> La Verne  </P></p>

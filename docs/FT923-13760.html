			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The Long View: The cost of safe pensions AT LAST there are indications of a shift in investment strategy by British pension funds. It looks as though they began to buy gilt-edged securities during the second quarter of the year. And the recent persistent weakness of UK equities suggests that some of the funds for the government bond purchases may well have come from sales of equities. Certainly the pension funds, and other institutions, have been highly choosy participants in the current troubled round of equity flotations. There are sound investment reasons for this rebalancing exercise. But there is also room for concern that legal and regulatory pressures may be starting to influence pension funds too. In the wake of the Maxwell scandals pension schemes face a new wave of controls and restrictions, including the possible introduction of a compensation scheme. It is already time to think about what the investment implications might be. The investment strategy of British corporate pension funds reached a uniquely aggressive extreme earlier this year. During the first quarter UK pension funds were buyers of Pounds 2.8bn of UK and overseas equities and sellers of Pounds 200m of gilts. By the end of March, according to Caps, which measures pension fund performance, the average fund's total exposure to equities had reached an all-time peak of 84 per cent. Around the world this strategy is unparalleled. True, in many countries pension funds must comply with laid-down investment guidelines. Governments which happen to have large borrowing requirements say that in the interests of prudence (naturally) pension schemes must invest a large percentage of their resources in government bonds. But even where pension schemes have complete investment freedom it is rare for their equity exposure to be much more than 50 per cent. Equities are, of course, risky. Share prices can be volatile and in 1987 they dropped by 25 per cent or so overnight. Back in 1974 the UK equity market reached such a freakishly low level that it threatened the solvency of various financial institutions and triggered the otherwise unnecessary collapse of Burmah Oil. In the long run equities offer the best returns. But institutions can only endure a high exposure to equities if they are insulated from short-term price fluctuations. British pension funds enjoy an infrastructure that gives precisely that protection. They are valued not on the basis of market prices but on a so-called actuarial valuation basis which focuses upon income. The huge pension fund surpluses in recent years have arisen not so much from buoyant stock markets as from the surge in dividends. In 1992, it is true, dividend growth has come to a halt, but during the five years to 1989 dividends almost doubled. I have a vivid memory from my period as a trustee of the FT pension scheme. In 1987, just after the crash, the trustees gathered apprehensively to discuss the investment performance. We need not have worried. There was no problem, the actuary assured us, dividend income had risen and so the actuarial value of the fund had gone up. This protection extends to the accounting methods. UK companies report their pension fund contributions according to the SSAP 24 accounting standard which accepts the highly smoothed results of the actuarial valuation method. Compare this with the equivalent US standard FAS 87, based on volatile market values. Surpluses or deficiencies resulting from market movements have to be provided for in company profit statements. Understandably, US companies would be alarmed by the risk to their share price if their pension funds were to build up a large exposure to the equity market. British companies have no such worries, but problems loom. One is over discontinuance liabilities. Pension schemes must contain enough assets to cover the liabilities if they were wound up tomorrow. In the past, schemes always held a vast surplus on a discontinuance basis because if the scheme were wound up the liabilities would be frozen in money terms, whereas schemes are funded to provide for benefits linked to final salaries and therefore expected to rise over the years. But now the law provides that benefits must be upgraded in line with inflation up to 5 per cent. There is a much greater possibility that after a market crash the scheme could become insolvent on a 'mark to market' basis. The second problem could arise from the design of a possible compensation arrangement. If scheme members are to be protected against all contingencies they will require cover against a collapse of the fund's asset value. Indeed, other pension fund sponsors are going to be unwilling to pay into a compensation scheme if they fear they will be required to bail out some fund which is following an imprudent investment policy. The imposition of a compensation scheme might trigger a rethink of the whole basis of investment risk exposure. In some ways this would be a pity, because occupational pension schemes paying benefits linked to final salaries are positioned to take the very longest investment view. This does not mean it is always right for them to be 100 per cent committed to equities: market conditions vary from time to time. But they are ideally placed to supply risk capital. It is reckoned that almost a third of the shares of British listed companies are owned by occupational pension funds. If pension funds were to decide that, as in the US, an equity exposure of between, say, 50 and 60 per cent would be more appropriate a massive volume of equities would have to change hands. It would be unfortunate, but logical, if in reducing the risks of pension scheme members we were to reduce the ability of pension funds to supply risk capital.</p>

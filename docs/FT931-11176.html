			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Trade News: IMF puts its terms for Dollars 3bn loan to Moscow TALKS on a standby programme which could unlock an extra Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) International Monetary Fund loan could start when Russia confirms it will act decisively on macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reform, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, told Izvestiya yesterday. The world would 'not understand' if Moscow agreed an ambitious programme but did not implement it. Western financial support would only be forthcoming if Russia acted to strengthen monetary and financial policy. It would have to ensure 'the money stays in Russia and does not immediately end up in bank accounts in Zurich, Paris or London'. Moscow should stop hyperinflation 'at any price'; many democrats had been 'killed' by it. Any programme would have to suit not just the Fund, but be accepted by Russian society. The west had delivered all the Dollars 24bn package promised to Russia last year except for a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund. Russia had received debt relief worth Dollars 7.2bn, plus Dollars 12.6bn fresh credit from other countries, the EC, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and finally a first Dollars 1bn from the Fund. Russian exports fell 25 per cent last year to Dollars 38.1bn in sales outside the former Soviet Union, the official Goskomstat statistics agency reported.</p>

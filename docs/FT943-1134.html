			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: Mascagni's 'L'amico Fritz' - Opera in Zurich There are no prizes for naming the composer of Cavalleria Rusticana. But what other operas did Pietro Mascagni write? He completed Cav in 1889 at the age of 26, and spent his remaining 55 years trying to emulate its success. The comparative failure of his other works has given him the reputation of a one-opera composer. Now comes a production of L'amico Fritz which suggests that Mascagni's talents went further. The Zurich Opera has brought together an internationally-established tenor and soprano from Italy, Vincenzo La Scola and Daniela Dessi, and framed their performances in a staging which is pretty but never sentimental. The result is an evening of pure charm. Mascagni was aware that some critics ascribed the runaway success of Cav to the stark realism of its libretto. For his next opera, he deliberately chose a weak subject - a rustic comedy set in Alsace - in order to highlight his gifts as a composer. The big surprise of L'amico Fritz is how familiar the tunes are. There is an abundance of pastoral atmosphere, enriched by folk melody, an off-stage chorus and instrumental lines of disarming grace. The whole opera  -only 90 minutes - has a consistency of inspiration which more than compensates for the flimsy plot. Fritz is a wealthy, middle-aged bachelor who offers his vineyard to the local rabbi as a wager that he will not marry. He promptly falls in love with Suzel, daughter of one of his tenants. The vineyard is returned as a wedding present, and all live happily ever after. The gentle colours and idyllic setting of L'amico Fritz have more in common with La Sonnambula than verismo and, like the Bellini, it depends on a first-rate cast, a sensitive stage director and supportive conductor. The Zurich Opera duly obliged. The production was staged in nearby Winterthur, as part of a campaign to make the canton of Zurich (rather than the city) responsible for funding the Zurich Opera House. There was no drop in standard for the out-of-town venue. As Fritz, La Scola hit every note confidently and stylishly, without a trace of false emotion. The Italian tenor's performance was poetic, capturing the shift in character from misogyny to self-doubt and open-hearted emotion. He found a radiant partner in Dessi's Suzel. She may not be the bambina of Fritz's description, but she was comely and demure, and her classic lirico spinto soprano sounded in peak condition. There was strong support from the rest of the small cast, particularly Stefania Kaluza in the trouser role of Beppe. Grischa Asagaroff's staging, designed by Marouan Dib and Jan Skalicky, was admirably clear, but too brightly lit. The Winterthur orchestra thrived on Manfred Honeck's direction. And despite its modern, concrete appearance, the Theater am Stadtgarten contributed a pleasantly warm acoustic.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Management: Inflation lessons over a Big Mac As the site of boot camp for the shock troops in the battle to cope with Russian inflation, few places could out-class Brazil. That was the conclusion of the McDonald's Corporation. And that is why it sent a group of high-level trainees there for a crash course in how to brave inflation in a country where prices have risen by at least 400 per cent a year since 1987. Last year, Russia's rate of 1,450 per cent was one of the few to top Brazil's astounding figure of 1,149 per cent.

Could the McDonald's experience portend a boom in the export of Brazilian 'inflationary intelligence' to the troubled economies of eastern Europe? 'I think there will be a migration of people in the financial area to those countries,' observed Ferrari.

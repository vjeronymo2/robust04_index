			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): The recipient bears the risk - Money purchase schemes RECENT LEGISLATION and legal cases have raised the potential costs of providing final salary related pensions for a large number of occupational pension schemes. As a result, many in the industry expect to see a shift away from final salary (defined benefit) schemes to money purchase (defined contribution) schemes. Indeed, a survey of intermediaries conducted by Prudential Corporate Pensions suggests as many as a third of all final salary schemes may switch to money purchase. It is easy to see why an increasing number of employers is attracted to the switch. In a defined benefit scheme all the risk is borne by the employer. Whatever happens, he must pay the level of benefit promised at retirement. With a money purchase scheme, it is the scheme member who bears all the risk. There is no benefit promise; the employer and employee simply make contributions into the scheme. These are invested, and the scheme member receives the value of these investments at retirement in the form of a pension. Although a money purchase scheme may be administered and invested on a group basis, it is essentially a series of individual arrangements as far as investment risk is concerned. There is no cross-subsidy between scheme members. This question of who bears the risk is the key to understanding the differences between the investment policies of money purchase and final salary schemes. Money purchase benefits are usually determined by the build-up of each member's personal account; all contributions made on the member's behalf are credited to an account in his name. This is typically achieved by each contribution buying units in the fund, in a similar way to investing in a unit trust. The need to unitise investment if the individual's benefits are to be valued accurately is one reason why the majority of money purchase schemes are invested in off-the-peg life office managed funds or pooled funds which already have the systems for unitising investments in place. To the extent that both money purchase and final salary schemes invest in pooled managed funds, the asset spread and performance of the two types will be identical. The individually tailored option of segregated management favoured by many final salary schemes has not been generally adopted by money purchase arrangements. This is not only because of the problem of unitising investments, but is also a function of size. A fund really needs to be worth at least Pounds 10m - some would say Pounds 20m or Pounds 30m - before segregated management becomes an economical option. In the past, most money purchase schemes have been considerably smaller than this. It may be that if the prophecies are fulfilled and more and more managers choose the money purchase option, there will be more defined contribution funds of a size to consider segregated management. Mr CW Fraser Low, director of benefit consultants Willis Consulting, agrees there is nothing to stop money purchase schemes opting for segregated management. However, he admits Willis has only four money purchase clients of sufficient size to receive individual investment advice and all of these opt for the pooled investment route. Willis does, however, have a couple of final salary scheme clients which operate on a unitised segregated basis. These are conglomerates with subsidiaries in a number of diverse industries which want to give different benefits to members in different subsidiary companies while investing all contributions in the same way. 'These show, in principle, there is no reason why money purchase schemes should not have segregated management,' says Mr Low. But he adds: 'If you are going to buy segregated management you probably want to go to a manager with unit trusts or unitised managed funds. They are in a better position to run the fund because they already have the computer programme in place to unitise the investment.' The Prudential survey asked intermediaries how they thought segregated final salary schemes switching to money purchase would maintain the power which goes with operating a segregated portfolio. The intermediaries - said to represent the advice being given to 83 per cent of all pension funds, measured by asset value - thought most schemes would either transfer all their assets to a life office or invest in a single managed fund. The third investment solution suggested by Prudential is to have a segregated or managed fund with its own bonus series. The intermediaries surveyed thought that around 20 per cent of schemes switching to money purchase would choose this option. According to Mr Jonathan Heller, head of research at Prudential Corporate Pensions, this would mean running the fund as a 'mini insurance company', with 'reversionary' bonus levels being announced every year to reflect the underlying growth in investments. In this way the individual member would be protected from fluctuations in the investment markets. As with a life office with profits policy, a terminal bonus might be payable in addition on retirement. Investment performance is clearly more important for a money purchase scheme than for one operating on a final salary basis because of the direct link between investments and the level of benefits received. But Mr Robert Baker, senior consultant at Mercer Fraser, believes the underlying investment objectives are very similar in many cases. He says: 'The objective of most money purchase schemes is likely to be to beat the median. The money purchase scheme has no liabilities to take account of. The investment policy of a final salary scheme should take account of liabilities, so you would expect the investment policy to differ. In practice both funds probably just want to beat the median,'</p>

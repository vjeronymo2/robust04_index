			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (6): Still the world champions / Banking, the private business IT HAS been a strange year for Swiss private banking. It began in an atmosphere approaching siege, as more and more big foreign banks turned their attention to this extraordinarily profitable niche, and it is ending in triumph as the turmoil in European exchange markets and economies brings unexpected new life to the haven aspect of Swiss banks. Some bankers believe that this haven quality will be further enhanced by Switzerland's refusal earlier this month to join the European Economic Area (EEA). But then private banking, as the Swiss like to emphasise, is an unusual business. The provision of financial services to the rich - or high net worth individuals, as the Swiss call them - is not like other types of banking. According to client surveys, the price charged for services in this field is far from the key to success, for example. Knowing how to deal with rich people and maintaining a stable, well trained staff are more important. By all accounts, the Swiss are still the world champions in private banking. According to Chase Manhattan Private Bank, which is one of several non-Swiss banks with a significant presence in the country, wealthy individuals around the world have placed some Dollars 2,000bn in banks outside their home countries, and banks in Switzerland hold more than a third of it. These figures are broadly similar to ones mentioned by others, but there is, in the nature of this business, no way of knowing for sure. Many of Switzerland's private banks are private partnerships that publish no accounts. Others do not reveal the extent of their funds under management. However, in the past couple of years, some Swiss private bankers began to wonder if perhaps their magic touch was coming to an end. On the one hand, many hitherto fertile sources of funds, such as Mexico, were drying up as confidence in their currency stability stability grew, and people took their money home to invest. On the other hand, non-Swiss banks were becoming increasingly active in the niche, seeing it as a source of stable earnings and minimal risks. According to a recent study by the management consultants McKinsey, the return on equity in private banking in Switzerland averages 42 per cent. The Swiss willingly admit that competition gets tougher all the time. The Swiss have been irritated about foreign competitors' claims that Swiss private banks' charges were excessive and their investment performance for customers less than impressive. 'That is an old story, and it is simply not true,' says Claude Demole, a managing partner in the largest Geneva private bank, Pictet &amp; Cie. Mr Demole claims that, with the removal of the Swiss cartel on commission rates on securities transactions nearly two years ago, charges have tumbled. A customer's total fees now vary between 0.8 per cent and 1 per cent of his assets under management. As for performance, Swiss bankers say the cult of performance, which flourished in the 1980s, has receded somewhat in the past couple of years as financial markets around the world have been depressed and/or volatile. If a private banker can merely succeed in preserving the real value of his clients' fortunes, he is doing well, they say. 'It is back to fundamentals,' says Mr Patrick Odier, a partner in Lombard, Odier &amp; Cie in Geneva. 'Markets have been very volatile in 1992. We have had to work very hard to get a satisfactory result for our clients.' The non-Swiss claim that they are more attuned to world financial markets and the latest investing technologies than the Swiss. The Swiss reply that they are among the most global-thinking fund managers. Also, technology, while important, is not a key marketing tool. 'You do not run private banking on technology,' says Mr Oskar Holenweger, chief executive of Bank Vontobel in Zurich. 'It is a people business, a question of confidence and trust.' Mr Holenweger and others acknowledge that big foreign banks have an advantage in tapping into their home client bases for private banking customers, but he is mystified about why they would bring them to Switzerland. 'Why should a foreigner bank with a foreign bank in Switzerland?' he asks. Most Swiss private bankers say the currency turmoil in Europe in September has helped their business. The Zurich bankers have also gained considerably from tax increases in Germany and the threat of more to come as the country struggles with its budget. On the other hand, a few customers were lost because of the final implementation of regulations in September requiring Swiss banks to know the beneficial owners of all accounts. The tightening of regulations in recent years to prevent money laundering and insider trading and to ensure due diligence has been welcomed by private bankers. But there is some nervousness about a proposal that would require bankers to report clients suspected of being involved in illegal activity. 'We risk making some big mistakes, and the problem of responsibility have not been sorted out,' says Mr Demole.</p>

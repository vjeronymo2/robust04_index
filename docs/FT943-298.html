			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Sweden names finance minister Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's prime minister-elect, yesterday appointed Mr Goran Persson as finance minister in the new Social Democratic government, due to take office next week after this month's general election. Mr Persson, 45, shadow finance minister since last year, is expected to introduce tax rises and spending cuts to tackle Sweden's record budget deficit and a state debt soon to exceed 100 per cent of GNP. Mr Persson has a reputation as a tough administrator and financial markets hope he will be strong enough to resist left-wing opposition to spending cuts. Mr Carlsson also announced the appointment of Ms Mona Salin, the party secretary, as deputy prime minister. Ms Lena Hjelm-Wallen, a former education and foreign aid minister, was made foreign minister with the task of leading Sweden into the European Union if membership is approved in a referendum in November. Mr Thage Peterson was appointed defence minister.</p>

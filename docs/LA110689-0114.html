			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ERIC KUMEROW CHARGED IN FIGHT  </P> <P> Miami Dolphins defensive end Eric Kumerow and his sister were charged with two  felony counts each of assaulting a police officer in a melee outside a sports  bar, police said today.  </P> <P> Kumerow, sister Cheryl and a friend were arrested Sunday night after police  were called because of a fight inside Koz's bar, said police. The Kumerows,  also charged with trespassing, were released Sunday night after posting bond.  Conviction on the felony charge of assaulting a police officer would carry a  possible maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment.  </P> <P> Police who found the group outside the bar "described them all as being drunk,"  said Ft. Lauderdale Police spokesman Ott Cefkin. The 6-foot-7, 268-pound  Kumerow punched one officer twice, Cefkin said.  </P> <P> The Kumerows reportedly were asked to leave Koz's after a fight and were in the  parking lot at about 10:40 p.m. when police arrived and found them "highly  agitated," Cefkin said. The bar's namesake is former Dolphins' safety Mike  Kozlowski.  </P> <P> The friend, Robert Sean Skelton, 24, of Chicago, had been in the fight inside  and began kicking one of the police officers, Cefkin said.  </P></p>

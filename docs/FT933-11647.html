			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM aims to save Dollars 4bn with job and capacity cuts INTERNATIONAL Business Machines suffered losses of more than Dollars 8bn in its second quarter, after pre-tax charges of Dollars 8.9bn to cover a huge reduction in its workforce and cuts in manufacturing capacity. The company also reduced its quarterly dividend by more than half to 25 cents per share from 54 cents. The charges cover 35,000 job cuts, in addition to the 50,000 employees who have already, or will, leave the company this year, through voluntary and involuntary redundancies. Future workforce reductions will be 'heavily weighted toward positions outside of the US,' the company said. Along with cuts in manufacturing capacity and office space, the reductions will result in savings of Dollars 4bn annually. Of the pre-tax restructuring charge, Dollars 6bn will be for employee reductions and Dollars 2.9bn to reduce capacity, office space and related expenses. Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said the second-quarter charges could be the last in a series of big write-offs. 'If our current view of future industry revenue and demand proves incorrect, we will have to take further actions. But if our assumptions prove correct, we believe we will be able to absorb, without resorting to additional special charges, the costs associated with any future productivity improvements,' he added. Net losses were Dollars 8.03bn, or Dollars 14.10 per share, against net income of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29, in last year's second quarter. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 15.5bn, down from Dollars 16.2bn last year. The charges were much higher than expected, but IBM's operating losses of 8 cents per share were smaller than most Wall Street projections. IBM said revenues from computer hardware sales declined 12.9 per cent to Dollars 7.53bn from Dollars 8.64bn in last year's second quarter. However, software revenues rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 2.72bn from Dollars 2.68bn while revenues from maintenance contracts fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.90bn. Service revenues were up strongly by 26.6 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn from Dollars 1.86bn. Rentals and financing revenues fell 6.3 per cent to Dollars 1.07bn from Dollars 1.14bn. Costs and expenses for the quarter rose 14.2 per cent to Dollars 9.55bn. 'Getting IBM's cost and expense structure in line with the revenue realities of our industry . . . is my highest near-term priority,' said Mr Gerstner. He added that substantial work was under way on longer-term objectives to improve competitiveness which will take in increased openness and improved ease-of-use of technologies.</p>

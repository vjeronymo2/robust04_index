			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cristina Hasbun de Merino] </F>   [Text] San Salvador, 25 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The major  parties, namely, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (right-wing  Arena), and the leftist coalition, which includes the former  guerrillas, already know who will support them in the possible  runoff presidential elections in April. Both parties claim that  they will win.    The decision of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the  third Salvadoran political force, not to support either  contender cleared up the new electoral panorama and dispelled  rumors about a possible alliance with ARENA, of which the PDC  has been among the staunchest critics.    Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the former Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front [FMLN] guerrillas, told ACAN-EFE that  the PDC decision "creates conditions to increase the coalition's  possibilities to win over votes."    Arena Deputy Rene Figueroa, however, told ACAN-EFE that the  PDC decision "does not affect us" because his party "is  supported by a majority of the Salvadorans."    The PDC leadership based its decision on the fact that the  government models of the contenders in the runoff elections --  which has not yet been officially announced by the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] -- "fail to meet the aspirations of our  voters," and this leaves us free to choose "conscientiously."    The runoff election will pit ARENA's Armando Calderon Sol,  the former San Salvador mayor, and Ruben Zamora, vice president  of the Legislative Assembly. The latter was nominated by the  former FMLN guerrillas, Democratic Convergence (CD), and  National Revolutionary Movement (MNR).    Rene Figueroa said that, although his party will not ask the  left wing to give up a runoff election, its leaders "should  reflect and save us energy and money, because it is clear that  most Salvadorans want democracy and liberty, this meaning ARENA."    Zamora, his partner Francisco Lima, and the leaders of the  three parties that comprise the coalition yesterday rejected  rumors that it would not participate in runoff elections and  demanded that the TSE guarantee the vote of all Salvadorans.    The ARENA deputy doubted that the PDC rank and file would  vote for the left wing, because that party has faced several  divisions in recent times and "discontented PDC members who  already voted for the FMLN on 20 March."    A visibly happy Villalobos, however, said that the PDC  decision "improves everything because the PDC rank and file is  an important element in the runoff election that will be  decisive, and it will vote for us." Juan Ramon Medrano, also of  the FMLN, told ACAN-EFE that the minority parties, namely, the  Unity Movement and National Solidarity Movement, of evangelical  persuasion, have adopted an attitude that is similar to that of  the PDC. He pointed out that what is important is "that they  did not side with ARENA."    The only party that decided to support ARENA is the  conservative National Conciliation Party (PCN). Its secretary  general and presidential candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia told  ACAN-EFE that Arena's alliance is "mainly based on our  ideological line, and obviously, we do not support the FMLN."    Calderon Sol and Zamora said they are talking with various  sectors in search of support for the runoff elections. They are  also willing to reach a consensus, because they realize that  governing will be the major problem of the new peace situation.    The candidates agree that the TSE must solve serious  anomalies that were present during last Sunday's elections, in  which 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly and 262 mayors  were elected. The most serious problems were related to the  voter registration list. Many citizens were unable to vote  because their names were not on it. There were delays in  opening voting sites, lack of transportation, and other  incidents the United Nations described as "minor."</p>

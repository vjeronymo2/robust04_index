			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Comalco NZ posts NZDollars 18m loss Comalco New Zealand, part of the Australian Comalco group, has made an after-tax loss of NZDollars 18m (USDollars 10m) for 1993, its deficit third in a row, writes Terry Hall from Wellington. Mr Kerry McDonald, chief executive, said prospects seemed to be improving as world demand for aluminium was growing and prices were recovering. He added that low prices were responsible for last year's loss, which followed a 'massive' increase in supplies from the fomer Soviet Union.</p>

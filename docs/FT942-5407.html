			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (1): High prices spell danger  -This year can't be as good as last, but investors must keep a sense of perspective Right now, the investment trust industry is facing the problems of success. Its recent barnstorming run means that many trust shares are now highly priced, both in their own right and in relation to alternatives, such as comparable unit trusts. A significant shake-out is a very real possibility. But it is important to keep current worries about trust shares in perspective. The long-term merits of trusts as an investment vehicle remain: they are a good way for investors, particularly private investors, to participate in stock markets both at home and abroad. The fact that many share prices look too high, and that there is scant hope that 1994 will be as profitable for investors as 1993, is a short-term problem. And it would be churlish not to recognise the industry's recent outstanding performance. Annus mirabilis In 1993, the investment trust sector index rose by 46 per cent, compared with 23 per cent for the FT-SE-A All-Share index. A number of factors contributed to this . . . Both the UK stock market and many of the minor world stock markets rose strongly, partly because American investors were diversifying into overseas markets. This meant that the majority of investment trust managers were able to increase net asset values substantially. The investment trust discount narrowed further, as the gap between trust shares prices and the underlying assets was virtually eliminated, and in some cases shares rose above the the value of the underlying assets. Investment fashion switched to specialist areas, such as emerging markets, where many trust managers have expertise and where even professional investors will not venture unaided. The continuing fall in deposit rates pulled more private investors into the stockmarket, and both unit trusts and investment trusts benefited. Heavy purchases of shares in existing trusts tend to narrow the discount, since there is a finite number of shares in each trust in existence at any given time. Widespread advertising of new trusts, and secondary offers of new shares in old trusts, made the public more aware of investment trusts as an alternative to unit trusts. The new practice of attaching free subscription warrants (entitling holders to subscribe to a certain number of shares at a pre-set price for a certain period of time) made the immediate performance of most new issues look reasonably resilient. The increasing availability of savings schemes, particularly ones which can be combined with a personal equity plan, has created a steady trickle of money into many funds. Interestingly, most saving-scheme investment in investment trusts comes through lump sums rather than regular savings. So it appears that many private investors are - intelligently - using these schemes mainly as a way of avoiding high stockbrokers' charges, while still exercising some judgment over the timing of their investment. Some specialised types of investment trust security did outstandingly well, notably warrants. In 1993 the best-performing investment trust warrant rose by 1,700 per cent, the worst by 19 per cent. Warrants are a very highly geared speculation, and this abnormal rise was a once and for all catch-up. But it understandably endeared the investment trust concept to investors who discovered some dusty old warrants in their bottom drawer. Dies Irae Why then are most pundits predicting problems? What we have seen so far in investment trusts is a relatively harmless version of the classic speculative bubble. There is genuine long-term value in most investment trusts. But there is also a layer of froth both in many of the shares in which the trusts invest, and in the securities of the trusts themselves. This froth is beginning to be blown off. Some trust shares are already more sensibly rated. But since markets normally exaggerate both at the top and at the bottom, it is possible that trust shares will fall further and then suffer a period of unfairly low ratings . . . For the past 10 years, investors have enjoyed unprecedently good returns from all the main forms of investment - shares, bonds and even cash. Many experts argue that returns are likely to return to more normal levels, which means that investors may have to lower their expectations. The interest-rate cycle appears already to have bottomed in the US, and possibly in Britain. Equity markets normally do badly when interest rates are rising, and investment trust shares do worse than many other types. Share prices of many of the securities in which the trusts invest, particularly the more specialist trusts, had been pushed to levels which could not be sustained in the short term. Many emerging markets, for instance, have already fallen heavily this year. Excessive attention to stock market fashion, both by investors and by fund managers, has meant that much of the new money coming into the industry has gone to the most overvalued areas of world stock markets. Some of the more fashionable recent new issues, such as the European privatisation trusts, raised more money than they could easily cope with. The fashion for issuing warrants has diluted the long-term value of the underlying shares. Assuming the investment portfolio does well enough to make the warrants worth exercising, warrant holders' right to buy new shares cheaply can only be satisfied at the expense of holders of the existing shares. Short-term, of course, any setback in investment trust shares would have a disproportionate knock-on effect on warrants - and other highly geared trust securities. These short-term worries explain why most professional analysts are wary of the shares. Credit Lyonnais Laing, indeed, has recently advised investors with shares in investment trusts trading near or at asset value to switch into alternatives, such as unit trusts. Perhaps this will be the year in which everybody suffers from a hangover after last year's binge. But hangovers don't last forever.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Electricity supply security forgotten Sir, I would like to add a few comments to your preview of the public inquiry into the National Grid Company's application to erect new 400kv transmission lines between Teesside and York ('National Grid faces first big inquiry', May 19). Chris Tighe's report rightly cited Enron's huge new gas-fired power station at Wilton as the main catalyst and suggested that completion of the upgraded lines by National Grid would enable that plant's net output to be sold into the electricity pool. In fact, in the name of competition, Prof Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, in September 1990 gave National Grid written derogation from its proper licence conditions on transmission standards for the connection of new plant in respect of the Greystones (Enron) station. This will enable the plant to sell its output before the disputed lines are ready, under conditions of reduced system security. The liberated market place therefore gives rise not only to environmental concerns, as voiced at the Northallerton inquiry, but also to fears of degraded security of supply. It was only a few years ago that the Department of Energy confirmed at the Hinkley Point inquiry that transmission security was an integral part of overall security of electricity supply, but that message, like the department itself, is being forgotten.

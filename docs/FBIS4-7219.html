			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHk News" program] </F>   [Text] Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense  Agency, met today with Yi Pyong-tae, the visiting South Korean  defense minister, and they agreed that Japan and South Korea  should seek a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue through  diplomatic efforts. This is the first time that a South Korean  defense minister has visited Japan.    Defense Minister Yi inspected an honor guard in front of the  Defense Agency headquarters, and later held talks with Director  General Aichi. Aichi and Yi agreed that Japan and South Korea  should seek a solution to the standoff over North Korea's  suspected nuclear program through diplomatic efforts, and also  that it is essential for Japan, South Korea, and the United  States to maintain close ties on this matter.    Minister Yi said if another war should break out on the  Korean Peninsula, it will be far more disastrous than the Korean  war [1950-1953] was. He emphasized the importance of U.S-ROK  defense cooperation, saying the important thing is for South  Korea and the United States to cooperate in building a system of  deterring wars.    The two agreed that to promote military exchanges between  Japan and South Korea, mutual visits of exercise vessels should  be realized by the end of this year. They also agreed to take  measures on mutual communications on flight plans and other  information to prevent aircraft accidents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel will not be able to prevent murderers of  Jews from serving in the Palestinian police. This emerges from  a letter sent by the Information Department of the Prime  Minister's Office which was obtained by our political  correspondent Gadi Sukenik. A resident of the settlement of  Teqoa' in the territories wrote a letter to the prime minister  asking whether the murderers of Jews, including the man who  murdered his neighbor and was released, will be allowed to serve  in the Palestinian police, or will Israel prevent this.    The letter of reply from the Prime Minister's Office says,  among other things, that the Israeli Government will continue  fighting terrorism and hunt down those sabotaging peace, but  will not be able to determine who can serve in the Palestinian  police.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government of Botswana has strongly appealed for  peace and restraint in Lesotho following a bloody unrest in the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force. In a statement the Department of  Foreign Affairs says the split in the ranks of the royal Lesotho  force has created a situation which threatens the peace and  security of the Basotho nation.    It further says the government of Botswana has been watching  the unfolding situation in Lesotho with grave concern, adding  that this critical situation resulting from the unrest within  the armed forces of Lesotho also threatens the stability of the  democratically elected government of Lesotho.    While pleading for restraint throughout the Basotho nation,  the Government of Botswana strongly appealed to the Royal  Lesotho Defense Force to restore the situation to the status quo  for the honor and dignity of the sister people of Lesotho. It  applauds the efforts of the secretaries general of the  Organization of African Unity, and the Commonwealth, to bring  the situation in Lesotho back to normal.</p>

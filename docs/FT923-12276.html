			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Foreign banks seek talks on Efim loans: Italian government's stance criticised ITALY'S foreign bankers' association (Aibe) is seeking an urgent meeting with the government to discuss the status of some L3,000bn (Pounds 1.4bn) of loans extended to Efim, the state industrial holding group ordered to be wound up last Friday. A banker heading one syndicate of foreign banks owed money by an Efim subsidiary voiced concern over the lack of consultation with bankers. By the end of the last week, he said, no banks had been 'contacted at all by Efim or the Treasury. It is all very unsatisfactory.' According to unofficial versions of a decree to be published today, Efim's debts and those of its 80 subsidiaries, totalling L8,500bn, will be frozen for a maximum of two years. The decree also says the Treasury has the discretion to limit the freeze on debt payments for individual companies to a period 'no greater than 18 months'. Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister, talked on Friday of the freeze being 'no less than one year'. The government has not formally justified the freeze but the group is believed to have negative net worth. Mr Alberto Predieri, the new administrator of Efim, will need time to value the group and determine the fate of its subsidiaries. Mediobanca and Warburgs have been engaged as advisers on the valuations. Efim's long-awaited liquidation is part of the new Amato government's radical approach to reorganising the Italian public sector. According to the decree, creditors will be offered in 1993 government paper denominated either in lire or Ecu with a ceiling of L4,000bn. The interest will be determined by the Treasury but the decree says that, beginning in 1994, the service costs of this paper will be L720bn. It is understood that at least six syndicated foreign loans - four in Ecu and two in yen - have been extended to Efim and its subsidiaries. Japanese institutions, including Mitsubishi Bank, are believed to be among the most exposed. However, Chemical Bank recently organised a private Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) placement. Foreign bankers are still angry about the collapse last year of Federconsorzi, an agricultural co-operative with indirect government backing. 'They frankly have to get this one right otherwise Italy will be no better than an Argentina or a Brazil,' a banker said. The administrator has 90 days in which to prepare a report on how the group is to be liquidated. The main loss-making sectors are aluminium (Alumix) and glass (Siv). Auction begins, Page 10</p>

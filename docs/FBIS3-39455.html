			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In spite of the strict austerity measures, public  debts will soar to gigantic heights this year. According to  Bundesbank estimates, federal, laender and municipal debts,  including those of the Federal Railways and the Trust Agency,  could "reach almost 2 trillion." In its latest monthly report,  the Bundesbank says that at the end of 1993, debts increased to  1.74 trillion German marks [DM] -- that is, 56 percent of the  GNP.    With a predicted debt volume of almost DM2 trillion at the  end of this year, public indebtedness would "jump" close to the  "critical limit" laid down in the Maastricht Treaty's  convergence criteria, which says that public indebtedness may  only be a maximum 60 percent of economic achievement.    The total public expenditure in 1993 was some DM140 billion  higher than revenues, which increased the deficit by DM30  billion over 1992. New indebtedness was almost DM160 billion  due to cash reserves being formed from "stockpiling credits."  For 1994, the Bundesbank expects the shortfall in public funds  "to stabilize at the 1993 level."    According to the Bundesbank, a further increase in the  government budget deficit will be prevented by the increase in  fuel tax and pension contributions, as well as by strong efforts  to cut expenditures. Although consolidating public funds during  a recession is particularly difficult, there is no alternative  to this approach. The way out via a further increase in taxes  and social insurance contributions is "practically blocked":  Germany is among the countries "with the highest rates in taxes  and contributions," the report says.</p>

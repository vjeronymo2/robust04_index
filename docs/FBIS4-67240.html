			<p>Destabilizing   Towns   <F P=102> 94WB0037F Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 15 Apr 94 STATES  Section pp 1, 3 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0037F </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rocio Galvan] </F>   [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 14 April--The financial,  political, and criminal movements that have occurred in the  state since January 1993 are a result of destabilizing  activities on the part of drug traffickers seeking to become  established in this town, and in Mexicali, and Ensenada. This  claim was made today by the state's attorney, Juan Francisco  Franco Rios.    He added that there was an obvious migration of individuals  coming from Sinaloa, Michoacan, Tamaulipas, and Puebla, who have  settled in Mexicali and appear to have large fortunes.    He declared: "The `narcos' want to cool the atmosphere in  Tijuana," because of the serious conflicts and problems posed,  as well as the large concentration of police forces combating  crimes against health that have arrived as a result of the  assassination of Archbishop Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. The  attorney reached the foregoing conclusion after having  investigated several crimes, including a murder committed in  Mexicali. He noted that the one presumed guilty "is a person  with great economic potential, the owner of 40 ranches and a  fleet of yachts."    Franco Rios reiterated the statement made by Governor  Ernesto  Ruffo Appel on the day of the signing of the Pact for Baja  California, urging businessmen not to become associated with the  drug trade.    The leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution and  councilman in the state's 14th town hall, Javier Gonzalez  Monroy, for his part, commented: "The battle against the drug  traffic obviously has failed to bring about the desired results,  because there are political rivalries on the various levels of  government responsible for that task: federal, state, and  municipal authorities."    He stressed that an impetus must be given to reforms of the  Federal Penal Code that would enable the Baja California State  Attorney's Office to take action aimed at solving the problems.    He added that large numbers of "informers" have registered  as  candidates for the State Judicial Police Academy, noting that  this should have been supervised by the local judicial branch.    The secretary general of the Revolutionary Confederation of  Workers in the state, Jose Maria Gonzalez Escobedo, declared:  "There is a power vacuum in the state, but it is impossible for  the citizens to remain at the mercy of criminals."    Finally, he described the Pact for Baja California as "a  signpost indicating that they want to improve security."</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / NatWest 'defrauded in sugar ship deal' An Italian businessman defrauded the Leeds branch of National Westminster Bank out of more than Pounds 1m in a complex international swindle spanning three continents, Leeds Crown Court heard yesterday. Mr Carlo Caresana, from Genoa, used a fake shipload of sugar to dupe the bank into paying him Dollars 1.771m, said Mr Robert Smith QC, prosecuting. The fraud was made possible by his intimate knowledge of shipping and international trade and by taking advantage of banking procedures. Mr Caresana denies charges of theft, obtaining property by deception, procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception and four counts of using a false instrument with intent. The alleged fraud took place in 1990 between March and June and involved companies in Brazil and Saudi Arabia and banks in London, Leeds, Frankfurt and Prague. Mr Caresana offered to supply sugar to a Saudi company. Having agreed terms he found the name of a genuine ship taking sugar from Brazil to the Middle East and pretended the consignment was coming with that ship, Mr Smith said. He forged a complete set of shipping documents to support a letter of credit to persuade NatWest to issue a bill of exchange, Mr Smith said. The case, expected to last three months, continues.</p>

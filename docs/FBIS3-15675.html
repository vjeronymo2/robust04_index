On the same day, the opposition distributed a statement  among  the deputies calling for recognizing the results of the March 1  vote on Georgia's joining the CIS null and void.    On March 1, the parliament ratified the treaty on the  republic's joining the CIS by a majority of 121 votes, with 47  votes against and 4 abstentions.    According to the opposition, a two-thirds majority, or 145  votes, rather than a simple majority was required to pass the  decision. On the whole, the Georgian parliament includes 220  deputies.    At the same time, opponents to the republic's membership in  the CIS agreed to the proposal by Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang  Goguadze to allow international experts to decide on the  legality of the ratification.    Simultaneously, the Social Democratic Party of Georgia which  supports joining the CIS called on the opposition to regard this  issue of paramount importance for the republic with due  understanding.    During the session, deputy Tengiz Sigua pointed to the need  to provide an answer to a recent statement by Armenian Foreign  Minister Vagan Papazian. In an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA, the Armenian minister did not rule out the possibility  of his republic's applying pressure upon Georgia, if goods are  not promptly delivered to Armenia from the seaports of Batumi  and Poti. He also demanded an end to acts of sabotage on the  railroads and pipelines going through the Georgian territory.    Sigua described the statement as "diplomatic blackmail and  policy of intimidation" pointing out that "such a statement by  an Armenian official must not be left without an adequate  reaction."</p>

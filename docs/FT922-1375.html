			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Indocement unveils Dollars 848m acquisitions INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's largest quoted company, has announced conditional acquisitions totalling Rp720bn (Dollars 848m). The purchases, which are in food and property, will diversify Indocement away from the cement sector in which it accounts for 52 per cent of national capacity. The principal acquisition is PT Bogasari Flour Mills, an integrated flour milling company with an estimated 85 per cent market share in wheat flour and cash-flow of about Rp160bn a year. The purchase cost of Rp1,179bn includes the assumption of about Rp350bn of debt, a cash payment of Rp220bn and the issuance of long-term promissory notes totalling Dollars 300m. Indocement will also acquire a 51 per cent stake in the Indofood Group for Rp777bn; the group of nine principal companies and 20 subsidiaries produces more than 140 products and is a leading producer of instant noodles. The final acquisition is Wisma Indocement, an 23-storey office building in central Jakarta for which the company is paying Dollars 56m. The reaction of brokers to the announcement was mixed. They say all three purchases are from the 'Salim Group', a loose collection of companies in which Mr Soedono Salim, reputedly Indonesia's richest businessman, is a major shareholder. Companies in which Mr Salim has an interest hold over a 40 per cent stake in Indocement, which has a market capitalisation of Rp7,396bn. Mr Salim and five other commissioners and directors of Indocement have announced an interest in the companies to be purchased. The reaction of brokers in Jakarta to the announcement was mixed. The food sector is expected to have high growth over the medium-term, but the flour industry is highly protected and may be the subject of deregulation shortly. Although analysts were expecting Indocement to make large-scale acquisitions, they expressed surprise that there was no mention of likely purchases at the annual meeting held earlier this month. A local broker noted 'a lack of synergy between cement and instant noodles' but conceded that 'Indocement has gone as far as it can as a cement company and needs to diversify'. Indocement says the purchases will be paid out of cash resources of Rp400bn and long-term borrowing of Rp1,320bn. This will give Indocement a debt-to-equity ratio of 132 per cent and brokers say a new share issue is likely within a year.</p>

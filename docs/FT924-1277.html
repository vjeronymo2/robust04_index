			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains ground asHong Kong falls back INDEX-linked buying, short covering, and demand from foreign investors allowed the Nikkei average to gain moderate ground in spite of late afternoon profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average was up 169.20 at 17,437.91 after a day's high of 17,544.13 and low of 17,209.53, rising above the 200-day moving average of 17,468 in the afternoon, before slipping on light selling. Volume decreased from 255m shares to 220m. Trading was led by technical activity, with little participation from institutions ahead of the year-end. Rises outpaced falls by 588 to 373, with 170 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained 8.52 at 1,325.85. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.45 to 1,078.88. Reports that the Ministry of Finance intended to introduce a new weighted index for the futures market supported equities. The Nikkei 225 index, blamed for volatility on the Tokyo cash market, is a simple average of 225 stocks, and is said to be easily manipulated. A positive reception for the new second-section listing of Ten Allied, a pub chain operator, encouraged market participants. The company, which had been traded on the over-the-counter market, closed at Y2,330, up from its public offer price of Y2,277. Yokohama Matsuzakaya, the department store, led rising issues for the third day, surging Y56 to Y695 on increased speculative trading, after rumours of share cornering had circulated the market earlier this week. Foreign investors bought high-technology issues, with Toshiba, the most active stock of the day, appreciating Y11 to Y636 and NEC Y20 to Y685. Reports that bacterial infection within a hospital had claimed the lives of 80 people revived interest in 'clinical infection'-related shares. Terumo, a syringe maker, jumped Y33 to Y873 and Sanden, a hand disinfecting machine maker, rose Y14 to Y582. Some financial issues rose on the asset revaluation theme, with the authorities rumoured to be considering the introduction of accounting reforms in which asset values would be re-evaluated at market prices on corporate balance sheets. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire put on Y30 to Y1,210 and Sumitomo Bank Y20 to Y1,880. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, which had previously gained popularity on rumours of a new gold vein discovery, moved out of favour, retreating Y10 to Y485 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 90.39 to 18,930.01. Volume remained high, at 142.9m shares (against 117.9m), on cross-trading by financial institutions. Roundup THE CHINA factor adversely affected sentiment in Hong Kong, while the region's other markets were mixed. HONG KONG fell after China's foreign minister ruled out any concessions in its dispute with Britain over the future of the colony. The Hang Seng index receded 86.50 to 5,329.46 in turnover of HKDollars 2.57bn. Banking shares were active, while properties saw profit-taking following strong gains on Wednesday. HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, retreating HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 54. AUSTRALIA overcame early weakness, helped by the stronger local dollar, and the All Ordinaries index closed 2.4 up at 1,499.4 in turnover of ADollars 206.3m. Westpac rose a cent to ADollars 3.04 after news that the managing director was to resign. News Corp, which has lost ground this week on profit-taking, rallied 22 cents to ADollars 29.22. BHP added 6 cents at ADollars 12.56 ahead of today's interim figures. SEOUL saw intervention by the market stabilisation fund lift shares in late trading. The weighted index improved 6.51 to 660.60 in turnover of Won703bn. TAIWAN's weighted index lost 6.25 to 3,668.67 in TDollars 8.8bn turnover. Late buying in blue chips pulled cement shares up, and textiles posted minor gains. MANILA was helped higher again by a strong US performance by PLDT, which put on 5 pesos to 845 pesos. The composite index firmed 3.81 to 1,226.73 in combined turnover of 261m pesos. SINGAPORE remained positive, with good gains seen in leading stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.69 to 1,468.31 in volume of 69m shares. NEW ZEALAND featured forestry issues as the NZSE-40 index fell 11.67 to 1,509.52. BANGKOK saw property companies advance strongly as the SET index gained 9.52 at 849.92 in turnover of Bt2.98bn.</p>

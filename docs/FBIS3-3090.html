Jiang welcomed Nikaido and his party, saying that Nikaido,  an  old friend of the Chinese people, had made outstanding  contributions in helping the former Japanese Prime Minister  Kakuei Tanaka in 1972 realize the normalization of bilateral  relations and the development of Sino-Japanese friendly  relations.    Jiang said that since the normalization of bilateral  relations, friendly cooperation between the two countries in all  fields had made much progress and bilateral relations had  entered a new stage.    He pointed out that China has long paid much attention to  the  development of a good-neighborly relationship with Japan, hoping  that the two countries will continue to enhance understanding  and strengthen cooperation so as to bring Sino-Japanese  relations to a new height.    Jiang said: "I met with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa last year in seattle and we are expecting Hosokawa to  visit China."    Nikaido said that since relations between the two countries  returned to normal in 1972, bilateral friendly relations and  cooperation have been developing.    He said that although he was now aged 84, he would try to  contribute to the further development of bilateral friendly  relations.    President of the China-Japan Friendship Association Sun  Pinghua and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan took part in the  meeting.    Nikaido and his party came here at the invitation of the  China-Japan Friendship Association.    Before coming to Beijing, Nikaido attended a ceremony on  March 12 to mark the completion of the Shanghai Baori  High-Molecular Material Co., which is a joint venture between  the Shanghai Metallurgical Construction Corporation and the  Sanken Industry Co. of Japan. The joint venture is expected to  produce heat-insulating and fire-proof materials.</p>

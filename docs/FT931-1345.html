			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Relief over polluted land decision THE withdrawal of the government's plans to introduce a contaminated land register was greeted yesterday with widespread relief tempered by uncertainty about what might replace it. Businesses, developers and local authorities had been convinced that the proposed registers would blight land, depress land prices and be a severe setback to urban regeneration. Pressure on the government to withdraw its proposals came from groups ranging from the Confederation of British Industry to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'We are delighted that the proposals have been withdrawn. They would have had a disastrous effect on many small businesses,' said Mr Marco Torquati of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. But some critics believed the government's announcement of a 'new wide-ranging review of the problems in this area' would merely prolong the uncertainty that has damaged the property market. 'We were expecting a firm announcement at this stage,' said Mr Michael Chambers of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'This is rather a disappointment. There will now be a long period of uncertainty.' Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on the environment, said a third round of consultation and review meant the government had given no sign of fulfilling its legal obligation under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990. 'It leaves still a considerable amount of uncertainty,' he said. After two consultations, the government has collected the views of some 400 environmentalists, landowners and consultants involved in the debate. The review will consider the powers and duties of public authorities relating to contaminated land, the mechanisms for recovering authorities' costs in remedying pollution, the statutory changes needed and whether any longer-term studies should be put in place. Some commentators believe the principle of the register should be salvaged. Mr Smith said he did not want to see the principle of a register thrown away completely. 'I want to see a proper register that allows land to be taken off it.' Otherwise, he said, the entire burden of assessing whether land was fit for development would fall on local authorities.</p>

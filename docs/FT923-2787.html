			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies It has suddenly become reasonable to wonder whether the UK can make it through to the weekend without raising base rates sharply to defend sterling. By last night the sense of alarm in currency markets was every bit as bad as it was on Friday, and sterling was firmly in the firing line. The trouble is only partly that the devaluation of the lira was too timid and the ensuing Bundesbank rate cut to small. Yesterday's weak retail sales figures from the US do not help either. They underline the limited prospects for a narrower trans-Atlantic interest differential which would sustain the dollar and curb upward pressure on the D-mark. To make matters worse, Mr Major has made a strategic blunder by cancelling his trip to Spain. The markets were quick to conclude that his nerve is faltering. Having just made a killing out of the lira at the expense of the Bank of Italy, dealers must now think the Bank of England is ripe for similar treatment. A token rise in UK rates will hardly put them off. Mr Major would have to opt for two points at least to show earnest commitment. But that would leave the real economy in an even bigger mess.</p>

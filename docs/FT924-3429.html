			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: S&amp;N The market was obviously prepared for something rather worse than a 6 per cent drop in pre-tax profit at Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The northward spread of the recession is apparently affecting S&amp;N less than other brewers. But it would be wrong to get carried away. Yesterday's 3 per cent jump in the share price is more a correction of recent underperformance than a sign that any particular corner has been turned. There is no disputing S&amp;N's natural advantages - strength in the take-home trade, premium brands and geographic business spread. Equally, though, the recovery of margins in the off-trade remains fragile, while devaluation must sooner or later eat away at the margins on Beck's. Arguably, too, the company has been a little slow in exploiting the food and thematic scope of its retailing side. In an ideal world, diversification into leisure would have compensated for lack of growth in beer. Yet Pontins seems to have become caught up in the recession. The company is vague about the growth rates being achieved by Center Parcs. Occupancy rates remain high and presumably the spend per visitor will pick up with the economy in the UK. However with the recession clouds gathering over the continent and incipient recovery in the US, it is just possible S&amp;N may, for a while at least, look with envy on Bass's investment in Holiday Inn.</p>

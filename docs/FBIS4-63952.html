			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the general heading: "Crimea: Talks </F> in Progress; No Easing of Tension"]    [Text] The formation of a 2,500 to 3,000-strong Ukrainian  National Guard brigade is continuing in Crimea. This is what  Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Republic of Crimea internal  affairs minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent yesterday in  an exclusive interview.    V. Kuznetsov pointed out that this military buildup is  "unnecessary and atypical" of Crimea, which is already "awash  with military formations and combat equipment." At the same  time, he noted, Ukraine is indoctrinating and sounding out army  units on the matter of the personnel's willingness to take  practical action in the event of the introduction of a state of  emergency in Crimea.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIDE TURNS, LEAVING SOME WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS OUT OF THE WATER;  </P> <P> INSIDERS: ONCE, IRAQ HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS IN THE CAPITAL. NOW, ARRANGEMENTS ARE  BEING 'TERMINATED.'  </P> <P> These are trying times for some Washington insiders who seem to be finding it  uncomfortable to be known by the company they keep.  </P> <P> Take lobbyist Edward J. van Kloberg III, who jokingly used the nickname "the  beast of Baghdad" to refer to his client, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in an  interview with the Washington Post last month. The flamboyant Van Kloberg was  not so jocular Wednesday, saying: "Our arrangement terminated in July."  </P> <P> Take Richard M. Fairbanks III, the former assistant secretary of state who was  one of President Bush's chief foreign policy advisers during the 1988 campaign.  Also listed on the most recent roster of Iraq's lobbyists, Fairbanks said that  his relationship with Baghdad was limited to legal work and that he resigned in  March. Attorney-client privilege prevents him from revealing his reasons,  Fairbanks added, but "obviously if we had felt comfortable with the  arrangement, we would have continued it."  </P> <P> There's also Mary E. King, the well-connected former Jimmy Carter  Administration official known in days gone by as a stalwart of the U.S. civil  rights movement. As executive director of the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum, King  squired Iraqi officials around, making sure that they were introduced in the  right social and political circles.  </P> <P> "I don't make speeches and I don't give interviews and I'm very busy," King  said in response to a request for comment.  </P> <P> It was not so long ago that Iraq had plenty of friends in Washington.  Particularly during its eight-year war with Iran, when the United States took a  decidedly pro-Iraqi tilt, many people were willing to knock on the doors of the  powerful on Iraq's behalf, acting either as representatives of the government  itself or those who wanted to do business with it.  </P> <P> Since last week, it has been U.S. policy to strangle the Iraqi economy with an  international embargo. But things looked pretty cozy as recently as January,  when the Commerce Department, under pressure from business, was planning an  aerospace trade mission that would include a stop in Iraq aimed at making sure  U.S. companies got in on the action there.  </P> <P> In the Commerce Department's news release announcing the trade mission, the  department noted that Iraq is among the countries that will "offer numerous  consulting opportunities in aviation service, maintenance and the avionics  equipment market. . . . Iraq has ambitious plans for upgrading its civil  aviation system, including new airports, air traffic control and related  equipment."  </P> <P> Weeks before the trade mission was supposed to take place, six Iraqi agents  were caught in London engaging in another type of commerce -- trying to smuggle  40 American-made nuclear bomb triggers into Iraq.  </P> <P> John L. Wolf, the trade mission coordinator, insists that the idea for  including Baghdad in the trip never got past the planning stages. The proposed  stop in Iraq was canceled because "we didn't like some of the things (the  Iraqis) said," Wolf explained. "We were very prophetic and proper about it but  we never get credit for it, do we?"  </P> <P> There are still some who -- while not quite defending Hussein -- contend that  he is not a total villain.  </P> <P> "We've focused a little too much on his brutal side," said Marshall W. Wiley,  the former ambassador to Oman who founded and heads the U.S.-Iraq Business  Forum. "In a personal meeting with him, he can be charming."  </P> <P> The forum is an organization composed of about 70 companies that were doing  business in Iraq, or wanted to. Wiley said that it was funded solely by its  members' dues and does not lobby Congress. Still, it regularly and publicly  argued the other side against critics of Iraq.  </P> <P> Although Hussein wiped out thousands of his own people with chemical weapons,  Wiley has often noted that he also fostered literacy and economic development.  Wiley warns even now that the United States "has got to come to grips with the  fact that Iraq is an emerging power" and should not back an unpopular and  undemocratic monarchy in Kuwait, which was invaded Aug. 2 and annexed by Iraq.  </P> <P> Iraq's social heyday in Washington was surely the mid-1980s, when Ambassador  Nizar Hamdoon ran what the New York Times described as "one of the liveliest  dinner tables in Washington." Hamdoon drew notables, including American Jewish  leaders -- which seems particularly ironic in light of Hussein's subsequent  threat to wipe out half the population of Israel with poison gas.  </P> <P> Fairbanks insists that the U.S. position in the Iran-Iraq War was a sensible  one, "based on U.S. national interests" of preventing a clear winner from  emerging from the conflict.  </P> <P> But California Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), one of Iraq's most  dogged foes on Capitol Hill, says that the attitude persisted well past the  war's end in August, 1988.  </P> <P> "That continued until the day before the invasion," he said. "They all thought  that Hussein could be a force for moderation."  </P> <P> He noted that the Administration and many in Congress opposed his bill banning  arms and high-tech exports to Iraq, a bill that cleared the House Foreign  Affairs Committee the day before the invasion. It quickly passed the House as  Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait.  </P> <P> Over the years, Iraq has mounted what Berman described as a sophisticated  lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, involving State Department officials, defense  contractors, agricultural interests and Iraqi-Americans.  </P> <P> Berman said that he was even telephoned on Iraq's behalf by William P. Clark,  after Clark retired in 1985 as President Reagan's national security adviser and  began working as a Washington attorney. Clark's office said that he has never  been engaged as a lobbyist by the government of Iraq. He is out of the country  and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> The invasion, Berman said, "was just to me a demonstration of the lesson I  think we should have learned a long time ago -- appeasing a bully doesn't work.  It's not only a morally corrupt position but a politically stupid position."  </P></p>

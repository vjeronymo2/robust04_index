			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / FT Conferences: BT urges end of support for telecoms rivals Preferential support for new contenders in the telecommunications market should be abandoned soon, Sir Iain Vallance, British Telecommunications chairman, said yesterday. Speaking on the first day of a Financial Times conference, he said: 'I am not suggesting limits or controls on market entry. But I am suggesting that the phase of preferential support for new entrants may soon be ready to close.' He also looked forward to deregulated telecoms markets elsewhere in Europe, arguing that there was a need to develop a 'common and converging' regulatory framework worldwide. Sir Iain was speaking a day before the publication by Oftel, the telecoms regulator, of a consultative document that is expected to precipitate a fierce debate about the role of regulation in the UK industry. Since BT was privatised a decade ago a variety of devices have been employed to protect newcomers from BT's market power and promote competition. The most important instruments are regulations to keep call prices up and access prices down. BT is prevented by means of an agreed formula from raising prices overall. At present the cap is the retail prices index minus 7 1/2 percentage points. Sir Iain said there should be three specific milestones towards a new regime: A commitment to deregulate all retail price activity from 1997. Specific time limitations on any remaining market entry supports. A stable and explicit regime for interconnection services that applies to all licensed network operators. At present competing operators pay BT a fee for interconnection to its network to route calls to their eventual destination. The way the interconnection charge is calculated has been challenged by BT's competitors.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to forget 1987 crash Sir, I am sure Bob Beckman ('In the Pink: Batten down for a bear beware', December 10) would wish no help from me, but Mr H L Benjamin's letter (December 20) requires a response. 'Well-reasoned articles' deserve argued replies, not insults. Mr Benjamin has conveniently forgotten that Beckman forecast the 1987 crash before it happened (unlike most experts) and was publicly pilloried for forecasting the collapse of the housing market when it was at the height of its boom. These were correct forecasts of the two most important events in recent financial history - ask those with negative equity] P R Browse, 21 Woodgate, Helpston, Peterborouogh PE6 7ED</p>

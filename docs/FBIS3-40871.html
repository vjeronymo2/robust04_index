			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] PANGAB [Armed Forced Commander] General Feisal  Tanjung believes that there have been several notable cases  recently which have damaged the credibility of ABRI [Republic of  Indonesia Armed Forces] and POLRI [Republic of Indonesia Police]  and which have had political consequences; intelligence agencies  did not detect these cases early enough, preventive steps were  taken too slowly, and KAMTIBMAS [Public Security and Order] did  not react immediately to the early detection of the symptoms  which then developed into those cases.    "In addition, the leaders and the managers did not act at a  high professional level to overcome critical situations  involving the masses," the MENPANGAB [Minister/Armed Forces  Commander] said yesterday when he gave the welcoming address at  roll-call ceremonies for deputy heads of provincial police,  heads of the regional police, and heads of sub-area police at  the Police Education Center in Sukabumi, West Java.    Notable cases which the MENPANGAB said have damaged the  credibility of ABRI/POLRI include the Banturujeg (Majalengka)  case, in which some people were killed; the Sei Lepan local  transmigration case, in which there was an attack on the  Pangkalan Brandan Sector Police Headquarters; the case involving  peasant dissatisfaction towards the Rancamaya (Bogor) real  estate project; the case of the Nipah (Sampang) dam, which led  to the death of several demonstrators; the case of the worker  Marsinah in East Java; and the destruction and burning of  Indramayon Inc.'s employee housing in Sumatra.    The MENPANGAB thinks that weak coordination between  ABRI/POLRI officials and the agencies involved in facing these  critical problems have also resulted in decreased credibility.    The decreased credibility, according to the PANGAB, was also  caused by poor management, particularly command of the initial  data, control in the field, and control over the firearms given  to the members of the units.    In addition, he said, the lack of emphasis placed on  carrying  out duties, including firm procedures for personal security and  operational security for members carrying out their duties, also  played a role in that decreased credibility.</p>

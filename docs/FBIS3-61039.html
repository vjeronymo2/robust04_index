He graduated from the Islamic Institute in  Tashkent and Jordan University in Amman. He was the qadiqalon  [Muslim judge who interprets and administers religious law] of  Tajikistan from 1988 (after the accession to power of the  People's Front, he was removed from this post and pronounced an  "enemy of the people.") He was second in command in Central  Asia's official Islamic hierarchy, a member of the Republic of  Tajikistan Supreme Soviet Presidium, and he spoke out in favor  of building a secular state.    Our meeting with the former qadi took place in conditions of  secrecy in the capital of one of the southern republics of the  CIS.    Addressing a press conference in Dushanbe, Turajonzoda once  said that there are three instances when the qadi is not  entitled to speak: if he is irritated, if he has not slept  well, and if he is fasting. When we reminded him of these words  he smiled and said that, thanks be to Allah, there was nothing  preventing our work that day.    [Dubnov] A year has passed since Imomali Rakhmanov was  elected chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Soviet. You were the  only opposition representative to send a congratulatory telegram  to Rakhmanov, in which you proclaimed your readiness to promote  a peaceful settlement to the war among Tajiks. However, you did  not attend the actual session. Why?    [Turajonzoda] I knew Rakhmanov's character. He is a very  hot-tempered man and a true communist. Despite all that, I  welcomed his election for the sake of establishing peace and  tranquillity.    But why did I myself fail to take part? I had reliable  information that there were plans to deal with the opposition at  the Leninabad session or after its conclusion. "You would be  better off not going, as I cannot guarantee your safety,"  erstwhile Prime Minister Abdullodzhanov told me.    [Dubnov] How do you evaluate the situation in Tajikistan  today?    [Turajonzoda] It was not difficult to predict what is now  going on in my motherland. A regime which seeks by way of its  basic task to instill fear in people and not self respect is in  no state to last long. Absolutely nothing is sacred to these  people, these authorities. Reviling democracy, and after making  threats only a year ago to "the entire democratic scum, not only  in Central Asia, but in Russia too" while swearing fidelity and  friendship to Russia so as to ask it for aid -- these people  sing quite a different song in other places.    "If we (the government and the opposition) had fought  against  Russia together, we would not have the situation we have today,  and we would not have spent two years fighting one another."  This is a quotation from an interview given by Abdumadzhid  Dostiyev [name as transliterated], first deputy chairman of the  Tajikistan Supreme Soviet, to Iran's KEYHAN.    But Imomali Rakhmanov persuaded Afghanistan's President  Rabbani to help first and foremost the true Tajiks who had come  to power in Tajikistan (that is, the people of Kulyab) so as to  prevent Abdullodzhanov's Leninabad clan from "selling the  republic to Russia and America." I was told about this by  Borhanoddin Rabbani himself.    [Dubnov] And did you try to get in touch with the Russian  leadership somehow to give it your point of view?    [Turajonzoda] I appealed to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin  personally on several occasions. To judge from Moscow's policy,  it can be concluded that Former Security Minister Barannikov and  Russia's current ambassador in Tajikistan, Mecheslav Senkevich,  did not present the president with all the information on the  situation in Tajikistan.    However, I am inspired by the Russian president's edict on  the appointment of a mediator to set up dialogue between the  government in Dushanbe and the opposition, by Andrey Kozyrev's  recent statements, and by the meeting between Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service Chief Yevgeniy Primakov and Said Abdollahi  Nuri, chairman of the Islamic Movement for the Revival of  Tajikistan.    [Dubnov] The Tajikistan authorities describe you as one of  the main culprits in the bloodshed. Do you consider yourself  guilty of anything?    [Turajonzoda] Any man who enters the political arena always  strives for power. I said that I would not seek to achieve any  kind of state post, and I recognized that I was mistaken when in  September 1991 I agreed to be nominated as a candidate for the  Supreme Soviet. But, given that people had pinned enormous  hopes on me, I simply wanted to help in the acquisition of  independence, the revival of culture, and the attainment of  religious freedom. When people say today that we wanted to seize  power, they are lying.    [Dubnov] In the last nigh-on three years you have had  several chances to become Tajikistan's number one. Do you  regret not making the most of this?    [Turajonzoda] On several occasions I was asked by both  political organizations and individual territories to run for  the presidency, but I considered then as now that Tajikistan's  spiritual leader should not be the leader of the state. We are  accused of allegedly striving to impose Islamic order in  Tajikistan. This is impossible. All the more so through force,  and against the people's will and convictions. This kind of  regime cannot last. It was impossible to impose from above  something for which there existed no formulated demand in  society. Could we, armed with this experience, do something so  stupid? That would have been criminal. After all, all the  mistakes I made while in office were ascribed to Islam.    [Dubnov] A coalition government was in power for a total of  six months last year and peace was not brought to the country.  It is asserted that this happened because the government was  under your influence.    [Turajonzoda] The government comprised 90 percent  communists, with only Vice Premier Davlat Usmonov [name as  transliterated] representing us there, with myself in the  Supreme Soviet Presidium.    [Dubnov] Where were you and your family when hostilities  against the opposition began?    [Turajonzoda] At that time 49 of my relatives were killed.  They were simply slaughtered in their own homes, in their native  villages. My own home was first pillaged and then burned. The  very same thing was done to my parents' home and the homes of my  brothers. They even set light to the mosque next to my house.  Three of my closest relatives, old men, were decapitated.    In February 1993 I managed to travel on foot across  snow-covered mountain passes to reach the territory of  Kyrgyzstan, as far as Osh, and then onward to one of  Kazakhstan's oblasts, and from there I flew to Moscow.    We welcomed Rakhmanov's call for mutual disarmament by the  armed formations. But instead of this, hostilities flared up  against the opposition, and People's Front detachments occupied  Dushanbe: the opposition was forced to take cover in the Garmo  Hills and to retreat to Kofarnikhon.    Then we sent a delegation to Rakhmanov and Karimov  requesting  that there be no attack on Kofarnikhon and that, with the aid of  the 201st Russian Division which would be the guarantor of our  safety, a start might at last be made on mutual disarmament.  Rakhmanov ordered the delegation's arrest.    [Dubnov] It is said that you are the chief of the Tajik  government in exile. Is this so?    [Turajonzoda] There is no Tajik government in exile. Even  if the current government in Dushanbe stands down, we do not  intend to take power into our own hands. Let people who have  not participated in the war come to power. It is necessary with  the help of Russia and other neighboring countries that we trust  to disarm both sides and eventually, once the situation in the  republic is fully stabilized, say in 18 months to two years'  time, to hold free and democratic elections under the  supervision of the United Nations, the CSCE, and other  international organizations. Whoever wins the elections will  lead the republic.    But until then, while the Communists remain, we will  continue  the armed struggle against them. We believe that this struggle  is legitimate.    [Dubnov] You do not want to go into talks with official  Dushanbe until you have set up contact with the Russian  authorities. At the same time, it is considered in Moscow that  the establishment of peace in Tajikistan is primarily the  concern of the Tajiks themselves. If you continue to defend  these stances, how will you break this vicious circle?    [Turajonzoda] Yes, we still want to meet with  representatives of the Russian Government first, but this does  not mean that we consider Russia our enemy. We recognize its  geopolitical interests in the region. Russian troops can remain  in Tajikistan. We want to see Russia as a mediator. We want to  explain our point of view -- it is not important whether this is  done officially or unofficially -- and that is all! And if we  convince Russia, then we will be prepared to sit around the  negotiating table with representatives of the current regime in  Dushanbe, with the exception of those people who were actual  commanders the People's Front and who are responsible for the  deaths of tens of thousands of completely innocent people. There  are upstanding people in the government with whom it is possible  to talk.    The communists and democrats in the republic are incapable  of  reaching agreement without mediation and help from countries  like Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. If Russia's  stance remains unchanged, this will signify a continuation of  the fratricidal war.    [Dubnov] How do you explain attacks by armed opposition  detachments on border posts on the Tajik-Afghan border, the  victims of which are the wholly blameless Russian soldiers?    [Turajonzoda] We deeply regret the the fact that innocent  Russian boys are dying. But show us another way of fighting  against the hated regime in Dushanbe. What else can we do if  Russian troops continue to defend it? After all, according to  the agreement, border troops protect the border from foreign  invasion. But we are citizens of Tajikistan, we want to go home,  but we are being killed there. The border troops are preventing  us from returning home with dignity. Our guys, when crossing  the border, are instructed to bypass the posts and military  units and not to enter into combat with Russian soldiers, but  they pursue us onto Tajikistan territory and, you know, we are  in our own country. I would very much like the Russian readers  to put themselves in our shoes.</p>

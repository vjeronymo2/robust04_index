			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Time out for reflection Britain's Con-servatives bad-ly need to lose a general election. They are not at ease with themselves. They are confused, bothered, dispirited, disillu-sioned. They should be relieved of the burdens of government. This would give them time to reflect on what they have to offer us. When they have cleared their heads they might once again be permitted to form an administration. How long should they be out? If they are fortunate enough to go in 1996, a return early in the 21st century sounds good. The latest manifestation of the Tories' doctrinal disarray is the current argument over the system of voting in the ruling council of the European Union. As matters stand, Britain can block EU decisions it does not like if it can form an alliance with, say, Germany and Denmark. The government hopes to retain this qualified minority veto when the EU is enlarged by the admission of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria. The other member states of the EU, except Spain, want a small increase in the necessary number of blocking votes. A strong, united Conservative government would be confident that Britain could as readily find three or four allies out of 15 other members as it can two out of 11. This Conservative government is not. What should be a typical Eurodebate, rich in technicalities, ripe for a compromise resolution, has reached apparent stalemate. Last week Mr Douglas Hurd tried to prepare his party to accept a trade-off. Tory Eurosceptics, and some others, are saying that they will do no such thing. The foreign secretary argued that enlargement of the EU was a Conservative prize worth negotiating for. The Europhobes, who have an apparent armlock on the prime minister, will only countenance a settlement on their terms. Mr Hurd appears to be trapped. It could be different in opposition. The party would be as divided as ever about Britain's place in the evolving European community, but it would have space in which to settle its arguments. There would be no need to take decisions on the run. The Conservative coalition could reassemble itself, with an eye to an audience wider than that constituted by its own depleted ranks. Liberal nationalists could argue their case, as Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Howard now do in veiled terms from their ministerial chairs. Christian Democrats and Europeans un-der the skin - like, say, Mr Kenneth Clarke  - might enjoy the unchallenged ascendancy that should come naturally in a popular Conservative party. Moderate conservatives who have the capacity to reflect on such matters are to be found inside the government, but many of them are out of sight. One, Mr Stephen Dorrell, emerged from cover earlier this year. In an address to student Tory reformers at Downing College, Cambridge, the financial secretary to the treasury rejected both minimalist government and the 'exaggerated histrionics of flag-waving nationalists'. Love of country, he said 'does not imply hostility to foreigners'. He did not mention Mr Portillo, nor did he need to. Mr Dorrell projects the kind of decency that has won Mr Tony Blair of the Labour party much applause, although neither of them will thank me for saying so. For example, speaking of family responsibility the financial secretary said that 'in this respect western culture needs to relearn forgotten lessons from some members of its own ethnic minority communities'. Plenty to chew on there. There is more food for thought in a new pamphlet by Mr David Hunt, published yesterday by the Conservative Political Centre. This should be read. The employment secretary, a known Tory Christian Democrat who grovelled to the Eurosceptics at last year's party conference, confronts the liberal-nationalist wing of his party head-on. 'That is what troubles me with the obsessive individualism of liberals: its potential drift into insularity,' he says. He goes further. 'Tories have always re-garded human beings as social beings - ours is a communitarian philosophy, and we regard communities and society as being somehow organic. The Kantian conception of the self - an abstract, rootless being with absolute characteristics - is alien to us.' There are plenty of similar sentiments. One more: '. . . we must not let our opponents on the left claim that we endorse the worst, most selfish, manifestations of the capitalist spirit. It falls to us to police the market.' Mr Hunt's contribution would be better expressed, and therefore even more valuable, if it had been produced in opposition. The employment secretary has been obliged to dot his observations with the butter of support for all the stated policies of the government of which he is a member. He throws in little dabs of praise for the prime minister he serves. Perhaps he wants the job of chairman of the Conservative party, a post he is tipped to be offered in a midsummer reshuffle. There is some sense in this, although possibly more political advantage in giving the task to Lord Archer. When Mr Chris Patten, now governor of Hong Kong, was Tory chairman he helped Mr John Major win an election. Like the employment secretary, Mr Patten is both a thoughtful European and a wistful Christian Democrat. You and I might regard it as crazy to accept the chairmanship of a disintegrating party, but Mr Hunt is an optimist, the kind who would tell himself that, starting from here, the Tories' fortunes can only improve. Just who leads the Conservatives to what should be defeat is of small significance. What they discuss while out of office is more important. The division between Christian Democrats, proponents of the social market economy, and the faction called liberal by Mr Hunt has already become blurred. It may be less relevant at the end the decade than it seems to be now. To take one specific example - will the fashion for adding layers of management to public services, as with health, survive? Private companies are downsizing their white-collar staffs; perhaps the Tories discovered 1970s management 20 years too late. There are other, more universal, questions, like how do you re-instil a sense of structure in an atomised polity? Mr Dorrell and Mr Hunt are both aware of this one. They know about Europe, too. A long period of sabbatical leave from government would enable them, and their colleagues, to search for 21st-century answers.</p>

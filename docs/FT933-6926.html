			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / High-tech speeding levy mooted THE ELECTRONIC tagging devices the government is considering introducing to charge motorists for using motorways could also be used to surcharge drivers for speeding, a minister has suggested. Mr Robert Key, roads minister, said he could envisage a situation where motorists would be charged for every mile they broke the speed limit. 'You would know before you set out that if the speed limit was 70mph and you were doing 80mph, it was going to cost you and it was going to hurt,' he told Carweek magazine. In May the Department of Transport suggested in a green paper that motorways could be operated profitably by charging users, imposing tolls of up to 1.5p a mile or an annual fee of up to Pounds 75. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, indicated in June that annual permits were the 'most realistic option' if the government decided to move quickly, as electronic tolling probably would not be 'technologically achievable' until at least 1998. But he said electronic tolling offered 'more flexibility in the long run'. The Department of Transport said yesterday the government had 'a very open mind' on whether to introduce road charging. Mr Key was not implying that charging speeding motorists in the way outlined was going to be government policy. Under the approach set out by Mr Key, motorists could be charged an extra 50p a mile for every 5mph they were travelling over the speed limit. The AA criticised the proposal for suggesting that the rich could break the law. 'Charging premium rate tolls for speeding motorists sounds like a charter for the law-breaking rich,' it said.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPPING ANCHOR AT BAYSIDE 240;  </P> <P> CAN A RESTAURANT WITH A VIEW MAKE GOOD WITH SERIOUS FOOD?  </P> <P> What have we here? A clever display of seafood on ice: It looks like a baby  shark thrashing the heck out of a mackerel for an audience of littleneck clams.  Nice work, boys -- leave your cards, we'll drop a word to "Saturday Night's  Main Event."  </P> <P> And what have we here? Behind the still life of wrestling seafood is a big  gleaming display kitchen. At the tables (somewhat disturbing tables of blond  wood that seem to slope downward toward all four  </P> <P> edges) you're handed a sophisticated California wine list. And Bayside 240's  menu, which changes slightly every day, is full of suavely up-to-date fancies  like grilled orange roughy with artichoke puree and crispy lamb chops with  thyme sauce.  </P> <P> It's a menu that has "Culinary Institute of America graduate" written all over  it, and Chef Thomas Tompkins did indeed attend that East Coast hotbed of  avant-gardism. He plans to have winemaker dinners and so on. It sounds like  serious restaurant time.  </P> <P> And yet there's all that view out the huge windows: 180 degrees of ocean  (counting what you can see from the busy, beachy bar as well as the restaurant  side's view), not to mention the vast panorama of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  Crane your neck and look east a little -- more or less back the way you drove,  because Bayside 240 is toward the end of San Pedro Pier -- and you can see a  couple of other restaurants getting along without quite such gorgeous view  locations.  </P> <P> The others are all chain restaurants, and that's what's amazing about Bayside  240. It has certifiably noble ambitions as a restaurant even though it could  clearly get people out here to romantic view headquarters, as the chain  restaurants do, serving food not much above the familiar surf and/or turf  level. It works hard in the kitchen where the colorful, cartoony 30-foot mural  or the driftwood dragon hanging over the bar might be be enough to augment the  attraction of the view.  </P> <P> Tompkins' menu is actually semi-familiar, or rather sometimes familiar. A lot  of dishes sound Italian, regional American or possibly Chinese or Mexican,  apart from the ones that suggest the avant-garde. But names can deceive.  </P> <P> For instance, the salmon pizza is less exotic than you'd think. It's  essentially Wolfgang Puck's "Jewish pizza" -- not on the Spago menu but often  available there. This sort of "pizza" is served cold, covered with salmon and  cream cheese, making it more or less a flattened-out version of lox and bagels.  Or as it has been put, "at last a bagel with lox that's big enough."  </P> <P> The egg rolls are cousins to the pizza, scarcely Oriental items lavishly filled  with lobster and cream cheese, though the vegetable rolls with charred ahi turn  out to be sushi-like. The big, meaty crab cakes, on the other hand, are exactly  as they sound, rather soft and rich, and very appealing.  </P> <P> Soups do not seem to be a strong suit at Bayside 240. The seafood gumbo, in  particular, is very strange, but not for the usual reasons. The Louisiana-style  roux that is the basis of gumbo is not undercooked, as California chefs are  likely to make it; on the contrary, the flour has been fried so dark you can't  taste anything but what seems the aftermath of a kitchen fire. Without looking,  I'd never have guessed there were shrimp in this.  </P> <P> The entrees are nearly all seafood, and of somewhat more even quality than the  appetizers. The hot-smoked king salmon might be the best of them. It's  extremely smoky, and the mawkish tendencies of salmon when served hot are cut  by both the smokiness and the fresh-tasting, mildly sweet-and-sour sauce of  tomatillos, fried onions and honey.  </P> <P> Costa Rican mahi-mahi (a name to ponder) could hardly miss, baked in a tangy  coat of Parmesan and Romano cheeses, nor could the luscious Molokai channel  swordfish with its garnish of corn relish. Cajun red snapper (sometimes made  with other fish such as black bass) is not exactly right out of the bayous, but  it's well grilled and comes with a novel jalapeno linguine in which the bite of  hot pepper is just discernible.  </P> <P> Redondo stew is the obligatory huge bowl of seafood (approximately two each of  shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops, crab claws and fish chunks). I can detect the  garlic and maybe a little saffron in the garlic saffron tomato sauce, but  there's no doubt at all about the tomatoes. There are plenty of really fresh  tomatoes in this one. Sometimes there is a dish of soft-shell clams (thin-shell  would be a better name; you wouldn't want to eat these whole like a soft-shell  crab) that come in a thin broth intriguingly spiced with clove.  </P> <P> Petrale sole gets treated very gently -- perhaps a shade too gently, though the  dish is probably just the thing for light diners. In the center of the plate  lies a big curled lump of sole surrounded by a dainty broth flavored with a bit  of olive oil. The northwest sector is a Tic-Tac-Toe pattern of crunchy, barely  cooked baby asparagus and poached red and yellow cherry tomatoes.  </P> <P> The Hawaiian ono with orange butter sauce is essentially for fans of Polynesian  Cuisine. The fish is served scattered with chives on a riot of pineapple and  orange slices, with a sunny smear of sweet orange-flavored sauce peeping out  from among the fruit.  </P> <P> You have to remember that everything is a la carte. If you want a green salad,  it's on the list of side dishes; a nice one of pretty baby lettuces and some  peeled tomatoes. There are also old-fashioned scalloped potatoes and  particularly good French fries.  </P> <P> The desserts at Bayside 240 rarely aim at subtlety (the white chocolate  cheesecake is an exception, smooth and scarcely sweet). There's a chocolate  fudge cake with a strong bitter chocolate flavor, and a banana extravagance  called banana savannah, a sort of banana pie with a chocolate layer.  </P> <P> The most imposing unsubtle dessert is a sort of giant sundae called the  thrasher, which recalls the glory days of the soda fountain. It's a brownie  topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded on various sides with banana and  pineapple slices, whipped cream and hot fudge sauce. I wouldn't swear there  weren't nuts on it as well.  </P> <P> The menu sensibly recommends the thrasher for two people. One person could get  thoroughly thrashed by it. Perhaps that still life by the door, the one of the  shark whipping a smaller fish, is a warning.  </P> <P> Bayside 240  </P> <P>  260 Portofino Way, Redondo Beach, (213) 374-8043.  </P> <P> Open for dinner seven days; brunch Sunday.

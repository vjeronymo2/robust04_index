			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Big cuts in nuclear arsenals agreed by Bush and Yeltsin SWEEPING arms cuts to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in Russian and US possession by more than two-thirds were agreed in Washington yesterday. President George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin agreed to a two-phase plan to cut their arsenals of warheads for long-range nuclear weapons to between 3,000 and 3,500 each by the year 2003. They also agreed to eliminate the multiple warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), seen as the most menacing of all nuclear weapons. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has been working for the past five months with his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, on a pact to take nuclear disarmament beyond the cuts agreed last year in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start.) This treaty would have reduced the US arsenal from about 10,000 warheads to some 8,500, including 1,400 loaded on ICBMs and 3,450 on submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The total Soviet force of about 10,200 warheads would have been cut to 6,450, including 3,150 loaded on ICBMs. Although the deadline for completing the new arms cuts is 2003, Mr Bush said they could be completed by the year 2000 if the US helped Russia to accelerate the destruction process. 'With this agreement, the nuclear night recedes,' Mr Bush said. Mr Yeltsin added that the agreement mirrored the fundamental change in relationship between Russia and the US. The Russian president said that, instead of laying down strict parity, each country could select its own force structure within the 3,000-3,500 target range. 'We know one thing: we shall not fight against each other,' Mr Yeltsin said. The agreement also provides for Russia and the US to work together on developing a 'concept' for a system of global defence against missiles, as well as opening the possibility of sharing early warning information. The disarmament pact will provide a capstone for the meeting, the first formal summit since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the agreement seemed to be overshadowed yesterday, in terms of US public opinion, by Mr Yeltsin's revelation that some US prisoners of war might still be alive in Russia. The Russian leader raised this possibility on Monday, striking a chord with US citizens, most of whom believe that some US servicemen listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war are still held captive. Following the announcement of the arms reductions, Mr Yeltsin said he believed US POWs may still be alive in the former Soviet Union, saying he would join Mr Bush in pursuing a full-scale investigation. Mr Bush said a team of investigators would be sent to Moscow immediately to look into the fate of missing US servicemen. He said Mr Yeltsin told him that the prisoners taken by the Soviet Union included those from the Vietnam era and from earlier wars. While Mr Bush said there was no evidence that any of these Americans were still alive, he praised the Russian leader for agreeing to open the archives of the KGB and the Central Committee of the Communist party to help in the search. Downing Street said that the British government had been in close consultation with the US on the arms reduction discussions well before the summit. Last night, Mr John Major 'warmly welcomed' what he described as a far-reaching agreement.</p>

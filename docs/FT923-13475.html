			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (8): Tensions below the surface - Foreign Policy WHEN the leaders of the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) gathered in December 1990 in Doha, the capital of Qatar, it was obvious to an non-participant what was going to dominate the agenda. Kuwait, one of its members, had been invaded and annexed by Iraq four months earlier. Despite efforts at mediation and a desire to find an Arab solution, the military build-up headed by the US was going on apace. Although few governments then believed that President Saddam Hussein would not extricate himself at the last moment from the threat of war, the affluent states of the Gulf faced, none the less, their most serious challenge since independence. Perversely, the GCC members found they had a more pressing issue to discuss. While the rest of the world struggled with the ambitions of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the Doha summit was largely preoccupied by the dispute between Qatar and Bahrain over the border between the two GCC neighbours. Eighteen months later - with Saddam's forces driven from Kuwait, the al-Sabah family restored to power and the oil fires extinguished - Bahrain and Qatar are still at loggerheads. The argument between the two ruling families and governments is one of several left behind by Britain when it withdrew from east of Suez. Kuwait is in the process of winning back some territory absorbed, since the 1970s, by Iraq; Iran appears to be trying to wrest from the United Arab Emirates total control of Abu Musa island at the mouth of the Gulf; Saudi Arabia and Yemen are exchanging angry words over oil exploration along part of their disputed border, and elsewhere there are several other territorial issues which could flare up again at any time. These arguments are not easily susceptible to mediation. First, they often involve strongly held beliefs and intense personal and tribal rivalries. Second, there is invariably an economic aspect - in particular, the right to explore for hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the parties involved in the dispute may well suspect each other of pursuing an unseen agenda, perhaps involving more powerful players in the region. Such suspicions have contributed to the disappointing performance of the GCC as an effective political and economic organisation - a failure particularly regretted by Bahrain. In part, it reflects the GCC's difficulty in finding a role for itself among the region's competing forces. In the four-way pugilistic context of the past decade, Saudi Arabia and its five smaller partners have occupied one corner, with Iraq in another, Iran in the third - and the fourth occupied by the US, which until recently viewed the Gulf as a crucial area of superpower confrontation. The only overall winner from this complex mesh of conflicts appears to be the US, with its military mastery of the region and its parallel grip on an important part of the world's oil supplies. The benefits, beyond the removal of an Iraqi military threat, are less obvious for small nations such as Bahrain. Ministers who expected greater regional harmony in the wake of the Iran-Iraq war and the Kuwait crisis have been disappointed. Worse: they see the resumption of old rivalries - with no apparent attempt by the remaining superpower to resolve them. Bahrain's rulers remember all too well that not until 1975 did Iran agree not to pursue its claim to their country. Four years later, Iranian designs on Bahrain re-emerged as part of the revolutionary fervour orchestrated by Ayatollah Khomeini. Some Manama residents sense in the present Iranian ambassador an extension of that proprietorial attitude. Qatar is also pursuing its claim to part of Bahrain, while seeking to improve relations with Tehran. Such a rapprochement can be seen as an entirely sensible move by Doha - given that Tehran also has access to its huge offshore North Field structure, containing one of the world's largest gas fields. However, several Arab commentators have already sounded the alarm, warning Qatar of 'opening a door to Tehran that it would not later be able to close.' They have also speculated that Qatar is using its closer ties with Iran as a way of increasing pressure on Bahrain. Officially, little of this breaks the surface. Statements by Bahrain are couched in conciliatory language; Mr Tariq Almoayed, the minister of information, says the government is more disappointed than irritated at Qatar's decision to go alone to the International Court of Justice rather than to make a joint application - as had been agreed by the two countries. He adds that there may be a need to look at the entire border between the countries - a reminder, perhaps, that historically Bahrain has laid claim to Zubara, part of mainland Qatar. Bahrain's renewed plea for a joint approach to the international court was again rejected by Qatar at the beginning of this month. Foreign diplomats in Bahrain are confident that the argument can be resolved amicably. But they recall that in 1986 the two sides came close to blows, when the Qatari navy seized foreign workers constructing a coastguard station for Bahrain. Bahrain's call for better relations with Iraq is officially placed within the same broad context of its desire for greater Gulf harmony. It is a policy development which will be interpreted differently in various capitals, but it broadly represents Bahrain's frustration at its inability to plan a more secure economic future, and its sensitivity to continuing claims to its territory. If the US State Department was at all surprised by Bahrain's more flexible attitude towards Baghdad, it may be because Washington has yet fully to appreciate the longer term consequences and responsibilities of having demonstrated so emphatically its capacity to act as the Gulf policeman. Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the Emir, rarely misses an opportunity when in the presence of Britons to express both his appreciation for the British government's military contribution during the Gulf War and his wish to see London playing a more vigorous and visible role in the region. It is a message heard elsewhere in the Gulf, and it has a greater emphasis now that Washington's influence is so much less qualified throughout the Middle East. Keeping a sense of balance can apply almost as much to friends as it does to enemies.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAMMY WEEK REPORT;  </P> <P> THE PASSAGES OF ROCK;  </P> <P> THE EXTREME;  </P> <P> FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN;  </P> <P> THE AWARDS ARE NOW MORE OPEN TO ROCK'S AGRESSIVE FORCES, BUT THE ACADEMY STILL  DRAWS A LINE  </P> <P> When rock 'n' roll slammed into America in the '50s, the kids loved it, parents  hated it and some wanted it banned. But now, closing in on 40, rock music  permeates American society and has been exported and embraced throughout the  world. Ironically, the record industry's Grammy Awards were slow to fall under  the spell. That too has changed. The passages of rock are charted in three  stories:  </P> <P> The notorious beginnings, seen through a movie about one of its wildest  forefathers, Jerry Lee Lewis.  </P> <P> An analysis of the Grammys and rock's present respectability.  </P> <P> A look at the cutting-edge artists who are pushing into the future.  </P> <P> Thirty years ago the Grammys shunned Little Richard and Jerry Lee. Ten years  later they ignored the Stones, Hendrix and the Who. A decade ago, the Sex  Pistols and the Clash went unrecognized.  </P> <P> And in the '80s there's been no place in the Grammys for Public Enemy, the  Sugarcubes, the Pogues and Elvis Costello.  </P> <P> This might not seem like the crime of the century, especially at a time when  the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is changing its image from  booster of the bland to champion of serious artists making serious social  observations -- as long as they sell a million records or so.  </P> <P> Well, better U2 than Christopher Cross. But does anyone think that if U2 had  remained just a little cult band, "The Joshua Tree" would have been album of  the year? The simple, hard fact is that if it's not a hit, most of the voters  don't hear it.  </P> <P> But even if they were force-fed a diet of Suicidal Tendencies and Guns N'  Roses, academy members would be unlikely to change their tune; it's not the  nature of academies to welcome those dedicated to subverting institutions like  academies.  </P> <P> Instead of reinstituting the rock 'n' roll and punk embargoes, the Grammys now  acknowledge big-selling anti-heroes like Guns N' Roses, Metallica and Public  Enemy by creating ghettos -- separate categories for hard rock, rap et al.  Welcome to the back of the bus, from all the black and country artists who've  been kept off center stage.  </P> <P> In assembling this voters' guide to the most worthy extremists of the day, the  idea wasn't to scour the underground and enshrine the most obscure sludge.  These 12 acts all claim significant fan and critical support, and are currently  in fine creative form. These are the artists who are shaping things, taking  chances, testing limits, expressing a vision, defining attitudes, opening  possibilities.  </P> <P> It might not be at the top of the charts, but this music -- on its own or  filtered through its disciples -- will figure strongly in the process of  renewal that keeps rock 'n' roll forever young.  </P> <P> Just imagine a Grammy show that acknowledged this. . . .  </P> <P> "Now, to present the award for Best Inspirational Drone Band, please welcome  one of the major influences on glam and punk, that minimalist man about  Manhattan, Mr. Lou Reed. . . . "  </P> <P> "Thank you, Sheena. You know, I didn't think we'd ever see a band that uses  fewer chords and more feedback than we did in the Velvet Underground (thank  you, thank you). Or a singer who makes me sound like Terence Trent D'Arby.  </P> <P> "OK, maybe on paper it doesn't look so great. But if you've heard 'Psychocandy'  or 'April Skies' or that killer take on Bo Diddley's 'Who Do You Love,' you  know you've experienced the majestic melancholy that only pure rock 'n' roll  can attain. I know what it is to be mistaken for a joke, guys, so carry this  award proudly -- and stick it in their teeth if you have to. Ladies and  gentlemen, from Scotland, THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN. . . ."  </P> <P> And so it would go. Here are the other 11.  </P> <P> PUBLIC ENEMY (Presenter: Gil Scott-Heron). Delivering their rhymes like Molotov  cocktails, the New York rappers bring the '60s' black militant stance into the  '80s: It's them against a repressive system full of corruption and conspiracy.  Punching out their tough, assured rhythms, Chuck D and crew pump themselves up  to archetypal proportions -- the Public Enemy, a rude intrusion on a kinder,  gentler nation. The group spends much of its second album, last year's "It  Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back," refusing to apologize for its  first album -- where it touted controversial black-power advocate Louis  Farrakhan, and "sampled" other people's music. Chuck D extends his challenge to  black radio. His declaration of war: You singers are spineless /As you sing  your senseless songs to the mindless / Your general subject of love is minimal  / It's sex for profit.  </P> <P> GUNS N' ROSES (Presenters: Keith Richards and Steve Tyler). Forget the bad-boy  antics. Forget the swagger and the leather. Forget the fact that it all sounds  a little familiar. The Hollywood heroes have emerged from the glitter pack and  become the rebel rockers of choice for the hard-rock fans who demand a true "us  against them" mentality rather then empty posturing. GN'R casts a bloodshot,  documentary eye on the wonderful life in their wonderful town. "Welcome to the  jungle," W. Axl Rose sings to open their hit album "Appetite for Destruction."  Strains of lost innocence sweeten the pot, and the stormy, Stones/Aerosmith/New  York Dolls guitar attack is tough enough to blow the cobwebs off the central  cliche -- Hollywood as a seductress and corrupter. It's also erratic and  threatening enough to put Guns N' Roses at the very edge of acceptability. (For  many former fans, Rose's rants against immigrants and gays on the current hit  mini-album, "G N'R Lies" have pushed the band over the edge.) Like the punk  innovators of the '70s, Guns N' Roses marks the last stop for those who want to  get off before things get too scary.  </P> <P> THE REPLACEMENTS (Presenter: Ian Hunter). The all-American misunderstood boys  (non-metal division) play guitar rock that unfailingly gathers itself into a  sweet melody line straight from the heart, no matter how chaotic and ramshackle  the beginning.  </P> <P> Chaotic and ramshackle are the operative words on the concert stage, where the  Minneapolis' foursome's unpredictability has made them the stuff of legend.  Torn between the perverse impulse to throw it all away and the rock 'n' roll  imperative to make it (one foot in the door / The other one in the gutter, they  sang on 1987's "Pleased to Meet Me"), Paul Westerberg and company come off as  rambunctious, melancholy, irreverent, wistful, romantic, bleary  existentialists. Westerberg is a true natural, a Huck Finn/Jimmy Stewart  innocent taking on the world with a Mott the Hoople defiance. He has some of  the primal rock instincts and intensity of a John Fogerty -- but with a  different set of musical roots ('70s hit pop, glam-rock), and a finely  developed sense of irony.  </P> <P> THE POGUES (Presenter: Van Morrison). The Clancy Brothers on speed, the  Chieftains in heat. The brawling Irish/English brigade was the first to exploit  the similarities between traditional Irish folk music and punk-rock: the cries  of alienation, the frantic slam-dance tempos. Singer Shane MacGowan is an  unpredictable, eccentric singer, wobbly but concentrating, coarse but vivid --  a bit like his buddy Joe Strummer. While they're cleaning up the act musically  -- and dabbling amusingly in Middle Eastern and Mexican forms -- they're coming  up with better songs. The last Pogues album, 1987's "If I Should Fall from  </P> <P> Grace With God," moves from Irish death obsessions to ghost stories to  race-track limericks to love laments to political protest. And now the advance  single from the next album comes along sounding like a giddy lost Motown  rocker.  </P> <P> JANE'S ADDICTION (Presenter: Iggy Pop). Sweet, elusive psychedelic reveries  alternate with hard-rock revelry on "Nothing's Shocking," last year's major-  label debut by the latest great hope from the battlefields of the L.A. rock  scene.  </P> <P> Confessional then distant, insistent then oddly distracted, the band can get  pretty slippery, but Perry Farrell keeps you from giving up. The raspy-voiced  urchin is a compelling presence at the center of the storm, confronting his  demons in rock 'n' roll psychodramas like "Had a Dad," then sketching an  aching, sympathetic slice of Hollywood life in "Jane Says." The band's  rambunctious reputation rests more on its arrogant image and anything-goes live  shows than on this friendly and accessible record.  </P> <P> THE SUGARCUBES (Presenters: Nina Hagen and Grace Slick). It's not as though  Iceland is another planet -- they do have radio and television there. Still,  there's a faintly alien tone in this Icelandic band's dense but airy tone  poems. It sounds like something that developed in isolation, cut off from  rock's major currents, and singer Bjork's possessed vocals contribute to the  Nordic mystery of the enigmatic songs. All of which might explain why last  year's debut album, "Life's Too Good," became the rage of the alternative  market.  </P> <P> ICE-T (Presenter: Curtis Mayfield). The L.A. rapper's second album, "Power,"  opens with the sounds of an argument and a shooting over an advance tape of the  album. That sums up a good part of Mr. T's turf: self-promotion and urban  violence. Even if you don't buy the whole pose and package, it's hard to resist  the momentum and intense action of his L.A. gang scenarios. One narrative on  "Power" scraps the common 4/4 rap rhythms and floats over a cool, jazzy  background -- a Tom Waits/ Raymond Chandler exercise that suggests new options  for creative rappers. (The other part of his turf is sex, depicted in terms  that might make Prince blush and infected with a deep misogyny. Needs work  here.)  </P> <P> METALLICA (Presenter: Ozzy Osbourne). How do the kingpins of the "new metal"  differ from the heroes of mainstream heavy metal? Their spare, scowling guitar  rock has none of the craven melodies and grandiose cymbal-crashing of ambitious  chart-climbers. They race along like a punk band, they shift rhythms like a  fusion group. They don't sing about girls, preferring to consider systems of  oppression and symptoms of depression. They don't dress in spangles and romp  around like circus acrobats. They don't grin and pretend to be your buddies,  they don't wear makeup and pretend to be the devil. Their guitar solos -- which  occupy much of their records and shows -- are direct, with no electronic  gimmickry. What Metallica does have in common with the old guys is a standing  reservation in the Top 10.  </P> <P> BH SURFERS (Presenter: Roky Erikson, legendary Texas visionary and leader of  '60s psychedelic band the Thirteenth Floor Elevators). If Guns N' Roses are one  of those "lock up your daughters" bands, the Surfers' cry might be "lock up  your dogs." No quirks of human behavior are beyond the grasp of these Austin  eccentrics, whose edge-of-chaos sound drills down to subconscious pools of  depravity and scatology. They generate a hallucinatory state in which ordeals  can be hilarious and cleansing as well as disturbing. The band's live show,  with its grim films, obsessed dual drummers, burning bass, brain-tapping strobe  lights, bullhorn vocals and topless dancers, is unequalled for creating an air  of imminent collapse.  </P> <P> SUICIDAL TENDENCIES (Presenter: Pete Townshend). Few bands have articulated  youthful alienation better than this Venice group, which has bridged the punk  and metal worlds over the course of its three albums. The cult hit  "Institutionalized" was just the beginning. The group's recent LP, "How Will I  Laugh Tomorrow . . . When I Can't Even Smile Today," is an interior journey  from pain, madness, hopelessness, impotence and isolation to determination and  action. It rides on a brisk, crushing barrage that's not really out of the  metal mainstream -- but ST's overall tone is a little rougher than the norm,  and the gang trappings contribute to their threatening air.  </P> <P> ELVIS COSTELLO (Presenter: Bob Dylan). A lifetime achievement award for the  elder statesman of this maverick delegation. From the new-wave upstart of "My  Aim Is True" to the revitalized upstart of the new "Spike," Costello has cut a  monumental path through '80s pop music. Dissecting both love and politics with  intricate imagery, moving restlessly from hard-rock to country to soul to torch  song to folk, the bespectacled one has delivered the goods with true rage.  </P></p>

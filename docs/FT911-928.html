			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Norway hits 1991 high on quiet Continent SCANDINAVIA apart, volume was thin in most continental bourses yesterday, as traders and investors looked forward to today's Ascension Day holiday. Paris was closed, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT did its best to avoid commitment, and turnover on German stock exchanges stayed low at DM4.4bn, against DM4.2bn on Tuesday. However, prices moved down, some of them considerably. After an 8.87 drop to 681.21 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 20.18, or 1.2 per cent lower at 1,607.28. There was particular weakness in chemicals and mechanical engineering, and relative strength in energy stocks like RWE, only DM2 lower at DM401.50, and Veba, down DM1.10 to DM348.90. The engineering losses were apparently indiscriminate. Lower profits from Metallgesellschaft followed two days of strength on a DM1bn project to clean up pollution in East Germany, and coincided with a report from Barclays de Zoete Wedd which said that Germany's mechanical engineering industry is on its way into recession. The shares fell DM7.50 to DM546, but there was more severe weakness in Linde and MAN - down DM16 to DM798, and DM9.50 to DM379 respectively - for which BZW saw above-average prospects SEL, the telecom company 86 per cent owned by the French Alcatel group, dropped another DM22 to DM328 for a two-day loss of DM51. On Tuesday it reported that net profits had almost disappeared in 1990, and passed the dividend; but Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt observed that the company had revealed to analysts that it still had DVFA earnings of DM15 a share for last year. Another big faller was Continental, the tyre manufacturer, down DM6.70 to DM197 as it called an extraordinary supervisory board meeting for today. Last week the company halved its 1990 dividend. OSLO hit a year's high in active trading as foreign investors showed renewed interest. The all-share index, which gained 2.5 per cent on Tuesday, rose 4.90 to 506.17, passing the previous 1991 high set in early March. Turnover grew to NKr588m from NKr517m. Kvaerner rose NKr4.5 to NKr202 after the engineering company revised upwards its 1991 profits forecast. The board also won approval for plans to merge with Kvaerner Shipping, and for an issue of 3.5m new shares. Saga, which announced first-quarter profits after the market closed, added NKr2.5 to NKr115. MILAN continued to fall in thin trading on increased worries that Italy's 50th postwar government could collapse over disagreement on the current budget discussions. The Comit index fell 6.81 or 1.2 per cent to 574.88 in volume estimated at slightly above Tuesday's low L106bn. Fiat ordinary shares dropped L132 to L5,267, following Tuesday's news that its new car deliveries had fallen 15.5 per cent in April, and continued to slide in after-hours trading to L5,250. Olivetti fell L82 to L3,648 on a newspaper report that Volkswagen of Germany might sell its 5 per cent stake in the computer company. One analyst said he would not be surprised if the car company sold its holding, as it was not integral to its core business. Furthermore, Olivetti's current difficulties made an early recovery in the share price unlikely. After the market closed, Volkswagen issued a denial. AMSTERDAM was mostly easier with the exception of Internatio-Muller which jumped 7.8 per cent on speculative buying. The CBS tendency index fell 0.4 to 94.2 in quiet trading. Internatio gained Fl 6 to Fl 83 following Tuesday's news of a takeover offer from Hong Kong's First Pacific. But Hagemeyer, 60 per cent owned by First Pacific, fell Fl 2.80 to Fl 119.50. Both shares were suspended on Tuesday. Buhrmann-Tetterode, ex dividend of Fl 2.80, was hurt by its recent profit warning. It closed down Fl 4.10 at Fl 52.60. STOCKHOLM fell in a busy half-day session. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 5.9 to 1,036.0 in turnover up from SKr343m to SKr380m. Ericsson B shares dropped SKr8 or 4.2 per cent to SKr181 in turnover of SKr56m, after Tuesday's late announcement of a 14 per cent fall in first-quarter profits. MADRID was little changed. The general index eased 0.49 to 279.55, while turnover picked up to about Pta11bn from Pta9.4bn. Focsa was requoted, rising to Pta14,960 before falling back to close Pta200 lower at Pta14,500. It was suspended from trading on Tuesday for the announcement that it is to be merged with another construction company owned by the same family interests. VIENNA fell 1.7 per cent to its worst level since the end of March, following losses in Frankfurt and overnight on Wall Street. The bourse index shed 9.88 to 565.77 in active trade. ZURICH went with the tide, dropping Nestle registered by SFr130 to SFr8,360 although the food group said yesterday that sales were rising and that 1991 profits, with a proviso on exchange rates, should be better this year. The Credit Suisse index fell 3.4 to 542.4.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - May 8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close  1120.75  1120.88  1119.33  1118.35  1118.83  1118.87  1118.76  1119.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High 1121.39            Day's Low 1117.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       May 7          May 3        May 2        May1        Apr30      1125.75        1129.77      1128.32      1110.32     1111.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

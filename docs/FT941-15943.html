			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Isda forms arbitration service Despite protests that it does not want to become the self-regulatory organisation for over-the-counter derivatives trading, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association has formed a non-binding arbitration service called the Isda Market Advisory Service. The service has the dual goals of settling disputes between members and establishing good market practices in the industry, Isda said. Isda has been active since 1985 promoting trade and regulatory issues relevant to commercial, investment, and merchant banks active in swap and derivative transactions.</p>

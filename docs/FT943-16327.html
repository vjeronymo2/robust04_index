			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Plastic surgery ICI has developed a taste for floating off unwanted assets. Unlike the demerger of Zeneca, though, its decision to make a graceful exit from PVC is no surprise. The joint venture with Enichem never looked like a permanent solution. By transfering manufacturing assets into what was originally a marketing alliance three years ago, the partners paved the way for eventual sale. One can only assume that the recent recovery in plastics prices has improved EVC's operating performance to the point where it can stand alone. Without a prospectus it is impossible to put a value on the business. The only clues to EVC's trading performance are buried in the associates line of ICI's results, and even these are muddied by transfer pricing. The state of the balance sheet can only be guessed at. Comparable US companies - such as Geon, the PVC specialist floated by its parent last year - are valued at a modest discount to annual turnover. If EVC can convince investors of its determination to cut costs and raise margins towards the US norm, a valuation of over Pounds 500m might therefore be achievable. Investors should welcome the chance to own a specialist company rather than the chemicals conglomerates which dominate the European scene. If such figures prove to be correct, the exercise will leave ICI with next to no net debt. How it plans to flex this financial muscle remain unclear. Investment projects such as building new plants in Asia are laudable but will barely dent free cash flow in the upturn. Having resisted the temptation to sell out at the very bottom of the economic cycle, ICI must avoid reinvesting near the top.</p>

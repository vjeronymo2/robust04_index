			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Iraqi trial told of warning A SENIOR civil servant warned his colleagues that embarrassing 'dirty washing' within the Department of Trade and Industry would be discovered by an investigation into the exporting of equipment for the Iraqi defence procurement programme, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. The warning was given by Mr Michael Coolican, an assistant secretary at the DTI, in June 1990 after Customs began investigating both the supergun affair and the exporting of other equipment to Iraq. In a memo, read out in court, Mr Coolican said: 'The dirty washing liable to emerge from the actions of Customs and Excise will add to the problems posed by the gun.' The timing of the investigation would be 'extraordinarily embarrassing' for the DTI, given recent conversations between it, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, he went on. DTI civil servants had not been aware of the activities of Customs when they briefed trade ministers on the matter, Mr Coolican said. The court also heard that, according to a memo from the British security services written in August 1987, American blueprints were used by the Iraqis during the Iran-Iraq war to build a 1,000-pound bomb at their Nassr munitions factory. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Press bodies detail case against regulation The Association of British Editors, the Guild of Editors and the International Press Institute yesterday launched a document detailing the case against new legal restrictions on the media. The document identifies 46 statutes which they say inhibit reporting, lists the media's selfregulation measures and argues that there are potential dangers in further restrictions on the public's right to know. Mr James Bishop, ABE chairman, says that 'there is continuing difficulty in reconciling the individual's right to privacy and the public's right to know. But the legal constraints already in place, together with the latest steps in self-regulation, provide sufficient protection of privacy and are more than adequate to meet current parliamentary concern.' The document was drafted by Professor Hugh Stephenson, professor of journalism at London's City University, after a meeting of more than 60 newspaper, magazine, radio and television editors last autumn. There has been pressure from outside the industry for legislation to make invasion of privacy a civil wrong, and for the replacement of the present system of press self-regulation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigerian police has accomplished a major feat by  finally tracking down Chief Moshood Abiola who allegedly  declared himself president of Nigeria about a couple of weeks  ago. It will be recalled that Chief Abiola, the presidential  candidate of the defunct Social Democratic Party, was declared  wanted about two weeks ago by the police to answer a charge of  treason leveled against him following his self-declaration as  president of Nigeria. The deputy inspector general of police in  charge of operations, Mr. Nuhu Aliyu, confirmed the arrest in an  interview a few hours ago with Mohammed Okoresho.    [Begin recording] [Aliyu] The arrest is no longer a rumor;  it  is confirmed, yes. We are very positive.    [Okoresho] Now, how did it happen? Did he surrender himself  or he appeared as reported in some of the media, or you sought  him out?    [Aliyu] He did not surrender himself. He appeared, and we  were very cautious but eventually we arrested him.    [Okoresho] Now, before his appearance in public, did you get  a tipoff of his hideout or that he was going to appear in public?    [Aliyu] Yes, yes, yes we got a tipoff that he was appearing.    [Okoresho] Now, how come, according to press reports, that  he  was able to address a rally and drive through the traffic all  the way to his own house until he was picked up much later?    [Aliyu] It's a strategy; I do not want to explain further.    [Okoresho] A foreign radio has been relaying an interview  with Chief Moshood Abiola while supposedly being taken away by  his captors. Are people under arrest normally allowed to do  that kind of interview? It does not seem like a police style to  me.    [Aliyu] Normally, somebody who.... [pauses] whoever is under  arrest is not supposed to grant any interview. It's very  unusual. We are looking into this report.    [Okoresho] What are going to do with Chief Abiola now? Where  is he right now?    [Aliyu] Chief Abiola?    [Okoresho] Yes.    [Aliyu] Of course, he is going to be interrogated. You know,  after accusation he has to sit down with us, we interrogate him.  He will have to make a statement to us. [end recording]</p>

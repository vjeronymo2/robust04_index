			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 2 May (MENA)--An official source in Sanaa has  accused the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of undermining the  passing of unitary laws, hampering the unification of state  institutions, rejecting the integration of the armed forces into  a single national institution, and not freeing its members from  party hegemony and loyalty.    The source also accused the YSP of rejecting attempts to  integrate the armed forces in order to achieve its own  objective, which is to secede from the unitary state and return  to party dictatorship over the six provinces in the south.    The source stressed that there is no use here for any force  or individual that tramples on democracy and constitutional  legitimacy.</p>

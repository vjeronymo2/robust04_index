			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Strike by Nigerian oil workers forces Shell to default on supplies The Anglo-Dutch Shell company, Nigeria's largest oil producer, yesterday declared force majeure on deliveries of crude oil, enabling it to default on supplies of about 1m barrels of oil per day, half of Nigeria's crude oil output. The decision, which means the company does not expect to meet original loading dates, led to a rise in oil prices. London September futures for the world benchmark Brent Blend rose to Dollars 17.94 per barrel, up almost 30 cents from Tuesday. There was also an unconfirmed report of a gas blast in the Nigerian Forcados field. Shell took the decision after reviewing the effects on the industry of the three-week oil workers' strike against military rule. The company was already three days behind schedule on loadings but says the main effect will be on August deliveries. Until yesterday Shell and the other oil companies operating in Nigeria had managed to keep output at normal levels by deploying non-union staff, mainly senior managers or expatriates, on essential tasks. Recent threats of reprisals by the unions against strike-breakers persuaded Shell to withdraw staff, according to oil experts in Nigeria, halting the flow of oil to its terminals Bonny and Forcados in the Niger delta. Chevron and Mobil have not yet declared any lapse in loadings but most companies say that this is a matter of time. Oil accounts for more than 90 per cent of Nigeria's exports and the cut in production deepens the country's financial crisis. Arrears on the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18bn) of external debt have reached Dollars 8bn. The budget deficit for the first half of the year was about Dollars 1.5bn, according to the finance ministry, and non-oil revenue flows have almost dried up since foreign exchange regulations were imposed in January. The oil strike is the most serious threat so far to the regime of General Sani Abacha. Nigeria is expecting a delegation from US President Bill Clinton, to be led by the Rev Jesse Jackson, to mediate in the political crisis. Nigeria is also host to a summit of West African heads of state, postponed this week until August 5. The government is under pressure from the oil workers and other unions in south-west Nigeria to release from jail Mr Moshood Abiola, the banned winner of last year's annulled presidential election, who is due to face trial today in Abuja for treason after declaring himself president. The union demands include the replacement of military rule by a government formed by Mr Abiola and the repayment of an estimated Dollars 800m owed by the government to the oil companies.</p>

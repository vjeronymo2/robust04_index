			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador on course for banana sales record As Latin American banana producers are making renewed efforts to forge a united front in the face of European Union import quotas, Ecuador, the world's leading exporter, is heading for record sales this year. The latest figures come only a week after the region's banana producers met in San Jose, Costa Rica, to consider a possible cut in production to revive depressed prices. First half exports reached 1.6m tonnes, up 20 per cent from the same period last year, and state officials expect this year's total to surpass the 1991 record of 2.6m tonnes. Despite a drop in banana prices on the world markets because of oversupply, total revenues are also running ahead of last year's, reaching USDollars 380m in the first half. Ecuador's higher foreign sales, which supply 26 per cent of the world market, are not due to increased production. The government has been pursuing a policy aimed at cutting output. Since the beginning of the year 11,000 hectares of inefficient plantations have been destroyed, most of them infected with the costly Black Sigatoka disease. Leading banana exporters say that a further 20,000 to 25,000 hectares of inefficient plantations need to be eliminated to boost the country's low productivity level. Ecuador produces only half as many bananas a hectare as its Central American competitors, but can compete because of lower overall costs. Industry analysts say that Ecuador's export bonanza results largely from aggressive marketing. While other Latin American exporters have lost ground, it has opened new markets in the Far East, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and has maintained its sales to the EC.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes the statute does not prohibit the establishment of different standards for different institutions and therefore does not wish to preclude a State from establishing such standards, provided the State can adequately justify that different standards are more appropriate than uniform standards for the institutions in its State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.21(b)(2), the Secretary proposes that a State establish standards that specify the records and information a referred institution would need to maintain to demonstrate to a SPRE the institution's compliance with those standards. The Secretary wishes to make clear that technically, only a referred institution is subject to the recordkeeping requirements specified in the State's standards unless, as discussed previously in &sect;667.3 of this preamble, the State has or creates an entity that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with those standards. Otherwise, a nonreferred institution may choose not to maintain the specified records. However, that institution would risk losing its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs if as a result of some future event it triggered a statutory review criterion, and was unable to produce the records required to demonstrate to the SPRE its compliance with the State's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, concern has been raised regarding a State's authority to collect information from all institutions in the State for the purpose of establishing review standards. For example, a State may establish on an annual basis a student graduation rate standard that is equal to the average graduation rate of students at all institutions in the State. While the Secretary believes that this method of establishing review standards is reasonable and appropriate, a State does not have the authority under the SPRP to require all institutions in the State to report standards-related information to the SPRE. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Secretary encourages all institutions to comply with a request from a SPRE for this information, particularly if the only alternative available to the SPRE is to establish arbitrary standards. The Secretary wishes to make clear, however, that a SPRE has the authority under section 494C(d) of the HEA to require standards-related information from all referred institutions in the State. The Secretary notes that if a State standard is based upon an average, such as an average graduation rate, there must be a sufficient number of institutions providing data to support that rate, and the reporting institutions should be representative of the institutions located in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.21(b)(4), the Secretary proposes that a State must quantify certain review standards. Thus, for the standard described in section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(10), the Secretary proposes that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between the tuition and fees charged by an institution for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program actually earns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, for the standard described in section 494C(d)(14) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(18), the Secretary proposes that a State establish acceptable percentages for_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The completion and graduation rates of students enrolled in educational programs offered by an institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The withdrawal rate of students at an institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) With respect to an institution's vocational and professional programs, the placement rate of the institution's graduates in occupations related to their educational program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The rate or rates at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each of these areas, the acceptable percentage sets the level above which a SPRE must consider an institution to be in compliance with the review standard, and below which a SPRE makes either a finding of noncompliance or conducts a further review of the institution to account for the reasons the institution failed to meet that percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary understands that developing such standards will be difficult and will therefore allow States great flexibility in developing these quantifiable standards, both in terms of the methods used to determine an acceptable percentage and the actual acceptable percentage. Moreover, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that the acceptable percentage that a State establishes should reflect whether an institution is successfully providing its educational programs to its students rather than whether the institution should automatically be terminated from participation in the Title IV, HEA programs solely because it failed to satisfy that standard. The Secretary also reiterates that a State need not recommend the termination of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs solely because the institution failed to meet any particular State standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

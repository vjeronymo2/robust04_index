			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Goodyear forecasts improved first-quarter profits of Dollars 83m GOODYEAR, the Ohio-based tyre manufacturer, yesterday forecast first-quarter profits after tax in the range of Dollars 83m to Dollars 86m. This would represent a significant improvement on the Dollars 66.1m (before extraordinary items) seen in the same period of 1992, and the Dollars 90.1m loss reported in the first three months of 1991. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said at the company's annual meeting that sales in the first three months of 1993 would show an advance of about 2 per cent on the same quarter of 1992, when the restated figure was Dollars 2.68m. Goodyear shares closed down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 1/2 . The meeting also voted to approve an increase in Goodyear's authorised common stock to 300m shares from 150m, Reuter reports. The company had announced previously plans for a two-for-one stock split, which will be effected in the form of a 100 per cent stock dividend to shareholders. Goodyear has reduced its debt load to some Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 3.62bn in 1990, much of it coming through the sale of assets. Mr Gault said that the company's big asset sales were now behind it. He added that Goodyear's Celeron unit, which owns its All American crude oil pipeline system, became profitable in the fourth quarter of 1992. The unit lost Dollars 52m in both 1990 and 1991. It reduced that to a Dollars 15m loss for 1992 but Mr Gault said that Goodyear planned to sell Celeron eventually.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Demand for fresh food lifts Tokyu stores 7.4% TOKYU store chain, part of Japan's Tokyu retail and railway group, yesterday reported a 7.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y4.77bn (Dollars 34.31m) in the year ended February 1991, citing strong demand for fresh food items as the reason for the rise. Sales increased by 6 per cent to Y256.85bn, with a 9.6 per cent rise in fresh food sales and a 0.6 per cent increase in clothing sales, which were affected by an unusually warm winter. The company said profit margins were improved by a streamlining of stock control, but higher interest rates increased payment burdens. For the current year, the company expects a marginal increase in pre-tax profit to Y4.87 on sales of Y265bn. Life Stores, another supermarket operator, reported an 8.6 per cent increase in sales to Y158.5bn and a 15.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profit at Y3.8bn. The company expects pre-tax profit for this year to increase by 5 per cent to Y4bn on sales of Y175bn, a 10.4 per cent increase. ASCII Pictures, a subsidiary of computer Japanese software and chip manufacturer ASCII Corporation, has reached an agreement with Edward R. Pressman Film Corporation, based in Studio City, California, to buy 33.3 per cent of Pressman's shares for Dollars 7.5m.</p>

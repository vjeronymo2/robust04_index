			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: CEDR settles Pounds 3m dispute - Legal Briefs The Centre for Dispute Resolution (CEDR), an industry-backed, non-profit-making body set up in 1990 to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution in the UK, has resolved a Pounds 3m dispute between Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering and the Ceylon Electricity Board. The two-year-old dispute, over an electrical engineering contract for Colombo's underground distribution system, was resolved in five days. CEDR was approached by the British High Commission after several unsuccessful attempts by the parties to settle the wrangle. Mediation was carried out in Sri Lanka by two mediators from London. The alternative for the parties was lengthy international arbitration, according to CEDR. One of the companies estimated its cost savings at Pounds 200,000.</p>

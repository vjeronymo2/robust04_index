			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAMORRO'S UPSET WIN IN NICARAGUA  </P> <P> A simple question regarding democracy and the Nicaraguan elections: Who showed  more respect for democratic values?  </P> <P> Daniel Ortega, who allowed a popular election to unseat his own presidency; or  the Reagan-Bush Administration, that subverted, perverted and otherwise  compromised our own moral and democratic principles in pursuit of its policy of  terror and intimidation?  </P> <P> If we are to accept the notion that the election outcome is a vindication of  the Reagan-Bush policy, then we must also accept a revision of the popular  quotation to read that "It is now possible for democracy to flow from the  barrel of a gun."  </P> <P> MICHAEL TOOHEY HEILIG  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

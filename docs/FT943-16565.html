			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Glasgow BB King brings his trusty Lucille to the Glasgow International Jazz Festival tonight. On Wednesday, soul-jazz pianist Horace Silver has the Brass Ensemble in tow at the Old Fruit Market, and on Thursday Al Green's evangelical falsetto will be melting hearts at the Royal Concert Hall. A rare visit by the Max Roach quartet on Saturday should rekindle memories of the great drummer's association with Bird and Dizzy.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Thumbs up to Jim and Sally Harrick, who are donating $75,000 to the UCLA  Athletics Campaign to endow a scholarship for the men's basketball program. Now  that's loyalty. . . .  </P> <P> Jose Canseco set his sights too low when he talked about a 50-50 home  run-stolen base season. . . .  </P> <P> Anyone who thinks ESPN is televising too much baseball should be sentenced to  two hours watching a tractor pull. . . .  </P> <P> Angel pitchers need fielding lessons. . . .  </P> <P> A pleasant surprise has been the work of analyst Ron Cey on SportsChannel's  Dodger telecasts. Good insight, pleasant delivery. . . .  </P> <P> Baseball might be the national pastime, but why do high school and college  games draw so poorly compared to football and basketball? . . .  </P> <P> Frank Viola is trying to join Gaylord Perry as a Cy Young Award winner in both  leagues. . . .  </P> <P> Despite Viola's great start, the annual hype of the New York Mets is merely  that. Here's a team that is fundamentally unsound. . . .  </P> <P> One more for the Carlton Fisk Has Played More Games for the White Sox Than for  the Red Sox file: Ernie Banks played more games at first base than at  shortstop. . . .  </P> <P> The surprising thing about the Cincinnati Reds' success is that they're  achieving it without much of a contribution from Eric Davis, who was hitting  .186 before being placed on the disabled list. . . .  </P> <P> Raul Perez, the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion who stands 5 feet 11  and cannot weigh more than 118 pounds for title fights, is taller than former  heavyweight champions Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano. . . .  </P> <P> A guy who spends $100 for a seat will turn his back to the ring to watch two  drunks fight in the stands. . . .  </P> <P> Buster Douglas signs autographs for hours -- and doesn't charge. . . .  </P> <P> Angelo Dundee on Tyson: "He's a nice guy. Really is. I remember calling him  every name in the book when he fought Pinklon Thomas. Then I'm walking Pinklon  back to the corner after he gets knocked out. Tyson taps me on the shoulder. I  think he's going to kill me. Instead, he says, 'Mr. Dundee, I just want to say,  Hi.' " . . .  </P> <P> Dundee on George Foreman: "He's gotten so glib that he reminds me of Archie  Moore. Except he smiles more than Archie." . . .  </P> <P> Jerry Niss, who died recently, was a jack of all boxing trades. He made  matches, reported them for the Associated Press and booked fighters throughout  the world. . . .  </P> <P> Hana Mandlikova, now rated 26th in the world among women tennis players, is one  of the more disappointing athletes of the century. . . .  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati is on the cover of Newsweek. Nothing like putting a little  pressure on a 14-year-old. . . .  </P> <P> When Laz Barrera says Mister Frisky didn't like the track Saturday at Churchill  Downs, does that mean the horse told him so? . . .  </P> <P> Nick Pappas, long a familiar face around USC's athletic department, will be  roasted by former colleagues, including Craig Fertig, Bob Boyd, Rod Dedeaux and  Marv Goux Tuesday at Town &amp; Gown on campus. . . .  </P> <P> When Michelle Staubach graduates from Catholic University in Washington Sunday,  her father, Roger, will be the commencement speaker. . . .  </P> <P> To most of the universe, the World Cup soccer tournament is a bigger deal than  the Olympic Games. . . .  </P> <P> The midget race features last week at Ascot Park were won by Parnelli Jones'  sons, P.J. and Page. . . .  </P> <P> Whatever happened to Xavier Hermosillo? . . .  </P> <P> I don't know which took more courage, driving Indy race cars through the  streets of Long Beach or running the marathon on them in 80-plus-degree  weather. . . .  </P> <P> Boston Bruin goalie Andy Moog on Washington Capital cheap-shot artist Dale  Hunter: "I've got a really smelly glove. I put it right up Hunter's nose." . .  .  </P> <P> Jim Valvano, who hasn't been interviewed for the job, is telling friends he  would love to coach the Clippers. . . .  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson will be in L.A., but: The NBA, in conjunction with Brightstar  Communications of London, is going to show the live telecast of the Laker-Sun  game from Phoenix Sunday at the Cannes Film Festival. . . .  </P> <P> The NBA should call more intentional fouls in the playoffs before somebody gets  seriously hurt. . . .  </P> <P> Even if you have no rooting interest, you've got to love the  Chicago-Philadelphia series with the Bulls' Michael Jordan and the 76ers'  Charles Barkley center stage. . . .  </P> <P> The Celtics need younger players, not an older coach.  </P></p>

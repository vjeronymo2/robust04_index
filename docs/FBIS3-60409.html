			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 20 (XINHUA) -- China is to use  legal means to avoid new births of inferior quality and heighten  the standards of the whole population.    The measures include deferring the date of marriage,  terminating pregnancies and sterilization, according to a draft  law on eugenics and health protection, which was presented to  the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress  (NPC) Standing Committee.    Explaining the law to participants at an NPC session that  opened here today, Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang said  that the measures will help prevent infections and heredity  diseases and protect the health of mothers and children.    Under the draft law, those having such ailments as  hepatitis,  venereal disease or mental illness, which can be passed on  through birth, will be banned from marrying while carrying the  disease.    Pregnant women who have been diagnosed as having certain  infectious diseases or an abnormal fetus will be advised to halt  the pregnancy. Couples in the category should have themselves  sterilized, the draft says.    China is in urgent need of adopting such a law to put a stop  to the prevalence of abnormal births, Minister Chen explained.  Statistics show that China now has more than 10 million disabled  persons who could have been prevented through better controls.    The draft also stipulates that organizations that are  engaged  in pre-marital checks, eugenics, pre-birth diagnosis or  sterilizations should be approved by the authorities at the  county level and above.    Personnel involved in this area should be subjected to  strict  training, Chen said.    The minister of public health called on medical authorities  at various levels to establish a comprehensive network for the  implementation of the law.    The draft does not state whether China will adopt euthanasia  to eliminate congenitally abnormal children, saying that the  international community has not come to a conclusion on that  issue.    The draft also does not touch on the issues of artificial  fertilization or test-tube babies because the effects of these  techniques have caused some disputes and because it's too early  to put any limitations into law, Chen said.    Minister Chen said the government should strengthen its  control and supervision of these techniques. He called for the  Ministry of Public Health to work out tentative management  measures of control.</p>

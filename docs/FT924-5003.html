			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: Christmas with bells on it - Lucia van der Post tests designer trees, pulls tasteful crackers and examines inventive alternatives to paper streamers and battered baubles HALF THE fun of Christmas, it seems to me, is the chance it gives to dress the house up to the nines. No need for quiet, restrained, good taste - more a chance to indulge your decorative fancies to the full, to be as opulent, as self - indulgent, as over-the top as you fancy. These days there is no excuse for just hauling out the cheap paper streamers and the battered box of baubles - for the well - heeled and lazy the shops are filled with decorative delights, while for the enterprising with initiative and energy to spare lots can be done for very little. Habitat has some well-priced decorations this year with pine-bedecked boughs and cone trees starting at Pounds 9.95. For decorating the tree choose from three different themes - circus (acrobats at Pounds 1.95, strongmen at Pounds 2.50, lions at Pounds 1.95), American folk art (carved wooden animals such as fish and reindeer) or Shades of White (in more traditional mode with frosted icicles, garlands, white wooden wreaths and doves). Every Christmas Thomas Goode of 19, South Audley Street, London W1 asks a clutch of celebrities and designers to come up with a festive table theme. This year's collection is as inspirational as ever. Many, but not all, of the components are individually expensive but the ideas come free and can, with some ingenuity, be re-invented at home. Elaine Paige, for instance, uses a rich red and gold theme and though her wonderful Michael Szell print cloth of golden fans on red is expensive much the same effect can be achieved at lower cost. She uses red and gold fabric bows, gold lay-plates, gold and red napkins (the rings finished off with musical instruments) and hangs a central candelabra with tiny oval and heart-shaped mirrors, tassels, crystal clusters of grapes and ribbons. Lady Kathleen Grade goes in for cream and gold with a cloth-of-gold undercloth topped by another of rich cream woven with golden roses. Viscount Linley's Breakfast for Two (a dashing black stocking for his Christmas guest) is in the new Basic Goode's department and is much more contemporary in mood - he uses a breakfast table in sycamore, inlaid with macassar ebony and vavona burr. Hugh Johnson takes a gardening theme and uses a painted watering-can as a centre-piece and twisted twigs as decoration. Jane Churchill, 135 Sloane Street, London SW1 and 3 Christopher Place, St Albans, Herts. has expanded its range of accessories on the home-front and for Christmas has masses of small decorative ideas. There are miniature chocolate Christmas puddings (Pounds 3.95 for eight), plain creamy candles, tartan-wrapped if you want to give them as a present, tartan terracotta flower pots and gold-embellished decorations for tree, table and room, all at accessible prices. Greenwood &amp; Lacey, Richmond Bridge House, 417-421 Richmond Road, Twickenham TW1 2EX (telephone 081-741-1377) is a source of stylish decorations - not cheap but they are original and most will last for years. A poinsettia topiary tree in a tartan pot, some 14 in high, is Pounds 44; a Mediterranean Olive Wreath, made from dried globe thistles, hydrangeas, love-in-the-mist, paper roses, fabric hydrangeas and zinnias is soft, enchantingly pretty and costs Pounds 49. There is a splendid collection of rose hips, seed heads, cinnamon sticks, berries, hazelnuts, eucalyptus leaves and tiny terracotta pots centred round a candle, for Pounds 45. A 24 in long Christmas Swag of preserved foliage, artificial plums, gilded walnuts, mushrooms and lots of red, red roses, is Pounds 58.</p>

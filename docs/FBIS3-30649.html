			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- Two bills concerning  nuclear energy were approved by the cabinet at its regular  meeting today. One bill will ratify the 1963 Vienna Convention  on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 1988 Joint  Protocol on Civil Law Liability and Compensation for  Cross-Boundary Damage From Nuclear Accident, which established a  link between the 1960 Paris Convention on Third Party Liability  in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the Vienna Convention. The  other bill will amend the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Act.    Bulgaria's accession to the Vienna Convention and the Joint  Protocol will help assert this country's position in the  international system of civil liability for nuclear damage,  according to Mr. Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Committee for  Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, who sponsored the bills. So far  Bulgaria has not been involved in this system which at some  times has hampered normal trade relations with other countries,  Mr. Yanev observed. Provision of technical and financial  assistance to enhance the nuclear safety of the Kozloduy nuclear  power plant, in his view, is also contingent on accession to the  convention.    The proposed amendments to the Peaceful Uses of Atomic  Energy  Act will limit the state monopoly to the extraction, processing,  production and trade in nuclear material and operation of  nuclear facilities. Other sources of ionizing radiation will be  subject to licensing requirements. This means that upon payment  of definite fees, both natural and juristic persons could use  sources of ionizing radiation in hospitals, industrial and  research laboratories and facilities. Liability for possible  damage from nuclear accident will rest with the operators of the  nuclear installations. Stiffer fines will be imposed for  breaking nuclear and radiological safety rules. Besides this,  the proposed changes will help penalize companies which do no  meet nuclear safety requirements.</p>

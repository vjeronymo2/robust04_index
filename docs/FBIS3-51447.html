			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Next year our country will launch a new health care  system aimed at rapidly expanding coverage so that by the year  2000, nearly 90 percent of the population will be totally  covered.  <H5>  Private Coverage </H5>   The bill passed by Congress sets up units known as Health  Promotion Agencies (EPS) that will be responsible for collecting  contributions from workers and business owners (12 percent of  the total monthly payroll) and for contracting for health care  services to be paid for out of these resources.  <H5>  Higher Dues </H5>   The new plan means a 71-percent increase in the contribution  for health care. To date, employers and workers have paid in 7  percent. According to estimates of the National Association of  Industrialists (ANDI), additional contributions paid into the  Social Security Institute by members will total 233.5 billion  pesos, 156.5 billion from employers, and 77 billion from workers.    An employee earning 100,000 pesos next year (roughly the  minimum wage) will pay 3,960 pesos of that sum for health  insurance for himself and his family. Under the current system,  he would pay only 2,310 pesos.    The employer's contribution rises from 4,666 to 8,040 pesos,  with the additional resources used to provide the entire family  of the insured with basic health care, including common  illnesses and maternity coverage.  <H5>  Two Systems </H5>   The reform creates two major systems: the contributory  system  and the subsidized system. The former will cover persons with  contracts, government employees, pensioners, and independent  workers able to pay. The subsidized system will include persons  unable to pay who will receive economic assistance to make their  contribution to the system. Such assistance will come from a  Solidarity Fund.    Members will have freedom of choice. They will be able to  select the EPS they prefer or transfer to one providing better  services.  <H5>  Subsidy </H5>   What will be the source of the subsidy? Health Promotion  Agencies will collect contributions from employers and workers.  These funds will be used to pay for the basic health plan and  administrative overhead. However, in some cases, there will be a  surplus that must be transferred to the Solidarity Fund.  Subsidies will be financed out of these resources and other  funds transferred from the Central Government or municipalities.    How will the surplus be generated? First of all, the  National  Social Security Council for Health Care will determine how much  the health care of every member costs. For example, if it  estimates the cost to be 200,000 pesos a year, the EPS may  retain only that amount for every member covered. However, in  many cases, the agency may have a large number of persons  earning high incomes, meaning that 12 percent of their salaries  would amount to far more than the cost of the health care. In  such cases, the surplus will be paid into the fund, effectively  creating solidarity between the rich and the poor.  <H5>  No Cuts </H5>   How does the plan work? The law states that the basic health  plan to be provided by the EPS will be the same as the one now  offered by the Social Security Institute. In other words, it  will include a package of services covering common illnesses and  maternity at all levels. It will also cover any and all  diagnostic services, medical treatment, surgery, and  rehabilitation deemed necessary.  <H5>  No "Preexisting Conditions" </H5>   There will be no such thing as "preexisting conditions" in  the system. This means that members will receive care even if it  can be demonstrated that a specific disease was contracted  before coverage as a member began.    For the first time, the pension reform will allow the  participation of private pension funds, which will begin to  compete for the contributions of Colombian workers.  <H5>  Gradual Readjustment </H5>   Payments into either of the two systems will gradually rise  from 8 to 13.5 percent based on the following schedule: 11.5  percent in 1994; 12.5 percent in 1995; and 13.5 percent in 1996.    Of that amount, 3.5 percent will go to pay for disability  and  survivor benefits and the administrative overhead of the system,  whether it be the ISS or a private fund.    In the latter case, however, the government has decided that  in order to promote competition, to the extent that the funds  are more efficient, they may voluntarily transfer part of the  3.5 percent into their members' savings accounts.    Under both systems, employers will pay 75 percent of the  dues  and workers the remaining 25 percent.  <H5>  Solidarity Fund </H5>   In order to expand coverage and enable persons with low  incomes to secure a retirement pension, a Pension Solidarity  Fund is being set up that will also benefit athletes, artists,  bullfighters, women operating small businesses, "community  mothers," and the physically challenged.    During its first year of operation, the Fund hopes to obtain  over 40 billion pesos from an additional 1-percent contribution  paid by employees earning over four minimum monthly wages.  <H5>  Retirement Age </H5>   In order to be entitled to an old-age pension, a worker must  be over 55 in the case of women or 60 in the case of men and  have paid into the system for a minimum of 1,000 weeks (whether  continuously or with interruptions), i.e., 20 years.    Effective 1 January 2014, the age at which one becomes  eligible for the retirement pension rises by two years: to 57  for women and 62 for men.    Those covered by the private system are entitled to a  retirement pension at whatever age they choose, provided the  total amount of funds that have accumulated in the individual  account allows them to have a monthly pension exceeding 110  percent of the legal minimum monthly wage at the time.  <H5>  Amount of Pension </H5>   The amount of the old-age pension based on the first 1,000  weeks of contributions will be equivalent to 65 percent of the  base distribution income.    However, for every additional 50 weeks and up to a total of  1,200, the percentage rises by 2 percent to a maximum of 73  percent. From 1,200 to 1,400 weeks, the percentage will rise by  3 percent up to a maximum sum of 85 percent of the base  distribution income. In the case of private pension funds, the  terms are different because the amount will depend on individual  savings and their financial yield.  <H5>  How Amount Is Calculated </H5>   In order to calculate the base distribution income, the last  10 years or the entire time worked will be taken into account,  depending on which alternative is more beneficial to the retiree.  <H5>  Exclusions </H5>    The following will be excluded from the system of individual  savings: those receiving disability pensions or persons who,  when the system takes effect, are over 40 years of age in the  case of men and 35 in the case of women, and those who have paid  into the ISS for over 750 weeks.  <H5>  Transfers </H5>   Persons deciding to transfer from the ISS to private funds  will receive a pension bonus. The bonus will recognize  contributions made since the worker joined, with allowance being  made for inflation and the yield such contributions would have  paid.

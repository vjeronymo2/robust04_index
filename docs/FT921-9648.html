Landed coloury assams met improved competition and often gained 5 to 10p but plainer sorts continued weak. Brighter East Africans ruled fully firm to dearer with dusts strong while mediums saw much better enquiry and put on 3 to 5p except the plainest. Good liquoring ceylons often advanced with the remainder little changed. Offshore demand was selective . Brighter East Africans types sold at firm rates but Central Africans were generally easier by 2 to 3p. Quotations: quality 140p, nom good medium 108p, medium 89p, low medium 77p.</p>

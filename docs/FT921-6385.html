			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (7): Investments that carry a guarantee - Fixed-rate savings HAVE YOU had your fill of variable investments? Are you fed up with leaving the level of return to the vagaries of market force and government whim? Do not despair. There are a variety of financial instruments to which you can turn for a guaranteed return. The thorny problem is to know the best time to lock in. When the government took sterling into the European exchange rate mechanism in 1990, the idea was that the ERM's discipline would help both interest rates and inflation to fall over the longer term. Both have indeed been falling, but sterling's weakness within the mechanism means that there is more than a chance that interest rates will go up again. The range of instruments to consider are: National Savings: NS products that offer fixed interest are: savings certificates, the Yearly Plan and Capital Bonds. The 36th issue of savings certificates, for example, pays 8.5 per cent if held for five years. Each unit costs Pounds 25. There is no income or capital gains tax to pay (see N for National Savings). Gilts: Conventional British government stocks provide a fixed rate of interest over a specified period, paid at half-yearly intervals. There are several issues, paying different interest rates with different redemption dates. The government repays them at their face value on maturity. When you buy them, you are certain of their return, provided you are able to hold them till redemption. This return, called the gross redemption yield, varied between 9.5 and 10 per cent in late January. If you think base rates will fall and the price of gilts will go up, then you could buy gilts in the hope of making a short-term capital gain. There is no capital gains tax on gilts, though you pay income tax on the interest (see G for Gilts). Guaranteed income bonds: By investing your money with an insurance company for a fixed period of time, you are paid a fixed interest rate during that period. The company guarantees to repay you the capital when the bond matures. Payment of income is usually made annually, though some insurers will pay on a monthly basis. The returns are paid net of basic rate income tax, which cannot be reclaimed. This means they are unlikely to be suitable for non-taxpayers. Higher-rate taxpayers will face a further charge when the bonds are cashed in: this should be slightly less than they would have paid had they held the money in a conventional building society account. Some security is provided by the fact that these bonds are covered by the Policyholders Protection scheme, which will repay 90 per cent of the amount invested. Annuities: You pay an insurance company a lump sum in exchange for a fixed amount of money which is paid to you at regular intervals. The annuity will pay you a high return, sometimes over a specified period (a temporary annuity) or, more usually, until death. A large part of the return is, therefore, the repayment of your capital. This has some tax advantages, but when you die your estate will have lost the value of the initial annuity investment. The nature of annuities means that the insurance company does badly out of those who live a long time. As a consequence, the older you are when you buy an annuity, the higher the income an insurance company is prepared to pay. In general, these are not good investments for people under 70. Rates on annuities vary, so it is important to look around the insurance companies for the best deals (See A for Annuities). Debentures and Convertibles: This is a riskier way of fixing your income than the suggestions mentioned above. Debentures are issued by companies that want to raise money, and are secured on an asset (usually property). They operate in a similar way to gilts, in that they pay a fixed rate of interest and are repaid at the end of a specified term. Convertible bonds can be exchanged into shares of a company at a future date. This potential for profit means that the bonds tend to carry a lower interest rate than conventional bonds, and the price is more volatile. There are accordingly two risks. If the share price of the company never reaches a level that makes conversion worthwhile, you would almost certainly have been better off investing in gilts. And if the company goes bankrupt, you are likely to lose your investment completely. This is an area where it is important to get good advice. Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs): These are shares issued by building societies as a way of raising capital. After approval from the Building Societies Commission, the first Pibs were issued by the Leeds Permanent in June last year. The shares are undated, so they can never be cashed. They are quoted on the stock exchange and can be bought and sold like other stock. The first issues of Pibs were aimed at the institutional market, but Bristol &amp; West and Britannia have issued Pibs in denominations of Pounds 1,000. The coupon on Bristol and West is 13 3/8 per cent, and on Britannia 13 per cent. In early February, the current yield on Bristol &amp; West was 12.74 per cent and for Britannia 12.65 per cent, paid net of basic-rate tax twice yearly. These rates are higher than for gilts, reflecting the increased risk of buying shares backed by a building society rather than the government. The interest can be waived or reduced if payment would lead the society to have insufficient capital under the new capital adequacy rules. Pibs are deeply subordinated, which means that in the event of a wind-up, you would be behind depositors in the queue for compensation. But if you believe that the building society will not go under and that interest rates will fall over the next decade, these can be considered as a long-term investment in a diversified portfolio.</p>

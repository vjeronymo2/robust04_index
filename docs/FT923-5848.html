			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Patten moves on school surplus LOCAL education authorities in England have been given three months to produce detailed plans for reducing surplus school places. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said yesterday that he aims to take statutory powers to impose plans if authorities do not produce satisfactory proposals to eliminate the estimated 1.5m surplus places. He also intends to take powers to close grant-maintained schools which have an unacceptable number of surplus places. This raises for the first time the prospect of the forced closure of schools that have opted out of local education authority control. Since opting-out has proved attractive to schools threatened with closure by their local authority, the consequences could be far-reaching for the government's policy of encouraging all schools to seek grant-maintained status. Mr Patten made an exception for 'scattered communities and small schools, particularly those in rural areas, which face special problems'. Such schools are mainly in rural Tory constituencies, and backbench Tory MPs will be resistant to plans to close their village schools wholesale.</p>

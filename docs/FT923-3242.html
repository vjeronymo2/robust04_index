			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Traders on tenterhooks after devaluation of lira THE gilt market will be on tenterhooks today as all eyes focus on the Bundesbank and the size of the cut in interest rates it has indicated it will make after last night's devaluation of the Italian lira. From the point of view of sterling, the developments are both good and bad news. A cut in German borrowing rates - the size and nature of which are due to be announced today - should take the pressure off the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism grid. On the other hand, a lira devaluation - the first significant adjustment of the ERM since 1987 - might appear in the eyes of some market participants to presage other changes in parities in the grid affecting other weak currencies, the pound included. The markets also have to digest the outcome of next Sunday's referendum on Maastricht. If France votes No to European economic and monetary union, that could lead to further selling pressure on weak ERM currencies, exacerbating the recent strains on currency markets and possibly leading ultimately to a sterling devaluation. The general nervousness about the pound was a feature of gilt trading last week. It forced a large rise in yields for short-dated bonds, amid fears that the British government might be forced, in the near future, to increase interest rates to defend the pound's ERM parity. With the UK government stressing strongly last week it would not devalue the pound, a rise in base rates, now 10 per cent, might be required to prevent sterling falling through its ERM floor. That explained why the yield on the short-dated 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond due in 1997 rose  1/3 of a percentage point last week, closing on Friday night at 9.71 per cent. Its price fell by 1 point to 96 7/32 . While short yields were pushed up, few large sellers of the securities were reported. An exception, however, was the Bank of Sweden, which was said to be selling gilts for cash to put its foreign-currency reserves in a more liquid state in case large-scale intervention is required to defend the beleaguered krona. At the long end of the yield curve, investors such as pension funds and insurance companies were moderate buyers of gilts on optimistic perceptions about the longer term inflation profile. As a result, long-gilt yields were depressed marginally. The degree to which pressure on rising prices is becoming subdued as a result of the long recession was underlined by last week's figures for the retail prices index. The RPI rose by 3.6 per cent in the year to August, after 3.7 per cent in the 12 months to July. However, it was the shorter term outlook for the pound that worried most gilt investors last week. Sterling closed on Friday against the D-Mark at DM2.79, slightly more than 1 pfennig above its DM2.778 ERM floor. This was even though a stronger dollar somewhat eased the overall ERM strains by putting less upward pressure on the German currency. A weak pound depresses sentiment about gilts. A special problem for the pound is the stalled domestic economy. With some commentators suggesting a recovery is unlikely until 1993 or 1994, investors are unlikely to want to push funds into sterling on the basis of hopes about a growing economy. At the same time, the UK's economic weakness greatly magnifies the potential effects of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, being forced to raise base rates to defend sterling's ERM parity. 'In normal times, the bad news about the economy, and the sense that inflation is coming down, would be expected to be good news for gilts,' said Mr James Barty, an economist at Morgan Grenfell. 'The trouble for gilts is that these are not normal times.'</p>

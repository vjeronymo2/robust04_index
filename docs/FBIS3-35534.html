			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus] </F>   [Text] Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has stated  that the massacre settlers committed today in Hebron's Ibrahimi  Mosque is one of the fruits of the so-called peace. He told  Radio Monte Carlo that a crime of such a nature cannot take  place without the knowledge of the Israeli Army and the Israeli  security organs which directly encourage the settlers and cover  up their fascist actions against the Palestinians.    Abu-'Ali Mustafa said this massacre is further proof that  the  Gaza-Jericho agreement legalizes settlement, protects the  settlers, and perpetuates the occupation. He said the PLO  leadership's official stand, which overlooks the issue of ending  settlement, is responsible for the settlers' crimes against the  Palestinian people.    The PFLP assistant secretary general called on the United  Nations and the human rights bodies to act immediately to  protect the Palestinian people under occupation.    Meanwhile, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, director of the Hamas  office  in Damascus, has said this massacre is a message -- signed in  blood -- and one which confirms that peace with those terrorists  is an illusion. He stressed that the terrorists, with the help  of the Israeli soldiers who claim to protect the Ibrahimi  Mosque, who attack in their mosques those who fast, have given a  slap in the face to the defeatists in Tunis who daily negotiate  and offer concessions.    The director of the Hamas office in Damascus emphasized that  this crime will not go unpunished, and that the 'Izz al-Din  al-Qassam Battalions will avenge this massacre as they avenged  al-Aqsah massacre.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps British Thornton A strong contribution from Masterpack, acquired last October, helped British Thornton report pre-tax profits of Pounds 947,165 in the year to April 30 on sharply higher sales of Pounds 4.67m. This contrasted with losses of Pounds 1.04m on sales of Pounds 730,000. The manufacturer of educational and scientific furniture joined the market last October. Directors said the company was involved in implementing an internal reconstruction aimed at a more efficient tax and commercial structure which would enable it to pay a special interim dividend, its first since 1985. Earnings per share were 1.04p (losses of 14.14p).</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: Poor Super Man throbs with power - Theatre Brad Fraser is the Canadian playwright whose award-winning Unidentified Human Remains And The True Nature Of Love made such an impact in Edinburgh and London last year, and coincidentally reaches the cinema screen this week. The Ugly Man, brought to last summer's Edinburgh Festival by a Canadian company, was a huge disappointment - a dose of Tennessee Williams baroque turgidly combined with Cold Comfort Farm. Now the same city's Traverse Theatre, where Fraser had his first UK success, presents Poor Super Man - A Play with Captions. The writer is back on the territory he knows best: the isolation of the city-dweller, the disorientation of the emotionally lonely, the sexual odyssey of the unattached, eternally seeking the ideal relationship. In Human Remains the shadow of a serial killer darkened the lyricism, comedy and pathos in this study of a small group of friends. In the new play the killer is identified from the outset: the HIV virus. Shannon is denied a sex-change operation by his worsening medical condition. His eventual suicide focuses and sharpens the self-analytic gropings of the play's four other characters. Chief among these is his flatmate David, an established painter, who (like the hero of Human Remains) takes a job as a waiter to dispel terminal jadedness - professional and personal. He falls in love with Matt, the married owner of the cafe; a development that echoes the central relationship of Remains. David (as in the earlier play, a questing seeker of love, assailed by self-disgust) has a loyal if possessive woman friend, the rueful, wisecracking journalist, Kryla; another throwback to Remains. If much of this seems like a rerun of Fraser's most successful material, there is no denying he does it extremely well. The reality of urban life nags like a throbbing tooth throughout. The characters live on a knife-edge between self-mocking buoyancy and suicidal despair. And the use of projections, the 'captions' of the title, reveal the floundering beneath the brittleness; the urgency under the badinage. Thus when David tells his new employers in the cafe that he is gay and they hastily confirm that this is 'not a big deal', the word 'queer' appears. 'Do you dislike me?' asks the cloying Kryla to her dismissive friend; his denial is countered by a projected 'maybe'. The titles are used naturally to note time and place, to encapsulate a scene ('lie','revelation') and sometimes as a descant to the spoken dialogue ('me me me'). Even more than Remains the play's central thread is the stuff of homosexual wish-fulfilment fantasy: the gay who makes straight men fall exclusively for him: 'There's something about you, things you say, the way you look at me,' says the capitulating heterosexual. In Ian Brown's direction of the European premiere such passages escape the trap of novelettishness thanks to the production's rhythm and pace - but without the external threat of a killer as in Fraser's previous success, the tension is finally diffused by the short, cinematic takes of the play's construction. The piece is uniformly well-acted though Ian Gelder's David is rather unfocused, uncertain how much his actions are rudderless bewilderment, how much simply the result of selfishness. Christopher Simon's Matt is a fine study of puzzled sexual self-discovery, Elaine Collins is a lovely wry Kryla, and Kathryn Howden makes more of Matt's hurt, loving wife than one suspects the part is worth. As Shannon, dying without achieving his ambition to become a woman, Jude Akuwudike goes through the play in dress and wig looking like one of the Supremes, in a beautifully judged blend of delicately camp self-parody and increasing anger. The production returns for the festival, then transfers to Hampstead. Fraser's fans will recognise the expertise of his variations on favourite themes, but may well begin to wonder what else he can do. Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh.</p>

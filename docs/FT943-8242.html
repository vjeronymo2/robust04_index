			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Why an A-level is not the B-all: Why UK employers will not cheer today's exam results as much as the students Eighteen-year-old school-leavers in England and Wales, who receive their A-level results this morning, will be able to congratulate themselves on achieving better grades than any previous year. By contrast, many employers now regard England's uniquely specialised A-level system, and post-16 schooling in general, as having failed. A broad coalition now favours radical reform of A-levels. It includes not only employers' organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry, but also teachers' professional organisations, leading independent schools, scientific bodies such as the Royal Society, and universities. The Labour party is also campaigning for reform, calling last month for the abolition of A-levels. The opposition party, it seems, is now more in tune with some of the government's most natural supporters, increasing the pressure on new education secretary Mrs Gillian Shephard to deliver at least some reforms. Mr John Patten, sacked as education secretary last month, was a fierce opponent of A-level reform, saying it would involve abandoning a well-established and respected educational 'gold standard'. As yet, there is no sign that the official line has changed: Mr Eric Forth, the new schools minister, has echoed Mr Patten's sentiments, describing A-levels as 'a world-renowned trademark of Britain's educational excellence'. In international terms, however, the A-level system, where students normally sit exams in just three subjects, is an oddity. Candidates for the French baccalaureat typically take seven subjects. Similarly, the US high-school diploma requires students to study English, mathematics, a science and a foreign language - usually as part of a seven-subject curriculum. UK employers are increasingly worried that the early specialisation required for A-levels - and their emphasis on academic, not vocational, ability - harms the country's competitiveness in two ways. First, employers argue that A-levels deter sixth-formers from going on to study science or engineering at degree level. Such degrees require an understanding, to A-level standard, of the main principles of mathematics and usually at least two science subjects. Candidates who 'mix' science A-levels with arts subjects may show intellectual breadth, but they do not have enough grounding in pure sciences to embark on a science degree. Research by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University's school of education shows that the proportion of A-level candidates mixing arts and sciences is growing, suggesting pent-up demand for a broader sixth-form curriculum. Prof Smithers's figures show 40 per cent fewer candidates taking maths and science subjects last year than there were in 1983. The Joint Mathematical Council, which represents academics and promotes maths as a subject, says this means a 40 per cent drop in the numbers qualified to study science or engineering at university. Employers' second reason for disliking A-levels is that they believe the exams have inhibited the growth of vocational qualifications. Over the past two years, the government has sought to encourage 16-18-year-olds to take the new general national vocational qualification (GNVQ). But Mr Roger Opie, education officer of the Industrial Society, an employers association which promotes good employment practice, says the A-level 'gold standard' deters students and employers from taking the new qualification seriously. 'Despite GNVQs, there are still schools persuading people to do A-levels who should not be doing them, and there's still a lot of parental pressure to do A-levels.' He points out that, even this year, almost 20 per cent of A-level students will fail. Students who fail to get the grades required by universities will have wasted two years. Their time, as far as employers are concerned, would have been far better spent in vocational education, Mr Opie says. While it is easy to find fault with the current system, it is harder to find agreement on how to replace it. Proponents of reform fall into two broad camps. The more radical proposes scrapping A-levels and replacing them with a system similar to a continental baccalaureat. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, wants to create a new General Certificate of Further Education (GCFE), which would remove the current division between academic and vocational qualifications by incorporating them within one framework. Students would work towards their GCFE by accumulating academic or vocational 'modules'. Both would be treated equally when modules were graded. Some subjects - almost certainly English and mathematics - could be compulsory. Similar proposals have been backed by academic science groups. Even some employers organisations have welcomed Labour's contribution to the debate. Mr Opie, of the Industrial Society, says: 'There's a lot in the Labour party document which pleases us. While there are separate structures for academic and vocational courses, there's always going to be this feeling that students should do A-levels at all costs.' The second camp of reformers is more gradualist. It proposes keeping the main features of A-levels - their academic content and emphasis on exams - but reforming their content, so that it would be feasible for pupils to take five subjects as the norm. This was the main recommendation of the Higginson committee, set up to examine reform of sixth-form education by the then education secretary, Mr Kenneth Baker, in 1987. Mr Baker rejected the report when it was published a year later, but the Higginson proposals are still the favourite option of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals, which represents UK universities, and by the main head teachers' organisations. Prof Smithers says A-levels could be made 'leaner and fitter', without lowering their standards, by trimming about 20 per cent from syllabuses - for example, cutting the number of books required for English literature A-level. He also believes that students could take more subjects if they spent more of their time at school in lessons, rather than in private study - at present most sixth-formers are unsupervised for roughly a third of each school week. Prof Smithers suggests such reforms would preserve the best features of A-levels: 'What makes them the gold standard is the examining process. They would still have questions set by teachers, reflecting what they think people need to know, and then be conducted by an independent examining board.' A slimmed-down A-level system would also allow students to mix academic and vocational qualifications. For example, students could take A-levels in maths and physics, plus English to ensure adequate communication skills, and also a GNVQ. Crucially, students could take a mixed curriculum while studying all the basic science needed to keep a science degree as an option. Mrs Shephard has yet to indicate whether she might be prepared to contemplate streamlining A-levels in this way. On a party political level, such a move would help counter the progress Labour has made in winning the support of employers for its education policy. At the same time, going down this route would be less risky than introducing a new French-style baccalaureat. Mrs Shephard already faces a considerable task in restoring morale in a teaching profession embittered by years of argument over the introduction of a national curriculum and testing for under 16s. The snag for the government is that it would have to reverse its past opposition to the Higginson report. But by reforming the A-level system, rather than overseeing its abolition, ministers would be able to go some way towards addressing the concerns of employers - and argue that England and Wales had not left the education gold standard.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Sainsbury takes store wars into a new phase: Why Wm Low has attracted the giants Mr David Sainsbury yesterday ushered in a new era at the UK's largest food retailer with his 305p-a-share rival bid to Tesco's agreed 225p offer for Wm Low. Chairman since the start of last year, he did what none of his predecessors had done: launched a hostile bid. It is true that because Wm Low's board had already endorsed another offer, Sainsbury's bid is not strictly 'hostile', but the company is at least entering a contest. The Columbia Business School-educated chairman also took competition between the biggest food retailers into a new phase, as the struggles over new sites in the early 1990s and recent price skirmishing gave way to a battle for control of a smaller player. He may have been motivated partly by pique that Wm Low had agreed Tesco's offer without speaking to Sainsbury - especially since it approached the Scottish company last year only to be told Low was determined to remain independent. Sainsbury certainly did not want to see Tesco walk off with it at a bargain price. But Sainsbury's bid of 305p per ordinary share and 143p per convertible preference share - valuing the company at Pounds 210m compared with Tesco's Pounds 154m - is seen as evidence that Sainsbury genuinely wants Wm Low. 'The 305p price is higher than expected, and clearly designed to make Tesco think long and hard about whether to respond,' said Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Yamaichi. The main attraction of Wm Low to Sainsbury, as to Tesco, is the chance to buy market share quickly and relatively cheaply in Scotland - one of the last areas of the UK not overrun by grocery superstores. Sainsbury says the acquisition would increase its Scottish market share from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, and its UK share from 11.4 to 12 per cent. Sainsbury has only four stores in Scotland. Its ambitions there have been hampered by intense competition for sites and struggles with local authorities over planning permission. Although many Wm Low supermarkets are small, the acquisition would give Sainsbury 57 stores for the cost of building and opening 12 superstores. Sainsbury says it has no plans to sell any of the stores, but admits rivals have expressed interest and 'recognises that some of Wm Low's smaller stores may be of greater interest to other operators'. It believes it can make Wm Low's assets work harder and is proposing Pounds 40m investment in the stores - Pounds 5m more than Tesco. Overheads would be cut by closing Wm Low's head office, and economies of scale exploited by bringing the stores into Sainsbury's supply and distribution network. It would refurbish the stores, reduce prices and widen the range by selling its own-label products. Some superstores would be extended and petrol stations added. Sainsbury believes it can raise the Scottish stores' performance towards that of the rest of its chain, and says it is best placed to unlock their potential as its performance ratios lead the industry. Sainsbury's weekly sales per square foot of Pounds 18.70 are twice those of Wm Low's Pounds 9.60, and well above Tesco's Pounds 15.20. Annual profits per square foot, at Pounds 85.50, are three times Wm Low's Pounds 27.60, and 45 per cent above Tesco's Pounds 59. Analysts believe Sainsbury could achieve a 50 per cent increase in Wm Low's operating profits to about Pounds 27m in the medium term. The acquisition would also give Sainsbury a much-needed Scottish distribution depot. Its Scottish stores are presently supplied by trucks from north-east England and Lancashire. Some analysts had suggested Sainsbury might not bid for Wm Low but save its money for a bigger acquisition in the US. However, with a successful takeover of Wm Low projected to increase year-end gearing from 20 per cent to only 27 per cent, it is clear Sainsbury still has scope for acquisitions elsewhere. Mr Sainsbury repeated yesterday that the group would investigate any opportunities to add to its Shaws chain in the US, but this was a 'statement of strategy, not an indication we are about to pounce on something'. However, whether Sainsbury or Tesco eventually triumphs in the battle for Wm Low, some suggest it could open the door to other bids for UK food retailers. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, analyst at Lehman Brothers, believes the most significant comment came from Tesco, which said the acquisition of Wm Low would enable it to expand its market share 'without increasing total industry floorspace'. If the biggest players start to believe the market is saturated and expansion should not add to industry capacity, smaller companies such as Iceland, Gateway, the co-operative societies, or even Wm Morrison could become targets.

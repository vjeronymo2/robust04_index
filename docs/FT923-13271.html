			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency factors depress share prices CONCERN OVER the implic-ations for sterling of developments in European currencies, deepening ahead of Thursday's meeting at the Bundesbank, kept the UK stock market depressed yesterday. Trading volume was poor and the market ended the first day of the new two-week trading account with a loss of a further 12.5 points on the FT-SE Index. Determined rejection by both Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, of calls from some political sources for sterling devaluation combined with fears in the City of London that the Bundesbank might tighten monetary policy this week. Lingering hopes for an early cut in UK interest rates have been replaced by fears that they could be forced up. Equities opened lower and a brief attempt to rally was soon extinguished. With the September futures contract on the Footsie below 2,500 for most of the day, the stock market remained resolutely on the downside, showing a fall of 17.1 at the day's low. Share prices recovered a little in late trading when Wall Street opened the new session with a gain of 8 Dow points in London trading hours. At the close, the FT-SE was down 12.5 at 2,478.3. Selling pressure remained light, as reflected by Seaq volume of 349.4m shares, well below levels acceptable to the London securities industry. Friday's Seaq total of 519.5m reflected customer, or retail, business in equities worth only Pounds 982.8m, according to Stock Exchange statistics. This value total is at the low end of the range of market profitability. Weakness in the dollar gnawed away at recent share gains in such transatlantic favourites as Glaxo and Rothmans International. ICI turned lower again as the market continued to shy away from the possibility that a large US investment bank might seek to place a 10m-share stake in the UK chemical company. However, Wellcome edged higher ahead of the share placing operation. UK stock market strategists have remained noticeably wary, and have generally taken a relatively cautious view of the near-term outlook. At Goldman Sachs, Sushil Wadhwani sets a 12-month target for the Footsie index of 2,900 - 'provided that the economy is seen to recover, albeit at a sluggish rate' - but, if the UK economy fails to recover, or valuation norms change, then 'equities might weaken to 2,000 in 12 months'. Nomura Research Institute, commenting on the UK recession, says 'it is not over yet', warning that recent rises in manufacturers' and retailers' stocks might be the result of inflated expectations about demand growth. At Nikko Securities, Peter Thorne also suggests that recent negative sentiment has been caused by unrealistic economic expectations and remains convinced that UK equities are good value against bonds and other international markets. Richard Kersley at Barclays de Zoete Wedd believes that a yield ratio on equities against bonds now at its lowest point since 1974 must be a supportive factor for share prices.</p>

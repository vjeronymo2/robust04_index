			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC,  has published a list of petroleum products marketing companies  with tankers found to be involved in the diversion of products  entrusted to them for delivery to various destinations in the  country. Addressing newsmen in Lagos today, the acting Group  Public Affairs General Manager, Mr. Edem Duke, said  investigations have proved that the products were not delivered  at the approved stations and that the marketing companies could  not officially account for the products.    [Begin Duke recording] That in our efforts to ensure that  petroleum products are readily available for Nigerians,  Nigerians are involved in subverting the efforts of this  corporation in realizing that objective. You are all aware of  the fact that there has been accusation and counteraccusation in  the past. But today we will make bold to provide details to you  that we have here, a list of 500 tankers carrying petrol which  is needed by everyone of us -- tankers that are supposed to  deliver products to all parts of the country. But these tankers  have been diverted by people who cannot take responsibility for  them. It is unfortunate that today, most of the major marketers  have tankers that they employed, or in their employment,  diverted to God knows where. And everybody sits by and passes  the buck.    There is a list here showing Elf Oil, APPLC [expansion  unknown], Unipetrol, Mobil Oil, Agip, Total PLC, National, and  so many independent marketers and this is just the first set of  500 tankers that are missing and we would like Nigerians to call  those who should be asked questions to render and account of  where these tankers are.

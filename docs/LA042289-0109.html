			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEMA MURDER  </P> <P> Re "Heathers," reviewed in Calendar March 31:  </P> <P> This film deals with the problem of teen suicide by advocating murder. It is a  disgrace to think that because the murderess is going to have popcorn with the  fat girl she has somehow made a moralistic turn-around. Who are you kidding?  Not me. Not my family. And not the 40,000 murder victims in the United States  last year.  </P> <P> My son was murdered last October. At some point, 1 in 3 families will  experience such a loss.  </P> <P> As a film writer I understand and applaud everyone involved in this movie for  attempting to expose the obsession teen-agers often have with death. I am,  however, saddened that the producers, directors, actors, crew and most of all  the writer would take on a subject as devastating as murder without portraying  it responsibly.  </P> <P> On behalf of all who've lost a loved one to homicide I plead with the makers of  "Heathers" to re-examine the film and realize that not only does it not work  but it is the most dangerous kind of message that we in our industry can give.  </P> <P> Please don't leave youngsters with the message that murder is all right. Remove  "Heathers" from the theaters. Show society that Hollywood can entertain  responsibly and that it isn't just a bloodthirsty, moneymaking monster.  </P> <P> DENISE de GARMO-RITCHIE  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

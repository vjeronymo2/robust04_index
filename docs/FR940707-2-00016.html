			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. That no member of Congress shall be admitted to any share or part of this grant or any benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to bar, as a contractor under the grant, a publicly held corporation whose ownership might include a member of Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. That all non-confidential information resulting from its activities shall be made available to the general public on an equal basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. That the purpose and scope of work for which this grant is made shall not duplicate programs for which monies have been received, are committed, or are applied to from other sources (public or private).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. That grantee shall relinquish any and all copyrights and/or privileges to the materials developed under this grant as published in whole or in part. The material shall contain a notice and be identified by language to the following effect: ``The material is the result of tax-supported research and as such is not copyrightable. It may be freely reprinted with the customary crediting of the source.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. That the grantee shall abide by the policies promulgated in the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, which provides standards for use by grantee in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies, equipment, and other services with Federal grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Obtain prior approval from grantor for use of grant funds for uses or amounts not consistent with the approved scope of work and budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. That the grantee, except for States, will remit interest earned on grant funds deposited in an interest bearing account in accordance with the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulation 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Grantee will comply with property management standards established by 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016 for personal property. ``Personal property'' means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible_having physical existence_or intangible_having no physical existence; such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. ``Nonexpendable personal property'' means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than 1 year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. ``Expendable personal property'' refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable property. When nonexpendable property is acquired by a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall be vested in the grantee subject to the following conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Right to transfer title. For items of real or nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, RDA may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) RDA shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If RDA fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 18. (b) of this exhibit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) When RDA exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this exhibit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Use of other nonexpendable personal property for which the grantee has title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

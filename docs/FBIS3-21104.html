			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Aerospatiale Strengthens </F> Its Position"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Operating below capacity and with declining sales,  the group strengthens its strategic alliances.    For Aerospatiale, 1993 was a very bad year. The traditional  annual results presentation by its chief executive officer  [CEO], Louis Gallois, perfectly illustrated these difficult  conditions. Sales shrank by 5 percent, to 49.3 billion francs  [Fr], and new orders dropped by 25.6 percent, from Fr39 billion  in 1992 to Fr29 billion last year, with a Fr130-billion backlog  of orders (2.5 years of operation). "The helicopter and aircraft  market was awful; all three manufacturers just broke even, with  practically as many cancellations as new orders," the CEO  commented. In spite of all, Louis Gallois wants his group to  remain on the offensive, and he is starting work along four  lines: to strengthen the group's alliance in its branch; to  reconfigure the group with a view to its privatization; to  prepare for the future by overhauling its product line; and to  negotiate with the labor force. Being an optimist, he predicts  that 1994 will be "a year for conquest and ambition."    Thus, Aerospatiale pursued its strategy of national and  international alliances. In France, it signed an agreement with  SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] concerning the  CELERG company, a specialist of tactical missile motors (see  next page). With DASA [German Aerospace Company], its partner of  30 years, Aerospatiale is planning new partnerships based on the  Eurocopter model; these partnerships will materialize in the  next few months in the fields of missiles, space, and commuter  aircraft. For the latter, Louis Gallois believes that "because  of its dynamism, the ATR [commuter aircraft] economic interest  group should serve as a pole for turboprop aircraft production,  and that the new ATR-82 project might be used as a basic  program." Preliminary talks, therefore, started in all  directions, both in Europe (with Fokker, Dornier, Saab, and  British Aerospace) and in many Asian countries.    Concerning satellites, which represent sales of Fr1.5  billion  and orders of Fr3.2 billion for Aerospatiale, Louis Gallois  believes that the four-partner Alliance formed with Alcatel,  DASA, and Alenia and which holds 49 percent of Space System  Loral, is "somewhat weak." This in spite of the fact that it was  through the Alliance that Aerospatiale's Cannes plant (which  just delivered the photography unit of the Helios military  observation satellite to MATRA [Mechanics, Aviation, and  Traction company]) obtained the contract for the Intelsat-7  satellite integration. He wishes, therefore, to strengthen the  Alliance as soon as possible, and Eurocopter might be used as a  model. "Our ambition is to place each of our operations in the  partnership structure most likely to promote its development,"  Louis Gallois indicated.    In France, this ambition already resulted in the creation of  an Aerospatiale maintenance group. This restructuring is part of  the efforts the group must make with a view to its  privatization. These efforts also involve financial  reorganization, which started in 1992. The resulting improvement  affected the net result which, although still a loss, showed a  "marked improvement" thanks to the austerity measures adopted by  the personnel as a whole. It also affected the debt, which was  stabilized and even decreased by Fr1.5 billion. Finally, the  capital should be increased to Fr3 billion. The objective is now  to restore equilibrium as soon as possible, by 1995 at the  latest.</p>

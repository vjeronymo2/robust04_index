			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Falling gold price leaves Cluff lower CLUFF RESOURCES, the UK mining company with operations in Zimbabwe, blamed low gold prices for a 6 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.35m. Earnings per share fell to 1.65p (2.43p) but the board is proposing a same-again 1p dividend. The results were also affected by Zimbabwe's temporary restriction on foreign currency in the first half because of the Gulf war. That delayed the purchase of essential equipment for the Freda Rebecca mine and as a consequence, total gold output in Zimbabwe fell from 74,675 troy ounces to 67,733 ounces - including 4,638 ounces (6,509 ounces) from the Royal Family mine. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said Freda Rebecca produced at record levels in December. Improved operation efficiencies helped reduce the average cost per ounce produced last year from Dollars 234 to Dollars 228. Mr Cluff said the company was in the lower half of world gold production costs and, if the potential Ayanfuri mine in Ghana went into production - probably in mid-1993 - 'we should be in the lowest quartile.' Gold reserves and resources at Freda Rebecca had been raised during the year by 13 per cent from those at the end of 1990 to 1.18m ounces, he reported. Analysts described the results as creditable in the circumstances.</p>

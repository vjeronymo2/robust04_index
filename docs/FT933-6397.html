			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Continental earnings slide as price pressures bite CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturing company, saw earnings slide for the first six months of the current year. Net profits sunk to DM31.3m (Dollars 18.5m) compared with DM118.7m in the first half of last year, on turnover down nearly 8 per cent to DM4.52bn. The Hanover-based group said the profits outcome was worse than anticipated, attributing the result to strong pressure on prices in the 'heavily declining' European vehicle industry as well as problems in other recession-stricken sectors such as machine construction, mining and military engineering. The crisis in the German vehicle market - down 25 per cent in production terms from its 1992 peak - has led to overcapacity in the tyre market, unleashing what Continental called 'fierce price wars'. Continental said it had also lost sales volumes to manufacturers in the UK, Spain and Italy, countries whose currencies have depreciated against the D-Mark over the past year. Continental said it was not expecting business conditions to be any worse in the second half of the year than in the first, although a revival in the German economy was not to be expected before next year. It saw no reason to change the forecast that the group would be in the black for the year as a whole. Last year, the group made profits of DM133m after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991. The group said that it would step up the cost-cutting measures in order to combat a 'far-reaching crisis' in its core markets. The number of employees in the group has been cut by 5,000 over the past three years, a process which is set to continue in the second half. It has also taken further rationalisation measures, for example reducing the complexity of production plants, improving the efficiency of logistics and distribution systems and relocating manufacturing facilities to less expensive production sites. Continental predicted that sales for the full year would be slightly less than the DM9.6bn achieved in 1992. It said that the number of employees at the end of June was 51,448, about 1 per cent higher than a year before. But for the effect of acquisitions, employee numbers would however have been down by 3,500 or 7 per cent.</p>

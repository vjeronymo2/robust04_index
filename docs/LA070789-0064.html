			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX HOUSE KILLS LAKE VIEW TERRACE DRUG CENTER PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Plans for a controversial drug treatment center in Lake View Terrace officially  died Thursday when Phoenix House, the company behind the proposal, withdrew its  application for a conditional use permit.  </P> <P> The news was greeted warmly by opponents in the East Valley community. They had  rejoiced when Nancy Reagan bowed out of the project on May 26, then despaired  when Phoenix House asked the Los Angeles City Board of Zoning Appeals for a  three-month extension on its permit hearing.  </P> <P> An attorney representing Phoenix House at a June 20 hearing on the extension  request had said there was still a remote chance the project would go forward.  But Phoenix House officials said Thursday they only wanted more time to assess  their finances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $5.3 Million Raised  </P> <P> Since the project was first made public more than a year ago, about $5.3  million in money and pledges has been raised at various gala events attended by  Nancy Reagan.  </P> <P> Christopher Policano, Phoenix House spokesman, said the company has determined  that those donations were not tied to the Lake View Terrace site, which means  the money can be used elsewhere. Policano said the company is searching for  other possible center locations in Los Angeles County that would meet with Mrs.  Reagan's approval.  </P> <P> "We're very disappointed about this, but it's the end of a chapter," he said.  </P> <P> Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said he  knew the project was dead when Mrs. Reagan withdrew her support, saying she did  not want to upset the community. Snow and other neighbors of the former  hospital site had protested that the center would attract more drugs and crime  to their streets and lower their property values.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ready to Help' Other Neighborhoods  </P> <P> "I'm happy," said Lynne Cooper, president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement  Assn. "That type of facility does not belong in a neighborhood, and if it tries  to locate in one somewhere else, we'll be ready to help."  </P> <P> Phoenix House officials have denied that the conditions the community feared  had materialized near any of the company's 10 centers, which are in New York  and California.  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan has never announced her intention to go forward with a Nancy Reagan  Center in another location. Her spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Thursday that he  did not know whether she had decided to do so. Weinberg said Mrs. Reagan could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> As first described in the spring of 1988, the center was to have been the core  of Mrs. Reagan's post-White House crusade against drugs. It was to have housed  150 adolescents, 60 adults, training and research programs, and an office for  Mrs. Reagan.  </P> <P> Phoenix House had hoped to have the center open when she returned from  Washington in January but ran into delays, primarily caused by community  opposition.  </P> <P> The 14-acre property reverts to a trustee who was appointed by a federal judge  to oversee sale of the hospital after it declared bankruptcy in 1986.  Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a frequent Phoenix House critic, has proposed that  the city buy the property for use as a municipal senior center, library and  recreation center.  </P></p>

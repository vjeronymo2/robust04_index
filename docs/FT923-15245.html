			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / City told to tighten regulation THE City's self-regulatory system must demonstrate its ability to get tough with its own members in the aftermath of the Maxwell affair or face being replaced with a more hostile watchdog, according to the chairman of the self-regulating body for the stockbroking industry. 'Self-regulation is under attack from the media and from parliament,' said Mr Christopher Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority. 'In a sense, we are in the Last-Chance Saloon for self-regulation.' Mr Sharples' remarks were made as the SFA unveiled its report for 1991-92, which showed that the group had begun 23 disciplinary proceedings in the period covered and fined members just over Pounds 1m. Revelations about City firms' connections with the theft of over Pounds 400m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell - even if those firms had no knowledge of the theft - had brought the entire regulatory structure into question, he said. Separately, it has emerged that the SFA is considering disciplinary proceedings against four of its members which have been named in a writ issued by MGN pension trustees in connection with the disappearance of Pounds 88m from the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme. The four are Capel-Cure Myers, Lehman Brothers International, Bank of America and Credit Suisse. The SFA is said to be awaiting the four members' response to the writ before formally considering any action. The writ alleges that Lehman Brothers, Bank of America and Credit Suisse accepted collateral for loans to Maxwell that were in fact the property of the MGN pension scheme, and charges that Lehman knew or ought to have known that the securities were owned by the pension fund. It also alleges that, at least some months before Maxwell died, some of the firms suspected that assets were being diverted from the pension schemes. The SFA's options in disciplining a member range from censure to barring it from all or part of its securities activities. Mr Sharples said that so far, self-regulation has proven to be more successful than its critics acknowledge. The system prevents regulation from becoming a bar to innovation, he said. However, if Britain's retail financial service companies fail to agree on the formation of an integrated self-regulating body for their own businesses, political pressure to scrap the current system completely is likely to arise, Mr Sharples said.</p>

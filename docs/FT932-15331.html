			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Unemployed in suspense Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, April 8) is sympathetic to Professor Patrick Minford's view that the equilibrium rate of unemployment in the UK is 1m. Does either Mr Brittan or Prof Minford have any idea when we might reach that equilibrium? The other 2m would like to know.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah-al-Din Hafiz] </F>   [Excerpt] Despite the serious, negative effects that  extremism, violence, and terrorism have left on our public life  and inevitably on our private life, this violence and terrorism  had one good effect, if one may say so.    The good thing was that the tragedy produced by extremism,  terrorism, and violence has made everyone realize that the issue  is not only the result of religious or ideological deviation or  incitement by foreign countries and forces that do not like to  see us enjoying stability and progress, but that the origin and  roots of the problem have something to do with the social and  economic situation in which we live and from which we suffer.  We sometimes deny the existence of the problem and sometimes  we do not read and interpret it correctly, claiming that  everything is fine and nothing better could be done. But the  bitter truth remains, does not disappear, and does not change in  the eyes of those who really are afraid for the future of the  country and the nation.    I say very humbly that we have frequently drawn attention to  the fact that violence, extremism, and terrorism would not have  broken out, grown strong, and spread had they not found the  proper environment and fertile ground among the unemployed, the  poor, the frustrated, the desperate, and people without hope who  are ready to dismiss this society which did not provide them  with work, housing, clothing, and hope for the future, as is  necessary.    We have often attacked the inciters, provokers, and liars,  claiming that extremism and terrorism are imported commodities  that have no basis in our society and we have pursued a policy  of concealment and deception until one day we woke up to the  sound of explosions and this terrifying bloody clash. We now  follow the deterioration of the situation with concern.    At any rate, thank God that we have awakened after a long  sleep, distractions, plays on words and slogans, and deception  in interpretations and justifications to place our fingers on  the cause of the disease. It is clear that the problem is due  to the existing social and economic inequality that has created  sharp divisions among the people, disturbed the structure of  society that has been maintained over the ages, and produced  abnormal conditions, values, and traditions that respect money  more than intellect, sanctify wealth more than work, and  exercise deception more than ethics. The result has been social  division and economic disparity that have no logical basis.  [passage omitted]</p>

Harut'yunyan'']    [Excerpts] On 21 August a conference dealing with drug  addiction and combating alcoholism was held at the offices of  Vice President Gagik Harut'yunyan of the Republic of Armenia,  attended by the following: Republic of Armenia Minister of State  Armen Ghazaryan; Karapet Rhubinyan, head of the oversight agency  under the President of the Republic of Armenia; Avet Grigoryan,  member of the Supreme Council's Permanent Commission on Health  and Social Issues; plus all ministry and agency representatives  whose work deals with these fundamental issues.    In his opening statements the vice president noted that much  effort is being expended on this problem, which is of serious  magnitude. Of great concern is the fact that at the present time  drug abuse is spreading rapidly, particularly among students.  According to a public-opinion survey, 83.7 percent of those  polled consider this to be a very serious problem. Fifty-four  percent responded in the affirmative to the question ``Are there  any drug abusers among those people with whom you associate?''    ``This meeting should not be the last one to address this  issue,'' said Mr. Harut'yunyan. ``It is essential to carry out  fundamental and consistent work efforts.''    The participants in the conference presented their views on  the subject.    Republic of Armenia Minister of Health Ara Babloyan stated  that last year his ministry had submitted to the government a  number of proposals aimed at resolving these fundamental issues.  Serious work continues to be carried out jointly with the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The  conviction was expressed that an individual agency working  separately cannot achieve results. Mr. Babloyan stated, ``There  is a need for a systematized plan, implementation of which calls  for the creation of a special commission (taking international  experience into account) under the president, vice president or  prime minister. The ministries of health, justice, internal  affairs, education, and social services, the public prosecutor's  office, as well as public organizations and organizations  dealing with the dissemination of information must be involved  in these projects.''    The minister went on to state that as of 1 January 1993  there  were 1,113 registered drug addicts, 796 of whom were enrolled in  a medical help program. Drug addict figures break down as  follows: 0.01 percent are 18 years of age or younger; 50 percent  are between 19 and 30; 31 percent are from 31 to 40 years of  age; 14.5 percent are between 41 and 50; and the remainder are  over 50. Forty-seven percent of the total are blue-collar  workers, 10 percent are white-collar workers, and 3 percent are  students. At the present time there is a 150-bed drug addiction  treatment center in Yerevan. There is a similar 50-bed facility  in Gyumri, plus 47 offices in various rayons and cities in this  republic. Much attention is being devoted to the question of  drugs produced in this republic as well as drugs brought in from  elsewhere. Mr. Baboyan noted that this issue was seriously  addressed at a recent meeting held with Minister of State A.  Ghazaryan. A decision was made to hold a special conference  dealing with the issue of habit-forming drugs and narcotic  substances.    Sergey Aslanyan, chief of the of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs directorate which deals with drug trafficking and  combating drug abuse, discussed the work being done by his  directorate and its results. He particularly stressed Operation  Poppy-93, in the course of which a large quantity of narcotic  substances was discovered and seized. He noted that the Ministry  of Internal Affairs considers it essential to pass a new law,  which should specify a number of important provisions: drug  addiction must be differentiated from drug trafficking, and  Article 44 of the Code of Administrative Violations must be  revised. Mr. Aslanyan also stressed the importance of  establishing a special coordinating commission.    Artavazd Gevorgyan, chief public prosecutor of the Republic  of Armenia, noted that certain groups are engaged in drug  trafficking for purposes of financial gain. Judicial practice in  the past has been quite severe in this regard. ``At the present  time we must apply existing laws, and therefore we must first of  all uncover these criminal enterprises,'' said Mr. Gevorgyan. In  1992, for example, 162 crimes were reported but, according to  the prosecutor, ``who knows what percentage this represents of  total crimes--probably a very small percentage.'' One hundred  eighty four crimes have been reported during the first seven  months of this year. Mr. Gevorgyan is convinced that these  numbers will grow unless all of us concentrate our attention on  this area of criminal activity. It was reported that all rayon  and city prosecutors have received instructions to cooperate  with and assist the 4th Directorate of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs.    Hayk Harut'yunyan, chief of the State National Security  Directorate of the 3rd Main Directorate, stated that his  directorate works in the area of identifying and neutralizing  groups involved in drug trafficking. They consider it essential  to close down those routes by which narcotic substances are  being brought into this republic. An extremely important element  here is the problem of ``open borders.'' The State National  Security Directorate considers it essential to draw up and enter  into a bilateral agreement dealing with drug trafficking and,  together with counterpart agencies in other interested  countries, to establish a permanent body which would exercise  oversight, as well as to establish a data bank. It is considered  to be of utmost importance to provide weapons and equipment to  agencies combating drug trafficking and drug addiction....    [Paragraph omitted]    In conclusion, Republic of Armenia Vice-President Gagik  Harut'yunyan noted that the campaign against drug addiction and  drug trafficking in this republic will in fact assume new forms  and new attributes. We shall find ourselves in a grave situation  if we continue to proceed as before, if under conditions whereby  changes have taken place around us we fail to have at our  disposal a comprehensive system. Of serious concern is the fact  that at the present time an organized campaign is not being  developing and that we are short of equipment.    Mr. Harut'yunyan commented that it is impossible to solve  the  problem through punishment alone and by merely taking  administrative actions. He stressed the importance of national  dignity, the factor of education of youth, and of effective  publicity.    ``There are at least two things which should not exist:  begging and drug addiction,'' said the vice-president. ``Perhaps  these two are not comparable to one another, but both are alien  to our national character.'' It is absolutely essential to  eradicate the causes of this evil. For this reason the  establishment of a substantial, well-designed program is  considered a prerequisite. It is very important that each and  every citizen realize that he cannot stay outside this campaign.  Widespread publicity is essential: the people must understand  the enormous danger presented by drug addiction and drug  trafficking. Mr. Harut'yunyan stated that 52 percent of those  polled gave an affirmative reply to the following  sociologically-oriented question: ``Are you concerned that a  child or relative of yours is a drug user?''    Mr. Harut'yunyan noted that, unfortunately, drug abuse is  widespread in the schools: not as regards level of drug  addiction, but rather the fact that a large number of young  people are trying drugs.    The situation has become calamitous at higher educational  institutions: a large number of students not only try drugs but  develop a need for them. ``At the most highly-disciplined higher  educational institutions, even drug abuse is of a widespread  nature,'' said the vice-president. ``The fact is that we do not  have working mechanisms within the educational system.'' A  situation of inertia continues in the field of medicine,  involving narrower and more costly means of combating drugs. At  this point Mr. Harut'yunyan stressed the importance of  differentiating drug addicts from those involved in drug  trafficking, whereby the former, who are sick, must be given an  opportunity to become cured, while the latter must be severely  punished.    ``We should not allow the problem of drug addiction and drug  trafficking to develop into a full-blown drug mafia, for  otherwise we shall not be able to root out this phenomenon,''  said the vice-president.    Gagik Harut'yunyan then proposed that all submitted  suggestions and questions formulated at the conference be  reviewed and further developed. Within one week's time they  should be submitted to the President's staff, in the process of  which all suggestions and proposals should be systematized and  computerized through the efforts of government and the  president's staff; he proposed that Vice-President of the  Republic of Armenia G. Harut'yunyan, Minister of State of the  Republic of Armenia A. Ghazaryan, and K. Rhubinyan, head of the  oversight agency under the president of the Republic of Armenia,  be tasked with summarizing all suggestions and proposals and  submitting them at the next meeting, which would take place in  two weeks time....</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 21 May (AFP) -- Ukraine said Saturday [21 May]  it would not use force against Crimea unless separatists there  resort to armed provocation, after telling the UN and NATO that  moves by the republic threaten regional peace and stability.    "We will abstain from using force, unless of course another  party launches armed provocations," Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko told AFP.    On Friday Crimean deputies voted to restore a 1992  constitution, a move tantamount to a declaration of independence.    Ukrainian lawmakers retaliated late Friday, giving the  pro-Russian Crimean assembly 10 days to reverse its decision and  "conform with the laws and constitution of Ukraine."    "I think we will have enough strength, will and  self-restraint to find a settlement" to the crisis, Zlenko told  AFP.    "We will take all the measures based on international law to  assure the territorial integrity of the state," he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Dec (NA) -- Electricity Department  Secretary Carlos Bastos reported today that the electricity cuts  recorded on 28 December in different points of the country were  caused by sabotage to the power lines coming from the El Chocon  and Salto Grande hydroelectric dams.    Bastos said that to repair the lines a program of rotational  cuts of between 20 and 30 minutes has been prepared.    In a news conference Bastos explained that last night,  between 1945 and 2120, three different acts of sabotage were  carried out on the power lines coming from the El Chocon and  Salto Grande dams, leaving some 800,000 people in this capital  and an unspecified number of inhabitants in the country's  interior without electricity.    Since repairing the damage will require between 24 and 48  hours, a plan of cuts in electricity service during "peak"  consumption hours had to be implemented. Bastos denied that the  cuts could be extended until 31 December.    The secretary said the energy supply through a line that  links the Salto Grande hydroelectric dam with the locality of  Santo Tome, Corrientes Province, was interrupted at 1945 on 28  December. When the failure was investigated, it was discovered  that it was caused by a chain thrown on the high-tension power  line.    Later, at 2020, a second sabotage was carried out, this time  on a pylon for a power line from El Chocon, in a place called  Unanue, near the intersection of National Route 35 and  Provincial Route 215, La Pampa Province.    In this manner, the power supply was cut from one of the  lines that link the dam with the cities of Puelches (La Pampa)  and Henderson (Buenos Aires).    An hour later, at 2120, a third attack was recorded only 12  km from the site, on the other high-tension power line that runs  parallel to the first.    Bastos said that although the reasons are not known so far,  he did not rule out the possibility that the objective of these  attacks might be the "disruption of the development of events in  the energy field or the total political environment" in the  country.    "So far we have no evidence to attribute the responsibility  for these attacks, but we fully rule out that they could have  been instigated by Light and Power Union leaders," Bastos said.    He added: "Since the repair work will demand between 24 and  48 hours by the Transener company, it is probable that  rotational cuts will take place during peak hours, affecting 2  percent of the demand."    The plan for cuts has been imposed because "since the links  with the generating plants are cut, the distribution companies  are restricting the supply to preserve the system."</p>

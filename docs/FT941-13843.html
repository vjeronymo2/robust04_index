			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Fyodorov adrift in sea of promises: The leading reformer fears the worst for Russia's economy Mr Boris Fyodorov's decision to resign as Russian finance minister underlines what is widely seen as the chief obstacle to successful market reform: rulers who cannot resist making promises they cannot keep. 'I can control the spending but not the promises,' Mr Fyodorov told the Financial Times. 'Other people in the government think that just because they are sitting in the White House (government headquarters), they have the god-given right to spend money. . . They don't understand you cannot do it.' Mr Fyodorov, a leading reformer, fears that spending in Russia is about to run out of control, fuelling inflation and undermining any hope of stabilising the Russian economy. The first sign, since his announced departure, that the new cabinet is ready to loosen the government purse strings came at the weekend: the first spending decisions included a big increase in subsidies to the farm sector announced by Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture, and a doubling in the amount of money the central bank will be asked to print to support expenditure which cannot be covered by budget revenues. Stung by the international outcry over Mr Fyodorov's resignation, a spokesman for Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin said his new course 'contains elements of western market economics but takes into account the special characteristics of our state, people and Russian traditions'. It is possible Mr Chernomyrdin wants to restrict spending. But his recent endorsement of a plan to spend up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) on a new parliament building provides a telling example of how Russia's rulers, in Mr Fyodorov's words, look 'at a problem and decide to throw money at it regardless of whether this money exists'. For all his tough words, Mr Chernomyrdin has appeared unable to resist the pressure to make promises he cannot keep. The state owes about Rbs1,000bn to the defence industry for weapons it ordered under pressure from the military in the past year. Under pressure from agricultural lobbyists, it set procurement prices for grain twice as high as those on an emerging free market, but then failed to pay the money. It liberalised coal prices but promised to continue paying subsidies to coal miners, without putting any pressure on the industry to restructure or consider closing unprofitable mines. Such promises have left Mr Fyodorov in the uncomfortable role of having to break them by telling people there are no funds - save by printing money and fuelling inflation. And he adds that Russia's main problem is not so much a lack of money but a waste of it. 'You find that in 90 per cent of cases, money is misspent or people did not need it,' he said. Corruption and inefficient institutions meant that subsidies rarely reached their targets, while those most in need of support felt abandoned by the government. 'If you stand in front of the British Treasury for an hour and shout, nobody will give you any money,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'But here it works, so why should people stop doing it?' Supporters of Russian reforms believe the west must and can help Moscow cover budget expenditure which cannot be cut overnight. But they also argue that this can happen only if spending is not in the hands of people like Mr Zaveriukha. If Mr Fyodorov leaves the government, he plans to focus on his role as a deputy in parliament, to take his fight to voters ahead of new elections scheduled for 1996. 'We have to talk to people more and conduct more propaganda to tell them how things work. Then we will have a second chance in the elections.' But pessimists believe a second chance may not materialise if, by that time, Mr Chernomyrdin's muddling through goes so badly wrong that the people will be ready for medicine more drastic than even Mr Fyodorov proposes.</p>

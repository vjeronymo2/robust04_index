			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE STILL HAS 'SMOKEY'  </P> <P> I was thrilled to read your article about Will James, "Endpapers: Come Back,  Will, Come Back!" (Book Review, March 12). So very interesting as I did not  know about his sad fate in life having died so young by drinking himself to  death.  </P> <P> I just happen to have in my possession "Smokey, the Cowhorse"! The book has to  be about 44 to 45 years old. It is in pretty good condition considering how  many times I have packed it.  </P> <P> Mr. Love, you have made me happy also to read about something that brought back  so many memories of my dear, beloved dad who has now left me many years ago,  but I will always have his knowledge and his quote:  </P> <P> "It is not what you read, but what you are able to retain -- that is what makes  a good story writer."  </P> <P> JANIS A. GAGE  </P> <P> GLENDALE  </P></p>

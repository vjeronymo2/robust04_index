			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Bonn to bar crews from Awacs before court ruling GERMAN crews on reconnaissance aircraft above the Adriatic Sea will not be able to participate in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over former Yugoslavia, pending a ruling by the German federal constitutional court. It will rule on an appeal yesterday by the liberal Free Democrat party (FDP), junior partner in the German coalition government, against a cabinet decision to let crews stay on board Awacs aircraft. The court will meet on Monday to study the appeal but has not said when a ruling can be expected. In a special cabinet session, ministers of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), voted that German crews on Awacs could take part in Nato missions implementing the no-fly zone over Bosnia. However, the decision was immediately challenged by the FDP, which is asking the court to consider whether German crews' involvement in enforcing the no-fly zone is constitutional. The coalition members have been clashing over interpretation of the constitution. The CDU/CSU says that article 24 allows German troops to fight in a Nato context. But the FDP, as well as the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), say the constitution prevents German military involvement outside Nato territory. The SDP yesterday also filed an appeal on the question to the constitutional court. Awacs aircraft are conducting surveillance above the Adriatic and would tell Nato's other forces how the no-fly zone is being enforced. A third of Awacs crews are German. Pending a court ruling, these crews would be asked to leave the Awacs if Nato were to implement the no-fly zone. They would, however, be allowed to prepare the aircraft. CDU officials said they were hoping the court would rule in favour of the cabinet decision in a couple of days. If the court does not rule in favour, though, the matter would have to be referred to parliament. So far, the opposition SPD has refused to vote for constitutional changes.</p>

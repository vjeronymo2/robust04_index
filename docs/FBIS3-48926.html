The refugees, mainly women,  children and elderly, left Sarajevo on Tuesday evening on board  16 buses. They will be housed temporarily in a sports centre in  Split, before being transferred to refugee camps or leaving for  new lives in another country.    Many of the refugees had no documents with them, which  created long hold-ups at the Croatian-Bosnian border, the Croat  refugee office said quoted by HINA. Bad roads and a spate of  technical hitches also delayed the convoy's progress. UNHCR  spokesman Ray Wilkinson said earlier Thursday in Sarajevo: "It  was not anticipated that it would take so long."    Wilkinson said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  was going to feed the evacuees before the last leg of the  journey Thursday from Metkovic on the Croatian border to Split,  120 kilometres (70 miles) to the north. "These people are  probably quite hungry, since they had only a few food supplies  with them when they left Sarajevo on Tuesday," he said.    A group of 150 Bosnian Serbs evacuated the same day, heading  for Belgrade, arrived in Serbia on Wednesday.</p>

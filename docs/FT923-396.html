			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Sterling hits new low as franc rallies STERLING HIT a new low against the D-Mark last night, while equities and gilts also lost ground as investors took a glum view of the UK's economic prospects now the pound is floating. Elsewhere in Europe, stocks and bonds slipped on worries that the German Bundesbank may take its time to ease credit policy, a move that may drive further into the distance the possibility of large cuts in interest rates across the continent. Gloom about the economic outlook was particularly intense in Ireland, where the central bank was forced to increase interest rates by 3 percentage points to strengthen the punt, which has weakened in recent weeks amid the turmoil on currency markets. The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark, indicating that devaluation of the currency looks unlikely. The pound was quoted last night after the close of European trading at DM 2.5080, 27 pfennigs below its former ERM floor of DM2.778, although it rallied in late New York trading to DM2.5115. Earlier, it had closed in London at DM2.51, down 3 1/2 pfennigs on the day. Sterling's weakness, even though Britain is now out of the ERM, may make it difficult for the UK government to sanction the further cuts in interest rates that many industrialists and politicians think are required to hasten recovery. Investor nervousness was increased by a lack of government clarification over the future of UK economic policy. Such sentiments took their toll on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed 41.0 off at 2,560.0, while gilts were down by up to  1/4 point. Some of the pressure may have come from investors taking profits after the rise in shares and short-dated gilts since sterling left the ERM. The mood among UK investors to some degree reflected torpid sentiment elsewhere in Europe, caused by indications of a lack of strength in the European economy and uncertainty about the direction for currencies. In Frankfurt and Paris, the bourses fell by 4 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent respectively, while the Swedish stock market suffered a decline of 4 1/2 per cent. In Germany, shares suffered on reports of the poor outlook for earnings growth at Volkswagen, the car company, and a bleak assessment of the German economy by the IFO economic research institute in Munich. On currency markets, trading conditions were quiet, indicating the eight remaining members of the ERM have staved off the chance of further realignments. The franc rallied in London to FFr3.373 against the D-Mark, nearly 6 centimes above its floor - a level it maintained in New York. This suggested the intervention of the Bundesbank and the Bank of France had stopped devaluation of the franc.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Weiguo (1728 0251 0948)] </F>   [Excerpts] "I tell you, there are cops here right now, and  they have not let me go out the whole morning, nor do they let  my friends come in," mainland Chinese human rights activist Xu  Liangying almost roared over the phone.    "A reporter asked me whether I would meet Christopher if he  came to pay me a visit. I said, I have not requested to see  Christopher. But if he wants to talk to me, I will be willing to  meet him. Perhaps this has irritated the authorities. This  morning three persons in charge of the party group of the China  Academy of Social Sciences came over here to talk with me and  asked me not to meet Christopher. They preached at me. They  talked of state security, blah blah blah....I gave this offer to  them. I said, I will consider your request if you have all the  cops withdrawn, have Ding Zilin's telephone line reconnected,  and have all the plainclothes men withdraw from around her  house. If you do not do this, then I tell you I will probably  request a meeting with Christopher on my own."    Xu Liangying said with great indignation: "I want to tell  the whole world what the situation is in China now -- whoever  calls for reason and the improvement of human rights through  rationality will immediately have his human rights infringed  upon." [passage omitted]    In this telephone interview Xu Liangying also mentioned Ding  Zilin's case: "I went to see her yesterday afternoon. Her  telephone line had been cut off. Those staying outside her  house seemed to be behaving in a more civilized manner. Many  plainclothes men were staying 10 to 20 meters away from the  house. Those cops I had here were in uniform, they were from  the Public Security Bureau. Whether the situation has changed  today, I do not know. That is what I saw yesterday." [passage  omitted]</p>

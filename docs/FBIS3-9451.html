			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wieslawa Wlodarczyk-Wardacka, director of </F> the Ministry of Ownership Transformations Szczecin Agency, by  Pawel Winiarski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Winiarski] Ownership transformations give rise to  many emotions and misunderstandings. What is more, some people  are beginning to say that the privatization process is too slow  and inefficient. Are these allegations true?    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] First of all, the Ministry of  Ownership Transformations has no power to exert any kind of  pressure on state enterprises to force them to choose the  privatization path sooner rather than later. Nor does it have  any interest in doing so. The decision rests first and foremost  with the work forces of the firms in question. On the other  hand, more than half of all enterprises in Poland are currently  in the process of various kinds of ownership transformations.  These processes include liquidation, restructuring, completion  of privatization schemes, bankruptcy procedures, and transfer of  the assets of certain firms into the administration of the State  Treasury Agricultural Property Agency.    [Winiarski] How does Szczecin Voivodship rate against the  background of your statistics?    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Unfortunately, our region is hardly up  with the national leaders. This is because  ownership-transformation processes are being carried out at no  more than just over 20 percent of firms that were originally set  up by the voivoda or by central administration agencies. Even  so, whereas we note relatively significant progress in the  latter category, the group of enterprises dubbed "voivoda's  firms" represents a minor proportion of enterprises currently  undergoing privatization in the region. Since the beginning of  1991, transformation operations have been initiated at 71 firms,  including 44 from the voivoda's "stable" and 27 administered  centrally. Only one-third of the total number have actually  been privatized. A dozen or so collapsed, and the rest were  liquidated because of their poor financial condition. Four  firms were sold to individual private investors, and several  more entered joint-stock companies based on foreign capital.  All in all, out of the total of 211 state enterprises, 95 were  not included in any ownership-transformation processes at all.  Just under one-third of all of the enterprises were transferred  to the administration of the State Treasury Agricultural  Property Agency.    [Winiarski] What form of privatization is currently most  popular with work forces?    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] The most popular privatization model  at present is leasing. Almost 75 percent of firms undergoing  privatization choose that particular option. The decisive  factors here are work forces' desire to become joint owners of  the assets of their own enterprises, accompanied by mistrust of  any new outside owners. We currently note a dangerous  phenomenon whereby economic analyses are commissioned "to order"  by enterprises from outside "consultancy firms." Instead of  telling the truth, which is frequently brutal, they go out of  their way to prove the correctness of the firms' choice of this  or that particular privatization model. This might later turn  out to be a very dangerous practice when it becomes apparent  that the firm is unable to meet market demands and has no funds  with which to meet the lease payments. We have such a situation  now with the Regional Land Reclamation Enterprise, whose  financial condition brings into question the original decision  to privatize it in the leasing system.    [Winiarski] But surely someone must have approved that  original decision....    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] Our agency notified the ministry of a  number of reservations about the documents we were presented  with at the time, but the work force's determination eventually  persuaded the minister to make that decision. Our agency has  relatively limited powers of intervention in  ownership-transformation processes. We are merely an  opinion-formulating organ, and we vet documents from the formal  and legal angles. Of course, we can formulate a negative  opinion, but that does not necessarily mean that a determined  firm will not be able to have its way.    [Winiarski] A new type of ownership transformation is being  introduced now, in the shape of the National Investment Funds.  Is this form of privatization attracting much interest?    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] In 1992, when the project was first  announced, three firms expressed an interest. Last year,  another five firms joined them. At the moment, talks are under  way with several more candidates eager to participate in this  form of privatization. These are not impressive numbers, but  that is also because a considerable number of firms are still  poorly informed about the details of this new venture.    [Winiarski] How would you assess the present condition of  the privatization scene in Szczecin Voivodship?    [Wlodarczyk-Wardacka] A measure of comfort may be derived  from the fact that, for example, last year the Szczecin voivoda  did not have to make even a single decision to liquidate an  enterprise on grounds of poor economic condition. However, this  does not mean that there are no such firms at all. There are,  but they are making every effort to survive. In many cases, it  is obvious that administration by a board of commissioners would  be an insufficient rescue measure that would only serve to  prolong their slow death even more. Liquidation processes  designed to precede privatization have been carried out  successfully in seven firms. This may not be much, but it is  still the best result we have noted over the past three years.  However, on the whole, there is still too little activity in a  significant number of enterprises that ought to be restructured.  Szczecin Voivodship is a region with a somewhat exceptional  structure. Huge areas are still in the hands of the State  Farms, and, in these, privatization is proceeding very  sluggishly. There are also a considerable number of enterprises  whose privatization would require truly long periods of time and  really comprehensive economic analyses. Nevertheless, even  those processes could and should be speeded up a little. The  trouble is that it is not within our sphere of competence to do  the speeding up. A proportion of enterprises should be  liquidated and sold as soon as possible. This is because they  survive not by carrying out their statutory duties but, for  instance, by subletting the land and the property they  administer. On the face of it, their financial situation  appears not too bad, but the State Treasury could still gain a  lot by privatizing those firms. The phenomenon is rather  widespread, and it should be opposed by individual enterprises'  respective founding agencies. For the time being, any such  opposition is not making many inroads. However, the reluctance  to make appropriate decisions is also underpinned by the fear of  inflation and can be seen as partly justified. Nevertheless, the  time for radical decisions will be coming soon.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 U.S. JEWISH GROUPS GIVE ISRAEL BAD NEWS;  </P> <P> AMERICAN PUBLIC, OFFICIALS FINDING IT HARD TO BACK PALESTINIAN POLICIES,  GOVERNMENT IS TOLD  </P> <P> Members of two major American Jewish groups have come to Israel with harsh  news: that the American public and many U.S. officials are finding it hard to  support Israel's policies toward the Palestinians.  </P> <P> "You ask for support . . . but people in this government cannot call  Palestinians 'grasshoppers,' break their bones and expect people who support  the underdog to speak up (in Israel's favor)," said Lawrence Goldmuntz,  president of the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security  Affairs.  </P> <P> "The underdog, in the perception of Americans, is the Palestinians," Goldmuntz  said. "You are blowing up homes. This has got to stop."  </P> <P> Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,  responded by saying that the alternative to demolishing the homes of people who  throw stones is "executing people who cause injury or death to Israeli people."  </P> <P> "If you can't explain that, you can't explain it," Ben-Aharon concluded.  </P> <P> The give-and-take was typical of the past few days here. American Jewish  leaders have descended on Jerusalem to hear what the Israeli government has to  say about questions of war and peace and, in some cases, to probe further and  even offer a bit of advice.  </P> <P> Two groups, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  and the governing board of the American Jewish Committee, were here. They are  among several expected in Israel in anticipation of a meeting between Shamir  and President Bush, sometime next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zionist Conference Sought  </P> <P> The Israeli government is trying to organize a Zionist conference that it hopes  will demonstrate world Jewry's support for Israel's position on the question of  ending the Arab uprising in the occupied territories and making peace in the  Middle East.  </P> <P> The way appears to be rocky. American Jews, normally highly supportive of  Israel, are coming here with a skeptical attitude and are straining to  understand the Israeli government's slow response to diplomatic moves by the  Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Some, like Goldmuntz, who came with the Conference of Presidents, directly  challenge Israeli policies -- in this case, actions designed to deter Arab  stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Others listen quietly  but come away apparently yearning for clearer answers from a government  pleading at once for more time and for immediate support.  </P> <P> Israel's interest in American Jewish opinion is clear. It wants to avoid  developments such as occurred last December, when Washington announced its  willingness to talk to the PLO.  </P> <P> George P. Shultz, who was then secretary of state, opened the contact after the  PLO said it had abandoned terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist in  security. The shock to Israel was multiplied when major Jewish groups in the  United States failed to attack Shultz's initiative.  </P> <P> "We were aghast that our friends in the States did not rise up in unison to  condemn this step," Ben-Aharon told the Conference of Presidents on Monday.  "There is a need now to mobilize all the efforts to bring about an improvement  in the situation. Talks with the PLO cannot produce anything positive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Israeli Goal  </P> <P> For the moment, getting the United States to end its contacts with the PLO  appears to be a major goal of the Israeli government, and it wants the American  Jews to help.  </P> <P> According to officials in Israel, the PLO has already broken its pledge to  abandon terrorism, and Israel has called on Washington to break contact.  Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in a speech to about 65 members of the Conference  of Presidents, said that a clash between Israeli troops and five heavily armed  Palestinians that took place Sunday in southern Lebanon proves that the PLO's  no-terror promise has been broken.  </P> <P> Two radical PLO factions, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and  the Palestine Liberation Front, took responsibility for trying to attack  Israeli positions north of the Israeli border. Israel maintains that the  guerrillas were bent on infiltrating into Israel itself and attacking civilian  targets.  </P> <P> Israeli government officials urged the American Jews not to view the  suppression of the Arab uprising, in which about 350 Palestinians have been  killed, as brutal.  </P> <P> "Our friends in the United States are either passive or critical or paralyzed,"  Ben-Aharon said. "This is negative. There is a lot you can do to debunk  misconceptions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Seem Unconvinced  </P> <P> Many of the listeners seemed unconvinced. Robert Lifton, president of the  American Jewish Congress, cautioned that American Jews do not have an endless  supply of influence and that backing Israel on the Palestinian issue may not be  the best place to spend that influence.  </P> <P> "You have to be aware, we have to pick and choose our spots," Lifton said.  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon's presentation was undercut by a fellow panel member, Shlomo  Avineri, a former high government official who suggested that Israel should  feel out the PLO. As for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he described the problem  there as one not of image but of policy.  </P> <P> "The time has come to try to nail Arafat down and see if there are substantive  changes in the PLO," Avineri said. "It would be good for Israel to ask these  tough questions of the PLO."  </P> <P> Public perceptions of the intifada, as the uprising is called, may or may not  be distorted, Avineri said, but certain basics are clear: "The fact is in the  last year the army -- our army -- has killed about 300 Palestinian civilians.  We have a few thousand in detention. There is no point in denying . . . the not  very pleasant picture."  </P> <P> On Sunday, the members of the American Jewish Committee, one of the oldest  American Jewish groups, heard Foreign Minister Arens plead for support.  </P> <P> "We hope the position of the government of Israel will enjoy the support of the  Jewish community throughout the world," he said.  </P> <P> But questioners noted that different Israeli officials give different  impressions of Israel's policy, and that as a result the Americans do not know  exactly what position they should support. Arens agreed that the complaint is  valid.  </P> <P> "We are sometimes not perceived to be speaking in one voice," he said, and he  promised that "we're going to avoid that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Differences in the Government  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has openly favored giving up  territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for peace, a stand that  is opposed by Prime Minister Shamir.  </P> <P> There have been difficulties in trying to obtain all the conflicting views of  the Israeli-Arab situation. On Monday night, the committee tried to arrange a  dinner panel that would include members of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and  Palestinian spokesmen.  </P> <P> The Likud members refused to attend because they did not want to sit with the  Palestinians. The Palestinians did not attend because they learned that Arabs  who have cooperated with Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza were also  scheduled to be present.  </P> <P> "The Middle East is in flux and so is our meeting," the master of ceremonies  quipped.  </P></p>

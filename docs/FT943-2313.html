			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Pajares accepts Savoy offer The Savoy group yesterday announced that Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, is to become its managing director on November 7. Pajares' appointment, while expected, will be greeted with relief by the Savoy and its newly-constituted chairman's committee of Sir Ewen Fergusson, Rocco Forte and John Sinclair. The committee was set up last week after the departure of Giles Shepard as managing director and represents a truce between the Savoy and Forte factions on the Savoy board. Forte holds a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of votes. Pajares was the favoured choice of both Forte and the veteran Savoy board members who remain after Shepard's departure. Pajares kept Savoy waiting for a week while he consulted senior executives of the Four Seasons group, which is based in Toronto. While excited by the Savoy offer, Pajares found it difficult to leave Four Seasons. He had been at the London Four Seasons (formerly Inn on the Park) since it opened in 1970. He was then executive assistant manager and food and beverage manager. After a spell in the Canary Islands and Canada, he became general manager in 1975. Born in Spain, Pajares is now well settled in London and is one of the city's most respected hoteliers. He has received official honours in Spain; in his adopted country he was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1988. (See Observer)</p>

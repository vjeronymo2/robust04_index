			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with U Sein Win, prime minister of the </F> National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, by Daw Tin  Htar Swe of the BBC Burmese Section on the morning of 18  February; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Swe] How does the National Coalition  Government of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] view the Congressman  [Bill Richardson] meeting with SLORC [State Law and Order  Restoration Council] leaders and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi?    [Win] We joyously welcome the meeting between Congressman  Bill Richardson and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The meeting enabled  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to openly express her position not only to  the Burmese people, but also to the whole world; and we hope it  is the beginning of the resolution of various problems in Burma.  [passage omitted] What we are talking about is our hope because  things will work out only when the SLORC, all the democratic  forces -- including the democratic forces led by Daw Aung San  Suu Kyi -- and the national leaders meet and seriously discuss  problems. Otherwise, there will be no comprehensive solution to  the problems in Burma. We believe in this, and our hope is  based on our belief.    [Swe] It is true that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi once mentioned  that national reconciliation is very crucial and she is ready to  discuss the restoration of national reconciliation with the  SLORC; but she has been out of touch with the outside world for  a long time. And now the SLORC has even arranged cease-fires  with small rebel groups. It is also planning to draw up a  constitution and is laying down principles for it which will bar  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from a leading role in Burmese politics.  Its relations with ASEAN are also improving. Therefore, the  question is: who will benefit from the meeting between the SLORC  and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi? The SLORC or democratic forces?    [Win] As far as we are concerned, although it is holding  talks with the national ethnic groups, the SLORC has not reached  any agreements. It has not signed any agreements officially.  These are just discussions. We believe that political matters  must be included in the discussions. We also believe that, if  the discussions concentrate only on the cease-fire, without the  inclusion of political matters, then the discussions will not be  fruitful and will not last very long. Similarly, laying down  principles to ensure the Defense Services' leading role in the  politics and exclude Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from Burmese politics  at the National Convention will not get approval if people do  not accept them. It doesn't matter whether it is the  constitution or not. The constitution, which is not accepted by  the people, will not last long. We also believe that the SLORC  should think about this.    [Swe] Following the meeting between Mr. Bill Richardson and  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, it has been learned that Japan is  considering providing small-scale aid to Burma, not as a loan  but as a small-scale financial aid. This news came almost at  the same time as Mr. Bill Richardson's visit to Burma. Why does  Japan have to announce its plan to provide aid to Burma at this  particular time? What is your view, U Sein Win?    [Win] We are still studying this. Why is Japan helping  Burma? We have just learnt that it will provide something like  a grant to Burma. If we have to express a position, we think it  is premature. We believe Japan's move to provide aid to Burma  is premature if it has only taken Bill Richardson's visit to  Burma and improvements in other areas in Burma as positive steps  into consideration.    [Swe] During the last couple days, while Mr. Richardson was  in Burma, the SLORC extended Daw Aung San Suu Kyi house arrest  another year. What do you think about this?    [Win] We believe that the SLORC has no honesty. The SLORC  used Mr. Richardson's visit to improve its international image  and, at the same time, extended her house arrest. The SLORC has  no right to extend the house arrest. According to the SLORC's  laws it cannot be extended. As long as the SLORC continues to  do contradictory things -- breaching its own law and at the same  time talking about the rule of law prevailing -- we will have  difficulties believing the SLORC. Having these doubts, we  believe that it will be very difficult to establish and restore  national conciliation.</p>

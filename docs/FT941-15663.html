			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Downing St tries to limit 'back to basics' damage Downing Street launched an immediate damage limitation exercise last night designed to keep the government's 'back to basics' initiative alive. The move came as Tory MPs braced themselves for further damaging revelations about the Westminster council affair. Copies of the unpublished report circulating in the Commons were said to contain further detailed allegations about how the gerrymandering was conducted. Gloomy Conservative MPs saw the report as a further instalment in the series of disclosures which has rocked the government in the past two weeks. Few blamed Mr Major for the latest revelations, but many said they would have been less damaging under the leadership of a more resolute prime minister. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, said the report disclosed political corruption on a scale unknown in modern Britain. 'It is the stuff of banana republics. It shows that the Tory party is rotten, and amoral to the core. They have abandoned basic principles of morality,' he said. There was also concern about the position of Mr Barry Legg, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes SW, who was chief whip to the Conservatives on Westminster council in the period covered by the allegations. Mr Legg, who could be surcharged if the Westminster district auditor decides to pursue the issue in the courts, said he was innocent of any impropriety. Labour also made clear that it would pursue allegations that Mr Peter Brooke, the MP for Westminster South, knew about Westminster council's housing policies when he was chairman of the Conservative party. Several cabinet ministers are expected to make speeches on the initiative today. They will include Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, who have differed strongly on the moral content of the campaign. Mr Major told the cabinet the campaign should not be derailed. 'The message is sound. We must not let ourselves be diverted by isolated incidents. We must keep our nerve,' he said. 'There is a moral dimension; it is not a moral crusade,' he was said to have told ministers. Mr Major won the support of the executive of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers at a long meeting last night, but MPs said there had been tough exchanges. Mr Major is understood to have been urged to act more decisively when dealing with future ministerial indiscretions. There was further gloom for the government in a Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph last night. The survey showed Labour on 46.5 per cent from 48.5 per cent in December. Conservative support was at 25.5 per cent (27 per cent), with the Liberal Democrats on 20.5 per cent (20 per cent). Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said last night that he had read the British papers while abroad in recent days 'with growing disbelief'. Mr Clarke said on BBC Question Time that he had 'come back to find that a kind of hysteria is spreading, with allegations that are unsustainable against any political party.'</p>

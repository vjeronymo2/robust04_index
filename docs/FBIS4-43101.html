			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: "Hizballah Members Use Mosques as </F> Cells"]    [Text] Ankara--It has been established that the Hizballah  members in Turkey have selected the mosques to camouflage their  organization and activities. It has also been established that  the Hizballah organization secures the funds it needs from the  donations made to the mosques, the charges for Koranic courses,  and the fees paid for Koranic recitations and requiems for the  deceased. It also selects its recruits from among the students  who attend the Koranic courses and fundamentalist individuals  who live in the organization's boarding houses.    The operations that have been carried out against the  Hizballah organization, which has become known for the  unresolved crimes in southeastern Anatolia, have recently begun  to yield results. The Diyarbakir State Security Court has  established that the Hizballah has selected the mosques as its  individual centers. Meanwhile, the Turkish Grand National  Assembly Commission on Unresolved Crimes has decided to ask the  Directorate of Religious Affairs to inform the commission on  Hizballah's organization plan. The commission will meet today  to be briefed by one of the directorate's officials on how  Hizballah uses the mosques to get organized and the measures  that have been taken against its activities.    The indictments made by the Diyarbakir State Security Court  Prosecutor's Office have outlined in detail Hizballah's  objectives, the plan it applies to get organized, and the  methods it uses to acquire funds and recruit new militants. The  indictments 1994/309 and 1994/318, which have been drawn up  against the militants arrested by the security forces in their  recent operations, disclosed that the Hizballah organization  appeared on the scene for the first time in al-Biqa' Valley in  1982. It adopted the model of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The indictments said the Hizballah is sympathetic not only to  the followers of the Shiite sect but also to those of the  Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Maliki orders. They described that  organization as having a "heterogeneous" structure.    The indictments noted that one objective of the Hizballah  organization is to establish a theocratic Kurdish State in  several provinces in eastern and southeastern Turkey. Regarding  that organization's structure, the indictments outlined the  following: "It has been established that the person responsible  in each mosque describes the militants as the `mosque  community;' the militants are recruited from among those who  attend the mosques and the students who follow the Koranic  courses; the religious training given to the militants under the  guise of `religious discussions' is aimed at informing them of  the structure and functions of a fundamentalist state; the  Hizballah has organized itself in mosques in several provinces  and districts; the head of a Hizballah committee in a mosque is  named as the `person in charge of that mosque' and he is also in  charge of the area where that mosque is located; the Hizballah  militia are named as `community members;' a strict hierarchy  system and discipline exists among the militants; the  organization maintains continuity; and the person in charge of  the largest mosque in a province or district is the most  authoritative Hizballah member in that province or district."    According to the Diyarbakir State Security Court, the  Hizballah organization acquires the funds it needs as follows:  "The organization receives a share from the donations that are  made to the mosques and the Koranic courses. It also secures  funds from the organization's publications, donations from the  families of deceased people, charitable activities, fees paid  for Koranic recitations and requiems for the deceased, and  extortion from businessmen."    The Diyarbakir State Security Court has established that the  Hizballah organization recruits its militants from among the  young men who attend the Koranic courses and the  profundamentalist individuals who live in the organization's  boarding houses.</p>

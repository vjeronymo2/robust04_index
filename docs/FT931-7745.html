			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The temptation to jump ship - Why are Britain's medium-sized companies so willing to give up their independence? Berghaus is the sort of company on which Britain's economic recovery should be built. From its base on Tyneside in north-east England the company has established itself as a market leader in the field of outdoor clothing and equipment. Founded in 1966 by two outdoor enthusiasts, Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, Berghaus has grown to a turnover of Pounds 20m (nearly half overseas), pre-tax profits heading towards Pounds 750,000 and a workforce of 450 people. Despite two difficult years Berghaus has emerged as one of those elusive winners for which venture capitalists, bankers and academics search so hard. Then, suddenly, last Wednesday, weeks of speculation ended with an announcement that Berghaus's two founders were selling out to Pentland, a cash-rich sporting and consumer goods company, for Pounds 7m. By coincidence, Derwent Valley Foods, manufacturer of the Phileas Fogg snack foods and, in common with Berghaus, based in the north-east, may also be on the point of selling out. The Medomsley Road, Consett company has grown in 11 years to profits of Pounds 2m and sales of Pounds 24m, It has a workforce of 270. Roger McKechnie, chairman and managing director, says he has talked to many companies over the past few months in a search for a partner to help the company expand more rapidly overseas. There has been widespread speculation that United Biscuits, a large foods group, might buy Derwent Valley. McKechnie says nothing is excluded. Berghaus and Derwent Valley are not alone in selling out or considering a sale. British companies are so willing to give up their independence that there is a growing concern at the country's failure to create a core of independent, medium-sized businesses, what the Germans call their Mittelstand. A 1990 study, Overcoming Barriers to Growth in Small Firms, by the Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost), highlighted the rapid increase in the number of small businesses (employing fewer than 100 people) and a sharp decline in the number of medium-sized companies (employing between 100 and 499 people). A belated recognition by government and policymakers that Britain was poor at growing more substantial businesses has forced a refocusing of business support initiatives. The government's planned network of business advice centres or 'one-stop shops' is to concentrate on the established small and medium-sized businesses. Why cannot these medium-sized companies make it on their own? Their US and German counterparts, by all accounts, grow far larger without compromising their independence. The reasons are many but several main strands emerge: Finance. British companies are over-dependent on short-term bank loans and often reluctant to sell equity. This acts as a constraint on growth. When venture or development capital is used, it too, has its limitations. The venture capitalist may be unwilling to increase his exposure to a particular company or business sector. Venture funds make most of their profits by 'exiting' from their successful investments, not by continually putting in fresh funds. Venture funds with a 10-year life, the most common form of venture capital organisation in the UK, come under pressure to realise investments as they approach their deadline for winding up, notes David Cooksey, chairman of Advent, a venture fund. Berghaus had been looking for additional finance for about 18 months to finance further expansion overseas. 'We were being held back from pursuing some markets,' says Lockey. Management skills. The challenges posed by expansion often demand more than the founders can give. 'Growth creates major management and organisational problems,' say the authors of the Acost report. They point out the need for a balanced managerial team combining marketing, financial and technical skills. 'Different skills are needed to take a business to the second stage,' comments Malcolm Hay, corporate finance partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young. Sometimes the inability of the founding entrepreneur to delegate becomes a barrier to growth while, even if the founder accepts the need to expand his management team, incorporating new managers can be a significant drain on the time of existing staff, Acost notes. 'It is not just finance we need,' says Derwent Valley's McKechnie. 'If we went naively into Europe we would be ripped off.' Linking up with a larger company would provide finance and expertise, he says. The founders' ambitions. Most people who set up in business have no intention of growing to any size. They are content if their business provides them with a comfortable living. 'Sixty per cent of people who start businesses do not want to grow,' comments Barrow. Lockey denies running out of energy to run Berghaus but he and Davison are retaining the shop where the company started. The LD Mountain Centre has a turnover of Pounds 1m and employs 14 people but Lockey says he has plans to expand. Selling out is not the only option open to the founder manager wondering whether he can manage the next stage in his business's growth, though it is the most common route. He could decide to stay on and pace the growth. This can pose problems, too. One business owner rejected an offer of venture capital only to find his managers became frustrated with the slow rate of progress, recalls Colin Barrow, head of the enterprise group at Cranfield School of Management. A year or so later the managers resigned, raised their own venture capital and set up in competition with their former employer. 'Managers want to work for companies which grow quickly. It looks better on their CVs.' Founder managers must also make sure that they do not miss the opportunity to get out at the most favourable time. Technology develops so rapidly that a company's competitive advantage can be lost if it does not move quickly while competitors will be quick to exploit gaps in a market. The volatility of the UK economy also provides an incentive for entrepreneurs to get out while the going is good, says Graham Bannock, a small firms consultant. 'The situation is so unstable that they give in to the temptation to accept an offer. They might never get another because the economy may have gone into recession again.' Flotation is another option though the illiquidity of small company shares has made this less attractive over the past five years. The London Stock Exchange's plans to close the Unlisted Securities Market in 1995 will further narrow options. The result could be that more companies succumb to an offer from a trade buyer. But does it matter that medium-sized companies lose their independence as long as the purchaser manages them well and gives them the funds they need? Yes it does, according to Acost and other studies. Smaller, independent businesses are better than large ones at developing new technologies. They can respond more flexibly to changing market demands and can bring new products to market more quickly and cheaply than large firms. They also ensure a greater range of choice and make for healthy competition. There are also implications for regional policy. Areas such as the north-east, which have attempted to rebuild their economy by supporting indigenous businesses, are concerned at the loss of local control. 'Independent companies are a vital part of the market system,' says Cooksey. 'But they are not sacrosanct and takeovers are a means of industrial renewal. There is nothing wrong with large companies taking over medium-sized ones provided other small companies come along to take their place.'  --------------------------------------------------------------- BARRIERS TO GROWTH FACING THE MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANY  --------------------------------------------------------------- Ranked by order of significance  ---------------------------------------------------------------  1.

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan, US settle flat glass dispute - Tokyo to monitor distribution networks but avoids numerical targets Japan and the US yesterday settled a long-standing trade dispute over Tokyo's flat glass market by agreeing measures to improve foreign access. Japan's flat glass market had been one of the last unresolved issues in the bilateral framework trade negotiations launched a year and a half ago. Vehicles and vehicle parts remain the most pressing dispute. To the clear satisfaction of the Japanese government, the agreement is in line with its insistence that numerical targets not be used and that all benefits be on a most favoured nation basis. 'Japan and the US, which make up 40 per cent of the world's GNP, have great responsibilities in managing the world economy,' Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade and industry minister, said yesterday as he announced the agreement. 'Our government will continue to reject managed trade and will continue to contribute to the world free trade system through the transition to World Trade Organisation and the Japan-US framework talks,' he emphasised. Mr Hashimoto was referring to US demands that the Japanese government agree to set specific targets for foreign market access, which Japan has criticised as akin to managing trade. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy trade representative, said although were no numerical targets the pact was explicit that the opening of the distribution system should proceed progressively and that 'token changes' with increased imports from overseas Japanese affiliated companies would not be sufficient. Ms Barshefsky said the deal would be monitored by a 'complex data system' overseen by Miti. 'The agreement ensures that Miti will have a direct role with respect to helping insure that the diversification process takes place.' The flat glass dispute arose following US claims that the Japanese market was, in all practical respects, closed to foreign suppliers as a result of the dominance of three large producers and their close relations to the country's wholesalers. A broad agreement on flat glass trade was reached at the end of September when the two countries agreed on measures to improve foreign access to Japanese government procurement programmes and the insurance market. However, the issues of numerical targets and foreign suppliers remained unresolved. Yesterday's agreement calls for the Japanese government to use foreign-made flat glass products in construction projects which it funds. Such projects would introduce the benefits of foreign glass to a wider Japanese audience. Mr Steve Farrar of Guardian Industries, one of the largest US glass producers, said the agreement was 'a good deal' because Japan's distribution system would be 'opened up'. He was also pleased that Japan would need to demonstrate that Japanese manufacturers and distributors had fulfilled their statements of intent. The issue of capital affiliation of foreign companies which increase their imports to Japan, another sticking point, was also resolved to Japan's satisfaction. 'I would like to stress that we have consistently carried out our position of observance of basic free trade principles and international trade and investment rules ensuring national treatment,' Mr Hashimoto said. The US had been concerned that overseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies would be the main beneficiaries of any increase in glass imports and had been calling for a way to identify the capital affiliation of importers. Japan argued that this would discriminate against Japanese subsidiaries and other foreign companies. Following the glass agreement, access to Japan's vehicle and vehicle parts markets is the last sectoral issue in the framework negotiations. Vehicles and parts are perhaps the most contentious issue as they make up two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan.  ------------------------------------ JAPAN'S FLAT GLASS MARKET  ------------------------------------                                  %  ------------------------------------ Domestic production           87.2 Imports US                             1.6 EU                             0.6 Others                        10.6 Total domestic consumption   100.0  ------------------------------------ Source: Miti  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley That's enough rioja. The time has come for institutions to focus on the fairness of Redland's offer for Steetley. Yesterday's final defence document is crisply written, and highlights Steetley's strengths; but at this late stage few will be convinced by the company's case for an independent future. Its argument that Redland is buying valuable market shares in aggregates on the cheap, though, merits further attention. Redland has done its level best to undermine the asset revaluation, but even with a disappointingly low figure of 394p, which is questionable on the inclusion of landfill and surplus ACT, the bidder is arguably not paying a big premium for control. Turning to the more meaningful question of earnings potential, the issue is when Steetley will again achieve the profit levels of the last five years. Given a fair wind - and assuming that landfill realises its full potential - this is certainly possible by 1994. At least a more generous cash alternative from Redland may be needed to convince doubters that it is not worth waiting to see.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and  for preservation of the national unity of Yemen are among the  most significant issues contained in the draft resolution of the  11th Ministerial Summit of the Nonaligned Movement. On 31 May,  experts began to work on the resolution, which will be presented  for final approval on 3 June.    Meanwhile, the heads of the delegations are meeting behind  closed doors in what the organizers are calling a brainstorm,  which will last into the night. In the morning, Robaina is  expected to give an address on the democratization of  international relations. Since the beginning of the summit,  numerous delegations have defended the need for radical  transformation of the UN Security Council and increased openness  in its proceedings+.    In an address before the plenum on 31 May, Robaina issued a  call to thwart efforts to turn the United Nations into an  intervention tool against underdeveloped nations. Robaina has  also conducted an intensive exchange of opinions with foreign  ministers from diverse countries. Robaina will meet today with  representatives from Kenya, Belize, South Africa, Palestine,  Algeria, and Qatar.</p>

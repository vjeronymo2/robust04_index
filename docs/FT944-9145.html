			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Dublin coalition set to fall as Spring resigns The collapse of Ireland's coalition government seemed inevitable last night as Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, announced his resignation as deputy prime minister. He said the other five Labour party ministers would also quit the Fianna Fail-led government. Mr Spring's decision came at the end of a day of high political drama in which Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minster, in a last-ditch act of political contrition aimed at regaining Labour support, had conceded his mistake in the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, to be president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan has been under fire for his department's failure to act for seven months on a request from Northern Ireland for the extradition of a priest later convicted of child sex abuse. Mr Reynolds last night seemed certain to go to President Mary Robinson to seek an early dissolution of parliament and an early general election. However, there was growing speculation that the president would use her powers under the constitution to force the parties to create a new coalition within the existing parliament. One factor is likely to be a wish to do as little damage to the Northern Ireland peace process as possible. After a day of high farce rich in rumour, Dublin was in sombre mood last night as Mr Reynolds struggled to save his political career. In a 45-minute address to the Dail, the Irish parliament, Mr Reynolds offered what he called the 'full facts, the unvarnished facts' on the extradition case. He said he acted unwisely in the attorney-general's appointment. With opposition MPs threatening to reveal new evidence to 'rock the foundations of the state', it was not until 6.45 that Mr Spring, the architect of the crisis, rose to speak for the first time in the drama. After three separate adjournments the Dail, the Irish parliament, was in its fourth sitting when Mr Reynolds conceded his error in the attorney-general's appointment. Amid speculation of a document showing official interference to block the extradition of the paedophile priest, Mr Reynolds reported that he had contacted all members of the attorney-general's office except two who are out of the country.

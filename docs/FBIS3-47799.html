The retailers have begun actively buying popular brand rice,  fearing imported rice, which will be on sale in March, will have  more low-quality Thailand-made long-grain rice as medium- and  short-grain rice imports from China will be reduced due to bad  crop.    The price of Koshihikari, the most popular brand of rice  harvested in Niigata Prefecture, for instance, has been renewing  its record high. It is traded at near 40,000 yen per 60  kilogram in a free market.    The government has decided to import more than one million  tons of foreign rice to make up for a shortage in supplies  caused by last year's poor harvest, the worst during the postwar  period.    The Food Agency told rice retailers that 30 percent of  imported rice to be on sale from March to June will be Thai  long-grain rice.    The prices of Koshihikari harvested in Ibaraki Prefecture  and  Akitakomachi of Akita Prefecture were 36,000-37,500 yen  Wednesday, up 3,000-4,000 yen from the previous week.</p>

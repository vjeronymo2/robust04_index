			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Concern for tenants of breweries - Corporate Affairs MR John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, told the Commons yesterday the Government was 'concerned' about threats made by certain national brewers to serve their tenants with notices to quit. He said the tenants involved were not yet protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1990 extending to pub tenants the same protection as other business tenants. The Act requires brewers, for the first time, to pay statutory compensation to tenants whose pubs are taken back into management, but does not become fully effective until July 1992. Mr Redwood said it was understood that most of the notices to quit had been served for the purpose of renegotiating the terms of tenancy agreements and would not ultimately lead to evictions. The Government has begun appointing advisers for the flotation of part or all of its remaining 48 per cent holding in British Telecom. In the Commons yesterday Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, said no decisions had been taken about the timing and number of shares to be sold.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The analysis uses an initial distribution of water supply reductions between agricultural users (80% of the reductions) and urban users (the remaining 20%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of three scenarios analyzed are presented in the draft RIA and are briefly summarized here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Agricultural impacts are influenced by improved irrigation efficiency, crop shifting opportunities, the size of the affected region and opportunities for water trading between agricultural districts. A range of these options was modeled, except for irrigation efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A middle range distribution of supply impacts (Scenario 2) that includes water trading between agricultural districts results in producer surplus losses (net revenue losses) of $20 million dollars on average. If trading is limited (Scenario 1), impacts are estimated to be $44 million on average. Scenario 3 illustrates the lowest cost option, distributing the water supply reductions throughout the Central Valley, resulting in producer surplus losses estimates of $8 million on average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Economic impacts were estimated for critically dry years and indicate larger economic impacts, because lower cost options are already used up in drought years. Scenario 1, where trading is limited, estimates $147 million in costs in critically dry years. Scenario 2, where trading is facilitated among agricultural districts, reduces those impacts by nearly half to $87 million in impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential impacts on the urban users were more difficult to estimate, given the less-established analytic information base. Three scenarios were developed to project the economic impacts based upon different assumptions and implementation choices. Key implementation choices analyzed include the availability of transfers, drought water pricing, a drought water bank and increased water reclamation. Additional water management choices include increased conservation, conjunctive use and other demand management programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water transfers and an efficient drought water bank are key to minimizing impacts on urban users, given increased environmental needs. In the least-cost scenario, (Scenario 3) impacts on urban users were projected to be $25 million on average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under Scenario 2, where reclamation meets urban supply needs along with a combination of drought water pricing and a more limited drought water bank, impacts are approximately $50&hyph;54 million on average. Under Scenario 1, where no drought water bank exists, impacts are projected at $80 million on average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The economic impacts of the proposals are highest in drought years, when fewer supplies are available to meet increased urban and environmental needs. Estimation of consumer surplus losses for Scenario 3 projects a continuation of the 1991 drought water bank resulting in economic costs of $70 million in a critically dry year. A combination of a more limited drought water bank and drought water pricing results in consumer surplus losses of $184&hyph;223 million for Scenario 2. Scenario 1, where no drought water bank exists, results in consumer surplus losses of $450 million in a critically dry year. However, EPA projects that these losses are not likely given the support for a drought water bank as a drought management option. Further, consumer surplus losses do not measure water bill increases in the drought case because consumers have demonstrated in drought periods that they change their water use practices rather than pay higher rates. Accordingly, an undetermined portion of these estimates is the value of inconvenience and changes in behavior during drought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the draft RIA also estimated employment impacts for agriculture associated with the implementation of these proposals. The direct employment effects were estimated to be a reduction of 99 person-years on average, but 1926 person-years in a critically dry year for Scenario 2 (water trading allowed between agricultural districts). If water trading between agricultural districts is limited, employment impacts are estimated to be higher, with 828 person years on average and 3282 person years in a critically dry year. These estimates are not predicted employment changes (e.g impacts that would effect the actual unemployment rate) because they do not account for a full labor market equilibrium analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Assessment of Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Background: The Bay/Delta estuary constitutes one of the largest habitats for fish and wildlife in the United States. The estuary supports more than 120 fish species and provides a stopover or home for more than half of the waterfowl and shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Suisun Marsh, which is within the Bay/Delta estuary, supports many rare plant and animal species. Maintenance of freshwater, estuarine, and wildlife habitat would preserve rare and endangered species; permit fish migration; and provide opportunities for commercial ocean fishing and sport fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualitative assessment: The combined proposed requirements will increase the protection of the estuarine habitat in the Delta and will benefit the ecosystem overall. In addition, the combined proposal is expected to increase biological productivity of such important resources as salmon, striped bass, and waterfowl; protect diversity of species, such as Delta smelt, longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail, that are unique to the Bay/Delta ecosystem; increase commercial and recreational fishing opportunities; and increase opportunities for wildlife observation resulting from restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

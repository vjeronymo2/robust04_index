			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS REJECT UNION  </P> <P> In a conciliatory gesture toward controversial school Supt. Cesare Caldarelli  Jr., administrators in the Ventura school district have voted more than 2 to 1  not to form a union, it was announced Thursday.  </P> <P> School principals, assistant principals, school psychologists and other  mid-level managers hope to set a good tone for the next school year by meeting  regularly with Caldarelli to discuss problems, said Terry Holts, president of  the Ventura Administrators Assn., which conducted the vote.  </P> <P> The tally for the mail-in ballot was 40 to 19. There are 80 administrators in  the district.  </P> <P> "The decision was to work with Caldarelli," said Holts, assistant principal at  Cabrillo Middle School. "This is what I personally had hoped would come out of  this."  </P> <P> Caldarelli was on vacation and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> A group of eight to 12 administrators is to meet with Caldarelli in August,  Holts said.  </P> <P> Although principals and others have met occasionally with Caldarelli in the  past, next year's meetings will be ongoing and scheduled, Holts said.  </P> <P> A facilitator from the Assn. of California School Administrators, a statewide  professional group, has been asked to serve as a mediator between  administrators and upper-level management in the 25-school district, Holts  said.  </P> <P> The facilitator will present samples of policies and procedures that are used  in other school districts to aid Ventura officials in improving communication  between Caldarelli and his administrators, Holts said.  </P> <P> "We're going to make every effort to make sure our members are satisfied with  any new policies or procedures we come up with," Holts said.  </P> <P> Asa Reaves, a professional services executive with the association's Los  Alamitos office, said representatives from the 15,000-member group are often  called in to help school districts settle labor or management disputes.  </P> <P> Unrest in the Ventura district began last fall after some administrators  complained that Caldarelli was making management decisions that affected their  jobs without consulting them.  </P> <P> Administrators were particularly upset when they received notices in March  informing them that they could be reassigned. Some administrators feared that  reassignment could lead to lower-paying jobs.  </P> <P> Teachers this month voted overwhelmingly to express no confidence in Caldarelli  and ask the school board to remove him. Ninety-three percent of the teachers,  or 524 of the 660-member Ventura Unified Educators Assn., supported the  no-confidence vote.  </P> <P> However, blue-collar employees, including supervisors of maintenance workers,  skilled laborers and bus drivers, sent a letter expressing support for  Caldarelli.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposing sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh front  line have refrained from launching intensive combat operations.  However, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army Press  Service has disclosed that over the past few days Azerbaijan has  violated the relatively peaceful situation. That republic's  military forces have been firing on the NKR defense positions.  For example, this morning Azerbaijani units fired on the NKR  positions in the northeastern part of the confrontation lines  with mortars. The Armenian side remains committed to the  cease-fire agreement and has held back from returning the fire.    Meanwhile, the Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Service  has  disclosed that the relatively peaceful situation in the  northeastern part of Armenia was disrupted again yesterday. The  defense positions around Vagashen in Idzhevanskiy Rayon were  fired on with infantry combat vehicles at 1405. No one was hurt.    The same source also noted that no other incidents occurred  on Armenia's border last night and this morning.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Leading Article: Brave watchdog NUMEROUS ACADEMIC studies have found either that takeovers fail to generate efficiency gains, or that the evidence of such gains is inconclusive. Yet Britain has seen successive takeover booms in which the number and value of acquisitions have risen inexorably. While there is no single explanation of this paradox, the extreme laxity of acquisition accounting is unquestionably one of the more important. So much the better, then, that the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is now embarking on an overdue clean-up. But as ASB chairman Mr David Tweedie is well aware, the power of the vested interests involved in the takeover industry is such that this could prove a make or break affair for accountancy's promising new regulatory framework. The laxity stems from the scope granted under existing rules to an acquiring company to attribute new, 'fair' values to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. There is a temptation, first, to write down the value of the acquired company's stock to unrealistically low levels, then to make provisions in advance for loosely specified rationalisation and reorganisation costs, bad debts, repairs and sundry other items. The effect is to increase the figure of goodwill arising on acquisition, which most predators immediately write off against reserves, and to boost profits artifically in subsequent years. Existing practice has, then, offered an open invitation to management to write its own profit figures. A growing market in corporate control has made the business of trading in companies seem an easy alternative to generating increased revenues from goods and services in a mature economy. The beneficiaries have been the managers of predatory companies, whose remuneration has risen to reflect growing assets and earnings; and bankers and brokers who have benefited from increased market activity in the City, two of whose leading institutions, the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange, are among the ASB's ultimate paymasters. The losers have been shareholders, especially those in the acquiring companies, and the wider economy. The ASB will come under powerful attack from those sectors of industry whose illusory profits are threatened and from the City, where real profits are at stake. It is therefore important that the government, the Confederation of British Industry and the ASB's own backers in the City recognise that the reforms will not distort legitimate business activity. They constitute an attempt to remove existing distortions that result from a wholly inappropriate set of incentives for company management. As takeover activity has increased, the economic significance of those distortions has become greater. The ASB deserves every support in promoting a supply-side reform whose technicality belies its considerable importance to the economy.</p>

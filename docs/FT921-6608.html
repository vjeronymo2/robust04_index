			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Mining wins substantial concessions SUBSTANTIAL concessions were offered to the mining industry in an attempt to boost flagging exploration and development. The economic statement, delivered by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, announced abolition of the 50 per cent Australia equity requirement for new mines, and of the economic benefits test for acquiring existing mines. The government also increased the threshold of foreign investment screening to ADollars 50m (Pounds 21.4m). The new threshold applies to all mining proposals except uranium, where the limit of three mines continues. Foreign investment proposals of less than ADollars 50m, including those in the mining sector, would be automatically approved unless the project were judged against the national interest. In considering whether a mining proposal was against the national interest, the government would give weight to downstream opportunities and value-added processing. Mr Keating announced removal of export controls on iron ore and the introduction of 'life of mine' approval for mineral sands projects. The statement addressed problems for mining arising from the Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act, used to stop or delay projects. The government is to act immediately to streamline procedures for assessing heritage concerns at local, state and federal level.</p>

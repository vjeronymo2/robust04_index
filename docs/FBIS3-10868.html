			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado and Ignacio Nunez] </F>   [Text] Somewhere in the jungle (Chiapas) -- Subcommander  Marcos has said the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has  not reached any agreement or negotiated peace with Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis; it has only participated in a  dialogue. He noted that, although the peace commissioner for  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and Bishop Samuel Ruiz,  mediator in the talks, have both said agreements, pacts, and  understandings have been reached through negotiations, this is  not true.    "The problem the (Indian Revolutionary Clandestine)  Committee  [CCRI] sees is that the government is saying agreements or pacts  have already been reached, that an agreement was reached as a  result of the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, and that  the only thing pending is its ratification, which is false,"  said subcommander Marcos, who headed the EZLN delegation at the  negotiations.    "The committee simply appointed delegates to participate in  a  dialogue, not to negotiate. We attended the dialogue, presented  the demands from the members of our organization, and received a  reply. Based on that reply, the committee must decide the next  step.    During an interview granted at an EZLN camp in the jungle,  Subcommander Marcos said this confusion has delayed  consultations with the Indian grass roots organizations. He  added that creating false expectations about peace would not be  fair. "It would seem that the only thing pending for a peace  agreement is a signature, which is not the case. Peace is  further away than one could imagine," he added.    He said the CCRI members will study the EZLN proposals and  the peace commissioner's replies in the next few days. Then,  they will evaluate both and will begin consultations in order to  reach a consensus. Subcommander Marcos said the committee will  also evaluate the delegates' conduct, and if anyone acted  improperly he will be punished.    "That is the most serious problem right now. There have been  no agreements or negotiations," he said. The government has  presented it in this way with the obvious intention of forcing  us up against the wall and accepting it."    When the dialogue meeting ended at the San Cristobal  Cathedral, both Bishop Ruiz and Camacho Solis announced that 32  agreements had been reached, which only had to be ratified in  order to sign a peace agreement. "This means that if the (EZLN)  committees say they disagree with the reply or part of it, it  will seem as though we are intractable, which could be their  purpose," he stressed.    Asked why, contrary to the peace commissioner and the  mediator, he looked upset the day advancements on the dialogue  were announced. "We were upset by the way in which the situation  was being presented, as if peace only depended on a signature,  and that it was just a matter of having a few meetings," Marcos  noted. "We were upset because throughout the dialogue we  stressed the fact that we had no power of decision or  negotiation, and this could create problems for us with our  leaders. The problem was that we did not want to create false  expectations in the civilian society. [no closing quotation  marks as published]    "People could get the impression that an agreement had been  reached, that the path toward peace was completely open, which  could cause people to lower their guards or give up. We believe  there are unfavorable conditions preventing a solution to the  conflict. I am talking about other factors."    He warned that one of the factors that could extend the  conflict is the aggressiveness of cattlemen and landowners.  "Another factor is the way the government has handled the talks,  giving the impression that everything has been settled," he  added. "I am upset by the federal government's attitude, which  gives the appearance of charity. I am disgusted with government  leaders who are not complying with their duties of satisfying  demands or organizing things correctly instead of conducting  actions that seem charitable," he said.    Asked why he did not clarify the situation when a report was  presented to the domestic and international journalists at the  Cathedral, when the mediator also implied that the next step  would be the signing of the peace agreement, he replied: "The  signals you give to the peace process is very important.  Therefore, if we insisted too much on that point, we could be  portraying a warmonger attitude, and some people would say: They  really do not want peace; they want war.    "We are letting the process continue according to our logic  and our time. We did, however, make it clear to the mediator  and the peace commissioner that no agreements had been signed."</p>

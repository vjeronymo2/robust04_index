			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 4 May TASS -- Working groups of the  Commonwealth Inter-Parliamentary Assembly met in the capital of  Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan] today to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh  problems and look for ways of settling the crisis.    The meeting was opened by President Askar Akayev of  Kyrgyzia.  In his opening address the president expressed the desire to  see the meeting make "the first step towards the peaceful  settlement of the Karabakh conflict."    Taking part in the forum are Chairman of the Board of the  Inter- Parliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko, Speaker of the  Parliament of Kyrgyzstan [as received] Afiyaddin Dzhalilov,  Armenian Parliament Chairman Babken Araktsyan, representatives  of Nagorno-Karabakh lead by Karen Baburyan. Roger Janson of  Finland is attending as an observer.    On the eve of the meeting Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists  that he was attaching great significance to negotiations on the  Karabakh problem. It is impermissible for two countries both of  which are members of the Commonwealth to wage war against each  other, he said. Recently Azerbaijan agreed to recognise  Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, which marked a  considerable shift, which increases chances of success.    Afiyaddin Dzhalilov said before leaving Baku for Bishkek  that  the Azeri side regards the meeting in the Kyrgyz capital as an  important step along the path of settling the conflict.    Along with this he declared that the Commonwealth  member-states "must at last recognise that Armenia's actions are  aggressive and express due political evaluation thereof."</p>

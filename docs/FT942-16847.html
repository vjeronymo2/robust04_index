			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Mexican assassin 'acted alone' The confessed assassin of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's governing party, has claimed he acted alone and not as part of a conspiracy, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mr Mario Aburto denied the special prosecutor's account that he conspired with six other men to assassinate Mr Colosio at a Tijuana campaign rally last month. He said he did not know the other men charged with the murder, according to testimony released by lawyers. Mr Aburto's statement adds to pressure on the special prosecutor to release more evidence implicating the other six suspects. An official familiar with the investigations said Mr Aburto's statements did not surprise the prosecutors, and that under the circumstances it was expected that Mr Aburto would keep silent. The prosecutor's conclusion that Mr Colosio was the victim of an organised plot has led to wild speculation over who may have ordered his killing. Press speculation has centred on members of Mr Colosio's own party, drug traffickers, or unknown political groups.</p>

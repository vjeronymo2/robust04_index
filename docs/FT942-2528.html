			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Suspect - but I wasn't told On August 18 1988, I bought 2,000 shares in Trilion plc (an independent television production company). As of March 17 1989, this firm had Pounds 25m in cash for the sale of Limehouse Studios on Canary Wharf in east London. I have been in touch with (the industry regulatory bodies) Fimbra and Lautro but it appears Trilion plc was not a member of either. I bought the shares through a firm in Norfolk which was a Fimbra member but left on May 14 1992. I learnt only recently that it should have told me Trilion plc was not registered with any back-up organisation and that I risked losing all my investment should Trilion go out of business. It did not give me this information, however. Is there any action I can take to recover my money? Huge debts forced Trilion into receivership in December 1992 and we regret that your former shareholding is worthless. To advise you on whether you have any ground for action against the Norfolk firm, we would need to know the nature of your relationship with it. If you were asking it merely to act as an execution-only broker, then your investment in Trilion can only be written off as a bad loss. If, on the other hand, it had a specific discretionary investment management agreement with you, and specifically disobeyed instructions not to invest in such small companies, then you might well have a right of action. Unfortunately, Trilion was a sad example of a small company not surviving in tough industrial conditions. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

He told the  ZIANA news agency: "I know it's in the process. But I don't  know if the application has been formally lodged with the  Zimbabwe Government." Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan  Shamuyarira could not be reached for comment.    Mr Michael told a press conference last week his government  had been angered by recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he  defended his rule in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his  ruling circle for his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by  "imperialist circles". The Zimbabwe Government also expressed  displeasure at the statements.    Mr Mengistu was granted political asylum in Zimbabwe with  his  wife and children about 30 months ago on condition he did not  engage in any political or public activity.</p>

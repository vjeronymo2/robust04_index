			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Picking themselves up, dusting themselves off: Relief co-ordination in LA Arnold Newman considers himself fortunate. 'No tears have been shed in my family,' he says. His hillside home in Sherman Oaks, a suburban community in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los Angeles, is still standing. His wife and eight-year-old daughter are alive. Like tens of thousands of residents of Los Angeles, however, the Newmans' lives were torn apart by this Monday's pre-dawn earthquake. On Thursday, they joined about 500 others outside the Van Nuys Recreation Center to wait for the opening of an emergency aid centre set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). The Newmans need help. Their home is still standing, but the earthquake damaged the roof, ripped plumbing from the walls and wrecked the interior. Mr Newman's business - a pet store in a local shopping centre - was also hit. 'We are being allowed in to feed and water the animals, but that is all.' City officials have closed the shopping centre, pending an inspection by engineers. But Mr Newman's hopes are high: he believes he might qualify for a small business low-interest loan. He is encouraged by reports that the Clinton administration will 'cut through bureaucratic red tape' and start writing cheques within the next seven to 10 days to people in need. 'I have to pay staff salaries, and for clean-up crews, and buy new stock. I am out of business unless I can get help here. And perhaps they can help me to make the house livable,' he adds. Since the earthquake, the Newmans have been sleeping in their car. Inside the makeshift emergency centre, one of 11 that has been opened in Los Angeles, officials from a myriad of public agencies - federal, state, county, city and local - are setting up tables and stacking application forms. All the agencies should work together, President Bill Clinton urged during his visit to Los Angeles this week. James Lee Witt, head of Fema, which is spearheading the relief co-ordination effort, is determined to avoid the confusion and delays for which the agency has been widely criticised in the past. Months after the Loma Prieta earthquake that hit the San Francisco area in 1989, victims were still waiting for aid. Already, he has announced plans to advance emergency funds to victims of about Dollars 400m. Next week, he promises, the administration will seek congressional approval for a 'supplementary appropriation' likely to be billions of dollars. First, however, he must have 'a realistic assessment of losses'. Making that assessment is not easy. Insurance industry experts suggest that total property losses may top Dollars 7bn. California Governor Pete Wilson has suggested a 'ballpark' figure of Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn. Mr Witt's priority is to provide emergency help for about 20,000 people sleeping in city parks and cars. Working with the Red Cross, Fema is setting up temporary shelters in schools, churches and any suitable building still standing. Water supply systems come next. Two large aqueducts that bring water into the San Fernando Valley have ruptured. Mains have cracked and pipes are broken in thousands of places. It may be weeks before full service is restored and months before the water supply system is repaired. 'After we solve the distribution of water, housing is going to be the most pressing human problem,' Mr Witt predicts. Thousands of Los Angeles residents have found temporary accommodation in the homes of relatives and friends, and so the full extent of the problem is unclear. Schools, hospitals and other public buildings also need attention. About 100 schools are badly damaged; public libraries are teetering and government offices wrecked. 'We have got to get the children back to school,' says Senator Barbara Boxer, 'so that they can begin to see some normalcy in their lives.' Three hospitals have shut. Highways and bridges have collapsed. Already, work has begun on demolishing sections of the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways. But it will take a year to rebuild them, state officials say. Few believe such optimistic projections: repairs to highways have yet to be completed four and a half years after the Loma Prieta quake. While the immediate needs are obvious, the long-term effects of the earthquake on southern California's economy are more difficult to assess. Already suffering from the cuts to its vital defence industry after the end of the cold war, the 1992 riots and last summer's fires, Los Angeles has had more than its share of recent misfortune. Tourism, an Dollars 8.25bn industry in the Los Angeles area, is expected to take the hardest hit as visitors go elsewhere. However, attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios were back in operation 24 hours after the earthquake and only 450 of the 91,000 hotel rooms in the region are uninhabitable, say tourism officials. Co-ordination among government agencies - whether it be advising would-be visitors or handing out emergency aid - will be crucial in the months ahead. So far, it is going well, officials say. 'I've never seen better co-operation between different levels of government,' says Governor Wilson. Yet Dick Andrews, director of the State Office of Emergency Services, says there will be many difficulties. 'There are tangible actions that are taken in the first hours and days after a disaster. People can see their government in action. Then the problems become more intractable. There is a tremendous opportunity for all of us to begin to find fault with the efforts of others.' Frustration and fear form a volatile mix. Many people leaving the emergency centre in Van Nuys on Thursday are angry. 'All we got is an application form and an appointment to come back next week. What good is that?' complains one man. 'They just don't understand. How am I going to feed the baby?' cries a young mother. For Mr Newman, however, the visit is worthwhile. He will fill in the loan application and hope for the best. In the meantime, talking about his experiences seems to help. 'It took us almost 20 seconds to get out of the bedroom. We were bouncing off the walls. We had broken toes and bloody feet  -from the broken glass.' In the early-morning light, he and his family became aware of the devastation. The three-storey house on top of the hill had collapsed to one storey. Their neighbours, miraculously, were unscathed. Others were not so lucky. Two other homes had slipped down the hill. Firemen were attempting to extricate a trapped woman. 'I asked if I could help and they said fine, so long as I didn't let her know that her husband and child were dead. We are so grateful to be alive,' says Mr Newman.</p>

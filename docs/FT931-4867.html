			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CCS seeks backing for capital reconstruction plan CCS GROUP, the Staffordshire-based building materials company, is planning a capital reconstruction which, if approved by shareholders and the High Court, will lead to a resumption in the trading of its shares on the USM. The shares were suspended at 2p and receivers called in during July 1991. The latest accounts, for the year to end-October 1992, showed that CCS has accumulated losses of Pounds 4.95m. These will be eliminated and a reserve of Pounds 17,000 created by a reconstruction which has two principal elements. The first relates to bank borrowings. Lloyds Bank is consolidating all its lending and accumulated interest into one loan of Pounds 351,801. Midland Bank, owed Pounds 911,974, is converting Pounds 300,000 into preference shares carrying interest of 7 per cent initially and redeemable in five tranches from 1996 and converting Pounds 100,000 into loan stock, while writing off the balance. The second element relates to the ordinary shares which have a nominal value of 20p. CCS plans to reduce their value to 2p, by sub-dividing each one into a 2p ordinary and an 18p deferred share and then cancelling the latter. The share premium account of Pounds 624,000 will be cancelled. CCS is now reduced to one trading subsidiary, G Blagg, which is operating profitably.</p>

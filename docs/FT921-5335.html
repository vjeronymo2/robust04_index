			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / IoD urges radical economic reform COMPANY directors yesterday urged an incoming government to adopt sweeping economic reforms based on the application of market forces and the eventual abolition of income tax and other direct taxes. The Institute of Directors published its 112-point programme as a challenge to the main political parties as they prepare their election manifestos. The tone of the document is uncompromising. It advocates a free market economy untrammelled by subsidies or any government interference. Among the more provocative recommendations are the abolition of capital gains and inheritance taxes as well as income tax, the privatisation of all remaining state-controlled enterprises - including motorways  - and the introduction of tax relief on health insurance and private education. The document only has a prospect of acceptance by a Conservative administration. Even there, support could be less than total. The institute, under Mr Peter Morgan, its director-general, and his predecessor Sir John Hoskyns, is regarded as one of the more influential policy organisations of the right, although it has no direct political affiliation. However, there is an assumption that Mr John Major is not as keen on some of the IoD's ideas as was Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Morgan said at a London press conference yesterday that a refocusing of the balance between government, markets and the individual was the theme of the document. 'It outlines what company directors want the new government to do and what they do not want it to do.' He said: 'Their adoption will create favourable conditions in which directors can lead their businesses and create wealth. The prosperity of everyone in the UK depends on their success.' A complete overhaul of the tax system would include establishing a single rate of income tax. This would fall to 20p in the next parliament and subsequently be abolished altogether. The cost of abolishing a range of direct taxes would be met by limiting the growth of public expenditure to half the growth in the economy. Two new government departments are advocated, one for the market, based on a reformed Trade and Industry Department, and the other for human resources, responsible for ensuring education, training and employment policy is geared to individual needs. David Owen writes: Labour last night called on Mr Major to make clear which of the institute's proposals enjoyed Conservative support, warning that voters would 'seriously suspect' the manifesto was the party's 'secret agenda'.

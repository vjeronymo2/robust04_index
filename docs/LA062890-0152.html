			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS PLANS FOR NEW FIRE STATION  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday approved plans for a new fire station and police  community service center on the south side of town.  </P> <P> The city has been planning for four years to replace the old station, which was  built almost 50 years ago on the corner of Date Street and Greenwood Avenue,  but has not had the money, Fire Chief Robert Fager said.  </P> <P> The old station was small and run-down, and fire personnel had been living in a  trailer in the back yard for about three years.  </P> <P> Fager said the new station would house one engine company and two paramedics,  along with a fire prevention bureau and emergency preparedness team. A  community service department of the Montebello Police Department will also  share the $1.4-million building.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to be completed late next fall.  </P> <P> "It's been a long time coming, and I know the firefighters are anxious to move  into a new station house," Fager said.  </P></p>

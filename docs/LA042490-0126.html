			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BARITONE WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND  </P> <P> Baritone Thomas Hampson has become the darling of the public and the critics.  The 34-year-old Spokane native, who sings a recital tonight at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa and on Thursday at Ambassador  Auditorium in Pasadena, has made a meteoric rise to success ever since local  audiences and press spotted him in the early '80s.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, Hampson is the first to downplay his stardom status and the cult  of personality arising around him.  </P> <P> "Somehow I feel we've gotten off the track and have started to become voice  fanatics," Hampson said in a recent phone interview from New York, where he was  singing Dr. Falke in Johann Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" at the Metropolitan  Opera.  </P> <P> "In and of itself, that is fun and exciting, but the notion of singing is much  more than a human voice in a costume. It should be a very personal experience.  That's my definition."  </P> <P> Hampson has succeeded in making it a personal experience whether singing opera  or lieder, and he rebels against the idea that a singer must chose between one  form or the other.  </P> <P> "The business of singing lieder should not preclude the business of singing  opera, and vice versa," he said.  </P> <P> "What I think has happened and is happening in the business of music -- which  is a business -- is the specialization or the compartmentalization of singers.  I just don't want to be classified, and singers should not be. They should not  become a commodity or a product."  </P> <P> Los Angeles audiences have heard Hampson in a number of recitals, but haven't  seen him on the stage of the Music Center Opera since he sang Marcello in  Puccini's "La Boheme" there in 1987. An account of professional disagreements  between Hampson and LAMCO general director Peter Hemmings recently surfaced in  the press.  </P> <P> "That's almost getting blown out of proportion," Hampson countered.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is, folks, Los Angeles (Music) Opera Company has a repertory  and Mr. Hemmings has got the right to run an opera company as he wants to run  it.  </P> <P> "Also, it's not unusual, it's not possible to come every year to Los Angeles,  even if I had the desire to. I don't want to throw a bowl of water in Mr.  Hemming's face. . . .  </P> <P> "No, I haven't been invited back. Were there differences? Apparently so. Are  there hard feelings? Apparently so. Not on my side. I would very much like to  sing opera in Los Angeles, as much as anywhere else. But I don't want to make  it an issue."  </P> <P> Hemmings did not return repeated phone calls.  </P> <P> "One of the downsides of this fast-track and great rise -- I hate that -- to  some stature is that there is a great deal of shuffling and rescheduling. San  Francisco Opera, thank goodness, saw that and were very good at that."  </P> <P> One can see how Hampson might run into conflicts with certain opera directors  and producers, especially those producers whom he describes as having "mainly  theater backgrounds (who) are amused by opera and want to show us how drama  works. . . .  </P> <P> "I believe that theater is illusion," Hampson said.  </P> <P> "The notion of realism in theater sometimes gets confused with the basic art  form, which is the creating of illusion. The creeping into realism -- which is  a direct influence from TV and films, less so from the theater -- will probably  always be the big problem of opera. You must be able to express vocally the  essence of the piece, which sometimes is incongruous with what a person looks  like."  </P> <P> Certainly, no one has ever complained about what the strappingly handsome  Hampson looks like. But Hampson deflects attention from such superficialities.  </P> <P> "I feel that I'm in the best position to speak honestly," he said.  </P> <P> "If I do not get any farther in the music business, if the flavor of the month  turns to be something -- someone -- else, not me, as it inevitably will, I will  be very happy.  </P> <P> "American singers have nothing to be ashamed of," he added. "This crisis we  keep hearing about in the musical world -- where are the great singers? --  simply reflects the world in general.  </P> <P> "Where are the great personalities? Where are the great thinkers? Is mediocrity  becoming the great king? Is getting along more important than striving for  something? Those are the great questions. . . ."  </P> <P> Still, were there no personal sacrifices on the road to fame?  </P> <P> "I was married," he said. "I am divorced. One, I don't want to talk about it.  Two, I don't want to blame that on my career. Not at all.  </P> <P> "(My career) has not taken a (personal) toll. Quite the contrary, it has opened  my life and soul.  </P> <P> "I feel I'm a better person. I feel that everything that has happened -- and is  happening -- to me personally -- the deeper I go into repertory, into more  singing, research, programming -- is really an inner path of opening and  awareness to myself.  </P></p>

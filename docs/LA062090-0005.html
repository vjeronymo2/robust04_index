			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINDEXTER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR ROLE IN IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL  </P> <P> Give me a break! Poindexter deliberately subverted the will of our elected  government, the U.S. Congress. He did this for his own political ends and  nothing more.  </P> <P> These people involved in this Iran-Contra scandal committed acts that border on  treason. It seems incredible then that the harshest jail term (in fact, the  only jail term) is a mere six months. Isn't this the era when we're supposed to  "get tough" on criminals?  </P> <P> The judge feels that poor Poindexter has suffered enough in legal costs (Part  A, June 12). It obviously paid off for him.  </P> <P> And maybe less obvious, but surely apt: This looks convincingly like another  case of rich, white men taking care of their own. From the President on down to  the sentencing judge -- what a sham!  </P> <P> Where is the justice when I can count on spending a few years in jail if I get  caught taking drugs to numb my mind to this kind of hypocrisy.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SANCHEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

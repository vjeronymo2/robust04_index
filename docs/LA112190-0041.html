			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO BOY, 3 1/2, IRAQ IS LED BY 'SADLY INSANE'  </P> <P> An Air Force sergeant's 3 1/2-year-old son has come up with a nickname for  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that has the White House laughing.  </P> <P> It took Pam Averill a minute to figure out what her son, Kyle, meant when he  said, "Sadly Insane took Daddy away."  </P> <P> Kyle's father, Sgt. Kenneth Averill, was shipped from Maine to Saudi Arabia in  August after Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait.  </P> <P> "He has heard us talking and it's hard for a little kid to say 'Saddam  Hussein,' " said Pam Averill, who is living with her parents while her husband  is away.  </P> <P> Kyle's grandmother, Joyce Austin, wrote President Bush to let him in on the  joke. A typed reply from the White House carried the handwritten note at the  end: "Sadly Insane? I love it."  </P></p>

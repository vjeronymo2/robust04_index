			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the statutory language included in section 612 is written broadly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for a reasonably comprehensive evaluation of substitutes that will be introduced as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements for ozone-depleting chemicals. However, additional clarification is presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below to further explain the Agency's definition of a ``substitute'' in specific circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on section 612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemicals already listed under TSCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612(e) explicitly requires producers of chemicals, both new and existing, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the Agency before introducing such chemicals into interstate commerce for significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new uses as class I alternatives. In addition, section 612(c) requires the Agency to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes, without regard to the status of each chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, whether new or existing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These interrelated provisions of section 612 serve as the basis for the Agency's belief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all substitutes, whether ``new or existing'' chemicals, should be subject to SNAP review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulatory purview would thus necessarily extend to those chemicals already listed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the TSCA inventory of existing chemicals. EPA believes SNAP review is critical for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals given the differing statutory objectives of TSCA and the CAA, and the new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded applications of many existing chemicals as class I and II replacements, which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alter existing release and exposure profiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significant new use of existing alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There has also been some question regarding whether an existing alternative already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being sold commercially within a SNAP sector (e.g., use of semi-aqueous cleaners in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronics industry) would be subject to review under section 612. The Agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it should be subject to review under SNAP. Because of the phaseout, uses of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes can reasonably be expected to increase significantly beyond current consumption,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which could translate into greater releases and risks from use of a substitute. Existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes are therefore subject to SNAP review because EPA believes that their use can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to significantly expand to new users or product lines. Users should note that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP determinations discussed in section IX of this final rule demonstrate that with few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, all substitutes already on the market meet the conditions for acceptability under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Authority to review substitutes for class II compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612(c) authorizes the Administrator to prohibit the use of substitutes for class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II, as well as class I substances, and requires the Agency to compile lists of substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II as well as class I compounds upon making the requisite findings. EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is in part because of the considerable overlap in sectors that use class I and II substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More importantly, this mirrors the statute's general emphasis on moving away from class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds in a way that does not create new and unintended environmental problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clearly, for the same reasons class I substitutes require review under the SNAP program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II substitutes should also be reviewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To obtain the data necessary to analyze class II substitutes, the Agency is using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory authority provided in sections 114 and 301 of the CAA in conjunction with 612(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the NPRM, these sections, when read together, authorize the Administrator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate such regulations as needed to require companies to provide information EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably need to identify acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for class II substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is exercising this authority to subject class I and II substitutes to the same information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements and listing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation of class I and II chemicals as substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that review authority under section 612 extends also to use of class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and II chemicals as substitutes, even though these chemicals are subject to the phaseout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the CAA. While one comment received by the Agency in response to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM questions EPA's authority under section 612 to review class I and II chemicals as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes (e.g., methyl chloroform used to replace CFC&hyph;113), it is clear that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds can be used as substitutes for other class I and II substances in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. Since section 612 authority extends to ``any'' substitutes, both class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are subject to review under the SNAP program just as any other substitute. Given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential for the class I and II chemicals used as substitutes for other ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals to continue depleting stratospheric ozone and thus affect human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment, a close examination of these alternatives in the context of both their effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment and the availability of other substitutes for particular uses is especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted under section 612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative products and manufacturing processes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that section 612(c) broadly charges EPA to identify alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone-depleting substances. For example, EPA believes that alternative products can include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no-clean fluxes in electronics manufacturing processes that currently use class I or II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds as cleaning solvents. EPA believes it appropriate to consider substitute processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and products for review under the SNAP program, since many of these alternatives are viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes and could reduce overall risks to human health and the environment. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that such alternative products and processes, therefore, fall within the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes under section 612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, new production techniques and/or processing equipment are important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developments that can minimize environmental releases. Accordingly, alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing processes will also be examined under section 612 in the context of use and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of substitutes. EPA believes that section 612's reference to ``alternative,'' instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alternative substance,'' or ``alternative chemical,'' implies a statutory intent that ``alternative''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be read broadly. This furthers the statutory desire to shift use to alternatives that reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

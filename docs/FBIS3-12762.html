We laid the foundation of the  new Islamic regime on the basis of the strong faith of our  nation and on the leadership of Grand Ayatollah Imam  Khomeyni--the blessing of God be upon him--as well as on  welfare, security, peace, health, and a life coupled with the  spirituality of mankind. We have suffered many hardships in  this respect. After a 15-year struggle, we now continue, more  than in the past, our human and Islamic efforts in the Islamic  Republic regime, and we have painted a very bright and dignified  future. It is hoped that the two countries relations will  expand further in the interest of the two nations. Expressing  gratitude for the message sent by you, I wish from God, glorious  is his glory, the success and health of your excellency and the  prosperity of the Muslim Afghan nation.</p>

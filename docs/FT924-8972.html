			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Conservatives sell their birthright: Dominic Lawson says that in the week's key vote the government betrayed property rights IN THIS week's most important vote in the House of Commons the Conservative Party, with a few notable exceptions, betrayed one of its few remaining principles. I am referring of course to the passing, on Tuesday, of the second reading of the Housing and Urban Development bill. The bill proposes that those holding the lease of any flat in the land may compulsorily acquire the freehold, at a knock-down price, regardless of both the wishes of the freeholders and any previous contract agreed between leaseholder and freeholder. The measure is a sweeping extension of the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act, a proposal of the socialist Government of Harold Wilson. That law, however, enabled only leaseholders of entire houses to expropriate their freeholders. Even then, a number of Conservative Members of Parliament did not vote against the measure. One of the leading Tories of the time, Sir Edward Boyle, asked by an irate freeholder why he did not oppose the Bill, replied in a letter of breathtaking cynicism: 'However much you and I may talk about 'robbing the rich to pay for the poor', it really is not going to help if those like myself, with narrow margins in seats whose social complexion is rapidly changing, fail to secure re-election at the next election.' Present day Tories do not even have Sir Edward's tawdry excuse: the landlord issue is not nearly as politically explosive as it was in the 1960s. The pressure for change has come largely from MPs whose constituencies cover the great central London Estates of Earl Cadogan and the Duke of Westminster. Perhaps significantly, neither of these gentlemen has the vote. Under the terms of the bill these and other freeholders can be compulsorily bought out for what is described as a 'fair market price': a sum equivalent to 50 per cent of the estimated free market value of combining the freehold and leasehold on any given property. According even to a Tory MP who voted for the bill (faithfully reported by Hansard) 'It appears in a fashion which is not related to merit or to reason, to take property assets from one party and to give them to another. It is quite clear that there is a windfall element of profit in this process of transformation. All that is being offered to the freeholder is 50 per cent of the marriage value, whereas in the commercial market it would be 80 per cent. There would be a claim for injurious affection for the rest of his estate . . .' This MP, who, as I say, cast his vote for the expropriating measure, also pointed out that the denuded freeholders were not just the likes of Cadogan and Westminster, but also the Church Commissioners and the bulk of the biggest pension funds and charities. Another Conservative MP, Sir Michael Jopling, interrupted the sponsoring Minister Michael Howard thus: 'Is the Secretary of State aware that many of his honourable friends are astonished that the present Government, of all governments, should be seeking to force people to sell their property and have freely made agreements broken by the will of the House . . . the concept of a 'fair market price' . . . will be nothing of the sort and gives great offence to many of us.' Alas, Sir Michael Jopling too found it inconvenient to stick around to cast his vote against the measure. With only (so far as I could tell) one Tory prepared to vote against the government, the bill passed its second reading with a majority of almost 70. It is easy to see how this bill fits in with the Thatcherite interpretation of a 'property owning democracy' - although Disraeli, who originated the term, would have been horrified. It is clearly designed to ensure that the middle classes - or at least those among them affluent enough to buy leaseholds in Mayfair, Belgravia and Chelsea - have more and more property assets to pass on to their children: tomorrow's electorate. The freeholders will doubtless have entertained the hope that they could have passed on the property they own to their children, just as they inherited it from their fathers. Too bad for them, it seems. During the debate ministers argued that it was legitimate to break a binding commercial contract, such as that which exists between freeholder and leaseholder, if it was in the general public interest. An interesting argument, and one which will doubtless be used by a future Labour government if and when it proposes terms for the state buyback of shares in privatised utilities.

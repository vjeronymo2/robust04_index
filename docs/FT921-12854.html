			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Sandner re-elected CME chairman MR JOHN 'Jack' Sandner was re-elected as chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for a record eighth time. Mr Sandner, who has served seven one-year terms as chairman, will now serve a two-year term under new rules approved by the CME last year. Mr Sandner is a lawyer by training and a former Golden Gloves boxing champion. He was chairman from 1980 to 1982, from 1986 to 1988, and again in 1991. He said he plans to press on with the initiatives he began in 1991 'to ensure that the CME remains the most important and innovative centre of risk management in the world.' At the CME, the chairman is elected by the board of governors rather than by direct vote of exchange members. The CME board of governors is composed of 24 representatives of the three divisions of the exchange and eight appointed outside governors. While there has been some grumbling on the CME floor about the exchange's entrenched leadership, the continuity in its top ranks has enabled it to pursue a consistent, strategic expansion of its innovative financial products.</p>

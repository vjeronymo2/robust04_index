			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Russian output halved in 3 years Russian industrial output fell 21 per cent in 1994 and is now at less than 45 per cent of its 1991 level. Light industry, machinery, chemicals and pulp and paper sectors were among the worst affected sectors although there are signs that the decline is beginning to level off. Gross domestic product is estimated to have fallen 15 per cent. Some economists have argued that the shake-out should ultimately benefit Russia's economy because it stops companies using inflationary state credits to manufacture goods nobody wants. In theory, this should enable capital to be redeployed to more productive uses. But overall capital investment fell 27 per cent between January and November and by the end of the year it is forecast to stand at just 39 per cent of 1991 levels. A budget deficit of 10.7 per cent of GDP by November and 'grossly inefficient' tax collection also resulted in underfunding of science and education. The decline in production has swollen the ranks of the officially-registered unemployed to 2.6 per cent. But this figure would possibly be five times higher under the International Labour Organisation's methodology, which takes account of 'suppressed unemployment'. The statistics from the Economics Ministry also reveal how the gap between rich and poor is widening sharply. The top 10 per cent of the population now earn 14 times the income of the poorest 10 per compared with a ratio of 5.4 times three years ago. The Russian statistics committee said inflation in December reached 16.4 per cent, bringing price increases in 1994 to 320 per cent. Inflation has been stoked by excessive credit in the summer and surging inflationary expectations. Pegging inflation back to a monthly rate of 1-2 per cent by the end of next year is the central element of Russia's 1995 budget plans, although they depend on up to Dollars 13bn of financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. However, the government's finances are coming under strain from the Chechen crisis, which some estimate is costing Rbs100bn a day. This week, Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the economics minister, said Russia could soon face a stark choice between war or reform. The rouble ended the year at 3,550 to the dollar compared with 1,247 at the start. Since Black Tuesday on October 11, when the rouble lost a fifth of its value, the currency has risen slightly against the dollar in real terms.</p>

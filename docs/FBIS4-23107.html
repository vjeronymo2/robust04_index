			<p>SUMMARY                                         As Ukraine approaches its 26 June presidential election,  candidate Leonid Kuchma, with his clear pro-Russian  identification, stands out as a frontrunner in many polls, but  his candidacy sharply divides Ukrainians by region.  Although  Kuchma's program of economic change is vague--leaving it unclear  if he would push economic reform or just defend industrialists'  interests if elected--his themes of drawing closer to Russia and  giving the Russian language a more or less equal status to  Ukrainian evoke considerable enthusiasm in Krym (Crimea),  Donetsk, Odesa, and other oblasts of the south and east, while  antagonizing the west and Ukrainian nationalists.  His stance on  Krym is still ambiguous, and with only a week or so left before  the election it is still unclear if he will soften his pro-  Russian image significantly during the campaign to lessen west  Ukrainian hostility to him.                                       END SUMMARY     Kuchma's stands favoring closer economic ties to Russia, raising  the status of the Russian language, and giving up control of the  Black Sea Fleet in return for Russian oil strike popular chords  in the east and south and reinforce his support there.  In May he  stressed that Ukrainians depend 90 percent on Russia and should  rent the Black Sea Fleet to Russia to get money for oil (Za Vilnu  Ukrainu, 31 May).  On 2 June he bragged of signing the 1993  Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian statement calling for an economic  union in order to "have common prices and eliminate customs  barriers" (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 June) and complained that  "Ukrainian media accused me of pro-Russian sentiments" (UNIAN, 3  June).  He also said that the whole Black Sea Fleet, a "decrepit  fleet" not needed by Ukraine, should be leased to Russia to get  money to buy oil (Interfax, 3 June).     Kuchma's pro-Russian positions have kept him on the defensive  during his rare campaign visits to the west.  In Lviv he was  questioned about his "pro-Russian sentiments" and insisted he  backed only economic union with Russia but "under no  circumstances, political union" (Vysokyy Zamok, 12 April).  In  Ternopil on 7 June he denied accusations that he wants political  union with Russia and a return to the ruble zone, stating that  restoring the ruble zone would "lead to loss of sovereignty"  (UNIAN, 8 June).     Hostile media are suggesting that Kuchma is shifting his  positions to fight off the accusations of being too pro-Russian.  Molod Ukrainy on 31 May contended that he has stopped advocating  federalism, acknowledging that it might lead to "26 Crimeas," and  that he has changed from supporting to opposing return to the  ruble zone.  The article argued that his statements were "enough  to baffle those present about who the real Kuchma is and who is  the politician calculating how to get as many votes as possible  in the election."  Reporter Vyacheslav Pikhovshek argued in a 9  June Vybir News Agency item that Kuchma is now trying to play  down his pro-Russian stance and has held talks with Rukh leaders,  promising Rukh some key government posts if he is elected with  their backing.     Krym     Although insisting that Krym should remain part of Ukraine,  Kuchma's statements opposing Ukrainianization and arguing that  more should be done for Krym please the Russophone population in  Krym, who probably expect to find more sympathy in Kiev if he is  elected.  When the Crimean Supreme Soviet precipitated the latest  Crimean-Ukrainian crisis by moving to restore its 1992  constitution calling for treaty relations with Ukraine, Kuchma  tried to take the middle ground, insisting that Krym remain in  Ukraine but expressing sympathy with Crimean demands and blaming  Kiev leaders for the crisis.  While defending Ukraine's  territorial integrity and criticizing the Crimean Supreme Soviet  for restoring the old constitution "without preliminary talks  with Kiev," he argued that a treaty between Krym and Ukraine is  "the only way to settle the conflict," insisted that use of force  "should be fully excluded," and blamed the crisis on intrigues by  "some Ukrainian political forces" and--apparently referring to  Kravchuk--those who want an excuse to postpone the presidential  election (Interfax in Krymskya Pravda, 28 May).  Declaring that  Ukraine's economic decline and distress are the basic causes for  pro-independence agitation in Krym, he argued that the solution  is to give Krym special status within Ukraine to speed up its  economic development (UNIAR, 1 June).  On 1 June he proposed in  the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet to grant Krym the status of a free  economic zone (Interfax, 1 June).  In Odesa on 2 June he said  "Crimeans must be given greater freedom within Ukraine" (UNIAN, 3  June).  Moloda Halychyna on 7 June quoted Kuchma as saying that  "the essence of the Crimean issue lies in the economy and not in  politics" and that Krym's agitation is a result of Ukrainian  economic collapse.     To counter Kuchma's strong appeal in Krym the Kravchuk forces  recently asserted that his actions as premier during 1992-93 had  seriously damaged Krym.  A 13 April Ukrainian cabinet statement  blaming Kuchma's actions as premier for Ukraine's present  economic decline in particular accused him of damaging Krym's  wine industry by raising taxes on Crimean wine while lowering  import duties on foreign wine and blocking development of  leaseholding, which it said had become popular in Krym (Kiev  radio, 13 April).     Kuchma's Numerical Advantage     Although polling organizations in Ukraine have not yet  established a track record of accuracy, their polls clearly  indicate that Kuchma is by far the most popular candidate in the  east and south, the areas where his Interregional Bloc for  Reforms (MBR) won Supreme Soviet seats during the March-April  parliamentary elections.  A 18-23 May poll of small samples in  ten cities showed Kuchma well ahead in the three eastern and  three southern cities included in the poll (see box).  A 23-28  May poll by the International Institute of Sociology of 1,004  people in all 25 oblasts showed Kuchma outpolling President  Leonid Kravchuk 34 percent to 12 percent in the east, 37 percent  to 22 percent in the south, and 35 percent to 26 percent even in  the central oblasts, while Kravchuk led Kuchma 40 percent to 3  percent in the west (Molod Ukrainy, 1O June).  A June poll showed  Kuchma leading in Mykolaiv with 23 percent to 19 percent for  Kravchuk and 10 percent for Socialist-Communist candidate  Oleksandr Moroz (Vecherniy Kiev, 9 June).  Of all candidates  collecting signatures in Mykolaiv to become candidates for  president, Kuchma got the most (8,380), followed by Moroz  (5,746), Education Minister Petro Talanchuk with 4,963, and  Kravchuk with 4,011 (UNIAN, 13 May).     Even with no support in the west, Kuchma has an advantage in that  his strongholds in the east and south hold close to half of  Ukraine's voters.  Absolute vote totals by oblasts for the  December 1991 presidential race and independence vote were not  published, but one can get a sense of the proportions of voting  strength of various regions by examining the allocation of  Supreme Soviet seats, which are distributed on the basis of  population.  The east and south hold 220 of the 450 seats (152 in  the east, 68 in the south)--46 percent.  The west's seven  oblasts, where nationalists and Kravchuk are strongest, have only  82 of the 450 seats--just 18 percent.  Kiev city, which tends to  vote for nationalists also, has 23 seats, which if added to the  west raises the total for nationalistic areas to 105, or 23  percent.  The main hope for Kravchuk and the nationalists is to  run strong in the many central oblasts, which have 125 seats-  -about 28 percent of the total.     Polls for Ukraine overall usually show Kuchma ahead or close  behind Kravchuk.  A nationwide poll of 1,200 people in April  showed 18 percent backing Kuchma, with Kravchuk second at 11  percent (Interfax, 30 April).  The 23-28 May poll showed 27  percent for Kravchuk nationwide, 20 percent for Kuchma, 11  percent for Moroz, 6 percent for reform economist Volodymyr  Lanovyy, and 4 percent for former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan  Plyushch (Kyivskaya Pravda, 7 June; Demokratychna Ukraina, 9  June).  Asked whom they would vote for in a Kravchuk-Kuchma  runoff, 37 percent of the respondents chose Kravchuk and 32  percent Kuchma, while 17 percent said they would vote against  both.     Outlook     With Kravchuk's popularity falling as his government takes  virtually no action to counter the continuing deterioration of  Ukraine's economy, Kuchma, one of Kravchuk's harshest critics,  has become a spokesman for the disaffected east and south and one  of the most likely to do well in the presidential race.  Although  he may have softened some of his divisive stands, it still is not  clear if he will try to reach out to the west Ukraine and  nationalists during the remaining days of the campaign or choose  to try to win over their determined opposition, and thus  exacerbate Ukraine's regional divisions.     BEGIN BOX     Mid-May Presidential Poll in Ten Cities     A poll of 100-120 respondents in each of ten cities taken by the  BOB [expansion unknown] Sociological Center during 18-23 May  showed Kuchma leading in six cities, Kravchuk in only three,  while economic reformer Volodymyr Lanovyy led in Kiev (Post-  Postup, 26 May-2 June, and 3-9 June).                   Kuchma   Kravchuk   Moroz  Plyushch  Lanovyy     East     Donetsk       40%        15%      13%     8%        7%  Kharkiv       30%         4%      14%     0        12%  Zaporizhzhya  15%         5%       2%     1%        3%     South     Mykolaiv      26%        22%      12%    10%        6%  Odesa         29%        10%      10%     5%       19%  Sevastopol    38%         3%       3%      0        3%     West     Lviv           7%        50%       3%     5%        8%  Uzhhorod      17%        22%       7%     5%        4%     Center     Kiev          21%        16%       8%     9%       23%  Poltava       15%        26%       3%     7%       23%       A 22-27 April survey by the same organization in Kiev, Lviv,  Donetsk, Odesa, and Kharkiv published in the 29 April-6 May Post-  Postup showed roughly similar results, although at that time  Kravchuk led in Kiev with 19 percent to Kuchma's 18 percent and  Lanovyy's 14 percent; Lviv respondents gave Kravchuk 36 percent,  economic reformer Viktor Pynzenyk (who has since withdrawn) 30  percent, Plyushch 16 percent, and Lanovyy 12 percent, and Kharkiv  respondents gave Kuchma 26 percent, Kravchuk 22 percent, Plyushch  11 percent, Lanovyy 9 percent, and Moroz 5 percent.

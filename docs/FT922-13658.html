			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: 'Bloody nose' at Dowding &amp; Mills THE EFFECTS of recession around the world hit Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair group, which reported a 28 per cent drop in interim profits, from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.7m. 'We are in recession and we are taking a bloody nose,' said Mr Jim Cole, chief executive. 'But I think we have performed in the depth of this recession better than many other companies have in the good times.' Outlook for the second half remained uncertain, however. 'January to March have returned to the miserable levels we experienced last year,' he said. 'We see absolutely no sign of an upturn in the UK and in most parts of the world.' Turnover fell from Pounds 41m to Pounds 38m for the six months to December 31. Mr Cole said the group had maintained gross margins, despite the drop in demand. Decline in sales was felt almost equally across the group's geographical regions. Dowding, which rewinds and calibrates engines among other activities, operates in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Australia. Expanding its international presence - overseas sales account for about 18 per cent of turnover - was one of the main reasons behind its unsuccessful bid for niche engineer Torday &amp; Carlisle last year. The Pounds 632,000 costs of the failed takeover were taken below the line. Dowding still holds 8.7 per cent of Torday. Mr Cole said the group would retain the stake, keeping its options open until Torday's annual results are published in the summer. Interest charges were 10 times covered at Pounds 382,000 (Pounds 331,000). Mr Cole said Dowding retained a strong balance sheet with gearing at 22 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 2.46p to 1.76p. The dividend is increased 'in line with inflation,' from 0.88p to 0.92p.</p>

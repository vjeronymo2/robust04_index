			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY PICKS A NON-COMMUNIST;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: EGON KRENZ RESIGNS AS CHIEF OF STATE AND MANFRED GERLACH IS  APPOINTED TO THE POST. THE GOVERNMENT APPEALS FOR CALM IN THE TENSE NATION.  </P> <P> East Germany named a non-Communist head of state for the first time Wednesday  as the government struggled to "stabilize this country step by step."  </P> <P> Manfred Gerlach, 61, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, was appointed  acting chief of state after the sudden resignation of Egon Krenz, the former  Communist Party chief.  </P> <P> "We are in a political and economic crisis and we're trying to get out,"  government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said in an interview.  </P> <P> "We are trying to cooperate with all political forces, political movements and  groups to stabilize this country again step by step," he said.  </P> <P> But tension and distrust clearly have been mounting in recent days with  widespread charges that Communist leaders amassed fortunes in hard currency  through shady deals that included smuggling weapons and art.  </P> <P> Fears that angry citizens might storm military installations prompted the  government to issue an urgent appeal Wednesday for "calm and restraint."  </P> <P> Thousands of East Germans tried to overrun offices of the hated security police  earlier this week in Leipzig and were held back by opposition groups who formed  a human chain.  </P> <P> In a statement carried Wednesday night by the official ADN news agency, the  government reported "increasing signs" of planned attacks against army bases.  </P> <P> No specific incidents or other details were provided, but the statement  included a thinly veiled warning that the soldiers are "armed and trained" to  counter any "attack from outside."  </P> <P> Army officers issued a statement, addressed to citizens and soldiers, saying:  "Such intrusions could cause danger for the security of the German Democratic  Republic. Illegal entry to weapons, munitions and fuel will be blocked."  </P> <P> The military leaders expressed "concern for securing peace" and pledged to work  with Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces to secure peace in Central Europe. "Only  together can we preserve the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic and  protect our country from anarchy and chaos," they said.  </P> <P> Government spokesman Meyer said that "everybody is worried about the growing  tension. In any such situation, there are groups which try to create terror and  violence."  </P> <P> The resignation of Krenz, 52, was further evidence that the rudderless  Communist Party is sinking.  </P> <P> Meyer said Krenz "made a lot of mistakes" since replacing Erich Honecker as  party chairman and head of state in October.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, was unceremoniously expelled from the party Sunday and is under  house arrest for alleged misuse of office.  </P> <P> "Krenz was very hesitant about deciding things, and there was pressure both  within and outside the party," Meyer said.  </P> <P> "He was choosing the wrong people. He would choose people for the Politburo who  had been rejected on the regional level in their own districts," Meyer said.  "That happened two or three times."  </P> <P> Krenz has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. The former Dresden party  boss acknowledged that he lacked public confidence.  </P> <P> "My years of membership in the Council of State and Politburo under the  leadership of Erich Honecker diminished confidence in my policy for the renewal  of socialism," Krenz said in a statement carried by the official news agency.  </P> <P> He said he was resigning "in the interest of stability."  </P> <P> Krenz warned of "anti-socialistic forces" in East Germany and called for a  joint effort to repel them. "In this hour of greatest danger, all those who  love this country must stand together out of patriotic duty," said.  </P> <P> The position of chief of state is a largely ceremonial post, and the only key  position that Krenz still held after the entire Communist Party Politburo and  Central Committee resigned.  </P> <P> Gerlach said he would serve until Parliament can elect a permanent president.  No date for that has been set.  </P> <P> Gerlach, a lawyer, quickly took up the cause of free elections and other causes  pressed by opposition leaders as the Communist Party unraveled over the last  several weeks. He demanded that the party give up its monopoly on power and  permit greater openness.  </P> <P> But he also made it clear in a television interview that "we are a party of  socialists in a socialist system. The task before us now is to define what  socialism means and how we can make it meet the needs of the people," he said.  </P> <P> Last week, the Communist-dominated Parliament ended the guarantee of the  party's leading role in society, and last weekend, the entire party Politburo  resigned.  </P> <P> The future of the party is now in the hands of a 25-member working group, which  is drafting a new program and constitution.  </P> <P> With Krenz's resignation, the group announced it will hold an emergency party  congress Friday, a week earlier than it had planned.  </P> <P> "Everything hangs on that party congress," said a spokesman for the working  group.  </P> <P> The government, headed by Prime Minister Hans Modrow, has sought to distance  itself from the tainted Communist Party.  </P> <P> Modrow, himself a Communist Party member, enjoys some measure of popular  support and has not been implicated in the corruption scandal.  </P> <P> "His image is squeaky clean," said one Western diplomat speaking on condition  of anonymity.  </P> <P> Government spokesman Meyer said there is "a very clear separation now between  the party, state and government."  </P> <P> He said that under Honecker, "Everything was together and the party more or  less decided what the government had to do."  </P> <P> Modrow's government includes 11 non-Communists and 16 Communists. Previously,  only four of a total of 45 ministers were not party members, Meyer said.  </P> <P> Western diplomats said the Communist Party, which ruled East Germany with an  iron hand for 40 years, now is fighting for survival.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of fingernails left up on the edge of the cliff," said one  diplomat.  </P> <P> The government spokesman rejected speculation that East Germany's best hope for  economic and political stability might be reunification with West Germany.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has outlined a 10-step program towards such  a goal, should the East Germans desire it.  </P> <P> "For us, there is no question of reunification," Meyer said, "and I am  convinced it is not the will of the majority of East Germans."  </P> <P> NEW CZECH REGIME -- The premier threatens to quit if changes are rejected. A12  </P> <P> </P> <P> FAST FORWARD IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> After years of East German government corruption and mismanagement, hard-line  Communist Party leader and President Erich Honecker was forced to resign Oct.  18. He was replaced by Egon Krenz, a party member described as a moderate. But  he proved unpalatable to the nation's ever more militant reformers and stepped  down Wednesday. Manfred Gerlach, leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, became  acting head of state, the first non-Communist ever named to the post.  </P></p>

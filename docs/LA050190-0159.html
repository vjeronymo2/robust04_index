			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'OKTOBERFEST': PLAY IS AN INERT DEPICTION OF TROUBLED TIMES  </P> <P> Casimir and Caroline are quarreling lovers in Odon von Horvath's "Oktoberfest."  Against the backdrop of a 1933 Munich beer-drinking festival, a nihilistic  oasis from Germany's growing repression, they bicker, break up and fret over  their lives.  </P> <P> Casimir is a chauffeur who has lost his job. Caroline is a secretary who wants  to get ahead. He's moodier, an angry boy worried about the future. She's lively  and optimistic, a pretty girl who understands intuitively that feminine beauty  always rises.  </P> <P> Despite their youthful vigor, "Oktoberfest," UC Irvine's final drama offering  of the season, is not a vivid or passionate play. It's the opposite, a  deliberately drawn but surprisingly torpid work, apparently designed to show  the moral emptiness created by the social problems of Germany in the early  '30s. Von Horvath, an obscure playwright who suffered under Nazism, writes  intelligently but, here at least, it's often a bloodless experience.  </P> <P> At UCI, director Dudley Knight does little to overcome the drama's fundamental  inertness. It may be what he's after -- being faithful to von Horvath's sense  of vacuity and banality -- but the staging is problematic, leaving a production  that has intriguing patches but is less than involving as a whole.  </P> <P> Casimir and Caroline are merely symbols of the times, as is the Oktoberfest  itself, a blatantly ironic contrast to the collective anxiety of a Germany on  the verge of Nazism. Cindy Felice's set is an almost menacing cartoon of a  carnival, with surreal rides and a test-of-strength amusement in the shape of  an ominous man. This cutout seems to presage the shadowy figures who were to  emerge, from the street thugs who became the SS, to Hitler himself.  </P> <P> Caroline (Ann Hamilton) and Casimir (James Calleri) aren't the only ones moving  through this weird playground. Von Horvath also gives us Schurtzinger (Jonathan  Greenman), a young tailor and thinker who pursues Caroline. His boss is the  exploitative bigwig Rauch (director Knight), a man with large appetites,  especially where Caroline is concerned.  </P> <P> Rauch's sidekick is the corrupt judge, Speer (Patrick Healey). Casimir has his  own friends, Merkl (Mikael Salazar) and Erna (Kitty Balay), a couple of  lowlifes surviving by their wits.  </P> <P> The cast has trouble dramatizing the frequently didactic thrust of von  Horvath's dialogue. At times, an emotional tide rises -- as when Calleri fumes  over his fate, or Knight unabashedly displays his sleaziness -- but the general  feeling remains staid, at times even ceremonial.  </P> <P> The most striking scene involves a group of sideshow performers parading about  for the revelers. But this vision -- of a gorilla woman, a dog-faced boy and  Siamese twins -- is not so much disturbing and revealing as merely picturesque.  </P> <P> 'OKTOBERFEST'  </P> <P> A UC Irvine production of Odon von Horvath's drama.

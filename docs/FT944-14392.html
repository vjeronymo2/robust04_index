			<p>941022 FT  22 OCT 94 / Guardian Royal to shed 220 jobs Changes in the financial services division of Guardian Royal Exchange, the insurance group, to provide a single support unit for both its direct sales force and the sales agents who act as its appointed representatives will mean the loss of 220 jobs in the next six months. It will continue to run a separate service for supporting sales made through independent financial advisers.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / People: Allen &amp; Overy John Rink, 47, joint head of the litigation department at Allen &amp; Overy, the City-based international law firm, has been seconded to British Aerospace as its legal director for a period of 'up to two years'. Initially, his appointment will be on a full-time basis while he carries out a review of the structure of BAe's legal services, though it will not remain full-time for the whole two year period. He will be assisted by Jeremy Thomas, another Allen &amp; Overy partner, also seconded to the company during this period. His appointment follows a 'beauty parade' involving six City law firms, which was won by Allen &amp; Overy. BAe said yesterday that as the company's interests became more diverse and it became involved in more joint ventures, particularly with international partners, there was a need to re-appraise its legal services requirements. It would continue to use a number of different law firms to provide external legal services.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE EXPERIENCED IN ABUSE CASES WILL RUN BUCKEY RETRIAL  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, 46, a former deputy district attorney  and dependency court judge experienced in dealing with child abuse cases, was  named Monday to preside at the retrial of McMartin Pre-School molestation  defendant Ray Buckey.  </P> <P> "He is ready to start March 9," said Judge Gary Klausner, supervising judge of  the Los Angeles Superior Court's central criminal division, in announcing the  reassignment. He ordered both sides to meet for a "status conference" with  Weisberg on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The March trial date had been set by Judge William Pounders, who heard the  record-setting 2 1/2-year trial of Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin  Buckey, in which they were acquitted of 52 counts of molestation and conspiracy  last month. However, the jury deadlocked on 13 counts, involving five children,  against Ray Buckey, and he is being retried on those counts.  </P> <P> Klausner removed Pounders from the case last week on the recommendation of  Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff, who read arguments from the defense and  Pounders' reply. Hoff found no evidence that Pounders was biased against either  Buckey or his attorney, but said he felt that Pounders' post-trial television  appearances could present problems in selecting a new jury.  </P> <P> "The judge knows what he said and what he meant by his remarks, but would be  placed in the impossible position of interpreting what the prospective juror  thought about those remarks and perhaps the judge himself," Hoff found.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Danny Davis said Monday that he has "personal plans" that may  delay the trial, and that, while a change of venue is "unlikely," jury  selection could be time-consuming.  </P> <P> "I'm troubled," he said, by the possibility that prosecutors may be creating "a  false event," in the form of the retrial, for political reasons.  </P> <P> (Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is a candidate for state attorney general).  </P> <P> "I sense the (post-trial) publicity developed a kind of heated energy," Davis  said, noting that only a handful of counts remain and that he believes that "no  child witness is committed and available to go forward at this time."  </P> <P> Davis said Reiner had better "be certain he is going to best me at trial."  </P> <P> The defense attorney said he does not know much about Weisberg.  </P> <P> "The trial is a tar baby for anyone" who touches it, Davis said. "I hope he'll  bring a measure of objectivity and fairness" to the proceedings.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Attys. Joe Martinez and Pamela Ferrero, the two new prosecutors,  made no comment on the selection of Weisberg.  </P> <P> The son of a sheet metal worker, Weisberg was born in East Los Angeles and  attended law school at UCLA.  </P> <P> He spent 18 years as a Los Angeles County prosecutor, handling such  high-profile cases as the successful prosecution of Marvin Pancoast for murder  in the slaying of Vicky Morgan, the mistress of business tycoon Alfred  Bloomingdale.  </P> <P> He was appointed to the Municipal Court bench by Gov. George Deukmejian in  1986, and elevated to the Superior Court in 1988. He is considered intellectual  and efficient.  </P> <P> A deputy county counsel who appeared before him during his one-year stint in  the juvenile division remembers Weisberg as "compassionate."  </P> <P> "He is not a demonstrative man, but he had a lot of sympathy for children whose  lot in life is pretty grim," she said. "He was willing to listen to kids and  give them credibility and what they needed. He genuinely tried to help out  children."  </P> <P> Weisberg married Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Levit Weisberg in 1985.  </P></p>

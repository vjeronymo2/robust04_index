			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The merger between two  splinter parties announced Monday is expected to create a  considerable power shift in the nation's political opposition  camp.    Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Pak  Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party held a news  conference Monday and formally announced their parties' merger,  which first became known last week.    It is not yet clear whether their merged party will be large  enough to become a negotiating body in the National Assembly. A  party is required to have 20 or more lawmakers in order to  qualify as a negotiating group in the unicameral legislature.    At present, the United People's Party has 12 lawmakers and  the new party for political reform has one -- Rep. Pak himself.    Addressing the issue of the new party's size, Kim Tong-kil  said "a clearer picture" will emerge in a few days when current  negotiations on bringing in independent lawmakers bear fruit.    If the new party managed to secure seven more lawmakers, it  could upset the power balance that has existed ever since the  inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam in February 1992 between  the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the hitherto main  opposition Democratic Party (DP).    Some political analysts are predicting there could be a  further realignment of political forces.    Monday's announcement of the merger, expected to come in  June, falls short of expectations for a grand merger of all  opposition parties, for which "under-the-surface" negotiations  have been going on since last year.    A merger of all opposition parties, to be built around the  Democratic Party, has been envisaged by many but sources said  the negotiations apparently failed because of the DP's  "intraparty problems."    Monday's announcement, in a way, signifies that the main  opposition Democratic Party has lost the initiative to form one  large opposition group.    If the merged party became "large" by enticing independents  into the fold, it would be much more difficult for the  Democratic Party to unify all opposition forces under its  leadership as the new party would demand a merger on equal terms.    In that event, the only possible path left for the DP to  strengthen its status as the No. 1 opposition party will be to  embrace Rep. Yi Chong-chan, chairman of the New Korea Party, and  other prominent opposition politicians as individuals, analysts  said.    In any event, the Democratic Party is likely to face  considerable difficulties if it loses its label as the "only  opposition force" -- at least in the National Assembly -- with  the emergence of a second opposition party.    Realizing the precarious position they are in, many senior  DP  officials, especially those who had been advocating a grand  opposition merger, were said to be urging the party to do some  soul- searching, they said.    This, in turn, is expected to heighten factional discord  within the party, they added.    Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party is watching  developments and contemplating possible action should the newly  merged party become a second opposition negotiating group.    DLP secretary-general Yi Han-tong told a meeting of senior  party postholders Monday that the party should seriously study a  possible tripartite setup in the assembly.    As part of the study, the DLP is understood to be  contemplating wooing independent lawmakers who had bolted from  the United People's Party earlier in order to prevent them from  joining the merged party.    Among the independent lawmakers the new party is interested  in embracing are Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik,  Kim Chin-yong, So Hun and Chong Chu-il.</p>

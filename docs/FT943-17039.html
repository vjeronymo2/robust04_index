			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Lautro fines life insurer Pounds 200,000 The Independent Order of Foresters, a mutual life insurer, has been fined Pounds 200,000 by its regulator for failing to organise its business responsibly. Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, highlighted weaknesses in the suitability, training and supervision of staff, and in operating procedures to ensure that regulations were met. The charges relate to a 3 1/2 -year period from the beginning of 1990. The failures were detected by Lautro during its second round of routine inspection visits. The Independent Order of Foresters said yesterday that it was reviewing past business in some areas, including areas where Lautro had expressed particular concern that mis-selling could have taken place - the sale of whole-of-life policies and the sale of endowment policies for the benefit of children. All its new business is being reviewed by a firm of actuarial consultants. Mr Arno Kitts, the insurer's chief executive and compliance officer, said yesterday that all customers who had been disadvantaged would be fully compensated. It has about 140,000 policyholders in the UK. While the level of the fine is less than the recent Lautro records of Pounds 300,000 imposed on Norwich Union and on Premium Life, it is significant given the relatively small size of the company in the UK - a factor Lautro took into account. IOF Foresters must pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 17,000. In its last financial year to December 31 the company reported premium income of Pounds 25m and assets of Pounds 240m against liabilities of Pounds 180m. Details of the charges by Lautro and admitted by the insurer are that it failed to ensure that its sales force gave best advice to customers and to keep full records justifying the advice; that it contacted investors who had decided to cancel policies within the allowable cancellation period; and that it failed to ensure that customers had enough information about products to make informed decisions. Among changes made since the compliance problems were identified is a reduction in the size of the direct sales force, from about 120 in September last year to about 90. Mr Kitts said that about half of those leaving had decided to go and half had been de-authorised by the company. He said: 'We accept Lautro's findings and have been working with them to ensure that we have the highest standards of compliance in place.' IOF Foresters is a separate organisation from the Ancient Order of Foresters, which is a friendly society. About three-quarters of its customers are in the US, although its head office is in Canada.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani by </F> Kassab Samawi in Amman on 11 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Samawi] How will the progress made a few days ago  on the Jordanian-Israeli track affect the upcoming meeting  between his majesty the king and President Clinton?    [Al-'Anani] The climate now is far better that it was a year  or two ago, especially compared with what it was like following  the Gulf war. We think Jordanian-American relations will  develop so as to clearly advance Jordanian interests. We would  like the United States to become convinced that our political  positions have sometimes been misrepresented and our demands  distorted. We hope the Americans will also appreciate that  Jordan -- which sets store by its independence, unity, national  pride, people, and, above all, its leadership -- is qualified to  engage such a great power as the United States in a dialogue  that ensures the dignity of all sides. This is because we are  aware that the United States is now the major player on the  global scene and that it wields influence in many of the areas  that also affect us. An improved political atmosphere between  our two countries will impact Jordan positively.</p>

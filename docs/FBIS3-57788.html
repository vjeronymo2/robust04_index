Haller stressed today on Hesse Radio that  "from a German viewpoint there is absolutely no question" that  the Bundesbank's monetary policy "will be influenced in some  way" via the EMI. The state secretary said that one essential  function of the EMI will be to coordinate monetary policy  between the member states in keeping with a policy of stability,  without detriment to the autonomy of the member states. He  stressed that the Bundesbank remains "entirely free" with regard  to its monetary policy. Another function is the EMI's  preparation of a common European currency for the third phase of  monetary union, which will be realized in a few years' time.    Haller pointed out that the functions and competences of the  EMI have been finally laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. "It  goes without saying that we, and I believe the Bundesbank too,  will not allow the Institute to go beyond the competences  clearly outlined there," he stressed.    The state secretary expressed his lack of understanding for  the stance otaken by Spain, Portugal, and Greece in wanting to  exclude Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland -- the prospective  newcomers to the European Union -- from the development of  monetary union. "We cannot accept this demand from the German  point of view."    It is important for Germany that monetary union is achieved.  Open markets without monetary borders bring many advantages,  said Haller, pointing out that many German jobs are dependent on  exports.</p>

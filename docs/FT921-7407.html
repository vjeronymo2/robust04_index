			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A new code of conduct IF YOU regularly become exasperated with your bank or building society because of poor service, you will soon be able to quote from their code of customer conduct to support your case. Good Banking, the draft voluntary code for personal customers, prepared by banks and building societies working with consumers groups, appeared last December and comes into effect on March 16. Some banks will apply it directly. Others say they will issue their own codes or charters which go beyond it. Lloyds Bank was the first institution to issue its code. It has now been followed by Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, and TSB. Barclays, the largest UK bank, says it will be producing a leaflet on customer relations in the next fortnight. Midland says it will be producing a document fairly soon for its customers. Not all the codes are entirely new. Bradford &amp; Bingley has been issuing a booklet to its customers for several years, telling them of their rights. Here are some key points to watch for when your bank or building society presents its code: Charges: how transparent are they? Can you see in advance how much you will have to pay for using a bank's services? Better still, will it notify you in advance of what it is charging you? So far only TSB has promised to introduce pre-notification for customers. Complaints: whom do you make them to? How swiftly will they be acted on? How many contact names and numbers are you given? Bradford &amp; Bingley refers customers either to its branch manager or to the Controller of Secretarial Services in head office. Lloyds has a head office customer service unit which can be called at the local rate, and has installed telephone answering machines at all its branches. Customer confidentiality: This was one of the main issues when the code was being discussed. The banks now all have the technology to build up a centralised data-base on their customers and use it to cross-sell financial services: for example, to target current account customers with insurance marketing. The snag is that not only do many customers dislike being bombarded with sales material - it is questionable whether it is even legal for a bank to hold details of customers in this way unless they give their express consent. This should be clearly given at intervals, not just quietly extracted once through inertia selling techniques and then used for ever. Lloyds is taking express consent very seriously. All its customers are being asked to return a signed form agreeing to allow the bank to give their details to other companies in the Lloyds group. A sweetener is on offer: Pounds 1,500 worth of free accidental death cover for three years, provided the customer stays with Lloyds. However, it is disappointing to see that Abbey National, the retail banking group, is sending some customers a letter offering no-cost cover of Pounds 1,000 with a clause in the small print on the application which allows Abbey National to disclose information to other companies in the group and use it for marketing. Abbey National says it will change this wording after the code comes into force in March, and that information about customers is held with a central registry and not circulated to subsidiaries. Lost and stolen cards: does the code make clear that unless you knowingly let someone else use your card and PIN number, your liability is limited to a maximum of Pounds 50? Will the code change very much? Consumers' groups have already made some criticisms, but there are reasons for cautious optimism. One is that there is clear competition emerging, at least among some banks such as Bank of Scotland, TSB and Lloyds, to produce the best code. The other is that bank and building society customers are likely to be much more forceful in defending their rights now that they have clear definitions of them. Personal customer banking services should improve in the next few years as a result.</p>

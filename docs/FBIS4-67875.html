			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jelena Dabarcic report] </F>   [Text] Fighting between the Army of Serbian Republic [of  Bosnia-Herzegovina] and members of the so-called Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place on a part of the front  between Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca. The worst fighting is  taking place in the Obrecevo region and along the Drina river,  between Vitkovici and Foca, where the Muslim units are trying to  recapture the positions that they lost.    In addition to using all the available arms, the Muslims are  also using chemical agents produced in the goldsmithing plant in  Vitkovici. The Serbian military sources claim that these agents  are produced with the most primitive technology. The Serbian  fighters who crushed the strong Muslim offensive from Gorazde,  involving some 10,000 well-armed Alija's [Izetbegovic] soldiers,  are continuing to rout the Muslim forces from the torched  Serbian villages on the right bank of the Drina.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / People: Stevenson takes on Takeovers Dennis Stevenson, the violin-playing chairman of consultants SRU, continues to climb the establishment ladder. The Governor of the Bank of England has appointed him to be an independent member of the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. Stevenson, 47, who founded the Specialist Research Unit in 1972, is perhaps less well known than one of SRU's other co-founders, Peter Wallis, the sociologist who invented the Sloane Ranger tag. However, of SRU's three founding partners - the other is Colin Fisher - Stevenson is credited with having the best access to the boardrooms of SRU's blue chip clients. SRU, a market research-based strategic consultancy, employs 45 staff. Apart from being chairman of the Trustees of the Tate Gallery, Stevenson sits on several boards, including Pearson (owner of the FT), Manpower Inc, Thames Television and J Rothschild Assurance. As a non-executive director he is probably best remembered for standing up to Tony Berry, the founder of Blue Arrow, during the infamous Blue Arrow affair. Stevenson, who was just 26 when he was given his first public job - the chairmanship of The Peterlee and Aycliffe New Town Development Corporation - replaces Sir Austin Pearce on the Takeover Panel. Sir Adrian Cadbury and Professor Robert Jack are the two other lay members of the Panel and the Bank of England says that his appointment will reinforce the industrial representation on the Panel. ***** Walter Lamb, one of the best known names in the UK robotics industry, is stepping down as managing director of ABB Robotics, and will be succeeded by Roland Nordstrom (above). Lamb has held a number of senior posts at ABB Robotics since he joined the company in 1979, and will continue in an advisory role before taking early retirement in March. Nordstrom, a Swede, also has extensive experience, and was most recently responsible for business development at ABB Robotics International. ABB Robotics is part of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group Asea Brown Boveri. ***** Hamish Donaldson, the former Hill Samuel chief executive who quit a year ago after the bank made heavy losses, has been appointed a non-executive director of London Bridge Finance, a former Hill Samuel subsidiary specialising in credit insurance coverage. The appointment is the first Donaldson has taken since he left Hill Samuel. London Bridge Finance, which was bought from Hill Samuel by COBAC of Belgium earlier this year, says that Donaldson will play a more proactive role than is usually expected of non-executives. William Fulton, former chief executive of Lesney Corporation and managing director of Avesco, is also joining the London Bridge Finance board, along with Campbell Dunform, chairman of Trade Aide Financial Services, both as non-executives. Peter Handley, previously a director of Trade Indemnity, has been appointed general manager. ***** Penny Hughes (above left) has been appointed president of COCA-COLA Great Britain and Ireland and a vice-president of Coca-Cola International. She was previously commercial director of Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages. ***** Doreen Boulding (below right), who has been general manager of Belgravia Sheraton and the Halkin Hotel, has been appointed general manager of the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea Harbour, part of the international subsidiary of HILTON HOTELS. ***** Graham Dunn, finance director, has been appointed md of the OLIVER GROUP and John Chapman, services director, becomes retail operations director. ***** Kenneth Wilson, formerly president and ceo of Cardis Corporation, has been appointed president and ceo of GKN PARTS INDUSTRIES Corporation, based in Memphis, Tennessee. ***** Gerald Hammond, a former works director with GKN, has been appointed md of BAUER &amp; SCHAURTE.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Sharp attack on UK ministers by MPs  -UK reaction / Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies The government's handling of the Pergau dam project came under sustained attack in the House of Commons yesterday, with Labour blaming ministers for the decision to ban British companies from bidding for Malaysian government business. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said it was because of the government's conduct that Britain now faced 'these very serious consequences.' He said Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had denied there was any link between Pergau and a Malaysian arms deal - 'a statement we now know to be untrue.' In fact, at the same time as British companies were engaged in discussions about Pergau, some of the same companies were discussing aspects of the arms deal, Mr Cunningham said. 'Is the country expected to believe that expenditure of Pounds  1/4 bn of taxpayers' money was being promised to a government at the same time as an arms deal was being negotiated with that government and there was no link between them?', he asked. It would never be possible to build a successful economy on 'squalid if not illegal' deals like this one. Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the 'blast and blather' from Malaysia suggested that they 'may have something to hide.' The Malaysian government's objections were to British press stories about funds allegedly paid by British contractors into Swiss bank accounts on behalf of Malaysian politicians, he said. No MP was in a position to know whether or not these were true. Concern on the Tory backbenches focused on the possible consequences of yesterday's move on British jobs. Mr Michael Jopling, a former minister, said many in British industry would be 'totally perplexed' to find their jobs put at risk because of the activities of a free press. Mr Michael Shersby, a Tory member of the public accounts committee, said there was nothing illegal in the Pergau deal. Mr Hurd had pressed on with the transaction 'because he did not wish to renege on undertakings' given to Malaysia by Lady Thatcher when she was prime minister. Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office minister, said relations with Malaysia would 'undoubtedly have been damaged' if Britain had backed out of the deal. Mr Hurd had looked at the project in the light of commitments to continue to assist Malaysian development and the wider context of bilateral relations between the two countries. It was the government's task to promote the national interest, including exports and jobs. Mr Goodlad said there was no good reason for the Malaysians to make a connection between British press reporting and the conduct of trade.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW GROWTH INDUSTRY: LIQUIDATORS OF FAILED RETAILERS;  </P> <P> BANKRUPTCY: IT'S A PROFESSION THAT SOME SAY LACKED RESPECTABILITY ONLY A DECADE  AGO.  </P> <P> National Lumber, Pacific Stereo and Gemco are a few of the local retailers that  have gone belly up in recent years. In those cases and many more, either Albert  Nassi or David Buxbaum was called in to bury the remains.  </P> <P> Nassi and Buxbaum are liquidators, who fly around the country to sell whatever  inventory a failed retailer has left. It's a profession some might not have  mentioned in polite conversation a decade ago. Nassi, president of Sam Nassi  Co., a Calabasas firm co-founded and named after his late father, remembers his  dad being described as a "corporate mortician."  </P> <P> "Where are your emotions?" the younger Nassi recalled people asking his father.  "They'd say, 'How can you put these people out of a job?' Well, somebody has to  do it, and you might as well use a professional."  </P> <P> More and more troubled stores -- or their creditors or their bankruptcy  trustees -- are doing just that. Nassi, Buxbaum's Encino firm, Buxbaum Ginsberg  &amp; Associates, and other liquidators are now viewed as savvy marketers who  can get the stores' creditors the most bang for the buck when they hold a  going-out-of-business sale.  </P> <P> They're also likely to be in greater demand over the next few years. Many  retailers today are hobbling under piles of debt they incurred in the 1980s,  often to avoid a hostile takeover. Throw in the recession now hanging over the  economy generally, and Buxbaum said liquidation "is the growth business of the  '90s."  </P> <P> Nassi agreed. "A lot of retailers are making their last stand with this year's  Christmas, and I think that come January there will be quite a few more retail  liquidations."  </P> <P> Both men run private firms and declined to spell out their financial results.  But Nassi is by far the larger, expecting to handle about $500 million worth of  close-out sales this year, and it considers itself one of the largest  liquidators in the nation along with Schottenstein Stores Corp. in Columbus,  Ohio. Buxbaum will handle about $50 million in sales.  </P> <P> The firms earn their income in different ways. Buxbaum charges a fee, usually  between 2% and 10% of the proceeds from the going-out-of-business sale. (That  would give it annual revenue of roughly $2.5 million to $3 million.)  </P> <P> By contrast, Nassi often buys a store's inventory for a certain price, then  holds the close-out sale. Whatever cash the sale generates above what Nassi  paid for the goods goes into Nassi's pocket. (He'll only say his firm's annual  revenue exceeds $10 million.)  </P> <P> For instance, Ames Department Stores, a Rocky Hill, Conn.-based chain that  filed for bankruptcy reorganization last April, recently had Nassi and  Schottenstein Stores jointly liquidate 221 of its 682 stores.  </P> <P> With help from their lenders, Nassi and Schottenstein first bought the  inventory to be liquidated for $211 million, Nassi said. The stores' close-out  sales last August generated $240 million, so the extra $29 million was shared  as the gross income, before expenses, by Nassi and Schottenstein. Of course,  had the sales garnered less than $211 million, the liquidators would have taken  a loss.  </P> <P> Why don't troubled stores just hold a going-out-of-business sale themselves and  save having to pay Nassi or Buxbaum?  </P> <P> Stuart Hershfield, a New York lawyer who represents Ames' creditors, said "it's  generally a sound approach" to hire liquidators because in cases such as Ames,  "they assume the risk of not being able to sell everything. It's their  problem."  </P> <P> Good liquidators also know how to generate the most traffic for the sales --  which typically last eight to 10 weeks -- and how to keep costs down in the  meantime, Buxbaum said. Both mean more money for the creditors after the store  closes.  </P> <P> "We can do it for less cost because we don't have the sentimental attachment"  to the business, said Buxbaum, 64, who keeps his office in his Encino house  because he's on the road three weeks a month supervising sales.  </P> <P> Going-out-of-business sales inherently draw customers, because the merchandise  is almost always marked down. But Buxbaum takes no chances.  </P> <P> A store's top credit customers are often invited to a "preview" of the sale,  catered with wine and cheese. Buxbaum also tries to generate publicity for the  sale not only with advertising but by drumming up media stories if he can find  an angle. Case in point: At a Wichita, Kan., store, he dressed its window  mannequins with clothing made from newspapers. Local newspapers and television  stations quickly made it a story, he said.  </P> <P> Sam Nassi formed his company with partner David Bernstein in 1971, and  Bernstein remains chairman. Both were officers in California with the White  Front department store chain, but when it went broke, they ended up liquidating  their employer and then stayed in the business of closing stores, Albert Nassi  said. Among their biggest liquidations was the W. T. Grant department store  chain in 1975, which had $1 billion worth of merchandise and 980 stores.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, Buxbaum also got into liquidations because of the White Front  collapse. He had been running discount health-food stores inside White Front  stores. But when White Front went under, he was forced to liquidate his stores  as well.  </P> <P> Buxbaum said he later worked for several other liquidators before starting his  own firm in 1978. Eventually, his son, Paul, and former May Co. executive Ira  Ginsberg joined the firm, and today each owns a third of Buxbaum Ginsberg &amp;  Associates.  </P> <P> Buxbaum said he knew in the late-1970s that liquidation "was going to be a big  business" because he could see smaller, regional retailers being squeezed by  large national department stores that had bigger marketing budgets and  "superstores" that focused in one area -- say sporting goods, home-improvement  products or home electronics. Now, many of those larger chains, such as Ames,  are in trouble as well and that probably means more business for the corporate  undertakers.  </P> <P> "We used to be happy running one job," Buxbaum said. "Now we're running three  or four jobs at one time."  </P></p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Is it really the decade of the bond?  -A three-year rally has encouraged bond investment, says Philip Coggan, who explains how to buy gilts THOSE WHO said that the 1990s would be the decade of the bond have not looked too foolish so far. Bond prices around the world have been rising and gilts (bonds issued by the government) have enjoyed a three-year rally in the UK. The redemption yield on long-dated high-coupon gilts has fallen from nearly 12.3 per cent at the end of April 1990 to around 7.5 per cent today. The long-dated gilts price index has risen nearly 50 per cent over the same period. Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, and the subsequent falls in short-term interest rates, have helped the rally. But the key to the revival in gilts market has been the fall in the rate of inflation, and investors' expectations that the UK has moved into a low inflation era. Inflation quickly erodes the capital value of a fixed interest security such as a gilt. If inflation is 5 per cent, then after 10 years the real value of Pounds 100 invested in a gilt falls to Pounds 61.39. Ignoring dividend payments, Pounds 100 invested in gilts in 1945 would be worth little more than Pounds 2 today. But, with headline inflation at 1.4 per cent, gilts look a much more attractive proposition. A long gilt yielding 7.5 per cent is thus offering a real gross return of 6.1 per cent. That compares well with the real return on offer in April 1990, at the start of the recent rally. Then inflation was 8.1 per cent, so the real return was just 4.2 per cent. The apparently high real returns on offer at the moment are partly illusory. The headline rate of inflation has been flattered by the falls in mortgage rates. Stripping out that effect, the underlying rate of inflation in July was 2.9 per cent, bringing the real yield down to 4.6 per cent. Nevertheless, such a real return looks attractive in historical terms. Furthermore, the fall in base rates to 6 per cent means that cash deposits yield less than long term gilts (the reverse was true in April 1990, when base rates were 15 per cent and gilt yields were 12). Those who doubted the potential of the bond market to rally were less concerned with demand, than with supply. The government is having to fund a Pounds 50bn budget deficit this year and is meeting most of the gap with gilts issues. To date the government seems to have had no difficulty funding itself and is even ahead of schedule. Gilt prices and yields Private investors should understand a number of factors before they buy gilts. The first is that as prices rise, yields fall. So normally speaking, gilts do well when interest rates decline. But much depends on the maturity (see box on jargon) of the gilt concerned. Yields on a short-dated gilt will follow base rates very closely, since such gilts are comparable to cash. Long dated gilts will not always rise in response to a base rate cut. If, for example, monetary policy was seen as being too lax, a base rate cut might provoke fears of inflation causing prices of long dated gilts to fall (and yields to rise). A second factor is that gilts rarely trade at face value. Many at the moment trade above it. Thus investors must realise the difference between the running and the gross redemption yield (see box). If a gilt is trading above par value, then the running yield will be higher than the gross redemption yield; if a gilt is trading below par value, the reverse will be true. Remember that tax will be deducted from the income, and not the redemption yield. On Thursday, for example, the Treasury 13 per cent 2000 was trading at a price of 132 3/32 . For every Pounds 132.09 you paid, you would get an income of Pounds 13, a running yield of 9.84 per cent. For a top rate taxpayer, that return would fall to 5.9 per cent. But if you hold the bond to maturity, you will lose almost a quarter of your capital. The quoted gross redemption yield is 7.04 per cent; the net redemption yield (a complex calculation) will be considerably lower than that. Capital gains made on gilts are tax-free. However, the corollary is that losses on gilts cannot be offset, for Capital Gains Tax purposes, against profits made elsewhere. Index-linked gilts Index-linked gilts are complex animals. Both the interest payments and the maturity value increase in line with the retail prices index. The coupon is normally 2 or 2.5 per cent. However, the price of index-linked gilts does not go up in line with the RPI; instead it is set by supply and demand. If you invest in an index-linked gilt at 100 in August 1993, and the RPI increases by 5 per cent over the following year, the price in August 1994 will not necessarily be 105. To date, most index-linked gilt prices have not risen as quickly as the RPI. Anyone buying an existing long-dated index-linked gilt at current prices can look forward to an additional catching-up gain; their real return will accordingly be 3 per cent plus. The calculations are complicated because the indexation period does not exactly coincide with the life of the gilt. Indexation starts eight months before the gilt's issue and ends eight months before maturity. The consequence is that the investor is at risk from inflation in the last eight months of the gilt's life. This matters most when the maturity date of the gilt is only two or three years away. The FT shows the real yields on index-linked gilts based on two inflation assumptions - 5 and 10 per cent. The higher the assumed rate, the lower the real return. Take the 2.5pc 2003 issue, quoted in Wednesday's paper at a price of 164 1/8 . The real yields shown were 2.85 per cent at 10 per cent inflation and 3.16 per cent at 5 per cent inflation. That would translate to nominal yields of 12.85 per cent and 8.16 per cent respectively. The attraction of index-linked gilts for private investors may depend on their income needs and tax position. Most of the return comes in the form of tax-free capital gain; which may suit top rate taxpayers. The corollary is that there is little income, which may not suit retired investors. Prospects for gilts For private investors, the key question is whether it is too late to join in the rally. Chris Anthony, sterling bond economist at UBS, thinks 'it is more or less too late. There is some value in index-linked stocks (see below) since, in the run-up to a possible tax-raising Budget, investors may be attracted by their tax efficiency.' But he sees long gilt yields rising to 8.25 per cent by June next year. Ian Shepperdson, of Greenwell Montagu, says the market has entered a consolidation phase. He believes base rates will fall to 4 per cent by the end of the year which will be good news for short-dated gilts. But there may be some political alarms during the party conference season which could worry gilt investors. With real yields on index-linked gilts at 3.3 per cent, he says they look a good buy to private investors prepared to put in money for the medium term. How to buy A private investor who is interested in gilts has three options; buying gilts from a stockbroker; buying gilts through the National Savings Stock Register at the post office; and buying them through a bond fund. A stockbroker is probably the best route for the wealthy investor with a six-figure portfolio who wants to put tens of thousands into gilts. If you fit that category, the chances are you already have a broker. Brokers can handle large orders, at reasonably economic commissions; and they should be skillful enough to get you the best price on the market. The Post Office system is best suited for those with relatively small sums of money, who feel confident enough to choose between the many gilt issues on offer. (The Bank of England has issued a booklet, called Investing in Gilts which is available from post offices). The commission on a gilt purchase bought via the Post Office is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250, then 50p for every extra Pounds 125 or part. A purchase of Pounds 2,000 of gilts would cost Pounds 8. One advantage of buying via the National Savings Stock Register is that interest can be paid without tax deducted, which may suit non-taxpayers. The limit on an NSSR purchase was recently increased from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000. However, the disadvantage is that transactions are conducted by post and the NSSR cannot guarantee to buy at a particular price or on a particular day. For those, who do not feel expert enough to select their own gilts, a bond fund might be the ideal solution. These are normally unit trusts which buy a portfolio of bonds, with the aim of offering investors income, capital growth, or a combination of the two. There have traditionally been two objections to the use of bond funds for private investors. The first is that profits on bond fund holdings, unlike profits on gilts themselves, are subject to capital gains tax. However, few investors use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance. The second problem is that the managers' fees can subtract substantially from investor returns, especially when yields are low. Some managers have tried to tackle this problem by cutting the initial charge; notably the Aberdeen Gilt Growth and Income funds, Fidelity's Gilt And Fixed Interest Fund and Murray Acumen Reserve. But annual charges in the sector can still be high, with some funds charging as much as 1.5 per cent. Offshore gilt funds can pay income gross to investors, which can make them more attractive for non-taxpayers. Weekend FT regularly publishes tables showing the yields and performance records of both onshore and offshore bond funds. The fund with the highest yield is not necessarily the best; it could be that the capital is being eaten away to provide the yield. As of August 1, the onshore gilts trusts with the best performance over the last five years were: Murray Acumen Reserve, Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt and Abbey Capital Reserve.</p>

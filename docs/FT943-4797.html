			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Observer: Mission to refrain books about the British Broadcasting Corporation. A tantalising biography of John Birt, the BBC's director-general, should soon arrive. Meanwhile, those needing a quick fix could do worse than dip into The Battle for the BBC by Steven Barnett and Andrew Curry, academic and former BBC hack, respectively. No major surprises or scoops, just a respectable analysis of the BBC's fate over the past decade. But it has its nuggets. One delightful passage considers the Birtian 'method', employed when he ran features and current affairs at London Weekend in the days when Weekend World was essential viewing. Birt always required a fully drafted, painstakingly prepared script, right down to knowing exactly what every interviewee would say, before any filming happened. A good way of saving costly film stock, but obviously open to abuse. Say the authors: 'This sometimes meant coaching (interviewees) in what they were supposed to be saying even if  - as could happen - they had changed their minds . . . There were reliable punters who would be prepared to come on at short notice and deliver the agreed formula. Andrew Neil, then industrial editor of The Economist, was one.' So what can one expect from Neil's latest exploit, namely his programme for Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV station entitled Full Disclosure?</p>

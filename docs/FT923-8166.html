			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Critical smoke obscures disciplinary reforms - The tensions surrounding the policing of standards within the profession AS the disciplinary procedures of the professional accountancy bodies are once more eased into the dock, any chance of their receiving a fair hearing is likely to be rendered impossible by the clamouring of the lynch mob. Criticism has been unleashed from both external observers and those within the profession in the last few months. Only the most recent example was the professional conduct hearing at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales against Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand over an alleged conflict of interest surrounding their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International. Some pour scorn on why these hearings are taking so long, and why they have now been postponed, apparently at least until mid-October. Others attack the decision to keep the hearings secret, even from other council members who sit on the disciplinary committee itself. But the Polly Peck incident is not so exceptional. At a packed meeting in November last year arranged by the London Society of Chartered Accountants, small practitioners angrily accused the English institute of protecting the larger firms. Why, they demanded to know, was no action being taken to investigate the accountants' role in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International? (The announcement of just such an investigation was not ultimately made until this April.) Several disgruntled members said that if they had been involved in such a scandal, they would have been summarily dismissed from the institute. The fact is that any disciplinary action - or the apparent lack of action in a high-profile scandal - is always likely to generate grievance. Much may be ungrounded, yet among the unfair vocal attacks, some faint legitimate voices are being drowned out. The professional bodies have done much to bring about reform. Mr Ian Plaistowe, who became the new president of the English Institute in June, has said that his vision of the disciplinary system is to be 'firm, fast and fair'. He has dubbed attempts to mould the system to this vision as among the highest priorities during his year in office. A large number of the most significant reforms pre-date Mr Plaistowe's appointment. Many reflect the influence of Mr Brian Harris, a lawyer who heads the institute's professional conduct department. Only last week, the most recent institute council approved a thick report from a working party on its relationship with firms. This will open the way to action being taken directly against firms rather than just the individuals within them, currently only allowed in the regulated areas of insolvency, audit and investment business. Earlier this year, the institute appointed an 'ombudsman' to mediate on behalf of people who had made complaints against professionals that the disciplinary committee had decided not to pursue. A change in the by-laws has meant that the institute can now be much more open in disclosing when a major investigation has been launched. Another has placed an obligation on accountants to report to the institute any serious misconduct by members which they come across in the course of their work. The disciplinary penalties meted out to accountants found guilty of misconduct have been simplified, and the level of fines imposed has risen. Professional fees charged by practitioners can be reduced by the committee, and the institute has the power to intervene directly in the operation of a practice. The most extreme case of fines has come in the operation of the Joint Disciplinary Scheme (JDS), the body that considers matters of significant public interest and is operated in conjunction with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. In its report on Milbury in the spring, Arthur Young became the first accountancy firm to be fined by the JDS, for its failure as auditor to highlight 'seriously misleading' figures in the 1984 accounts of the collapsed house-building group. It was fined Pounds 100,000 plus Pounds 40,000 in costs. Other proposed JDS changes - already reflected in the workings of the disciplinary committee - allow simplified and more rapid processing of complaints when the firm or individual under scrutiny admits responsibility. JDS reports are already released in full. Now discussion is underway to provide more detail on the results of the other, more minor disciplinary hearings. Many of the complaints about disciplinary procedures are related to the delays between an allegation and its resolution. Mr Brian Harris says this is partly the result of the rising workload of complaints, reflecting a similar trend by many professional bodies. The institute received about 3,500 complaints last year, up 20 per cent on the previous year, 10 per cent on the year before that - and likely to rise by another 20 per cent this year. But most of these cases are handled without any formal proceedings, and the vast majority concern often trivial difficulties in relation to very small practitioners. Most criticism centres on the handful of high-profile cases taken on by the JDS. Part of the delay is explained by the need to allow the cases to be adequately prepared and to allow the chance for appeals. Part is inextricably tied into the delays in the legal system, since the JDS cannot take action while a court case is underway. Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund management company, for example, was closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988. Its JDS case was only re-opened in February, after prosecutions in the courts had finished. That leaves one vital concern unanswered, however: the openness of proceedings. The JDS cases are at least reported in full on their conclusion, giving outsiders the chance to see details of the evidence and arguments presented. There is no such luxury for the hearings of the disciplinary committee. The tension within the institute is whether its apparently growing desire to be seen to be fair will conflict with the effectiveness of its procedures. A paper circulating internally stresses the risks of defamation, contempt, restriction of free discussion, and the level of co-operation with other regulatory bodies if sensitive information is discussed too openly. It may well be that these barriers prove unsurmountable. If the institute is determined to be seen to be objective, it must have to face up to an unpleasant question which has been rather buried over the last few months: whether there is an irreconcilable conflict over its roles as both a trade association and a professional regulator for accountants.</p>

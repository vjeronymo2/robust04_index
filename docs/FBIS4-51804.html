			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Twenty-two, or 60 percent,  of the 38 central government agencies have undergone  streamlining to honor the pledge of a "small government" made in  January. At a meeting Monday presided over by Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok, the cabinet confirmed that 1,368 officials have been  cut while 829 have been newly employed, resulting in a net  reduction of 539 officials. One office, three bureaus, 11  councilor posts and 35 divisions have been closed down. Of the  remaining 16 agencies, four agencies are awaiting approval for a  manpower increase while 12 others, including the National  Unification Board, have yet to submit reorganization drafts.    The government streamlining is therefore virtually finalized  as the rest of the reshaping is likely to be small in scale. Of  the 22 agencies that have finished their restructuring, the  Communications Ministry did the most cutting -- 223 officials --  followed by 115 in the Korea National Railroad, 105 in the  Construction Ministry, 55 in the Home Ministry, 52 in the  Foreign Ministry, 43 in the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry,  and 23 in the Government Administration Ministry.    In contrast, the Environment Ministry added 223 officials to  perform its new task of handling water-related affairs and the  public prosecutor's office employed seven.</p>

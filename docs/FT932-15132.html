			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher rekindles her old fire over Bosnia BARONESS Thatcher proved yesterday that she has not lost her political touch. However strong the private annoyance of ministers and however rationally argued the public denunciation, the former prime minister's remarks on Bosnia stirred Westminster into passionate debate over the role Britain could play - and struck a chord with a surprising number of Labour and Tory MPs. 'The unofficial view is that she has flipped - gone completely mad,' said one MP ally of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. 'It was good Dog and Duck stuff for a Friday afternoon in the pub.' That was a careless assesment - although it was true that scarcely a Tory MP was prepared to support Lady Thatcher's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be armed and few had concrete alternatives to present government policy. Government officials' attempts to pretend that Mr Rifkind's Commons statement was planned were half-hearted. The government was clearly on the defensive, anxious that her views should not become common currency or be seen in the US as policy. The private scorn of loyal MPs, fed up with Lady Thatcher's attacks on her successor as prime minister over Maastricht, was coupled with an admission that her views chimed with swelling anxiety beyond Westminster over Bosnia. 'Her comments have struck a chord with the public,' said a Tory MP who fiercely opposes increasing Britain's military involvement. 'I had an old man speaking at a meeting in my constituency who said 'I remember 1945 and never thought that we would see the return of concentration camps.'' For Thatcherites, Lady Thatcher's outburst echoed her time as prime minister when, at least in their minds, Britain was either totally involved in overseas military operations, or not at all. Lady Thatcher's intervention may have been clumsy. Her decision to grant several interviews to television news programmes rather than make a considered speech, allowed ministers to pick holes in her argument. But in the Commons there was a growing 'something must be done' mentality that Mr Rifkind at times struggled to contain. 'There is a ghastly parallel between the feebleness of the United Nations as it now stands and the League of Nations some 60 years ago against expansionism,' said Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for South Wirral. 'There is a real danger of being dragged into a far wider and more difficult conflict unless some check is imposed on the Serbian-driven expansion,' said Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee. Reaction among some Labour MPs too was surprisingly strong; the condemnation of inactivity by leftwing backbenchers more vociferous than the front bench. Ms Clare Short, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, drew parallels between the plight of Bosnian Moslems and the failure to protect Jews in the second world war. Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, said the former prime minister had articulated at least 'the deep anger and frustration of people in this country'. To an extent, Lady Thatcher was voicing the frustration of Tories wanting firm leadership after a year dominated by rows. She has served warning that ministers must work hard to hold the party together over Bosnia.</p>

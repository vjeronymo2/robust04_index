			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "British Provocations"] </F>   [Text] The British Government brutally "dealt us a blow"  for the third time within a few days. Frankly, cynically, and  unhesitatingly, Britain has proved its pro-Turkish stance by  blocking the European Union [EU]-Cyprus fourth financial  protocol.    The Greek presidency's draft plan on the financial protocol  struck a chord of British reaction. During the meeting of the  permanent representatives of the EU member states the day before  yesterday, the British spokesman insisted on securing financing  for the pseudostate without the necessary consent of the lawful  Cypriot Government. This British stance exhausts Cypriot  Hellenism's final margin of patience. In an initial reaction,  President Glavkos Kliridhis said that if something like this  happens, we will not accept the EU fourth financial protocol.    The president's reaction is correct. But the president, the  government, and the House of Representatives must not limit  their reaction to just that. As we have stressed in recent  reports because of other British blows against us, we are  obliged to react accordingly. We must react dynamically. Why  not even strike back at Britain? We are in a position to do it.  We have the power and the means to harm many of Britain's  serious strategic and financial interests in Cyprus.    We recall that both the president as well as the other party  leaders have repeatedly described the British bases as the  remains of the British colony in Cyprus. The State Prosecution  has opined that the British bases are not sovereign. Therefore,  we are in a position to deactivate these bases, the remains of  the British colony. It is time that the government and the  House of Representatives examine legal ways to implement this.  The decision must be made based on two basic facts: first, the  British refusal to reimburse the Cypriot Government for the  facilities it is offering for the operation of the bases;  second, the use of the bases for purposes that go against the  interests of Cyprus and its people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Mario Rivera and Marta Moreno from </F> the NTV newscast]    [Text] Army General Raul Castro visited Tank Unit 1410 in  Matanzas Province during his tour of Central Army facilities.  The unit's troops worked hard to build defensive tunnels and to  fortify positions for correctly conserving all weaponry and  protecting soldiers and the population.    The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba assessed  the importance of these facilities in protecting weaponry and  soldiers in case of enemy air raids. Raul Castro's words are  known: We may not be the Armed Forces with the most available  resources, but we can say that we are the best protected Armed  Forces on the continent; therefore, they are the most  enthusiastic and are capable of coming from beneath the Earth's  surface after a surprise, large- scale air raid and making the  enemy pay dearly for trying to land on our island.    Unit Chief Colonel Lazaro Lopez said the troops are prepared  for combat readiness through various exercises and the use of  schoolrooms, maquettes, and trainers, as well as through gunnery  practice and the use of shooting ranges. This results in a  considerable savings of human and material resources, including  fuel.    The young men in the unit excel in various patriotic and  social activities: minimizing misdemeanors and eliminating the  need for discipline violations, strengthening personnel support  to their leaders, and proving to be active participants in  essential tasks.    Agrarian development represents another important task for  this tank unit, in its zeal to achieve self-sufficiency. They  currently have two basic production units, a pig farm, a poultry  farm and its slaughterhouse, a cattle farm, and a fodder  factory. A total of 20 tanks are being built to breed fish. Out  of 160 medical products that can be manufactured with herbs, the  unit has managed to manufacture 125 products in a small  laboratory, thus fulfilling basic needs at the unit's hospital.  In addition to their work, these fighters have had time to  support vital economic tasks, including the potato harvest, the  sugarcane recovery, and the cleaning of Varadero beach. They  are also in charge of the military community and its elementary  school and excel in valuable blood donations.</p>

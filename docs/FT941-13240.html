			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Stream of issues in currency range A stream of Eurobond issues in various currencies emerged yesterday, including a UK corporate issue in the Eurosterling market and the first Danish krone convertible Eurobond. Meanwhile, in the French domestic bond market, the French unemployment fund Unedic issued the largest-ever domestic bond via Banque Paribas and Caisse des Depots et Consignations. The issue came in two tranches: a FFr10bn tranche maturing in October 1999 and a FFr12bn portion maturing in November 2002. The first tranche was priced to yield 10 basis points over the interpolated French government bond yield curve, while the second tranche came at a yield of 12 basis points over the 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002. 'This paper offers added supply in maturities where there is little liquidity in the OAT market,' said a syndicate manager at Paribas in Paris. He said the short-dated tranche was sold out quickly, while placement of the longer-dated tranche was slower. The bonds are guaranteed by the French government. However, while they will be traded by French government bond primary dealers, they are not deliverable into the notional bond futures contract on the Matif. In the afternoon, Salomon Brothers announced SKr1.5bn of 10-year bonds for Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export financing agency. The bonds are expected to be priced today at a yield spread of 24 basis points over the 10-year Swedish government bond. While the five- to seven-year sector of the Swedish krona bond market has been flooded with new supply in the last two weeks, the 10-year sector has not been tapped recently. And there is still good demand for Swedish krona bonds from investors who expect Swedish interest rates to continue falling and the currency to appreciate. The UK healthcare and industrial group BOC was the second UK corporate borrower this year to tap the Eurosterling market, issuing Pounds 125m of 10-year bonds via CS First Boston. The launch spread of 57 basis points over gilts was deemed by most market participants to be too tight. After the syndicate broke, the gap widened to more than 60 basis points. However, the lead manager said it rebounded to around 59 basis points over gilts towards the close. In the Canadian dollar market, Abbey National Treasury Services issued CDollars 200m of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 26 basis points over the Canadian government bond at re-offer. The issue was widely criticised as being too tightly priced. An official at lead manager Salomon Brothers agreed the deal had been aggressively priced, but argued that the Canadian dollar bond market has recently seen little supply and strong investor demand. 'We haven't sold all our bonds, but we feel comfortable about our ability to place them in the next few days,' he said. Elsewhere, the Danish food ingredients and packaging company Danisco launched the first Danish krone convertible Eurobond, totalling DKr1bn of 10-year bonds. A syndicate official at lead manager S. G. Warburg said the issue was heavily oversubscribed, with strong demand from Swiss and UK institutional investors, and existing Danisco shareholders. In the D-Mark sector, the price of LKB Baden-Wurttemberg's DM750m bond issue launched on Monday slipped in line with the underlying bund market, but the yield spread tightened slightly to around 66 basis points, from 67 the previous day. According to lead manager J. P. Morgan, the bonds traded as high as 100.90 on Monday. Yesterday they slipped to around 100.55 bid in late trade.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S BOYS' GAMES;  </P> <P> GREGORY PLANS TO MAKE TRABUCO HILLS' SWANWICK WORK FOR POINTS AGAINST SAVANNA  </P> <P> Tom Gregory, Savanna High School basketball coach, has conceded as much before  his team meets Trabuco Hills at 7:30 tonight in the second round of the  Southern Section 3-A division basketball playoffs: Opposing center Rick  Swanwick will score his share of points.  </P> <P> Swanwick, 6-feet-10, averages 20.3 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. An  estimated two dozen college coaches and scouts watched him score 23 points and  grab 11 rebounds in Wednesday's opening-round 84-58 victory over Rancho  Alamitos.  </P> <P> Savanna (23-2) will rely on 6-6, 220-pound center Tim Tillman and 6-8,  210-pound reserve Eric Preuss to contain Swanwick, who is considered by many to  be the top collegiate center prospect in Southern California who is still  unsigned.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills (18-6), which has won 13 of its past 14 games, uses Swanwick  inside and sharp-shooting guards Tim Manning, Chad Poulos and Randy Kriech  outside to keep opposing defenses honest.  </P> <P> Savanna, seeded third in the division, is coming off a 91-point outburst  against Azusa, the highest point production since the Rebels' 104-77 victory  over Sunny Hills in 1976.  </P> <P> Sophomore Mustaphi Abdi made his opening 11 shots and finished with 35 points,  hitting 15 of 18 shots.  </P> <P> In other 3-A division games, all starting at 7:30:  </P> <P> Laguna Hills (16-9) at Corona del Mar (16-9): Laguna Hills is coming off its  first playoff win in the school's history, a 72-67 victory over La Quinta.  Guard Chris Sheff, a four-year starter, is the school's career scoring leader.  Corona del Mar ended El Dorado's 14-game winning streak with a fine defensive  effort in a 61-43 victory.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda (20-7) vs. San Dimas (18-6) at Charter Oak HS: San Dimas' tallest  starter is 6-2 Chris Young, who averages 11 points and 5 rebounds per game.  Junior Keith Walker, who scored 37 points in Brea's 29-point victory over La  Sierra, figures to have another big game against smaller opponents.  </P> <P> Estancia (20-5) at Norte Vista (15-10): Estancia guard Mike Curtis was limited  to 10 points, his lowest output of the season, but the Eagles gained a 55-49  victory over Foothill Wednesday. Estancia's reward? It gets to travel to  Riverside. Norte Vista's top scorer is 6-2 forward Mario Nava, who averages  23.1 points.  </P> <P> In the 5-AA division:  </P> <P> Chaffey (18-6) at Saddleback (24-1): Chaffey is making its first playoff  appearance in 13 years. Saddleback, the county's top-ranked team, has won 19  consecutive games behind the play of center Malru Dottin and guard Craig  Marshall.  </P> <P> L.B. Jordan (17-8) at Fountain Valley (19-6): Jordan was the only team to  defeat fourth-seeded Lakewood in Moore League play and has also defeated Loyola  and El Dorado. Guard Tom Weaver, despite playing with a sprained ankle, made  two free throws with 16 seconds remaining to seal Fountain Valley's 82-76  victory over Montebello.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach (13-11) at Lakewood (21-6): The teams have a common opponent  in Santa Ana. Lakewood defeated Santa Ana, 55-48, in the championship game of  the Santa Ana Elks tournament. Huntington Beach eliminated Santa Ana, 89-62, in  the first round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> Upland (18-9) vs. Mater Dei (24-2) at Rancho Santiago College: Upland has  qualified for the playoffs for the first time in 11 years but it figures to be  a short stay. Guard Rick Brodbeck averages 19.3 points and has made 58  three-point shots. Guard Crispin Alapag averages 15.3 points and has made 52  three-point shots. Mater Dei is trying to become the first school to win five  consecutive large-school titles.  </P> <P> In the 5-A division:  </P> <P> Los Alamitos (12-14) vs. Edison (14-12) at Marina: Junior center Robert Conlisk  scored 30 points, had 15 rebounds, blocked 7 shots and scored the winning  basket with 25 seconds remaining in a 72-71 victory over El Toro Wednesday.  Edison, the only school to defeat 2-A division powerhouse Santa Clara, plays on  a neutral court after administrators scheduled a wrestling tournament in the  school's gymnasium.  </P> <P> Gahr (17-8) at Irvine (21-5): Gahr's potent offense erupted for 111 points  against Santa Fe in its second game of the season. Irvine counters with a  ball-control passing offense in an effort to dictate the tempo. Guard Bryan  Allred averages 16.5 points and has made 59 three-point shots for Irvine.  </P> <P> Ocean View (18-8) at Etiwanda (15-9): Etiwanda lost three of its opening four  league games and rebounded to win the Hacienda League title. Center Todd Norman  averages 18.5 points and 9.5 rebounds for Ocean View.  </P> <P> Diamond Bar (12-11) vs. Capistrano Valley (20-4) at Saddleback College: This is  a rematch of last year's 4-A division quarterfinal game which Capistrano Valley  won, 76-65. Forward Troy Clark leads Diamond Bar with a 15-point average.  Forward Scott McCorkle averages 24.1 points and guard Chris Kostoff averages 15  points for Capistrano Valley, which has advanced to the semifinals in five of  the past eight years.  </P> <P> In the 4-AA division:  </P> <P> Torrance (15-10) at Sunny Hills (17-8): Richard Robison averages 27.7 points  for Torrance and scored 26 points in an opening-round 59-52 victory over  Servite. Guard Jeff White averages 13 points and 7.3 assists for Sunny Hills.  </P> <P> El Modena (20-5) at Cajon (15-9): Cajon upset defending 3-A division champion  Kennedy, 52-50, in the first round, meaning fourth-seeded El Modena travels to  San Bernardino for its first playoff game in eight years. El Modena also has a  potent offense, averaging 74 points per game.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo (12-12) at Inglewood (15-8): Inglewood has three players --  forward Harold Miner (USC), guard Johnny Terrell (Colorado) and center Cory  Johnson (New Mexico State) -- who have signed with Division I colleges.  </P> <P> In the 4-A division:  </P> <P> Dominguez (20-4) at Cypress (12-13): Top-seeded Dominguez has won 14  consecutive games since losing to El Toro, 60-42, in the Orange Holiday  tournament. Forward Xavier Edison averages 14 points and 10.1 rebounds, and  guard Dijon Bernard averages 13.5 points for Dominguez.  </P> <P> Fullerton (17-6) at Artesia (18-5): Artesia's Ed O'Bannon, generally considered  the best underclassman in the state, averages 27.7 points and 14.7 rebounds per  game. O'Bannon, a junior, has a high-game of 50 points. Guard Pete Bach leads  Fullerton with a 19.6-point average.  </P> <P> In the 2-AA division:  </P> <P> Whittier Christian (19-6) vs. Bell-Jeff (20-4) at Burbank: Whittier Christian,  seeded fourth, is led by forward Paul McKinley (17 points, 5.1 rebounds) and  center Scott Ferguson (13.7 points, 9.1 rebounds).  </P> <P> In the 2-A division:  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran (21-3) vs. Notre Dame (12-12) at Corona HS: Guard Jack Kavanagh  averages 14.1 points and center Bill Hillyard averages 13.7 points in Notre  Dame's balanced attack.

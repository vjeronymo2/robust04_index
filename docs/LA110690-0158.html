			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BURGLARS MAY HAVE STRUCK AS MAN LAY DEAD  </P> <P> Two men have been arrested on suspicion of burglarizing a house where,  investigators believe, the homeowner's body may have lain decomposing in the  garage when the crime occurred.  </P> <P> The two were arrested after an investigation into the death of Edward G.  Stecki, 76, whose body was found last Wednesday at his home in the 1100 block  of Weatherby Road in Rossmoor, Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Arrested on suspicion of burglary and grand theft, auto, were David Lane Neve,  26, of Rossmoor, and Raymond Wayne Gamboa, 28, of Buena Park, Olson said.  </P> <P> An autopsy revealed that Stecki had been dead for one to two weeks before his  body was found. Although the autopsy was not conclusive, pending results of  toxicological tests, there were no obvious signs of trauma, and foul play did  not appear to be involved, Olson said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> "During the follow-up investigation of the death, family members were contacted  and it appeared that the victim had a 1985 Chevrolet Corvette that was missing,  along with a .38-caliber handgun, some coins, miscellaneous jewelry and stereo  equipment," Olson said.  </P> <P> After further investigation, sheriff's deputies learned that Neve, who was  wanted on a parole violation, lived near Stecki's home, Olson said.  </P> <P> Neve was placed under surveillance, and on Friday he was stopped in his  vehicle, Olson said. Investigators found the stolen coins in the vehicle, Olson  said. In searching Neve's house, officers also recovered the stereo equipment.  </P> <P> "Investigators also obtained information that led them to believe the stolen  Corvette was in the Buena Park area," Olson said. Sheriff's deputies found the  car near Hoffman Street and Lincoln Avenue in Buena Park.  </P> <P> "Investigators further learned that Gamboa aided Neve in stealing the Corvette  from the Stecki residence," Olson said.  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Survey shows explanation is still needed - Derivatives Bankers have been quick to emphasise the importance of properly explaining their derivative products in the wake of this year's highly publicised losses by companies in the US and Europe. A survey of UK companies*, published today, shows that they still have a lot of work to do in this respect. But it also indicates that companies could more to help themselves. Ninety corporate treasurers - all working for companies which make up the FT-SE Mid 250 index - responded to the fourth annual survey by Record Treasury Management, a firm of consultants which advises companies on how to manage currency and other financial risks. Like previous surveys by Record, this one covers the views of corporate treasurers on interest rate and currency trends as well as broader economic developments. But for the first time the survey also includes a section on derivatives. It found that although nine out of 10 treasurers use derivatives, more than half these users believe salesmen are not properly explaining the risks involved. Thirty-six per cent of respondents said banks explained derivatives 'inadequately' and a further 18 per cent felt the risks were explained 'poorly'. Only 1 per cent of respondents said sellers were explaining and quantifying the risks 'very well'. However, other sections of the survey indicate that corporate treasurers may not be doing enough to monitor or manage their derivatives risks adequately. The survey shows two particular weaknesses. First, in spite of continuing levels of volatility in financial markets, nearly three-quarters of respondents 'mark to market' the value of their derivatives exposures no more frequently than once a month. Only 12 per cent 'mark to market' weekly and 16 per cent on a daily basis. Mr Les Halpin, chief executive of Record, says that treasurers should 'at least have the facility to mark to market on a daily basis'. 'Control and monitoring of exposure to derivative risk is essential even with the less exotic products on the market,' insists Record. Second, a substantial minority of companies have apparently failed to heed the lessons of some of this year's corporate losses and continue to operate corporate treasury departments as 'profit centres'. Although three-quarters of corporate treasurers rank their main role as one of 'risk reduction', 9 per cent of respondents believe they can 'add value'. Mr Halpin believes corporate treasuries aiming to add value have run into problems because they have taken on risks unrelated to their ordinary business. 'Nearly one in 10 see themselves as profit centres. That is enough to give you all the disasters you need for the next 20 years,' he claims. More generally, there are indications that the management controls and systems for derivatives may not be in place in some companies. Treasury departments appear to allocate relatively few resources to derivative activity, in spite of the fact that it is typically of high value and importance to the company. It is 'hard to know what percentage of resources should be devoted,' concedes Mr Halpin. 'But this is evidently something that needs looking at.' There are also indications that some treasurers may not be keeping their boards fully informed about their derivatives activities. Nearly half the companies surveyed require board level approval for transactions of Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.58m) and above, but as many as one in five companies make decisions about derivatives transactions of Pounds 50m or more without board-level approval. More generally - and perhaps not surprisingly, given the nature of its own activities - Record suggests that companies make insufficient use of specialist advisers. 'Treasurers tend to see derivatives as a do it yourself business. In other areas of business where specialised expertise is needed like accounting and the law, companies appoint outside advisers,' explains Mr Neil Record, chairman. *Survey of UK Corporate Treasurers, by Record Treasury Management, 32 Peascod Street, Windsor, Berks SL4 1EA</p>

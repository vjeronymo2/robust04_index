			<p>BFN     [Text] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari confirmed today  that he had talks on arms deals during his visit to Russia,  including the procurement of helicopters. At his news  conference in Mikkeli, Ahtisaari rejected a statement made by  Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, according to which it would be  totally mad to cover the Russian debt with arms purchases. Ossi  Kervinen reports.    [Begin recording] [Kervinen] The Defense Ministry announced  in a press statement yesterday that the ministry has neither  agreed nor negotiated on arms procurement from Russia to cover  Russian debt. Today, however, the supreme commander of the  defense forces, President Martti Ahtisaari, said that during his  visit to Russia he had talks about possible new arms purchases,  according to a list drawn up by the Defense Ministry.    [Ahtisaari] I do not remember now the contents of the list  because there were many such matters which did not mention any  amounts. For example, there is a requirement for helicopters,  but the list did not say how many helicopters. They wanted to  find out what was possibly available and suitable.    [Kervinen] Aimo Pajunen, chief secretary of the Defense  Ministry, confirmed in the afternoon that the president has a  list with him, but not a shopping list. The list, the contents  of which Pajunen did not reveal either, emphasizes the high-tech  areas which Finland would be willing to discuss. Generally, such  familiarization will lead to procurement if the price and the  quality are agreeable.    Regarding the helicopters, we know that the Mi-8 helicopters  of the air force are aging. New helicopters will be needed  sooner or later. The procurement of helicopters was taken up  during the winter when the procurement agreements, which were  signed with Russia in March, were prepared. A protocol was  signed with Russia in March on this year's procurements from  Russia. The deal, which is worth 100 million markkas, gives us  mainly ammunition and spare parts for the land forces. At the  same time, a protocol was signed which liquidates accounts  receivables worth 450 million markkas of the old debt of the  former Soviet Union. With this money, modern, light Igla air  defense missiles will be acquired together with artillery  equipment and ammunition.    Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn said in a press interview  yesterday that it is totally mad to cover Russia's debts by arms  procurement when we do not even know whether we need such cheap  arms. This statement has caused serious rancor in the defense  forces and in Rehn's own ministry. The defense forces say that  they have received only good and useful arms from Russia and  also from Germany; a poor country cannot afford to buy bad  equipment.    During Defense Minister Rehn's period in office, the defense  forces appear to have received a lot of positive publicity and  understanding. In one press interview, which also mentioned the  dispute over appointing the chief secretary of the Defense  Ministry, Rehn is said to have destroyed everything. What also  makes Rehn's statement odd in the case of arms procurement is  that she and her ministry drew up all these lists. This aspect  was also raised by President Ahtisaari when he commented on  Rehn's statement.    [Ahtisaari] Well, as a matter of fact all these proposals  have come from Rehn's ministry, so I do not believe that  anybody has proposed anything other than what has been proposed  by the ministry.

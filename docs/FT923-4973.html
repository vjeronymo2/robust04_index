			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iran offers oil routes to ex-Soviet states Mr GHOLAMREZA Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, promised this week that Iran would provide routes to the oil market for the newly independent republics of central Asia and the Caucasus. He told energy officials and experts gathered in Tehran for a two-day conference on Energy Co-operation in Central Asia and the Caucasus that Iran was ready to put its experience and expertise at their disposal. Iran's strategic position means it can offer these republics a cheap and direct route for their oil and gas on to the European market. Experts at the conference predicted, however, that it would be at least ten years before the necessary infrastructure was in place. Mr Abbas Maleki, Iran's deputy foreign minister for science and research, said: 'The republics of central Asia and the Caucasus, despite having vast energy resources, suffer from a lack of energy. They cannot even meet their own needs, because they do not have the technology to exploit the large oil, gas and coal reserves'. The oil-rich states of central Asia and the Caucasus - Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan - now produce 900,000 barrels a day. However, they need 1m b/d just to meet their own needs. Azerbaijan consumes 50,000 b/d but only produces 25,000 b/d.</p>

(70&hyph;8347) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appalachian Power Company (``Appalachian''), 40 Franklin Road, Roanoke, Virginia 24022, Columbus Southern Power Company (``Columbus''), 215 North Front Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, and Ohio Power Company (``Ohio Power''), 301 Cleveland Avenue SW., Canton, Ohio 44702, all electric public-utility subsidiary companies of American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, have filed a declaration under Section 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appalachian, Columbus, and Ohio Power intend to issue and sell, in one or more series through June 30, 1995 shares of their cumulative preferred stock (``Stock'') up to $30 million (no par), $100 million (par value $25 per share and/or $100 per share), and $85 million (par value $25 per share and/or $100 per share), respectively, under Rule 52. If market conditions require, Applicants propose to include a redemption provision and/or a sinking fund with their sale of the Stock, and request authorization from the Commission to acquire or redeem such Stock through the operation of such redemption provision and/or sinking fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the Stock include a redemption provision, the Stock would not otherwise be redeemable at the option of Applicants for a period ending on a date occurring up to 15 years following the date of its issuance. Alternatively, Applicants may provide in the terms of the Stock that the Stock would not be redeemable at the option of Applicants for a period of up to 15 years if the monies for such redemption are obtained by Applicants through a borrowing or issuance of stock at an effective interest rate or dividend cost to Applicants of less than the dividend rate per annum of such Stock. After the expiration of such non-redemption or non-refunding period, such Stock may be redeemable at Applicants' option at a price per share equal to the stated value thereof together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus 100% of the dividend rate, declining annually on a straight-line or other formula basis until arriving at the stated value thereof, and thereafter at the stated value thereof. Applicants state that they will not exercise any right of redemption by using the proceeds of any new issue of securities unless the estimated present value savings (derived from the net difference between interest or dividend payments on a new issue of comparable securities and on the cumulative preferred stock to be redeemed) is, on an after-tax basis, greater than the present value of all redemption and issuing costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the Stock be subject to a sinking fund, Applicants may be required, after the expiration of a non-redemption or non-refunding period, to annually redeem a number of the shares of the Stock equal to between 5% and 20% of the number of shares of Stock initially issued. In addition, Applicants may, at their option, redeem on any such date an additional equivalent amount of Stock. The price of such shares subject to the sinking fund would be the price per share equal to the stated value thereof together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption. The Stock also may be subject to a final balloon sinking fund payment which would require Applicants to redeem at per share equal to the stated value thereof, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, a number of the shares of the Stock of up to 80% of the number issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> CECo Holding Company (70&hyph;8353) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CECo Holding Company (``CECo''), 37th Floor, 10 South Dearborn Street, P.O.

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Markets await payroll figure THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday as the markets anxiously awaited today's US non-farm payroll figure for July, writes James Blitz. The payroll figure is widely seen as the big number of the week, with the market expecting a rise in US employment of anything up to 200,000 on the month. Dealers believe that if the figure comes through as expected, the dollar could make a concerted move towards DM1.50. There is also speculation that June's reported fall of 117,000 in non-farm payroll was greatly overstated and some think it could be revised all the way up to a 100,000 increase. However, a leading London economist said there was still deep uncertainty over the jobless figures: 'We have got uncertain revisions, huge seasonal adjustments and one-off adjustments for government-sponsored work schemes, so the market has every right to be paralysed with fear.' The US currency received a small boost yesterday from the Bundesbank's decision not to raise its emergency Lombard rate. Adding to the more relaxed mood was July's figure for German manufacturing orders, which was down 1.8 per cent on the month. Signs that the German economy is weakening will put pressure on the Bundesbank not to tighten policy further. However, analysts believe there are still reasons to fear a Lombard rate rise this autumn. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, thinks Germany's M3 money supply figure for August, due out in three weeks time, will show monetary growth peaking at 9.5 per cent. He believes that the Bundesbank could increase the Lombard rate by  1/4 percentage point in the wake of this. In London, the dollar ended higher against the D-Mark at DM1.4815 compared to a previous finish of DM1.4760. At the close of New York trading the US currency had slipped back to DM1.4772. After having fallen about 2 pfennigs this week, sterling's descent against the D-Mark was halted yesterday. The UK currency finished a little firmer at DM2.8275, after a previous close of DM2.8250. Dealers, however, remain bearish towards the currency, which is testing its floor against both the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta in the European exchange rate mechanism. An analyst sugg-ested that if the pound drifts down to DM2.80 in forthcoming days, the Bank of England will be forced to respond with heavy intervention. The Italian lira showed a mild improvement against the D-Mark, ending at L756.0 compared to the previous close of L756.5, as did the French franc, with a finish of FFr3.3770 to the German unit, against FFr3.3800 previously.</p>

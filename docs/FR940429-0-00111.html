			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A vocational program is defined as ``an educational program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare individuals with skills and training required for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to the educational program.'' The Secretary notes that this definition is operationally consistent with the IPEDS/CIP definition of an ``occupationally specific program.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.3&blank;State Agreement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that the Secretary specify more clearly when sanctions would be imposed on a State that failed to establish review standards. These commenters recommended that the Secretary impose sanctions on a State that failed to establish review standards by the end of the second year. However, these commenters suggested different time periods for measuring the end of that second year. These suggestions included using the Federal fiscal year, the State fiscal year, the calendar year, and the planning year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees to be more specific in these regulations with regard to when sanctions will fall on a State that fails to establish review standards. Because the Secretary encourages all States to participate in the program, the Secretary has chosen a deadline date for sanctions that should enable all States to avoid that sanction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 667.3(d)(4) has been revised to provide that a State will have until December 31, 1995 to submit State review standards that are subsequently approved by the Secretary if the State received fiscal year 1993 funds to carry out SPRP activities, and until December 31, 1996 to submit those standards if the State that did not receive fiscal year 1993 funds to carry out SPRP activities. The deadline date for imposing sanctions has been changed from the date on which standards are approved to the date on which approvable standards are submitted to the Secretary for approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters writing on behalf of SPREs argued that the Secretary should not impose sanctions on a State that failed to establish review standards within two years if the reason for exceeding the proposed two-year limit was due to (1) a State requirement to codify those standards in State regulations, or (2) a condition beyond the control of the SPRE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees that codifying standards in State regulations is a valid reason for not imposing sanctions on a State that fails to establish review standards. Under &sect;667.12(a)(2), a State establishes review standards if those standards meet the requirements in &sect;667.21 and the Secretary does not approve those standards under &sect;667.22. This process of establishing standards is distinct from the process a SPRE may need to follow to codify standards in State regulations. Accordingly, a SPRE may submit the State's standards to the Secretary for evaluation while simultaneously beginning the process to codify those standards in State regulations as long as the State coordinates the two processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, as noted above, the Secretary has extended the deadline date for submitting approved standards to the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary believes that no State codification process should prevent a State from submitting its standards in a timely manner. Similarly the Secretary believes that a State should be able to meet that deadline regardless of conditions outside its control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters were concerned that the provision in proposed &sect;667.3(b)(3)(iii) that stated that ``the SPRE will keep records or have access to records *&blank;*&blank;*'' implied that the SPRE had the authority to (1) require nonreferred institutions to submit financial and standards-related information to the SPRE, and (2) gain access to the records of nonreferred institutions without first obtaining authorization from those institutions for that access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is not the Secretary's intention that a SPRE generally have records or access to records of nonreferred institutions, and the Secretary agrees to clarify this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 667.3(b)(3)(iii) is revised to require State assurance that a SPRE will keep records or have access to records of referred institutions, and will provide requested information to the Secretary for purposes of financial and compliance audits of referred institutions. A new &sect;667.3(b)(3)(iv) is added to require State assurance that SPRE will keep records or have access to records, related to its activities under this part, and will provide requested information to the Secretary, for purposes of program evaluations of the manner in which the SPRE carries out its SPRP responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters suggested that the proposal to include in the State's agreement with the Secretary a description of the SPRE's relationship with State-level entities be removed on the grounds that it would unnecessarily divert SPRE resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees that such relationships would unnecessarily divert SPRE resources. To the contrary, the Secretary believes strongly that to carry out effectively the purposes of this part, a SPRE must avail itself of relevant information regarding the actions that any State agency takes or plans to take with regard to a referred institution in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters acknowledged that the statute requires a SPRE to review referred institutions on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. Several commenters urged the Secretary to require a SPRE to review only those institutions that represent the highest risk for fraud and abuse. A number of other commenters suggested that the SPRE develop additional priorities for the review of this set of institutions that would be compatible with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying these institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary acknowledges that a SPRE's allotment of funds may be inadequate to review all referred institutions on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. For that reason, the Secretary proposed in &sect;667.12(c) and restates in that same section in these regulations, to allow a State to establish review priorities, giving States discretion to establish their own priorities, subject to the requirement for coordinating with the Secretary's schedule for recertification of institutions. The Secretary expects that, to the extent possible, States will select ``high-risk'' institutions for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

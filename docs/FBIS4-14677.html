			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- "The interests of Russia now  are primarily economic, trade and humanitarian ones, that is  absolutely legitimate, normal vital interests of a civilised  democratic state", Dmitriy Ryurikov, assistant to the Russian  president, told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview.    Ryurikov categorically denied assertions that Russia  manifested imperial ambitions in its foreign policy. The  presidential aide emphasised that he does not see "anything  terrible in remarks by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs  Andrey Kozyrev who refers to CIS countries as the area of  Russia's vital interests".    "This is really so. Russia has vital interests in CIS  countries, just as those countries have very serious and vital  interests in Russia", Ryurikov said.    He believes that the vital interests of Russia and CIS  countries closely interweave. All depends on what is understood  by the term "interests", the presidential aide pointed out.    "Russia has moved away from the former Soviet Union's  understanding of `interests' as a desire to monitor and  influence the internal life and foreign policies of other states  and to declare them to be an area of the Soviet Union's special  `interests'. If they disagreed, pressure tactics, the dispatch  of troops, etc. Used to be resorted to," Ryurikov explained.</p>

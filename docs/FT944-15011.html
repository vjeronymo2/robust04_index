			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Personal View: Rising pressure on German unity In the run-up to last Sunday's German elections, controversy over Europe was conspicuous by its absence. This did not happen out of negligence or lack of concern. Germany's main political parties simply could not find enough uncommon ground. So they left it to the marginal parties of a scattered left to raise the subject: the Greens quarrelled with the Brussels technocrats, while the recycled communists sounded their perennial anti-capitalist refrain. Only on the eve of the elections was there a hint of discord. The leaders of the opposition Social Democrats announced that, if they won power, they would renegotiate the terms for a future European currency to guarantee monetary stability. To be pro-European is not only part of political correctness in Germany. It also reflects a widely shared notion of national interest, economic well-being and psychological reassurance. Germany regards the idea of constructing Europe around an 'inner core' as a practical matter, not a religious question. However, spelling out Germany's European agenda until the end of the decade will not be easy. Germans agree there is no alternative to building Europe. However, it will not be without toil and tears - as the issues of economic and monetary union, European defence and the integration of the more eligible central European countries will remind us in coming years. First, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl will press for early admission into the EU of its immediate neighbours to the east. It will be much less enthusiastic about countries further away. Between the Czech Republic and the neighbouring German Lander of Bavaria and Saxony, cross-border trade in goods and services is growing fast. Much German capital investment is flowing to the Bohemian lands. The direct line between Munich in the south and Dresden in the east still goes via Prague. Poland has courageously adopted market reform. Yet it still has not much to offer that would make it an indispensable member of the EU. Germany's interest in seeing Poland in the Union has much to do with geography. It wants a stable neighbour to help to absorb any trouble in the former Soviet Union. Hungary, still struggling with the communist past, is badly in need of some reassurance against the old demons of its Balkan neighbourhood. The big problem for German policymakers in this part of Europe is that the Common Agricultural Policy of the past is incompatible, financially and otherwise, with the German view of the future. But in terms of German farmers and their political muscle, the CAP has not yet outlived its usefulness. How to make European security effective after the waning of the Pax Americana will be even more controversial. The Social Democrats will not raise their sights about deploying the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, outside Nato except under massive United Nations pressure. However, Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats are starting to understand that serious trouble in various parts of the world may require quicker action than the UN can furnish. The Free Democrats, junior partners in the governing coaltion, will tread uneasily over security matters. They will give up hope only gradually of international problems simply melting under the pressure of German goodwill. Now that the constitution no longer provides a pretext for inaction over 'out of area' Bundeswehr deployment, Germany will agonise about the national interest in Europe as well as in the wider world. Last, but not least, the effects of the Maastricht treaty will force the Germans to confront the D-Mark's future. This issue reaches deep into the collective memory of a nation that has had two catastrophic inflations this century. German society has a highly developed need for security, and Germans share with their French neighbours a distrust of politicians managing their money. Any suspicion of cross-breeding between the D-Mark and, say, the drachma would turn Germany into a hothouse of rebellion. The Germans may play safe and stick to the D-Mark and their trust in the Bundesbank, but that may not please all their neighbours. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany is facing the consequences for the whole of Europe of German unification and the end of the cold war. Politicians and the wider public still tend to believe that what is good for Europe is also good for Germany. But the choices ahead will develop a divisive edge. The 1994 Bundestag elections may have been the last ones to provide a very nearly unanimous German view of Europe.

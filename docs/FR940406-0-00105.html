			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The canister is preconditioned by loading it with a 50/50 mixture of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 40 grams of butane per hour, until 2 grams of hydrocarbons are emitted from the canister (referred to as the 2-gram breakthrough point). Alternatively, the canister can be loaded to this point with gasoline vapors by conducting repeated diurnal heat builds. All detailed aspects of the supplemental evaporative emission test procedure, up through the exhaust emission test, apply to integrated ORVR system testing as well (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). The three test sequences (full 3-diurnal evaporative, supplemental evaporative, and refueling) may be performed in any order and exhaust emissions measurements from any of the three may be considered valid. If either evaporative emission sequence has been conducted before the refueling test, the fuel tank drain and fill and vehicle soak that precede the one UDDS preconditioning drive in the refueling test sequence may be skipped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Non-Integrated System Preconditioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Non-integrated ORVR systems store only refueling vapors and therefore warrant a preconditioning drivedown of 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity before being subjected to the 85 percent refueling event. This driving consists of repeated UDDS cycles, either on a track or on a dynamometer, until a volume of fuel equal to 85 percent of the fuel tank nominal capacity has been consumed. During the actual refueling test, the vehicle will be filled to at least 95 percent of tank capacity, as is the case for the integrated system. If manufacturers exercise the option to do less driving in certification testing, EPA may perform subsequent confirmatory and in-use testing using the same reduced driving schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At its discretion, EPA may test non-integrated systems with a partial refueling test procedure. This procedure helps to ensure control in those in-use refueling events in which less than a tankful of fuel is pumped. Because the non-integrated system test allows a nearly complete drivedown of the fuel tank capacity, thus enabling purge design strategies that inappropriately minimize purge during the exhaust emissions test, EPA considers the partial refueling test necessary. It also allows EPA to assess the basic question of whether the system has the capacity to handle a partial fill, a common refueling event in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this partial fill test, following the loading of the canister with butane and fueling of the vehicle to 95 percent of the fuel tank capacity, the vehicle will be driven some integer number of UDDS cycles such that some amount of fuel between 10 and 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity is consumed. After a one to six hour soak, the vehicle will be subjected to the refueling emissions measurement test with no intervening drain and fill. The fuel pumped in the test will be a metered amount, corresponding to the amount consumed in the drive. This amount will be based on the vehicle's fuel economy, as determined at certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Seal Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also at its discretion, EPA may perform a seal test of integrated and non-integrated designs, aimed at verifying the integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor lines. This test eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory driving are therefore likewise eliminated, although EPA may perform the test procedure up through the exhaust emission test (in order to obtain this measurement) and then conduct the bench purge and refueling test. Failure of the seal test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling emissions test and the same standard would apply to both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Cap Removal Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the May 1993 Notice, EPA requested comment on including a test to measure and control the ``puff loss'' emissions from a pressurized fuel tank when the fuel cap is removed for refueling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to refueling emissions, vehicles can have emissions when the fuel cap is removed from a pressurized fuel tank before the refueling event. Although these emissions potentially warrant control, EPA does not view them as ``refueling'' emissions for purposes of section 202(a)(6), since they precede a refueling and are more akin to evaporative emissions. EPA in fact proposed, but did not finalize, such a cap-off test in the evaporative emissions NPRM (55 FR 1914, January 19, 1990) rather than in the ORVR NPRM. Thus Congress would not have been considering such emissions when it enacted the 95 percent minimum control standard in section 202(a)(6) in the 1990 CAAAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Time for Michelin to think again Memo: to the Rt Hon John Major MP, the Rt Hon John Smith MP and Mrs Stella Rimmington, head of MI5. Concerned about security? Worried about those embarrassing leaks to the Press? Allow a humble restaurant correspondent to offer a solution. Consult Derek Brown, editor of the Michelin Guide to Great Britain and Ireland since its inception 21 years ago. He is the man who has, without a single security lapse, just bestowed the coveted stars and Red Meal symbols on 133 dining rooms and supervised the entries on a total of 4,625 hotels and 1,085 restaurants in the 1994 guide (Pounds 10.95). Keeping such secrets has not been easy. In a rare interview Brown admitted that for the past three weeks he, his team of nine inspectors and his Press Office, had been continually questioned by chefs, restaurateurs and the national and catering press as to who would be promoted, demoted or even dropped completely. Not a word had got out. During the course of a year his team travels for 10 months, eats out twice a day and sleeps in a wide variety of hotels (I asked for figures on total annual expenditure but this proved a secret that he would not divulge). In most cases the inspectors introduce themselves after the meal, talk to the chef or proprietor and inspect the kitchen. A dirty kitchen is an immediate disqualification, as is an over-dependence on the deep freeze - happily, Brown stressed, almost a thing of the past. Using this type of continuous assessment, Michelin's inspectors build up a rapport with the British hospitality industry which Brown insists is safeguarded. The team hears trade and family gossip - in one case an inspector was told that the chef planned to divorce his wife and sell the restaurant even before the wife knew of his plans - and keeping these sources of information private is essential for the guide's future. Brown described the Michelin Guide as having been conceived as a 'simple book to help people to get around'. He cited the example of a couple who arrived in Lincoln and who needed to find a room and a restaurant that would meet their requirements but not stretch their wallets. Michelin's annual sales of 80,000 copies for its UK edition worldwide proves that it achieves this ambition. The Michelin guide to the UK stands as a sister volume to its six other European guides. Brown is at pains to stress his and the guide's independence. He travels to France frequently to eat and keep abreast of culinary trends rather visit Michelin's headquarters in Paris. Although Michelin has bestowed its stars since 1974 I am sure it did not anticipate the tears and the financial success or failure which they would generate. This week, at a lunch at Leith's, in west London, before 15 selected food writers, Brown made a short speech in which he stressed that the most satisfying professional element in his years as editor has not been the drama over who gets how many stars but the large increase in the number of entries, from 3,000 to 5,700, and the sharp rise in the overall quality of food and service. Unfortunately, Michelin's policy of not including an introduction to its guide means such facts are not often publicly proclaimed. And serious question marks can be raised against the validity of some awards. Does, for example, Marco Pierre White at the Hyde Park Hotel in Knightsbridge, deserve two stars when, twice to my knowledge, he has asked paying customers to leave his restaurant because they dared to complain about the food? It is also surprising to see the award of a star to the Grill Room at the Cafe Royal, London W10 and even more so to one for The Canteen in SW10. And does Leith's, which served a decidedly unbalanced meal for the guide's launch, also deserve a star? Elsewhere in the capital, there is still only limited recognition for talented Simon Hopkinson at Bibendum, in Michelin House, Fulham Road, SW3 and Alastair Little of Frith Street, W1. There is also a large number of 'ethnic restaurants' which perhaps deserve more recognition. And I also feel that still not enough importance is given by Michelin to the price/quality ratio, an essential ingredient for any service industry in the 1990s. Brown endured criticism of this nature from a fellow restaurant reviewer throughout the lunch and then, when they parted, admitted that they had had the same dispute for the past 20 years. So long as the star system prevails there are bound to be such arguments, particularly when other restaurant reviewers feel they can do the job better and chefs feel their hard work and dedication is under-appreciated. I feel the needs of the Michelin Guide reader would be better served if it reverted to its original remit, to be a 'simple book to help people get around'. Isn't it time for a complete overhaul of the system, for a recognition that culinary stars, like so many trappings of the 1970s and 1980s, are no longer valid? A restaurateur who had held, lost and then regained his Michelin star agreed. Michelin provided 1.3 per cent of his business, regular clients 50 per cent. His recommendation to any aspiring restaurateur is to forget the glory and go for the regulars. Yours sincerely, Nicholas Lander</p>

Prasolov, N.N. </F> Voytenok, Hematology and Blood Transfusion Institute at the  Belarussian Republic Ministry of Public Health and Molecular  Biology Institute at Russia's Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC  577.21]    [Abstract] The antibodies whose structure contains the  molecules of two different antigen-specific segments--the  so-called bispecific antibodies--and which are capable of  cross-binding of molecules and cells and the methods of  producing bispecific antibodies by fusing two hybridoma lines  are discussed, and two approaches to fusing hybridomata  producing monoclonal antibodies (MKA) to the _a_-tumor necrosis  factor (FNO-_a_) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (NPF) of  Escherichia coli are discussed. In one instance, a  G418-stable hypoxanthine, aminopterine, thymidine (GAT)  medium-sensitive partner was hybridized with a ``wild type''  partner while in another, various markers of antibiotic  stability were introduced into both partner with the help of  recombinant retroviral vectors. As a result, quadromata  producing bispecific antibodies were produced by two methods  whereby the quadromata formation efficiency was roughly the same  in each case. The findings show that the use of retroviral  vectors is a faster and simpler way of cell labeling. The method  of hybridoma cell labeling with the help of retroviral vectors  carrying dominant selectable genes of resistance to hygromycin B  and genecytin (G418) has virtually no limitations.

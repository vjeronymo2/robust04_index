			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Brighter prospect of US help for Russia THE prospects for Congressional approval of the US contribution to the Dollars 24bn international assistance package to Russia have been much improved, but not guaranteed, by President Boris Yeltsin's speech to the US legislature on Wednesday. Yesterday, Mr Bill Clinton, the prospective Democratic presidential candidate, had breakfast with the Russian president and afterwards urged Congress to take swift action. Mr Clinton rejected any link between the provision of assistance and Russian progress in identifying US prisoners of war who may have been held on Russian soil. 'We have no reason to believe that he (Mr Yeltsin) will not proceed in complete good faith on that. We would not even know about that issue had he not raised it,' Mr Clinton said. The Congressional leaders still have not set a date for formal consideration of the aid package, the grandly titled Freedom Support Act. Yesterday, Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican, predicted a vote 'in a week or 10 days.' Mr Yeltsin's speech and personal lobbying seem to have swayed doubters on both the Republican right and Democratic left. The most conspicuous convert was Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona and a former prisoner of war, while Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and sceptic on the efficacy of aid to Russia, conceded that the Yeltsin speech 'will win him a lot of votes.' However, Congress still expects President George Bush to follow the successful summit by canvassing hard in the days to come on Capitol Hill. The president said he thought support in Congress for Russian aid was now 'overriding.' Critical voices still resound, even so. For example, Mr Ray Flynn, mayor of Boston, said yesterday it was 'outrageous' that Congress should 'bail out' Russia while providing 'a pittance' to American cities.</p>

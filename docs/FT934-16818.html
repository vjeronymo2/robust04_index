			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Pakistan poll looks unlikely to settle score: Bhutto leads contest where winning votes is only half the battle PAKISTAN goes to the polls tomorrow in its third general election in five years with the leaders of the main parties both claiming victory is in their sights. But independent observers believe Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister between 1988 and 1990, has an edge over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her successor who was forced to resign in July after a prolonged political crisis. However, Ms Bhutto's lead could be so thin that her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) may find it difficult to form a stable government. A poll published by Newsline, a weekly magazine, gave the PPP 34 per cent of the vote against 31 per cent for Mr Sharif's Moslem League and 9 per cent for the Pakistan Islamic Front, an alliance of Islamic parties. Other estimates suggest Ms Bhutto could win 70 to 80 seats in the 217-seat National Assembly - more than Mr Sharif but not enough for a majority. Pakistanis are less interested in the outcome than in the last two elections, which came after 11 years of military dictatorship under General Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. Gen Zia's death unleashed hopes that Pakistan might quickly evolve into a stable democracy - hopes which generated enormous enthusiasm and which have since been dashed. Politics since his demise have been dominated by conflicts within the three-cornered establishment which rules Pakistan - the prime minister, the army and the president. These conflicts brought down Ms Bhutto's government in 1990 and this year destroyed that of Mr Sharif. 'I'm not going to waste time voting. I'm going to work,' says an Islamabad businessman. Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif do not differ greatly on policy. Their economic options are limited by serious current account and government deficits: they largely accept the austerity measures of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister, who has sought emergency funds from the International Monetary Fund. On foreign policy, Ms Bhutto seems more committed than Mr Sharif to solving the dispute over Pakistan's nuclear programme which has soured relations with the west; but Mr Sharif is no isolationist. Meanwhile, both want to reduce the president's powers via a constitutional amendment. However, the two leaders' styles are utterly different. Ms Bhutto, daughter of Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the populist prime minister of the 1970s executed by Gen Zia, has inherited her father's oratorial ability. Tall and elegant, she is treated like a queen by her most loyal supporters. At a rally last week in the southern province of Sind, her home territory, she was presented with a gold crown. Mr Sharif does better in the backrooms of politics than on the campaign platform. He made his name as a businessman and powerbroker in his home base of Punjab, the largest and richest province, and won Gen Zia's attention with his skill in the murky financial dealings which underlie Pakistan's politics. The campaigns have not been short of vitriol, including charges of corruption, murder and terrorism. Ms Bhutto accuses Mr Sharif of abusing power almost as much as General Zia. Mr Sharif retorts that he stands for 'democracy not dynasty' - a reference to the Bhutto family's domination of the PPP. Mr Qureshi's interim government has added spice by publishing names of loan defaulters to highlight abuses by the rich and famous. Ms Bhutto is riding the crest of a wave largely of Mr Sharif's making. Just last year, her support seemed at its nadir when PPP protest marches fizzled out. Mr Sharif appeared to be firmly in power, working closely with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and with military leaders who seemed content to take a back seat. But the delicate power balances collapsed when the army chief of staff died suddenly and Mr Sharif and Mr Ishaq Khan quarrelled over appointing a successor. The arguments escalated into a bitter struggle in which each tried to curb the other's power. The president dissolved the National Assembly in April only to be overruled by the Supreme Court. Eventually, the army generals urged both the prime minister and the president to resign. Mr Sharif has lost the military and bureaucratic establishment's backing. But he is not without resources: he has money and professional managers and the support of big business. His party appeals to many middle-class Pakistanis. Moreover, he has made political capital out of the fact that Ms Bhutto, for all her democratic ideology, co-operated with the president when he tried to dissolve the National Assembly. Ms Bhutto is the beneficiary of all the turmoil. On the campaign trail she behaves like a leader who feels confident of returning to the prime minister's office. But as she knows from her own experience and from Mr Sharif's more recent travails, winning an election is only half the game. The other half begins once the votes are counted.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Yuriy Fefofanov: "Who Will Be </F> Judged for What in Russia"]    [Text] As a general rule, criminal codes consist of  two halves: "General Part" and "Special Part." The first half  gives the basic principles of criminal legislation; this is its  philosophy. The second part enumerates the criminally punishable  acts and the punishments corresponding to them. We shall now  discuss the "General Part" of the craft Criminal Code--it was  developed by the Ministry of Justice and the president's State  Legal Administration.    Will discussion in parliament get around to this draft?  It is hard to say. The Criminal Code in general is having a hard  time. The 1960-model code, which is still in effect, is  obsolete. A draft appeared in 1991--it was published in the  journal ZAKON. It was never even discussed. And here is a new  draft.    Doctors of Jurisprudence S.G. Kelina and I.M. Galperin  helped in the expert assessment of the draft Criminal Code.  <H5>  What Is Crime? </H5>   Criminal law must first of all answer this "simple"  question. How is it to be distinguished from the host of human  actions which, although they may be of a negative nature, do not  warrant jail and certainly not "the noose"?    The Criminal Code now in effect:    "A crime shall be deemed to be a socially dangerous act  (action or inaction) specified by criminal law which threatens  the social structure of the USSR, its political and economic  systems, socialist property, the individual, and political,  labor, property, and other rights and freedoms of citizens...."    It is interesting to compare this with the draft of the 1913  Criminal Code, which was not adopted either.    "A crime shall be an action or inaction specified by the  present code that is dangerous to the socialist state of workers  and peasants or the socialist law and order established in it."  Protection of the individual is not mentioned at all--only the  "state of workers and peasants" is protected.    And what does the present draft have to say about crime?    "A crime shall be deemed to be an act prohibited by criminal  law under the threat of punishment. Socially dangerous shall be  deemed to be an act that causes or creates the possibility of  causing harm to objects protected by criminal law."    In the first three definitions of crime there are the  "society" and the "state," which inevitably politicizes the  point of departure of all criminal legislation. But do the  society and state have to protect themselves. Undoubtedly. But  then is it possible to avoid "politics"? It seems to me that  this was done in the draft of the 1991 Criminal Code which never  reached the point of discussion.    It seems that the authors of the draft managed to enclose  the  definition of a crime within a purely legal framework and yet it  is fairly exhaustive.    So is it worthwhile to give a very great deal of thought to  such a "simple" thing as the definition of a crime; to weigh  everything on the most precise scales so that in the list of  specific acts and punishments there will be no loophole for  arbitrariness. "Theoretical" imprecision in practice leads to  derailing the proceedings of the State Committee of the Russian  Federation on the Administration of State Property and  justification of political violence. The Roman principle "nullum  crimen sine lege" (there is no crime unless it is indicated in  the law) proclaimed by the compiler of the draft of the Criminal  Code must be upheld to the end in all its purity...  <H5>  The Death Penalty for the Firm </H5>   Criminal liability of legal entities is something new  and unusually for our law. That is, not living people but  organizations may be sentenced to criminal punishment. It seemed  to me that this breaks away from the general principles of  criminal law.    CHAPTER 16. CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF LEGAL ENTITIES    Article 106. Grounds for criminal liability.    (1) A legal entity shall be subject criminal liability for  acts specified by criminal law if:    a) the legal entity is guilty of failing to fulfill or  fulfilling improperly a direct prescription of the law, which  establishes the obligation or prohibition to conduct certain  activity;    b) a legal entity is guilty of conducting activity that does  not correspond to its constituent documents or declared  objectives;    c) an act that caused harm or created the threat of causing  harm to an individual, the society, or the state was committed  in the interests of the given legal entity or was allowed,  sanctioned, approved, or used by an organ or individual  performing the functions of management of the legal entity.    2. The criminal liability of a legal entity shall not  preclude the liability of the individual for his commission of a  crime.    Article 107. Types of punishment.    (1) As basic punishments it is possible to impose fines,  prohibit engaging in a particular kind of activity, or liquidate  the legal entity.    (2) As additional punishment it is possible to prohibit a  particular activity or confiscate property.    "Is the innovation of criminal liability of a legal entity  not flouting the very foundations of criminal law? An individual  and not the organization is responsible for the act. Only the  Nuremberg Tribunal accused an organization of a crime. Is that  not so?"    "No," says the person with whom I was talking, "the legal  systems of many countries stipulate the liability of legal  entities: England, America, France. And we have an extreme need  for this. Take ecological crimes--it is not enough for only the  officials to be responsible. Or legal violations regarding  taxes. And all the 'Panama affairs' with checks, auctions, and  deposits. Or the mass media: Certain newspapers are directly  calling for violence and war. The measures specified by civil  legislation are clearly inadequate."    "But will individuals who are guilty of crimes not hide  behind legal entities? Remember our recent sanctions? The  enterprises easily paid the fines and continued to destroy  nature."    "But the liability of the legal entity does not remove the  blame from the individual. Unfortunately, the parties mainly to  blame have always escaped responsibility. The guilt of the  collective subject established by a court, the sentence of this  court--the sentence that declares the organization's actions to  be criminal--in the present chaos will help to single out legal  business, even if it is with an element of risk, from criminal  business into which entire firms are sometimes drawn."    Criminal liability of legal entities will certainly evoke  disputes. Still, the basic postulate of criminal law--the  actually liable person is responsible--does not fit completely  into the innovation. I personally am bothered by one thing: Will  it not turn out that the sentence for the organization will save  the organizers from a sentence.  <H5>  Justified Risk </H5>   The draft Criminal Code, it seems to me, proposes a  very important and typical market norm which will give a person  the "right to a justified risk."    Article 45. Justified risk.    (1) It shall not be a crime to cause harm to legally  protected interests when there is an objectively justified risk  for achieving a socially useful goal.    (2) The risk shall deemed justified if the goal that has  been  set cannot be achieved by actions that do not involve risk and  the individual who has taken the risk has taken the necessary  measures to prevent harm to legally protected interests.    (3) Risk shall not be deemed justified if it was known to  involve the threat of an ecological catastrophe or social  disaster.    That would be a legal form for the recent  command-administrative times! Do not count "commanders of  production, as they were called at the time, who would take  literally a fatal risk to do something useful for the people in  spite of stupid prohibitions. At that time there was only one  principle: Do the absurd, but according to Marx; push  unmarketable products but fulfill the plan; throw seeds onto  frozen ground but do not disobey the raykom [rayon committee].  Some brave souls departed from the absurd and spent the rest of  their days in jail. Yes, much has receded into the past.  Nonetheless enterprisingness, innovation, the achievement of a  legitimate advantage have always involved risk. There is no  business at all without risk. But is it right, for example, for  the board of a joint-stock company to risk the stockholders'  money for their own sake? Is a risky operation allowable if the  patient has agreed to it but it is not envisioned by medical  canons? Life is always presenting us with situations that do not  appear in the textbooks. And our law has not tried to regulate  them.  <H5>  Is an Order the Law? </H5>   What should a soldier do if he has received an order  that is more or less clear? And what should a bookkeeper do if  his direct superior orders him to distort the reports. And who  will go to court if the subordinate has carried out a legal  order?    Article 46. Execution of an order    (1) It shall not be considered a crime if harm is caused to  legally protected interests by an individual who is acting to  execute an order that is mandatory for him or any other  instruction given according to the established procedure and in  compliance with the proper form.    (2) Causing harm to legally protected interests as a result  of the execution of an illegal order or other instruction shall  not entail liability if the individual was unaware of its  illegal character. In this case the liability for the act  committed in execution of an illegal order or instruction shall  be born by the individual who issued this order or instruction.    (3) Execution of an order or other instruction that is known  to be illegal shall entail criminal liability but there can be  mitigating circumstances.    (4) Failure to execute an illegal or criminal order or other  instruction shall not involve criminal liability.    Article 8 of the Regulations of the Nuremberg Tribunal: "The  fact that the accused was acting on instructions from the  government or an order from his superior shall not relieve him  or responsibility."    Our popular semi-proverb "the order of the superior is the  law for the subordinate" harbors a very deep contradiction.    During war time the absolute nature of the order for the  subordinate was formulated clearly in the Regulations: It was to  be carried out without questioning whether it was criminal or  not. Do it! All responsibility lay with the individual who gave  the order. The draft Criminal Code proposes a different norm: It  shall be a crime to execute a criminal order. But how is the  subordinate to determine which order is legitimate and which is  criminal? Can the call from the country's vice president to  storm the city facilities be regarded as an order? What were the  tank drivers who were given orders to open fire on the  parliament supposed to do?    There is no doubt that such a norm of law places each  follower of orders in the face of a serious problem of choice.  How is the "switchman" supposed to recognize the legality or  illegality of an order?    The legal experts with whom I was speaking answered: The  "switchman," of course, is always the fall guy; but he does  control switches; he is capable of diverting the train; but  ultimately he is a "homo sapiens" and not an automaton for which  the leaders do the thinking.    Obviously, in these norms the law corresponds very closely  to  morality and a sense of justice plays a decisive role in the  selection of possibilities of behavior. So it would be possible  to exclaim after the poet: "Where there is no morality, what  good are useless laws?" But still the attempt on the part of the  authors of the draft Criminal Code to legally regulate precisely  these complicated, nonstandard, extraordinary situations seems  useful.  <H5>  Confiscation </H5>   When you read the draft Criminal Code offered for  discussion you get the impression that in many respects it has  held to a position somewhere between the old and the new. I  think this is especially clearly seen in the inclusion of  confiscation of property as a separate punishment (Article 55).  The people with whom I was speaking commented somewhat  enigmatically: "That is an old question."    Article 55. Confiscation of property    (1) Confiscation of property shall be forced removal of  property to state ownership of all or part of the property owned  by the accused.    (2) Confiscation of property shall be prescribed for crimes  that are grave, especially grave, and exceptionally grave  committed with a selfish purpose and may be imposed only in  cases stipulated by criminal law.    (3) Property needed by the accused or his dependents shall  not be subject to confiscation...    Yes, perhaps it is old, like Chernomor's. In Rus for ages  the  property of guilty parties and falsely guilty parties "has been  confiscated by the state," especially if there was something to  confiscate. At the beginning of the last century Aleksandr I  declared confiscation to be a separate punishment. Soviet rule,  having made pillage the norm of life, soon promoted it to a norm  of law as well. Since that time confiscation has been in all the  codes as an independent punishment. The crime may not have been  related in any way to the criminal enrichment--still, according  to the sentence, everything was taken except what was needed to  survive.    Yes, what has been criminally gained, if this is proven in  court, must be taken away; there is no question about that. But  this must be clearly documented. It is not enough to make  mention of a crime "committed with a selfish end." It is  necessary to indicate unequivocally what is subject to  confiscation and when.    The draft Criminal Code contains much that is new, and  a good deal has been clarified. The norms of the "General Part"  of the draft code lay the foundations for sanctions against  organized crime, they strengthen punishments for repeat offenses  (cumulative punishments), they introduce life imprisonment, and  the clarify the liability of repeat offenders. The draft takes a  large step from the "socialist" criminal law now in force to a  legal Criminal Code.    but here is the question: Will the parliament adopt the  new Criminal Code? In 1991 the Ministry of Justice of the  Russian Federation developed a draft Criminal Code which  corresponded to market relations. It was not even discussed. Now  the draft with which we have familiarized the readers has been  submitted. But the parliament is busy patching up the old,  socialist code. And the question arises of its own accord: Are  they not expecting times like 1939? If so, I have the draft  Criminal Code from that time in front of me. Perhaps it should  be proposed to the parliament.</p>

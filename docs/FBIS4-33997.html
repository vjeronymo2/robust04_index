			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of the Second Lacandona Jungle Declaration issued by </F> the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command  of the Zapatist National Liberation Army "from the mountains of  southeastern Mexico" in June 1994]    [Text] Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]    Mexico    Second Lacondona Jungle Declaration    Today we say: We will not surrender!    "...it is not only they who carry swords, who shed blood,  and  who emit radiant rays of military glory who are chosen to choose  the personnel of a government for a people who want to  democratize themselves; it is also the right of citizens who  have fought in the media, who are identified with the principles  of the revolution, who have fought the despotism that is  undermining our laws because it is not only by firing bullets in  the battlefields that tyrannies are defeated; it is also by  launching ideas of redemption, expressions of freedom, and  terrible curses against the executioners of the people that  dictatorships and empires are overthrown (...) and if the  historic facts show us that the demolition of all tyrannies,  that the overthrow of all bad governments is the joint work of  the idea with the sword, it is an absurd thing, it is an  aberration, it is an outrageous despotism to want to segregate  the healthy elements who have the right to elect the government  because the sovereignty of a people is made up of all healthy  elements who have a full awareness of their rights, whether they  are civilians or accidentally armed people, but who love freedom  and justice and work for the good of the fatherland." --  Emiliano Zapata in the voice of Paulino Martinez, Zapatist  delegate to the Sovereign Revolutionary Convention,  Aguascalientes, Mexico, 27 October 1914.    To the people of Mexico:    To the peoples and governments of the world:    Brothers:    The EZLN, on a war footing against the bad government since  1  January 1994, addresses you to explain our thoughts:    I. Mexican brothers:    In December 1993, we said ENOUGH! On 1 January 1994, we  called on the legislative and judicial branches to assume their  constitutional responsibility to prevent the genocidal policy  that the federal executive branch is imposing on our people, and  we based our constitutional right by applying Article 39 of the  political Constitution of the United States of Mexico:    "The national sovereignty essentially orignates with and  resides in the people. All public power comes from the people  and is instituted for the benefit of the people. The people  have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify its  government."    This call was answered with an extermination policy and  lies.  The branches of government disregarded our just demands and  allowed the massacre to be carried out. But the nightmare only  lasted 12 days, because another force, superior to any political  or military power, prevailed over the parties involved in the  conflict. Civilian society assumed the duty of preserving our  fatherland; it expressed its disagreement with the massacre and  forced a dialogue. We all understood that the days of the  eternally ruling party, which uses for its own benefit the  product of the work of all Mexicans, cannot continue any longer,  that the presidentialism that supports it inhibits freedom and  cannot be allowed, that the fraudulent culture is the method by  which democracy is limited and suppressed, that justice only  exists for corrupt and powerful people, that we must make those  in power learn how to obey, and that there is no other way.    This is something all honest Mexicans and all good-willed  civilian society has understood. The only ones who are opposed  are those who have based their success on stealing public  assets; those who protect drug traffickers and murderers,  thereby corrupting the justice system; and those who resort to  political assassinations and electoral fraud to impose their  wills.    Only these political fossils are planning to return to  Mexico's past and to erase from the national conscience the  shout that the entire country has cried out since 1 January  1994: ENOUGH!    We should not let this happen. Today, we are not calling  upon the government's ineffective branches that failed to  fulfill their constitutional duties by allowing the executive  branch to control them. Although the current legislators and  magistrates have been undignified, others will come who will  understand that they must serve their people and not themselves.  Our call goes beyond a six-year administration or an  approaching presidential election. Our sovereignty rests upon  CIVILIAN SOCIETY; people are the ones who at any time can alter  or modify our form of government, and have already decided to do  so. It is the people to whom we issue a call in this.    SECOND LACANDONA JUNGLE DECLARATION    We say to them:    First: We have faithfully complied with conducting military  actions within the framework of international agreements on war.  This has given us the tacit recognition of nationals and  foreigners as a belligerent force. We will continue honoring  those agreements.    Second: We have ordered our regular and irregular forces  throughout the national territory and abroad to observe a  UNILATERAL EXTENSION OF THE CEASE-FIRE. We will continue to  respect the cease-fire TO PERMIT CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO ORGANIZE IN  WHATEVER WAYS IT DEEMS BEST TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE TRANSITION TO  DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY.    Third: We condemn the threat to civilian society posed by  the country's militarization with personnel and modern  repressive equipment prior to the upcoming federal elections.  There is no doubt that the government of Salinas de Gortari  will try to succeed through the culture of fraud. WE WILL NOT  LET THIS HAPPEN.    Fourth: We propose to all independent political parties that  they now recognize the intimidation and denial of political  rights our people have suffered for the past 65 years and that  they demand a government of political transition toward  democracy.    Fifth: We reject manipulation and the attempt to separate  our just demands from those of the Mexican people. We are  Mexicans and will not give up our demands or our weapons until  we have achieved democracy, liberty, and justice for all.    Sixth: We reiterate our desire for a political solution in  Mexico's transit toward democracy. We urge civilian society to  resume the heroic role it had in stopping the military phase of  the war and to organize to conduct peaceful efforts toward  democracy, liberty, and justice. A democratic change is the  only alternative to war.    Seventh: We invite honest members of our civilian society to  participate in a national dialogue for democracy, liberty, and  justice for all Mexicans.    This is why we say:    II. Brothers:    After the war started in January 1994, the united voice of  the Mexican people stopped the confrontation and called for a  dialogue among the conflicting parties. The federal government  responded to the just demands of the EZLN with offers that  failed to touch the basic point of the problem: a lack of  justice, liberty, and democracy on Mexican soil.    The degree of compliance with the proposals made by the  federal government to the EZLN's demands has been determined by  the political system of the ruling party. This system has  allowed another power, which is above constitutional power, to  exist in Mexican territory. Its roots keep the party in power.  This system of complicity has promoted the existence and  belligerence of bossism, the omnipotent power of cattlemen and  merchants, and the infiltration of drug trafficking... The  simple offering of the so-called Compromise for a Dignified  Peace in Chiapas provoked a great uproar and open defiance on  the part of these people. The single-party political system is  trying to maneuver in this reduced horizon imposed by its  existence. It cannot refrain from attacking these groups  without hurting itself and it cannot leave things as they are  without seeing an increase in the belligerence of peasants and  Indians. In sum, compliance with the commitments implies,  necessarily, the death of the system of the party of the state.  By suicide or execution, the death of the current Mexican  political system is a necessary condition, although not  sufficient by itself, in our country's journey to democracy.  There will be no real solutions to Chiapas' problems unless  Mexico's problems are settled.    The EZLN realizes that the problem of Mexican poverty is not  caused by a lack of resources alone. Its main contribution is  to understand and point out that any effort, in one aspect or  another, will only postpone a solution unless these efforts are  made within a new framework of national, regional, and local  political relations: a framework of democracy, liberty, and  justice. The problem of power will not depend on who is the  leader, but on who will exercise it. If power is exercised by a  majority, the political parties will be forced to confront that  majority and not one another.    Viewing the problem of power within the framework of  democracy, liberty, and justice will force the creation of a new  political culture within the parties. A new class of  politicians should be born, and undoubtedly, a new types of  political parties will be born.    We are not proposing a new world but the start of a new  Mexico. This revolution would not end with the creation of a new  class, part of a class or group in power, but in free and  democratic "space" for political struggle. This free and  democratic "space" will be born from the stinking corpse of the  system of the party of the state and the presidential system. A  new political relationship will be born. A new policy whose base  is not a confrontation between political organizations but a  confrontation between their political proposals and the various  social classes, because the head of political power, and not its  exercise, will depend on the GENUINE support offered by these  groups. In this new political relationship, the new proposals  of system and course (Socialism, Capitalism, Social Democracy,  Liberalism, Christian Democracy, and so on) must convince a  majority of the nation that their proposal is the best for the  country, not that they will be "watched" by the country they  lead to ensure they offer regular reports and are subjected to  the nation's opinion on whether they should remain in power or  be removed. A plebiscite is a regulated means to confront  power, both the power of party and nation, and it deserves an  important place in the ultimate law of the country.    The current Mexican legislation is too narrow for this new  policy between rulers and those being ruled. There is a need  for a NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION to produce a PROVISIONAL OR  TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT through the resignation of the federal  chief executive or through elections.    The NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND TRANSITIONAL  GOVERNMENT should produce a new Constitution and new elections  should be called within its framework. This process will always  cause less pain to the country than that produced by a civil  war. The prophecy of the south is valid for the entire country,  and we can learn from past developments and make the delivery of  the new Mexico less painful.    The EZLN has an idea of what system the country should have  and what course it should follow. The political maturity of the  EZLN, its coming of age as a representative of the feelings of  part of the nation is based on the premise that it does not wish  to impose this idea on the nation. The EZLN demands for itself  what is evident: The coming of age of Mexico and the right to  decide, freely and democratically, the course it should follow.  This historic start will not only produce a fairer and improved  Mexico, but also a new Mexico. We will risk our lives in this  -- in giving to future Mexicans a country in which it is not  shameful to live...    The EZLN, in an unprecedented democratic exercise within the  armed organization, consulted its components on whether it  should sign the peace agreement proposal presented by the  federal government. In light of the fact that the main issues  of democracy, liberty, and justice for all have not been  resolved, the EZLN rank and file, which mostly comprises  Indians, has decided to reject the signing of the government  proposal.    Being under siege and pressured from various flanks which  have threatened us with extermination if we failed to sign for  peace, we, the Zapatists, reaffirm our determination to attain  peace with justice and dignity, and in this endeavor we will  offer our lives. We are again continuing the dignified struggle  of our forefathers. The dignified call of insurgent Vicente  Guerrero -- "Live for the Homeland or Die for Liberty" -- is  coming out again from our throats. We cannot accept peace  without dignity.    Our decision to fight resulted from the impossibility to  fight peacefully for fundamental human rights, of which the most  valuable is the right to choose, with freedom and democracy, a  system of government. Currently, the possibility of a peaceful  transition to democracy and freedom is facing a new struggle,  namely, the electoral process of August 1994. There are those  who are preparing for the postelectoral period by preaching  apathy and disappointment from their stagnant positions. They  seek to benefit from the blood shed by those who have fallen on  all combat fronts, violent as well as peaceful, in the city and  in the countryside. They are basing their political project on  the postelectoral conflict, and hope, without doing anything,  that political demobilization will again open the heavy gates of  war. They will save, so they claim, the country.    Others, from now on, are anticipating that the armed  conflict  will begin before the elections and that the ensuing  ungovernability will help them retain power. As they did  yesterday, when they usurped the popular will through electoral  fraud -- and, as they do today and will do tomorrow -- while in  the confusion of preelectoral conflict, they are seeking to  prolong the agony of a dictatorship which, disguised under the  official party, has already lasted decades. Other sterile  harbingers of apocalypse believe that a war is unavoidable, and  they sit in wait for the corpse of their enemy... or of their  friend, to be walked on. The sectarian mistakenly believes that  the firing of rifles in and of itself will bring the dawn our  people have awaited since that day when the night fell upon them  following the deaths of Villa and Zapata on Mexican ground.    All of these thieves of hope believe that behind our  weapons,  there is ambition and a thirst for prestige, and that this will  lead our path in the future. They are mistaken. There are  other weapons behind our weapons -- the weapons of reason. Hope  drives both types of weapons, and we will not let anyone take  them away.    Hope by way of the trigger had its moment at the beginning  of  the year. It must now wait. It is necessary that the hope that  exists in broad-based movements returns to playing the pivotal  role it deserves out of right and reason. The flag is now in  the hands of those who have names and faces; good, honest people  who walk paths that are not ours, but whose goal is the same as  we are fighting for. We respect these men and women and we  respect and hope they will take that flag to its rightful place.  We will be waiting, standing up with dignity. If that flag  falls, we will pick it up again...    Let hope be organized and walk now in the valleys and  cities, as it did yesterday in the mountains. Fight with the  weapons available to you. Do not worry about us. We will know  how to resist until the end. We will know how to wait... and we  will know if the doors are closed again, so that dignity can  prevail.    That is why we are addressing our brothers of nongovernment  organizations, of peasant and Indian organizations; workers of  the countryside and the city; teachers and students; housewives  and settlers; artists and intellectuals; and members of  independent parties of Mexico:    We appeal for a national dialogue on the topic of democracy,  liberty, and justice. In turn, we are now calling for a  National Democratic Convention (CDN).    We, the Zapatist National Liberation Army, are striving to  achieve the democracy, liberty, and justice that our fatherland  deserves, whereas: First, the supreme government has also  usurped the legality bequeathed to us by the heroes of the  Mexican revolution. Second, the existing Constitution no longer  reflects the will of the Mexican people. Third, the ouster of  the usurping federal government does not suffice, and it is  necessary to have a new law for our new fatherland, which will  be born of the struggles of all honest Mexicans. Fourth, all  forms of struggle are necessary to achieve a transition to  democracy in Mexico.    We appeal for the holding of a CDN [expansion unknown],  sovereign and revolutionary, which will propose a transitional  government and a new national law, a new constitution that will  guarantee the legal fulfillment of the people's will. The  fundamental objective of the CDN is to organize the civil  expression and defense of the people's will.    The sovereign revolutionary convention will be national  inasmuch as its composition must include all states of the  federation. It will be pluralist because all patriotic forces  will be represented. It will be democratic in the making of  decisions because we will utilize national consultations.    The convention will be chaired freely and voluntarily by  civilians and public personalities of renowned prestige,  regardless of their political affiliation, race, religious  creed, sex, or age.    The convention will comprise civilians through local,  regional, and state committees in villages, neighborhoods,  schools, and factories. These convention committees will be  charged with gathering the people's proposals for the new  constitution and their demands to be met by the new government,  which will stem from the new constitution. The convention must  demand the holding of free and democratic elections and struggle  tirelessly for respect of the people's will.    The EZLN will recognize the CDN as the authentic  representative of the interests of the Mexican people in their  transition to democracy.    The EZLN exists throughout the territory of the nation and  is  now in a position to offer itself to the Mexican people, as  guarantor of the fulfillment of the people's will.    For the first meeting of the CDN, the EZLN offers a Zapatist  town as a venue and all the resources available to it. The date  and place of the first session of the CDN will be announced in a  timely manner.    III. Mexican brothers:    Our struggle continues. The Zapatist flags continue waving  in the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Today we declare: We  will not surrender!    In the mountains, we spoke with our dead so that they could  point us to the road on which our gagged people must march.  Drums resonated and the earth spoke of our pains and our  history. Our dead say: "Everything to everybody." As long as  this does not happen, there will be nothing for us.    Speak on behalf of other Mexicans, look into your hearts and  speak to those for whom we struggle. Invite them to walk the  honorable road of the faceless. Urge everybody to resist; let  no one receive anything from those who give orders for the sake  of giving orders. Turn the not-for-sale principle into the  common banner of the majority. Ask those who speak encouraging  phrases to give us more than words for our pain. Ask them to  share our pain, to resist at your side, and to reject alms from  the powerful. Let the good people from this land put together  today the dignity that gives them the strength to resist and  that prevents selling out. Let them put together this dignity to  demand tomorrow that those who govern remain truthful to and  hail the essence in the heart of the majority. Let the good  road win in order that those who give the orders do so while  obeying.    Do not surrender! Resist! Do not dishonor the truth!  Resist with dignity in the land of true men and women. Let the  mountains nestle the pain of the men of corn. Do not surrender!  Resist! Do not sell out! Resist!    This is how the essence in the heart of all of those who  have  died. We have sensed that what our dead are saying is true and  that their advice is truthful and honorable. This is why we are  appealing to all of our Mexican Indian brothers to resist with  us. We appeal to all peasants, workers, employees, settlers,  housewives, students, and teachers, those whose life means  thinking and speaking, and those who have dignity and honor. We  appeal to all of them to resist with us because the corrupt  government does not want democracy in our land. We will not  accept anything from the rotten heart of the bad government --  not a single coin, or medicine, or rock, or one single grain, or  the crumb of alms they are offering in exchange for our  honorable march.    We will accept nothing from the supreme government; even if  our pain and suffering increase; even if death continues sitting  at our table, in our land, and in our beds; even if we see that  others sell out to the oppressor; even if we ache everywhere;  and even if the rocks cry out in pain. We will accept nothing.  We will resist. We will accept nothing from the government.  We will resist until those who give the orders do so by obeying.    Brothers, do not sell yourselves out. Resist with us. Do  not surrender. Resist with us. Repeat with us these words,  brothers: "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" Let this  be heard not only in the mountains of the Mexican southeast but  also in the north and in the peninsulas, on both coasts, and in  the middle of the country. Let this be shouted in the valleys  and the mountains. Let this resound in the cities and in the  countryside. Unite, brothers; thunder with us; let our demands  be your demands! "We will not surrender! We are resisting!"    Let dignity break the siege with which the dirty hands of  the  corrupt government is suffocating us. We are all besieged.  They do not let democracy, liberty, or justice enter Mexican  territory. Brothers, we are all besieged. Let us not surrender!  Let us resist! Let us be honorable! Let us not sell out!    What good will wealth do for the powerful, if they cannot  buy  what is most valuable in this land, if the dignity of the  Mexicans cannot be bought? What good will power do for the  powerful?    Dignity does not surrender! Dignity resists! Democracy!  Liberty! Justice!    [Signed] From the mountains of southeastern Mexico,  Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command of  the EZLN    [Dated] Mexico, June 1994</p>

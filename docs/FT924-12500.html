			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (6): Seeking solutions overseas / Profile of NFC WHEN NFC, the UK-based transport and logistics giant, decided to pack up its Home Services Division and move to North America a year ago, it was not looking for cheaper labour, a more favourable tax climate or relief from trade barriers. Its aim was to place a corporate division in the heart of its increasingly international business and in the process raise the company's profile in the minds of US investors. Best known in Britain for its Pickfords and Hoults Group home moving services, NFC viewed the US and Canada as prime markets for business expansion and sources of fresh investment capital. The company, which advertises itself as 'the world's largest mover', has in recent years struggled to keep its UK operations profitable. A moribund UK property market has halved the company's home moving business there and had also depressed results from the home delivery services NFC's Merchants Group provides for UK retailers. Other sectors of NFC businesses have also come under fire, with its big Logistics group undergoing reorganisation in 1991. Successive losses in its Pickford Travel unit resulted in the sale of the unit in 1991, with the remainder of NFC's Travel and Property division being scaled down. Until UK interest rates decline and the domestic home mortgage market revives, NFC executives are looking to geographic expansion and product innovations to fuel growth, particularly in the Home Services division. When the division moved to North America, NFC was already deriving 30 per cent of its profits from US and Canadian operations and wanted to expand non-UK profits to 50 per cent by the end of 1992. So Mr Denis Olliver, NFC's managing director of the Home Services Division, was not entirely surprised when the company's chief executive, Mr Jack Mather, called him into the Bedford, UK executive suite in early 1991 and suggested Mr Olliver move, with his divisional staff, to the US. 'While NFC has significant employee ownership, we had just converted the ratio of our ADRs from one for one, to one for five. That increased the face value of the shares and - we hoped - would attract institutional investor interest in the US. 'The relocation had become a shareholder issue. We wanted more visibility in the US and Canada,' Mr Olliver said. From a personal perspective, the relocation order was more of a jolt. 'I had just that afternoon signed a contract for a new house. My wife had wanted to move closer to her mother and we had found a place just 8 miles away,' Mr Olliver says. and 'I told her we were moving, but that it was not going to be eight miles away from her mother, it was going to be 4,000.' Aside from the shareholder issues, the scope of NFC's North American operations made it strategically important that one UK member of the NFC Board should have a North American perspective and be available to the US and Canadian business managers for direct communication. The company owns Illinois-based Allied Van Lines, the second or third-largest of the 23 leading van lines in the US, depending on the measure used. Orange and Black Allied trucks move households across the US, with Allied's profits holding at Dollars 16m in 1991, in spite of a faltering US economy. NFC bolstered its home moving business this year by acquiring Allied Van Lines, Canada. It also operates Pickfords, Canada. Another divisional business, California-based Merchants Home Delivery Service, was growing rapidly through acquisitions and successful marketing. Merchants' trucks and staff perform home deliveries of appliances and furniture for some of the US's largest retailers, including Sears, J C Penny's and Federated Department Stores, the parent of Bloomingdales. Merchants, which had income of Dollars 40m in 1985, grew to a Dollars 120m business in 1991. Separate from the Home Services Division, but still in North America, NFC-owned Exel Logistics was building a reputation as one of the largest independent providers of warehousing and distribution services in the US. Anxious to accomplish the relocation relatively swiftly, NFC executives narrowed potential sites to Atlanta and three US cities where the subsidiary businesses were already headquartered. Atlanta, with its warm weather, active international airport and friendly business climate was attractive but the suburban Chicago location was finally selected. 'First, we liked its central location, within the US and globally. We have operations in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Europe and the UK. In the UK we only had a one-hour overlap in the business day with Australia. In Chicago we overlap by several hours with the UK and Australia - we like the timeliness, the improved communications,' Mr Olliver said. Since Allied already had a well-established infrastructure in Chicago, NFC had only to move the core of its Home Services staff. Legal, marketing, and other support staff were already in place. The marriage of the Allied office into a corporate divisional headquarters had the added benefit of giving US employees there more promotional opportunities within NFC. Although NFC employees are unionised in the UK, they are not in the US, and union issues were not a factor in the NFC move. A big factor in the selection process for the globe-trotting executive was Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. A new international terminal is due to open at O'Hare in mid-1993. The state-of-the art terminal will double the amount of square footage devoted to international travellers and will have 21 gates, 156 ticketing postions and 68 customs inspections stations. A 'people-mover' system will transport weary travellers to the central core of the airport. NFC did not seek tax or other incentives from Chicago or Illinois to sweeten the move. 'There wasn't time and I don't believe in them,' Mr Olliver said. However, he said that Allied Van Lines did accept a tax and training incentive package from Mr Jim Thompson, then the governor of Illinois, after it considered a move to Texas several years ago. The move - predictably for a company in the moving business - went well. Executives say NFC is already benefitting from having input with 'an American point of view'. The cultural import was first seen in a revamp of the Home Services Division's marketing literature. 'Everything we sent out to shareholders, all our communications, have been completely de-Anglicised,' Mr Olliver says. He says the managers of NFC's American companies now believe NFC has a better feel for their businesses. He also thinks that he gets a fresh viewpoint and exposure to new ideas. 'What we try to do here is not keep re-inventing the wheel. If something is working in California, we try to see how it would work across all our operations. We have a real exchange of ideas worldwide.' Illinois-based NFC executives have also assisted in a Dollars 20m computer revamp at Allied, a measure the company is undertaking to diversify Allied's services and leave it positioned for growth as the US economy recovers. Real financial dividends of the relocation have yet to be measured. NFC was due to release its 1992 financial report in early October. Mr Olliver says the fading US economy will keep the Home Services division results flat for the year, but that revenue declines are not expected.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Observer: Henkel dives into soap war More dirty suds spill over from the Unilever-Procter &amp; Gamble soap war. Germany's Henkel group is foaming at the mouth, fearful it may get washed up in the overflow. The detergent and chemicals group has shot out a panic press release from its Dusseldorf HQ, informing the world that 'German Persil has nothing to do with English Persil Power'. Henkel has been swamped with queries about whether its Persil contains the magic Unilever formula - which P&amp;G says rots fibres. But Henkel launched its Persil in Germany back in 1907; the brand remains Germany's undisputed market leader. Unilever has controlled the rights to market Persil in Britain and France 'for decades', says Henkel. Everywhere else in Europe, the product is a German one. Henkel's statement scrupulously avoided taking sides in the slanging match between the two Anglo-Saxon soap giants; just trying to show that its hands are clean, presumably.</p>

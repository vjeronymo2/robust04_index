			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / HK Democrats condemn British Secrets Act plan DEMOCRATS IN Hong Kong last night condemned a British decision to bypass the local legislature and introduce the UK 1989 Official Secrets Act by administrative means. The colonial government sought to present the decision as a 'liberalisation' of Hong Kong's laws governing official secrets. It said yesterday that the 1989 act would become law in Hong Kong at the end of this month after an order by the Privy Council. The United Democrats said the decree violated a 1984 pledge, enshrined in the Hong Kong Act of 1985, that the colony would have the power to enact its own laws. They vowed to campaign for its withdrawal. A spokesman said orders in council fell outside jurisdiction of the colony's bill of rights. A law so enacted would not be legal after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. This would create a vacuum Beijing would fill by applying its law to Hong Kong in the same way - by order - thereby depriving Hong Kong people of a say in an important piece of civil rights legislation. A dangerous precedent had been set. The government said the Privy Council's decision did not rule out a move to localise the law through Hong Kong legislation. But it has shown little inclination to do so. If the government were to introduce local legislation it would first have to seek China's approval. Measures which span 1997 are the subject of Anglo-Chinese negotiation. Given the poor state of Hong Kong-Beijing relations, latterly strained by disagreement over financing the colony's HKDollars 120bn (Pounds 8.5bn) airport, the government is reluctant to raise the issue with China. China has urged the Hong Kong government to relieve Hongkong and Shanghai Bank of its residual central banking powers as the bank is 'paring its commitment' to the colony. The Beijing-funded China News Service said the government should 'enhance further its financial supervision' in the colony now that 'the HSBC intends to fade out from Hong Kong'. The government 'should strengthen its control' over the domestic money and foreign exchange markets. It did not mention Hongkong Bank's role as a note issuer or clearing system manager.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: China factor behind Hong Kong's rally The 'China factor' gave momentum to Hong Kong's record-breaking advance last week, on reports, later denied by the Chinese authorities, that charges against the former Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang had been dropped. Investors pulled back on Friday and, indeed, again yesterday, but this profit-taking was still perceived to reflect a general rally ahead of the Chinese New Year next Tuesday. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity comments that the China factor was very strong, backed by news from the mainland that China was looking to speed up reforms with further economic liberalisation to promote growth. This was particularly welcomed by the market since most of China's exports go through the colony. However, further profit-taking was expected to be in evidence this week as money is taken out of the market prior to the new year celebrations, during which factories will close for a two-week holiday. Australia recorded the largest fall on the Pacific Rim, with the bond market particularly sensitive to concern that interest rates might not continue to come down. The markets are also nervous about the fiscal package which the Keating government is due to unveil in late February or early in March. Australian interest rates remain high, although some analysts feel that they could come back. Quarterly inflation figures are due to be published tomorrow. Europe remained generally flat. The biggest changes were seen in Norway and Finland which reversed the strength of the week before as they recorded falls of 5.9 and 3.3 per cent respectively. Norway was hit by news that Norsk Hydro, which accounts for 22 per cent of Oslo's equity market capitalisation, was taking a special charge in the fourth quarter. Analysts note that Finland has started to drift back after the new year spree of bargain hunting, and that investors are beginning to focus on preliminary results which will start to come out in March.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change     % change                                                                 in US              % change in local currency**        sterling**  ** Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           1 Week   4 Weeks    1 Year   Start of   Start of     Start of                                            1992       1992        1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -0.43   +5.61     -0.75      +5.82      +3.25       -0.36 Belgium      -0.02   +5.09    +17.89      +4.59      +2.80       -0.80 Denmark      -0.39   +4.06    +20.84      +3.64      +2.96       -0.65 Finland      -3.28  +21.15     +8.64     +14.90     +12.25       +8.31 France       -0.34   +7.34    +21.11      +4.81      +3.99       +0.35 Germany      -0.29   +6.54    +15.20      +6.02      +4.99       +1.31 Ireland      -2.69   +7.60    +27.91      +5.08      +4.74       +1.07 Italy        +0.16  +12.30    +13.72      +9.70      +9.26       +5.44 Netherlands  +0.03   +6.19    +24.14      +5.74      +4.77       +1.10 Norway       -5.85   +8.14     +3.91      +7.14      +6.14       +2.42 Spain        -0.66   +6.54    +15.95      +2.92      +2.73       -0.87 Sweden       +0.18   +8.40    +15.77      +7.75      +7.07       +3.33 Switzerland  +0.53   +6.80    +27.04      +5.88      +5.67       +1.96 UK           -1.14   +4.00    +19.65      +1.04      +1.04       -2.49  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       -0.60   +5.84    +18.99      +3.72      +3.27       -0.35  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -3.82   +0.98    +26.24      -2.92      -2.16       -5.58 Hong Kong    +3.56   +9.63    +49.61      +7.78     +11.97       +8.05 Japan        -0.86   -5.34     -7.30      -7.72      -3.08       -6.47 Malaysia     +0.02   +3.39    +11.44      +2.47      +8.46       +4.66 New Zealand  -1.83   -0.09    +18.88      -2.36      +1.26       -2.28 Singapore    +0.03   +5.62    +33.28      +4.39      +7.02       +3.28  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -0.26   +5.55    +10.79      +3.64      +6.39       +2.66 USA          -0.77   +2.22    +25.08      -0.25      +3.36       -0.25 Mexico       +1.29  +13.46   +187.28     +10.48     +13.16       +9.20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -2.36   +5.77    +42.39      +5.26      +6.67       +2.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.74   +1.02    +13.01      -1.32      +1.56       -2.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on January 24th 1992.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and County NatWest Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

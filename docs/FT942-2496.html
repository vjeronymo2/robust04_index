			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: A hot and dusty road to the last place on earth - Leslie Gardner wanders through Thrace to Tekirdag, in Turkey, a small port with a literary history Edirne, on the Bulgarian frontier to Istanbul, at the gates of Asia, is the fag-end of the Orient-Express route. Every morning a pink motortren sets out from Edirne, roams Thrace, stops everywhere and reaches the Bosporus in the evening. A ticket to Corlu (Tchor-loo), the half-way house, about 110 miles, costs 55p. Two rough-looking boys were my fellow-passengers. They looked over my shoulder as I sat studying the map of Turkey. One traced with his finger an east-bound journey, far across Anatolia, to Mus, near Lake Van. His native town. The other went farther, into the mountainlands of the Iraqi border. 'You're a Kurd,' I told him. Both laughed heartily. I pondered the mobility of Turks in their vast land where, to one side, the Danube pours her waters and, from the other, the Tigris and Euphrates flow. The Grand Signior once summoned teams of virgins from the distant provinces, in order to have samples of every region in his harem. By the time the Lake Van girls reached Constantinople, a third of them were mothers. At least they were spared an ordeal by motortren. Racked with cramp from its narrow, straight-backed bench, I needed help to disembark at the wayside halt of Buyukkaristi. (A sketchy knowledge of a few nouns interpreted it as either the resting-place in the birch forest or the town of wooden saucepans). It was an oasis of rank vegetation in a harsh landscape. Roses fought with cabbages, all tossed in a red and green salad. Hollyhocks and begonias stood like signals along the line. Canary creeper festooned the fountain and the crossing-keeper's white two-roomed house. He lay sprawled under his fig-tree, a burly old fellow in braces and uniform trousers. Custodian of this single-track link between east and west (down the line: Istanbul, Ankara, Baghdad; up the line: Sofia, Vienna, Paris), he led a contented life, pottering among flowers. He exemplified the wisdom of Candide's philosophy: 'Il faut cultiver notre jardin.' The pink motortren had not been worth getting up for, but when a signal clicked and the dark-green Marmara Express loped through like an exhausted animal, he put on his pill-box cap and saluted the driver. I took to the hills. When the rains arrive, Thrace will be a delightful country with oak, mountain ash and laburnum in leaf, wild cherry in flower and clear streams racing down sandy channels to the Sea of Marmara. Until then it is dusty, lifeless and swept by a gritty north wind. I kept stopping to empty sand out of my shoes. A young man and a girl in a donkey-cart overtook me and, as everyone does in Turkey, urged me to climb up behind. He scowled when I declined, but the girl understood and her happy young smile was as good as a glass of spring water to me. Short cuts across the sheep pastures were a mistake. My guide-book mentioned 'playful Thracian shepherd dogs,' but those I met had never learned to play. The first whiff of a stranger brought them racing in a pack, snarling and spoiling for action. Pretending to pick up a stone sometimes disarms a cur, but not the curs of Thrace. The shepherd, thank God, is usually not far away. You offer a cigarette (which he examines as though he has never seen one before) and sit with him in a cavity of the dried-up torrent bank, out of the breeze. Off-duty dogs chew scattered bones, probably those of some previous passer-by. You offer the dogs a share of your lunch of black bread and kazan dibi ('bottom of the barrel'), the treacle pudding which the Edirne pastry-cook rolled into a ball and stuffed unwrapped in your pocket. The dogs respond with growls. Near Corlu a tractor-driver refused to take No for an answer, so I rode into town on his trailer-load of sunflower seeds, 'Oberj?' He pointed down a side-street off the asfalti, the shining racetrack of the Athens-Istanbul highway. 'Yok turistik,' he said - not a tourist hotel, therefore not a rip-off. Picturesquely old-fashioned (they even provide bedroom slippers for your dawn raid on the mosque), the Oberj Hatman was half as costly and twice as elegant as anything I had known in Turkey. It served no food or drink (it was impossible to buy wine anywhere in Corlu, although the place bristled with drunks), but I discovered a sort of garden restaurant called Atsubay Orduvei. The lamb rissoles and nightingales' nests, the kebabs and dolmasi were nothing to write home about, but the commissionaire snapped off a salute as I arrived and the coffee-boys, balancing tiny cups on trays slung from silver chains round their necks, trotted about smiling. On a low wall across the street sat a dozen old women, veiled and silent, like a row of black crows waiting to pounce on the leavings. I asked one if I could photograph her. She fled whimpering. I put the same question to her neighbour, who immediately uncovered and gave the camera a brilliant smile. The 15 miles from Corlu to Tekirdag (Tekky-da), downhill all the way, take about four hours on foot. When you come out on the low, lonely Marmara cliffs you can strip, beat the sand out of your clothes, wash and dry your socks and swim in a mild sea. Tekirdag is a small port among the dunes through which sandy trails of streets are cut. Hustled by the gritty wind, clapboard houses rattle and nod over their buttresses of sand. There was no sign of a population until I peered into the mosque, where a spotty youth in a tasselled cap was reading from the Koran. A bell tolled. Out of the municipal offices the clerks came running, down the broad steps two and three at a time. Surely one among them spoke English or at least French? Surely someone was aware of the literary importance of Tekirdag, the spot that Voltaire nominated (possibly because it appeared to him the last place on God's earth) as that to which Candide and Pangloss retired to cultivate their garden? The clerks could not make out what I was talking about. A garden? At Tekirdag, where everything lay under 6 inches of sand? Before dark I had surveyed the town, upwind and down. There was no monument to that profound and original French philosopher, no bulvari Candide, no sokagi Pangloss. Army trucks slithered through, each vehicle's radiator proclaiming 'NATO-FUNDED.' A coach from Greece stopped at the waterfront fuel point, all its passengers asleep and the radio playing Mozart. One by one the arc-lamps of the coasting vessels at the jetty went out. Incredibly, the coasters seemed to have been discharging cargoes of sand and gravel. I button-holed a sailor in French naval uniform. 'M'sieur, you know of Voltaire?' He looked up and down the harbour and said: 'How many funnels has she got?'</p>

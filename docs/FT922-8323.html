			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (5): Pampered by the pampas - Agriculture - future prosperity depends on adding value FARMING once made Argentina rich, but like other areas of the economy, it has suffered a debilitating cycle of under-investment, protectionism, and inefficiency. Agriculture remains, nevertheless, the bedrock of the economy and is benefiting from stability. Demand is growing, prices are rising and profitability is improving. The next crucial step is for farmers to increase investment. The collapsing transport infrastructure must also be overhauled and marketing channels revamped. Traders, farmers and government officials have also realised that the key to future prosperity lies in adding value to the grains and beef that Argentina's fertile pampas produce at very low prices, rather than exporting them to processing plants in Europe or North America. Instead of exporting soyabeans, Argentina should export more cooking oils. Instead of exporting beef carcases it should sell more cooked beef products. This trend is being reinforced by the US and European farm subsidies that have driven world commodity prices down. Grain prices plummeted in the late 1980s and are only now beginning to recover. Grain output and prices touched bottom in 1987, when exports collapsed to 10m tonnes from 22m tonnes in 1985 and export revenues fell by two-thirds to Dollars 1bn. In 1991, grain exports rose to 15.7m tonnes, worth Dollars 2.05bn. Exports of oilseeds have performed better, rising steadily since the early 1980s. . Exports roughly doubled from 650,000 tonnes in 1981 to 1.4m tonnes last year. In value terms, shipments were worth touching Dollars 284m in 1981, rising to Dollars 773m in 1991. Exports of subproducts of soyabeans and sunflower seeds have risen from Dollars 329m a decade ago to Dollars 1.13bn in 1991. Mr Jorge Ingaramo, assistant agriculture secretary, points to the main problem: 'Agriculture uses land as an input too much and does not use enough of the modern factors of production - qualified labour, technology, capital, services, that would add more value to basic products.' He says that while it would be difficult to double the size of the wheat crop, it would be feasible substantially to increase its value in four or five years. At present, only one-quarter of Argentina's Dollars 8bn-worth of agricultural exports are processed in the form of cattle feed or oilseeds. And since Argentina's output is marginal to the world market, it could double its value-added exports without depressing world prices. Raising the capital component of farm produce will, of course, take time and require heavy investment. Farmers' profits are growing as strong demand pushes up prices. The government says they have already begun replacing worn out equipment: it reports tractor sales up by 230 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the same period of 1991. Nonetheless, farmers still complain that real interest rates of about 20 per cent a year discourage major investments. Mr Luis Maria Flynn, president of the Argentine subsidiary of Cargill, the US grain trader, points out that there is still a long way to go. 'Maybe only one-third of farmers are using modern technologies.' Wider use of modern techniques could easily raise annual grain output by 25 per cent in five years to 50m tonnes, he argues. The challenge, then, is how to encourage the other two thirds of farmers to use more advanced equipment. Although farmers understand that there is no point in lobbying the government for subsidised loans or grants, there is still a lot the public sector can do to help. Mr Ingaramo admits that the government must provide better rural extension services, better sanitary controls, and develop marketing services, such as a country brand. Farmers also need to become less tradition-bound and to be more business-like, examining their costs carefully. They are already beginning to use financial instruments like futures hedging to avoid price fluctuations. Even though the pampas, the most fertile tract of land in the world, provide Argentina with an awesome competitive edge, protection from outside competition over the past 60 years has atrophied agriculture. Argentina never bothered to develop premium products such as fine cheeses or exotic fruits. Because Argentina was a closed market, the consumer could buy only produce that was available locally. For the same reason, Argentina failed to develop new export markets in fresh produce, exotic fruit or in wines, as Chile did during the 1980s. Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an economist at Coninagro the farm cooperative organisation, points to the dilemma: 'The farmer wants to make the consumer buy what he sells and not sell what the consumer wants. Yet when new products arrive, they sell well. The problem is the retail system, which is inefficient and has big margins that are not shared with the farmer.' Argentina's atrocious transport infrastructure adds heavily to farmers' costs. Mr Flynn reckons that costly and inefficient ports alone have lost farmers Dollars 100m over the last five years in extra costs. Buenos Aires is reputed to be the world's most expensive port. Public services, such as ports, railways and toll roads, are being transferred to the private sector this year. They should lower costs and improve efficiency dramatically, although exporters complain that the companies taking over port facilities are being allowed to set prices artificially high. Growing integration with Brazil will open a huge new consumer market for processed beef, dairy, poultry, fruit and vegetable products. The bigger market would enable Argentines to exploit economies of scale they lack at present, allowing them to become more efficient. Agricultural specialists see conquest of a significant slice of the Brazilian market as a first step to penetrating European Community, North American and Japanese markets. The shift from basic farm products to more sophisticated ones will require a drastic shake-out. The government reckons that there are 200,000 family farms that are no longer viable units. They will be bought out by larger, more capital-intensive farmers. Inevitably, farmers have major doubts. Their misgivings are similar to those of industrialists. The key question is confidence: is it worth investing, especially if a farmer cannot be certain Argentina's inflation, exchange rate and cost structures will not get out of hand? Labour is a major agricultural input, but wages have risen dramatically. On average they have doubled to Dollars 450 a month in just one year. In some cases, wages have risen more than fourfold, wiping out profits. Farming requires long lead times. It takes six months to grow cereals and three years to produce a steer ready for slaughter. Farmers fear that if they begin investing now to meet rising consumer demand, the boom may end just as their investment is ready to hit the market. Mr Sarachu also points to the danger of social disequilibrium as small farms are absorbed by larger ones and their former owners are either driven into urban slums or retained as low wage labourers. This would be all the more worrying if investment does not take place. He warns this would create wealth concentration in a context of stagnation. 'High investment costs are preventing diversification or expansion of output.'</p>

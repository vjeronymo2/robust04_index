			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b could technically be used as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their use is extensively controlled under section 610 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary substitutes for the solvent/diluent uses of CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, MCF, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;141b are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Petroleum hydrocarbons (C6&hyph;C20). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Oxygenated organic solvents (ketones, esters, ethers, and alcohols).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCFC&hyph;141b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Terpenes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Chlorinated solvents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water-based systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other substitutes, including monochlorotoluenes/benzotrifluorides, hydrofluorocarbons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and perfluorocarbons, are also being investigated. This list of substitutes was compiled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the help of companies that submitted information on substitutes to the Agency in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the January 16, 1992, Advance Notice of Proposed Rule-Making. Today's decisions on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes are listed in appendix B. The remainder of this section discusses these substitutes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the decision on each substitute, and the Agency's reasoning behind each determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vendors or users of substitutes not included on the table for the SNAP determinations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosols should provide information on the substitutes so that the Agency can add these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes to the lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Substitutes for propellants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Saturated light hydrocarbons (C3&hyph;C6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydrocarbons are promising replacements for nonessential uses of HCFC&hyph;22 as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant in aerosols and pressurized containers. The specific category of hydrocarbons used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as propellants are saturated light hydrocarbons (C3&hyph;C6). Examples of these small chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds include butane, isobutane, and propane. All have low boiling points, making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them excellent propellants. They are used separately or in mixtures, are inexpensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to HCFC&hyph;22 (HCFC&hyph;22 is four times more expensive than hydrocarbons), and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily available from most chemical distributors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the major area of concern with the replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons for HCFC&hyph;22 is the flammability of hydrocarbons. In applications where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonflammable propellant is needed, a hydrocarbon could not be used. For example, the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hydrocarbons around electrical equipment could prove hazardous if sparks from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment were to ignite the hydrocarbon propellant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saturated light hydrocarbons are adequate substitute propellants where flammability is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a concern. To reduce product flammability, hydrocarbons can be used with water-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations in products such as insecticides, where product quality would not be adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected. Manufacturers are also hindered from selling hydrocarbon-propelled aerosols in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain jurisdictions. In California, for example, the use of hydrocarbons is restricted because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their classification as volatile organic compounds which contribute to low level ozone or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Dimethyl ether.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dimethyl ether (DME) is a medium pressure, flammable, liquefied propellant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of its chemical properties, it can be used as a combination propellant/solvent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although it is typically classified together with other propellants and is used in combination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other propellants. Practices for manufacture and use of aerosol products formulated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DME parallel practices employed with hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Hydrofluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;152a are partially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluorinated hydrocarbons and have been developed relatively recently. These compounds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less dense than HCFC&hyph;22, but with minor reformulation adjustments could function equally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as propellants except in products such as noise horns, which require a more dense gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because HFCs have only recently been developed, they are only now becoming readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available and are expected to be priced significantly higher than HCFC&hyph;22, at least in the near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary studies show that HFC&hyph;134a and HFC&hyph;125 are nonflammable and have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very low toxicity, which would make them good replacements for HCFC&hyph;22 as propellants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products where nonflammability is a requirement. Although HFC&hyph;152a is slightly flammable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it can be formulated with other materials_such as HFC&hyph;125_to control its flammability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFCs also may be used in conjunction with other flammable chemicals to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammability of such mixtures. For example, HFCs are being tested for use with dimethyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ether (DME) in safety sprays and animal repellents. Although DME is flammable, the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product formulation is not. HFC&hyph;134a and HFC&hyph;125 are also being tested as replacements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFCs still used in medical applications because of their nonflammable, nontoxic properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compressed gases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compressed gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, air, and nitrous oxide are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common, low molecular weight gases used as propellants in aerosol products but not as drop-in replacements. First, alternative dispensing mechanisms and stronger containers are needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because these gases are under significantly greater pressure. Containers holding compressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gases are, therefore, larger and bulkier. Second, because these chemicals have low molecular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weights, they are inadequate as replacements for HCFC&hyph;22 in products requiring a dense gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant, such as noise horns, or in products requiring fine dispersion of the product, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as surface lubricants and weld inspection developers. Third, compressed gases dispel material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faster because they are under higher pressure, which contributes to wasted product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compressed gases are readily available from most chemical distributors and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively inexpensive. Compressed gases cool upon expansion. Compressed gases are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonflammable and can serve as propellants in applications where a nonflammable propellant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is necessary, but not in applications where a fine even dispersion is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

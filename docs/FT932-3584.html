			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / US to sell helicopters to Turkey THE US is to sell helicopters to Turkey and transfer 50 A-10 tank buster aircraft in a Dollars 356m (Pounds 231.1m) package unveiled in Ankara over the weekend by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state (pictured left with his Turkish counterpart, Mr Hikmet Cetin). The deal, which includes the purchase of five Super-Cobra attack helicopters, gets around a US congressional move last year to cut US military aid to Turkey and Greece and Portugal, other southern flank Nato members, under which grants were changed to credits, writes John Murray Brown. Until this year Turkey was the third largest recipient of US military aid after Israel and Egypt, receiving about Dollars 500m annually under the US foreign military sales programme, most of which was used in Turkey's F-16 fighter aircraft manufacturing project. Mr Christopher said the Clinton administration would seek congressional approval for the latest sales.</p>

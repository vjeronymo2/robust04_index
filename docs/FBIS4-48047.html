			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Joe Modise by Leslie </F> Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program; place not given -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening and welcome to Monday  night's "Newsline." Tonight we give you the first ever  interview with the minister of national defense, Mr. Joe Modise.  Mr. Modise, good evening and welcome, and let's congratulate  you on being appointed national defense minister of the new  South Africa.    [Modise] Thank you.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, what do you regard as priorities?  What is important to you as defense minister?    [Modise] Your question is a loaded question. From the side  of defense, naturally, the priority is to put these armies  together. As you know we had the former South African Defense  Force [SADF]; we had Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation],  APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]; we also had the  Transkei Defense Force and Bophuthatswana Defense Force and the  Ciskei Defense Force. All those forces on 27 April became the  South African National Defense Force. Now we are faced with the  task of preparing them. In other words, they've got to undergo  training -- in fact all of them -- so that we've got one uniform  form of training. For the process, we have requested the  British in particular to come and assist us in preparing these  forces, and also in taking part in the adjudication especially  when infiltration, I mean when integration begins to take place,  so that we don't have a lot of wrangling. So basically the  starting point would be to prepare all these forces so that the  level of training is more or less the same.    [Mashokwe] Putting together these forces from different  backgrounds, in a way from different thinking, and former  enemies becoming compatriots or colleagues in the army -- is it  doable, let me use that word?    [Modise] It is doable, but it's not an easy task. It's a  mammoth task, because here you are not just dealing with  ordinary training; you are also changing attitudes. It has been  done in Zimbabwe; it's done in Namibia; there is no reason why  South Africa shouldn't do it. And what I saw today, in this  parliament, is a clear indication that our people are now on the  doorstep of progress. We are on the threshold of building a  nation, and I am very confident that that South African nation  is going to be built. Unlike the factions that we had in the  past, if we can build a nation, there is no reason why we  shouldn't put these different forces together and build a truly  national defense force.    [Mashokwe] Apparently we had this failed attempt at putting  together the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], and many cynics  look at that and say: Will we be able to put together a national  defense force if we failed at that level?    [Modise] You must not forget that the Peacekeeping Force  never had a chance. We had planned to put it together, train it  for nine months. It was done in eight weeks. The training was  completely inadequate. Time was too short, and what is more,  the Peacekeeping Force was opposed long before its inception.  The idea was opposed. It had a lot of enemies from within and  from without. I've never seen a force that was criticized like  the Peacekeeping Force. So, in other words, it was never given  a chance. I don't think that attitude is going to prevail with  the building of the new South African National Defense Force,  and we are going to give ourselves time. We don't see  integration as an overnight affair. We look at it as a process.  We are going to start preparing our men now. We are going to  put them through the necessary paces, until we feel that they  are ready to be put together, because that's the only way in  which we are going to have a legitimate force. The SADF cannot  be transformed into the South African National Defense Force.  It won't be accepted by the people. It will still remain an  illegitimate force. To legitimize it we've got to bring in all  these others, and we've got to empower them. They come from a  deprived community. They never had the opportunities that their  counterparts have. We've got to work hard and get them also to  be on this, on par with the others, so that the integration also  should be seen as being fair, and if the SADF has got black  groups that were commanded, that fought wars in Angola and  everywhere else, what would be wrong with these black troops  that are coming into the new National Defense Force?    [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, as I listen to you talk, I remember  that in days gone by you were almost regarded as chief  terrorist. Now you are chief of the defense force. Tell me  about that transformation in your heart, in your mind, in your  being?    [Modise] Well, I was asked this morning, this evening too,  how do I feel? I said somewhat strange. It does. The  surroundings are strange. Parliament, do you know that it was  my first time to enter parliament yesterday? I've never seen it  from inside. I've always seen it from outside as I'm passing  here. One had that feeling, but let me say it's a challenge and  I'm confident that we are going to succeed in building this new  nation. I said to you earlier on, we are on the threshold of  building a nation in this country. We are moving away from the  old black, brown, white factions that we had here. We are  building one solid nation, and like I said earlier on, that I am  very confident. What I saw here today, over the past few days  -- in fact from the elections -- I've always been confident;  I've always been optimistic. [sentence as heard] But from the  elections I became even more optimistic that we are going to  build a prosperous country, and our people are going to be  united. And, you ask me how do I feel? That's the feeling I  have. I have the feeling of being part of a great nation, and  let me say, from my side as minister, with my [word indistinct]  I'm going to put it together. We will also do our best to do our  small part to make sure that this country becomes prosperous and  its people are well protected.    [Mashokwe] In defense the important matter now when you  could say the scenario, the political scenario, the cold war is  over, we no more have enemies, we don't have the kind of  situations that prevailed in the old days of apartheid when we  had to be guarding all the borders -- should we be giving you  more money than was the budget for the last year? Should we use  that money elsewhere for instance?    [Modise] You've got to look after your forces. There's no  such thing as people not having enemies. Perhaps they don't  appear now because we have a formidable force here. If this  force disappears and we become defenseless, you'll be surprised  how many enemies are going to mushroom. Look at Switzerland --  they've always been neutral, they've never fought a war, but I  can remember, I mean from Western history, that they are armed  to the teeth. You ask yourselves: Why are they spending so much  money? They've just bought five Phantoms from the United States  -- I mean, F-18's from the United States. You ask yourself why  are they arming to the teeth when they are a neutral country?  They've always been neutral. Even when people negotiate peace,  we go to Geneva. Peaceful people. Why are they defending  themselves?    [Mashokwe] You are saying the defense budget must not be cut  down. When I listen to other politicians from your organization  they say: We'll cut on defense; we'll use that money for  reconstruction and development. Is there not conflict of  interests here?    [Modise] No, no I don't think you must misunderstand me.  Naturally, our priority as a nation is to better the lives of  our people. The development program is a very important  program. We've got to save where we can, even in defense. We  are not going to modernize. It's true our country has been  isolated for a very long time. It couldn't buy the type of  equipment that they would want to buy. But we've got to  maintain what we have. We can't take these aeroplanes now and  throw them into the scrap yard. They need to be serviced. We  need to buy spare parts for them, but of course the outlook will  always toward saving a little bit from defense, saving from all  over, enabling the government to continue with its development  program.    [Mashokwe] I'm trying to put myself in the boots of minister  of defense. You have all these newcomers -- MK, APLA, and  everybody else who would like to be now a member of the National  Defense Force. You obviously need a bigger budget. But now the  question is, what's more important? Those who are coming in to  defend the country? Are you prepared to take a cut in the  defense budget? What do you think is important? I know you  might have a prejudiced answer, but it is important?    [Modise] I think there will be a reduction in spending on  new  equipment. We can't take these men and throw them into the  streets. They've got to come in, and naturally after preparing  them, there will be rationalization, and after rationalization  we need to find other alternatives for them. I was asked by the  radio people as to what's going to happen to them? I've been  highly impressed with the Taiwanese approach. They've got what  they call a Veteran's Association. The men who went to Taiwan  under Chiang Kai-shek when they got there, when they were now  being rationalized with Chiang Kai-shek, when they were half a  million men, and he ended up with 100,000 men -- the other  400,000 weren't in it -- and their conditions were worse than  ours. Those men were assisted by the government, given  training, started working with their hands, developed. Today,  the biggest engineering companies today belong to the ex-service  association. I don't say we'll equal the Taiwanese, but I think  that as soon as these men -- and we are working in the direction  of preparing, getting an organization which will absorb them --  and we'll then train them to acquire little skills and some  will, those who have got the ability to go to universities will  be given that opportunity, and the government will assist where  it can. But eventually we are going to assist these people to  begin to stand on their own feet, give them a little bit of  money once they have acquired skills to start working on their  own, and we will be preparing them to enter civilian life. We  think this method of approaching this problem will also go a  long way to assist us.    [Mashokwe] If one who was a captain, or holding a rank  within  the MK faction is given some training, will it be equal to a  rank of captain within the defense force? How are you going to  integrate that [words indistinct]?    [Modise] I said to you that we had irregular training, some  of our men. Of course others had regular training. Those who  did not have regular training, and they had irregular training,  they will be given a chance, they will be trained, and if the  man then was a captain, then we will train him as a captain,  whether it takes a year or two years, three years to prepare  him. This is a man who has commanded, a man who fought against  formidable regular forces, so we will empower him to become a  proper captain.    [Mashokwe] When you look back with hindsight, Mr. Modise,  many people who have lost their lives during the onslaught, the  attacks that you were waging as commander out there, are you  ever sorry that you did it?    [Modise] If I found myself in a similar situation, I would  do  it all over again. I do regret the lives that have been lost.  I think apartheid oppression in this country was wrong. It was  unnecessary for this country to have lost so many dear ones.  But if I was placed in the same position, I would repeat it all  over again.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, on that note thanks for your time and  thanks for talking to us.    [Modise] You are welcome.    [Mashokwe] Thank you.</p>

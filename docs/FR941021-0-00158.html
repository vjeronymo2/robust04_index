			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 53. Our interim plan is based upon the most recent system designs presented to us in the context of the Negotiated Rulemaking. Four of the CDMA applicants propose to build systems using narrowband 1.25 MHz transmission channels while one_TRW_proposes wider 5 MHz channels. If the entire 11.35 MHz assignment designated for CDMA systems were available, the narrowband licensees would be able to operate over 9 transmission channels, while the wider band operator would be able to operate over two. If MSS cannot be provided in the 1610&hyph;1612 MHz portion of the CDMA band segment because of GLONASS considerations, two narrowband channels would be lost and one wideband channel would be lost. Allowing CDMA licensees to shift frequencies by 1.25 MHz into the designated TDMA/FDMA band at 1621.35-1626.5 MHz would provide both narrowband and wideband CDMA licensees with access to one additional channel. Consequently, until the entire 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band is available for MSS operations, we will provide CDMA operators with the option of operating in the 1621.35&hyph;1622.60 MHz band segment. In their way, all Big LEO operators will bear some of the necessary operating constraints_the narrow band CDMA operators by the net loss of one channel, the wideband CDMA operators by the loss of one channel or by the need to retune the center frequencies on both of its channels once GLONASS is fully moved, <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  and the FDMA/TDMA licensee by the loss of operating bandwidth. Nevertheless, we are optimistic that these measures will not be necessary or, if they are, that the effect on the MSS industry will not be significant given their short term nature and the anticipated incremental implementation of Big LEO service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The additional interim bandwidth of 1.25 MHz (1621.35&hyph;1622.60 MHz) would allow TRW to operate two 5 MHz CDMA channels at 1612.60 MHz to 1617.60 MHz and 1617.60 MHz to 1622.6 MHz. If it chooses to do this, it would be required to move these channels to 1610 to 1615 MHz and 1615 to 1620 MHz once GLONASS is moved. This would require the center frequencies on each channel to be shifted or retuned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditions to the plan_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> i. Reduction in spectrum for single CDMA system: 54. Another issue raised by the LEO applicants is our proposed modification to the plan in the event only one CDMA licensee goes forward. <FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>  In this unlikely scenario, we proposed to reduce the bandwidth assigned to that system automatically from 11.35 MHz to 8.25 MHz. We stated that an 8.25 MHz assignment, or one-half of the available 1.6 GHz MSS allocation, should be sufficient to support a viable system. We noted that the remaining 3.1 MHz of spectrum would be made available to an operational FDMA/TDMA system upon a showing of need or, if this demonstration could not be made, to a new entrant. The four parties to the Joint Proposal suggest that if one CDMA and one FDMA/TDMA system become operational, the 3.1 MHz of spectrum should be available to both of these licensees upon a showing of need and should not be made available to new entrants. In their comments, the CDMA operators argued that an automatic spectrum reduction for a CDMA system with no possibility of adjustment would penalize a CDMA licensee for the failure of another operator to launch a system, that it does not consider the efficiency of the system or whether the CDMA system is sharing spectrum with a foreign system, that it does not give CDMA operators a corresponding opportunity to gain access to bands above 1621.35 MHz upon failure or inefficient spectrum use by the FDMA/TDMA licensee, and that it will seriously impair CDMA operations. They further argued that even if GLONASS is moved, the lower frequency portion of the band is subject to more interservice sharing constraints because of protected radio astronomy operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the terms of each authorization, Big LEO licensees will be required to meet specified implementation milestones for the system. Failure to meet these deadlines will render the authorization null and void.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> para. 189,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The bandwidth adjustment discussed here would be triggered only; (1) if no CDMA system is licensed: (2) if only one CDMA system is licensed; or, (3) if more than one CDMA system is licensed and all but one is declared null and void.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 55. The CDMA proponents correctly state that uncertainties are present in the lower portion of the band that are not present in the upper portion. As noted, GLONASS is now operating in 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band and we do not know exactly when it will be moved or the limitations its operations will impose on MSS operations. Further, the radioastronomy service (RAS) operates on a co-primary basis in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band. The agreement reached by the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee regarding sharing between RAS and MSS imposes restrictions on MSS operations provides certain operating constraints on MSS mobile earth terminals in geographic areas near RAS sites. <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  If RAS sharing proves burdensome or if GLONASS is not fully moved in a timely fashion, an assignment of 8.25 MHz for each of the two LEO system architectures may not prove equivalent. Further, we do not know if, and the extent to which, foreign systems will impact U.S. systems' operations across the entire band. Consequently, we will defer any decision with respect to the 3.1 MHz between 1618.25 and 1621.35 MHz until, and if, either of those contingencies arises. At that time, we will have a clearer notion of the extent of any inter-service sharing constraints in the lower portion of the 1.6 GHz band. We will not, however, limit our consideration for assignment of this band to the two licensed systems, as the parties to the Joint Proposal urge. We do not think it is advisable at this time to preclude new entrants from access to this band. Rather, we will make the decision with respect to the 3.1 MHz, if necessary, in the context of a rulemaking, based upon the circumstances that have developed at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  paras. 101&hyph;109,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Other potential scenarios. 56. Although not specifically address in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the four parties to the Joint Proposal have developed a plan in the event that only one system retains a construction permit. In this scenario, the Joint Proposal would provide that that system, whether TDMA/FDMA or CDMA, would be given access to the entire 16.5 MHz of bandwidth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57. We need not decide now on a course of action to be taken in the event that only one Big LEO system is implemented, whether it is a CDMA or TDMA/FDMA system. If and when that occurs, we will weigh a variety of factors in a rulemaking, including our preference for multiple entry, constraints on the assigned spectrum due to international coordination agreements, system efficiency, and system loading, when considering a spectrum adjustment for that system.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

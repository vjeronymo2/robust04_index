			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher yesterday  completely distorted Cyprus' history and downplayed the problem  regarding issues of economic cooperation between the Republic  and the pseudostate.    Boucher stressed that the Cypriots, both Greek Cypriots and  Turkish Cypriots, "have a common geography, history, and  culture," and added that diversity among Cypriots is a unique  advantage.    He called upon the participants to turn Cyprus into a  regional base for businesses in the radically developing markets  of Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.    The U.S. ambassador mentioned that the separate economies on  the island each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and  stressed that they would be a lot more effective if they pooled  their funds, which could help to improve the lives of all  citizens.    Boucher was speaking before 250 people from both communities  at the fifth annual intercommunal coordinating meeting,  organized by the UN High Commission for Refugees at the UN  Headquarters in Nicosia International Airport.    An unacceptable incident marred the conclusion of the  meeting. UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] soldiers refused to allow  the Greek Cypriot reporters to return to the free areas from  Nicosia International Airport. The UNFICYP cited the force's  rules that for security reasons reporters need to leave the area  accompanied by UNFICYP men. They also tried to confiscate the  television crews' cameras.    Nicosia Mayor Lellos Dhimitriadhis resolved the dispute  following a heated discussion between the UNFICYP men and the  Greek Cypriot reporters. He pointed out to the men of the force  that he was representing the Republic of Cyprus, which hosts the  United Nations, and assured them that all the Greek Cypriot  reporters were present at the meeting.</p>

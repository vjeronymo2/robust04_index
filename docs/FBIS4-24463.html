			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 May (XINHUA) -- The structural  contradiction of China's consumer goods market which was once  quite conspicuous has diminished significantly since the  beginning of the second quarter. Various locales have adopted  effective measures to ensure sufficient funds for the  procurement of agricultural and sideline products and to lessen  peasants' burdens. As a result, the purchasing power of the  vast number of peasants has increased to a certain extent, sales  in rural markets have increased, and the gap between urban and  rural markets has been further reduced.    From the second half of last year to early this year, there  was a quite different situation in the rate of increase of sales  in urban and rural markets. The rate of increase of sales in  cities was far greater than that in the rural areas, and this  extremely uneven situation has created a conspicuous structural  contradiction in China's market situation. Some experts  analyzed the situation and pointed out that this situation was  mainly due to the fact that some locales have not earnestly  implemented the policy of the party Central Committee on  accelerating the development of agriculture, that the peasants'  burdens were too heavy, and that the funds for procuring  agricultural and sideline products were not appropriated  promptly. The rate of increase in peasants' income was slow,  and the extent of the increase of their purchasing power was  relatively small.    Based on information from the State Statistical Bureau,  since  the beginning of this year's second quarter, various locales  have strengthened measures to promote agricultural development  and have achieved initial results. Peasants' income from  selling agricultural and sideline products has increased to a  certain extent, and their purchasing power has increased  significantly. In April, the total volume of retail sales of  consumer goods was 117.1 billion yuan. Of this amount, total  retail sales of consumer goods in cities were 70.3 billion yuan,  which was a 25.4-percent increase compared to the same period  last year. Total retail sales of consumer goods in counties and  lower levels were 46.8 billion yuan, an increase of 22.8 percent  over the same period last year. The rate of increase of retails  sales in rural areas in April was 1.8 percent higher than the  previous month. The gap between the rate of the increase in  sales of consumer goods between cities and rural areas was  reduced from 5 percent in the first quarter to 2.6 percent. The  extent of the increase in retail sales of consumer goods in  counties and lower levels in Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong, Hunan,  and Henan Provinces has even exceeded that of cities.</p>

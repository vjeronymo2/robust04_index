			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zambia has called on the donor community for help in  its fight against drug trafficking. The Zambian Foreign Affairs  Minister Remmy Mushota said Zambia was committed to ridding  itself of the scourge of drug trafficking but did not have  adequate resources to carry out the task alone. Dr. Mushota  told diplomats in Lusaka that while Zambia appreciated the  concern of the donor community about drug trafficking,  corruption, and transparency, it was also imperative that heads  of diplomatic missions did not become over-zealous. He said  diplomats should observe diplomatic propriety and etiquette.</p>

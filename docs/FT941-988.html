			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Yeltsin concludes Black Sea holiday President Boris Yeltsin arrived home yesterday after a Black Sea holiday that provoked a rash of rumours about coup plots and his failing health, AP reports from Moscow. In an interview published in the newspaper Izvestia on Saturday he condemned what he called the 'rich brew of lies, meanness and greed'. Even his normally reticent wife, Naina, was quoted in the press. Mr Yeltsin's two-week absence from the capital provided a field day for speculation about everything from the president's bad back and his heart to his drinking habits and his liver. Aides were forced to issue frequent denials that Mr Yeltsin was at death's door.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Lyudmila Yermakova report, especially </F> for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Respecting Private Rights. What Will  the Civil Code Be Like?"]    [Text] Of the draft laws which the Russian Federation  president intends to submit to the State Duma as part of his  legislative initiative, he is putting the Civil Code to the  fore. Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov has reported that the  first section of the document, which lawyers are describing as  the market economy code, has already been prepared for  consideration.    Civil law specialists consider this new collection of laws  second in importance to the Constitution, since "it is designed  to lay the legal foundations for civilized market relations in a  country undergoing reform in all spheres of its life." It  should replace the virtually obsolete 1964 RSFSR [Russian Soviet  Federated Socialist Republic] Civil Code.    The draft is being created by a working group of lawyers set  up at the government's behest from the Private Law Center, the  Justice Ministry, several institutes, and the Supreme Court of  Arbitration. The Court, incidentally, is very interested in the  adoption of the code, which will "make it possible to streamline  the legal regulation of economic relations that have developed  with the transition to the market," Vasiliy Vitryanskiy, a  member of the group and deputy chairman of the Court, explained.    He stressed that the compilers of the plan are "proceeding  on  the basis of the constitutional provisions on civil legislation  as an area under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation on  the unity of the economic area throughout its entire territory,  and on the free movement of goods, services, and finances." He  called the "recognition and equal protection of private, state,  and municipal property, and freedom of economic activity" the  most important provision of the document.    Particular attention is being devoted to the legal  regulation  of the creation and activity of economic companies and  partnerships, which are becoming the main participants in  entrepreneurial activity. A special chapter is devoted to the  state's role in civil legal relations. It is envisaged that it  will take part in such relations on an equal basis with other  parties and is responsible for its commitments.    Many of the document's concepts go back to the classic  provisions of private law. The draft consistently implements  its norms, which are based on "the quality of the sides building  the relations, and on their right to independently resolve  matters without interference from others, including state  organs." By granting citizens an opportunity to exercise their  rights as they see fit, the draft obliges them to "act  conscientiously, reasonably, and fairly, observing the demands  of the law, moral principles, and the rules of business ethics,"  Vasiliy Vitryanskiy pointed out.    There are three sections in the draft of Section One of the  code, including a section on the right of ownership. This  fundamental document contains 450 articles. It has been  discussed by the Russian Federation Government Presidium. A  working group with the participation of representatives of the  State Committee for the Management of State Property, the  Ministry of the Economy, and the banks has also examined  proposals from Russian Federation components and several dozen  interested institutions. The draft has had expert scrutiny from  world-famous civil law scholars in the Netherlands, the FRG, the  United States, Italy, and France. Its adoption will "ensure the  stability of civil legislation, without which the economy cannot  develop normally."</p>

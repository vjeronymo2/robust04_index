			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING PERSONAL  </P> <P> When we moved to Orcas in 1980 and I told my friends that we were moving to the  San Juan Islands, they thought we were going to the Caribbean. When we arrived  it was as you described it in Jerry Hulse's charming article, "Personal Bests"  (April 8). Today, not so.  </P> <P> The travel writers discovered us. Clippings from our local weeklies illustrate  the conditions that you travel writers have helped to create with your articles  raving over the beauties of our islands.  </P> <P> Of course I'm being a bit facetious, but I'm sure I speak for more than half of  the population of San Juan county when I say please do us a favor -- for Pete's  sake shut up about our islands.  </P> <P> BILL and ANNE BOONE  </P> <P> Eastsound, Wash.  </P></p>

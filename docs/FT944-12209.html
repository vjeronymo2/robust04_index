			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Softbank to pay Dollars 202m for Ziff unit Softbank, a Japanese computer software company, has agreed to acquire the trade-show business of Ziff Communications, the US publishing group, for more than Dollars 202m. The agreement came after Softbank failed to acquire the publishing business of Ziff-Davis, which was sold to Forstmann Little, a New York investment group, for Dollars 1.4bn. The trade-show business of Ziff runs exhibitions of information network-related software and equipment, and had sales of about Dollars 90m this year, the Japanese company said. Ziff operates the world's largest trade show on network computing. The addition of Ziff's trade show operations will lift Softbank's involvement in the trade show business, and add value to its network-related operations which have been growing strongly in recent years, the company said. It will also help it to expand operations in the US. The acquisition, which Softbank intends to finance with its own funds, is not expected to affect the Japanese company's results in the year to next March, the company said. Softbank is a fast-growing company involved in the distribution of computer software, hardware and peripherals, and publication of magazines.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Christie's in Dollars 37.5m NY sale: Saleroom Christie's auction of Impressionist and Modern art in New York on Wednesday night was a success, totalling Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 23.4m). A total 44 of the 57 lots on offer found buyers, and 11 sold for more than Dollars 1m. This is firm evidence that the art market is recovering its nerve. The Republican mid-term electoral victories helped to make the American rich feel that bit richer. The star lot was a decorative oil by Toulouse-Lautrec of a ballet dancer adjusting her tights. It sold for Dollars 4.78m (Pounds 3m), well over double its estimate. In contrast, the most highly rated item, the last circular version by Monet of his favourite subject, Nympheas (Waterlilies), still in private hands, sold for just Dollars 3.3m, well below its Dollars 4m-Dollars 6m estimate. Nympheas had decorated the Manhattan apartment of the late Alice Tully and Christie's had guaranteed her executors a fixed sum, reputedly around Dollars 25m, for the chance to sell her collection. Fortunately for Christie's all five Tully pictures in this auction found buyers. Another painting which carried a guarantee, one of six of the same model painted by Corot when confined to his studio with gout, also sold below target, for Dollars 1.43m as against the Dollars 1.8m-Dollars 2.2m estimate.</p>

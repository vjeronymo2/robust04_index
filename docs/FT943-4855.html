			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Economy enters benign phase: The chancellor and Bank have a breathing space Fortune has smiled on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Today they hold their first monetary meeting since before the summer holidays against a background of diminishing expectations of a rise in interest rates. It was a brave analyst who, just three weeks ago, did not forecast an imminent rise in base rates from the 5.25 per cent in effect since early February. However, fears of monetary tightening have eased on signs that the UK may be close to steady non-inflationary growth - the holy grail of economic policymakers over the past four decades. Yesterday's news of disappointing car sales in August, and this week's figures showing slower growth in money supply and consumer credit, as well as a fragile housing market, suggest little by way of inflationary pressure from consumers. Instead, the economy appears to be in a benign phase, with exports and investment supporting growth rather than consumer demand, as was the case in the first two years of recovery. This news should be especially welcome to Mr Clarke. Recent minutes of his monthly meetings with Mr George show he has been more relaxed about inflationary pressures and less inclined to raise interest rates than the governor. Mr George, who has built up an image as a doughty inflation fighter, may feel at a tactical disadvantage. Recent published data has been better than the Bank's short-run projections of inflation. Last month, the year-on-year inflation rates for July, as measured by the retail prices index and the government's target measure of underlying inflation (RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) were well below 2.5 per cent. This put them safely within the government's 1 to 4 per cent target band for inflation. But the benign economic background could make today's discussions more, rather than less, difficult. The government is committed to having underlying inflation in the lower half of the target band by the 'end of this parliament'. As the next general election has to be fought by spring 1997, and the Bank believes monetary policy decisions operate with a two-year lag, the discretionary monetary policy in force since sterling's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 is entering a critical phase. The Bank's August inflation report concluded it was 'probable that inflation would gradually rise into the top half of the target range' if official interest rates remained unchanged over the next two years. This implied that the Bank saw a need to raise rates in the months ahead to prevent such a development. News concerning prices has been mixed in the five weeks since the report. While growth in consumer demand seems to have slowed, second-quarter growth as a whole was revised upwards to a year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent from 3.3 per cent previously. Such growth is well above the 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent 'trend' rate considered compatible with stable prices at full capacity utilisation. If sustained, such 'above trend' growth will absorb unused economic capacity, producing inflationary pressures in the future. The problem facing Mr Clarke, MrGeorge and their advisers is that nobody knows the size of the UK economy's unused capacity, or 'output gap'. Neither the Bank nor the Treasury publishes estimates, although officials are thought to have been preparing today's meeting on the assumption that the gap is around 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Even with annual growth of about 3.5 per cent, it will be some time before the UK economy runs into the inflationary buffers. Moreover, growth may slow because of further fiscal tightening between now and April 1995 as a result of measures in Mr Clarke's November 1993 Budget. Such thoughts sustain economists who believe today's meeting will decide against raising rates. 'There is no justification for an early interest rate increase, and so I think the chancellor and governor of the Bank of England will take a view there is no need for a change,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist in London at DKB, the Japanese bank. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, differs. 'With rising price expectations, above-trend growth and the authorities' bias to raise rates earlier than in previous cycles, we suspect that a September rate rise is still probably slightly more likely than not,' he says. However, he does not expect 'more than a single 0.5 per cent rate hike this year'. Analysts agree on one thing - UK official interest rates are at the bottom of their cycle. The first upward move in base rates for five years is just a matter of time.</p>

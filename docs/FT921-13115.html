			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Putting Nokia back in the black  -The company's new president has a tough job MR JORMA OLLILA, the new president, chairman and chief executive of Nokia, the European technology group and the largest of Finland's private companies, faces a tough task. For the first eight months of last year, Nokia made a pre-tax loss of FM205m (Dollars 47.3m) compared with a FM425m profit last time, on sales down 31 per cent. It warned 1991 as a whole would show a substantial loss. 'My first priority in the short term will be to get the company back into profit,' says Mr Ollila. Although he is cautious about the immediate outlook, he hopes Nokia will be making money again by the end of this year. Sales have fallen steeply in the important consumer electronics division, with a big drop in colour television sales in the German market. The slump in the Finnish construction industry hit the cables and machinery division, while the performance of basic industry areas covering tyres, chemicals and power was unimpressive. It is only in the mobile telephones division - under Mr Ollila's leadership since February 1990 - that Nokia has thrived. The division is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 30 to 40 per cent for the rest of the decade. Nokia is the second largest maker of mobile phones, after Motorola of the US. Mr Ollila believes Nokia will break into the Japanese market later this year. Nokia has already tried to divest some of its ailing activities. Last May, it sold its loss-making data division to ICL, the UK computer group 80 per cent-owned by Fujitsu of Japan. Nokia's important, but ailing, consumer electronics area requires particular attention for restructuring. Further divestments cannot be ruled out, along with additional cuts in the group's 27,000-strong workforce, which has already been slimmed by 10 per cent over the past two years. Mr Ollila plans to centre on four core business areas: mobile telephones, consumer electronics, telecommunications and cables. 'This will be our main thrust,' he says. Although he does not regard strategic alliances with other companies in consumer electronics as 'a quick fix,' he does see Europe developing along lines similar to the trends in Japan and the US. The Nokia board hopes Mr Ollila can supply the vision, energy and business acumen that the company enjoyed under chief executive Mr Kari Kairamo during the 1980s. Since Mr Kairamo's suicide in 1988, Nokia has gone through a period of consolidation. Nokia's transformation under Mr Kairamo from a producer of basis products such as rubber, cables and paper into one of Europe's largest consumer electronics companies was rapid. Mr Simo Vuorilehto, Mr Kairamo's successor, focused on internal structural changes. Mr Vuorilehto, who retires this summer, had been Kairamo's right-hand man and, over the past three years, has exercised a calming influence on the company. Although the arrival of Mr Ollila, 41, in the top spot may have brought a change in generations, it looks as though he intends to build on the foundation set by Kairamo and Vuorilehto, rather than turn Nokia in any new directions.</p>

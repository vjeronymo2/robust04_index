			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just this minute received some information  from the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. It says: By  continuing to play an active role in settling the situation in  former Yugoslavia, Russian diplomacy, along with its five  partners in Yugoslavia -- Russia, Great Britain, Spain, the  United States, and France -- enabled important progress to be  made in strengthening the safe havens regime in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Security Council has proposed that the UN secretary  general come forward with concrete recommendations on this issue  by 10 May. The UN Secretariat has assured the Russian  representative that the Russian proposals put forward earlier on  this will be taken into account when these recommendations are  being worked out, in addition to the information in the letter  from the Security Council chairman.    It is the unanimous view of the sides looking for a  settlement that the strengthening of the safe havens regime will  push forward significantly settlement of the main tasks today,  being tackled by the Russian, the United States, EC, and the UN  contact group. These are to achieve an end to all military  activity and bring the conflicting sides back to the negotiating  table.    This information is from the Russian Foreign Ministry.</p>

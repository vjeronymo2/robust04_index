			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Polls fuel Perot's presidential hopes MR Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, will apparently go ahead with his independent candidacy for US president. 'The decision is made. I made a commitment to the American people,' he said in an interview yesterday. Earlier Mr Perot had said he would run if his supporters could get him on the ballot in every state, a process as yet incomplete. Mr Perot may be influenced by several polls suggesting he would be a real factor in the presidential race. This runs against the history of most independent candidacies, which tend to bloom in spring before withering. The greatest concern to President George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, the presumptive Republican and Democratic runners, is probably less that Mr Perot would win outright than that he might tip the balance in some states. A Texas poll published yesterday, for example, found he could win the critical Lone Star state. The survey gave him 35 per cent to 30 per cent for the president, who calls Texas home, and 20 per cent for Mr Clinton, from neighbouring Arkansas. The White House promptly dismissed the significance of the poll, saying Mr Perot was still enjoying a political 'honeymoon' that might not stand up to scrutiny. A spokesman predicted Mr Bush would carry Texas. Another national poll in Newsweek magazine found Mr Perot's support in retreat; it gave him 20 per cent, down from 24 per cent at the start of the month. Mr Bush was given 42 per cent (from 44 per cent) and Mr Clinton 27 per cent (25 per cent). This survey also found Mr Perot doing better in the west of the country (27 per cent) than in the south (17 per cent).</p>

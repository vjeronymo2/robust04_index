			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: UAP chief sees sell-off despite 71% fall in profit MR JEAN Peyrelevade, president of UAP, France's largest insurer, believes the privatisation of the state-owned insurance group will go ahead this autumn in spite of a 71 per cent fall last year to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 200m) in profits and a cut in dividend to FFr8 a share from FFr11. The UAP chief forecast that the Balladur government's sell-off programme would not get under way until the autumn, by which time UAP's results for the first of 1993 would be in. Mr Peyrelevade said he could not foresee a repetition of 1992's 'avalanche of catastrophes and troubles'. For UAP, these ranged from the costs of Hurricane Andrew in the US, a sharp rise in French car thefts, to property-related losses incurred by the Banque Worms, its French banking subsidiary and by Danish insurers in which UAP has direct and indirect stakes. In spite of an earlier warning that profits would be sharply down from 1991's level of FFr3.76bn, UAP shares were briefly suspended yesterday to allow the market to digest news of the dividend cut. Mr Peyrelevade conceded UAP's error in getting involved in Danish insurance at a time of instability in Scandinavian financial markets. UAP last year suffered a FFr400m loss because of its indirect holding in Baltica. Yesterday, UAP said it had set aside provisions to cover its FFr270m direct stake in Hafnia, another Danish insurer. The UAP president said it was not clear that his group would want to sell Banque Worms, even after the banking subsidiary was restored to health. Last year, the bank lost FFr1.64bn and UAP injected nearly FFr1.5bn of capital into the institution. Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was under growing pressure from banks selling life insurance policies directly to their clients, and that it might be useful for the insurance group to retain a banking operation.</p>

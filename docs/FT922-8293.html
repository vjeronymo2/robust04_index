			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Brussels gives way on mail services THE European Commission yesterday pulled back from recommending the immediate liberalisation of cross-border and direct mail services. Its long-awaited green paper on the single market in postal services suggests gradual liberalisation, a significant softening of tone compared with earlier drafts which recommended their removal from post office monopolies. Some national postal authorities have lobbied hard to preserve their monopoly rights over mail services. While the paper recommends more liberalisation, it reiterates the right of each member state to apply for a 'more restrictive solution' under the EC treaty, in the interests of preserving a universal mail service for all consumers. Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, launching the discussion document with Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the commissioner responsible for the sector, said he would not rule out the use of special Commission powers to break open national monopolies without approval of member states. Sir Leon has forced the pace of change by recommending the liberalisation of express services and publications, and trying to restrict the scope of reserved areas - such as domestic private and business correspondence - in which national monopolies would be allowed to maintain control. He stressed yesterday that the Commission would move quickly to turn its discussion document into legislation. However, it will come under continued pressure from national postal adminstrations not to challenge public monopolies. Mr Pat Lupo, chairman and chief executive of the international express service DHL, said yesterday: 'It is disappointing to see the Commission yielding to pressure to amend its original proposals concerning cross-border services.' Mr Jim Campbell, counsel for the International Express Carriers Conference and European Express Organisation representing many private operators, said the paper still contained 'unwarranted traditional assumptions', although he praised its general move towards liberalisation. The British Post Office welcomed the EC's gradual move towards liberalisation. The Commission has called for the establishment of a set of reserved areas in which national administrations would be able to keep their monopoly. Such a commitment would preserve standards and ensure a universal postal service, the Commission believes. Reserved services should include domestic personal and business correspondence, the Commission says. 'A (standard) service would be available everywhere in the Community, ..irrespective of the accessibility of certain regions,' said Mr Pandolfi. The paper also recommends the creation of an independent regulator to achieve 'the best balance between public and private operators'. Composite insurers (which combine life and non-life operations) will be allowed to establish branches in any EC member state under legislation expected to be agreed by ministers today. The third life assurance directive will override clauses in a 1979 directive, which restricted composite insurers' rights to create new branches in countries outside their traditional homes of Italy, Belgium and the UK. Ministers are also set to discuss the vexed issue of frontier controls on goods, including checks on animals. Britain and Ireland want to maintain such checks, to help prevent the spread of rabies.</p>

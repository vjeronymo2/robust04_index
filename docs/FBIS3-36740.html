			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Juri Luik has commented on Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's interview to the [word  indistinct] NEWSWEEK weekly. [Words indistinct] With the  Helsinki Final Act, Russia took upon herself an unambiguous  obligation to withdraw her troops from Estonia quickly, in an  orderly manner and completely. The UN General Assembly and CSCE  foreign ministers have been demanding the same of Russia.  Keeping in mind such a consensus on the part of the world  public, each Russian hint which casts doubt on the withdrawal of  the Russian troops must be seen as violating crudely the  international behavior standards, said Juri Luik. The Russian  foreign minister's hint that the Western countries' request for  Russia to observe elementary standards of international  communication and honor unconditionally the sovereignty of her  neighboring countries would (?play a trump card) into [Vladimir]  Zhirinovskiy's hands remains completely unclear to the  [Estonian] foreign minister. Against this background, Juri Luik  recalls with worry that despite previous promises Russia failed  to hand over to Estonia a timetable for the troop withdrawal  during the recently ended 16th round of talks and not one  Russian serviceman left Estonia in January.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (6): Symphony of joyful expectations - David Gardner watches the government tune up for the EC presidency WILLY CLAES, the Belgian foreign minister, brings a rare skill to his presidency of the European Community's Council of Ministers, which Belgium took over at the beginning of July for six months. He is a conductor of some repute. He took up his orchestral baton at an eve-of-presidency concert, kicking off the Belgian mandate by conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ode to Joy, the anthem of the EC. He will no doubt be hoping for its joyful reverberations over the next six months, as he tries to keep the 12 member states in unison at a fractious and difficult time in the community's development. The Belgians are thoroughgoing federalists, at home and on the larger stage of Europe, where they have always been in the vanguard of the 'ever closer union' to which the Maastricht treaty commits the Community. But they take over the EC's rotating management in the wake of two Euro-sceptical presidencies run by the UK and Denmark, which were strongly marked by these countries' difficulties in obtaining national assent to Maastricht. The Belgian presidency's unofficial slogan, reiterated in recent interviews by prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, is 'nothing more, but nothing less' than the full application of the European Union treaty. That majority of member states in favour of greater European integration are looking expectantly to Belgium to relaunch the Europe of Maastricht and propel it towards what have recently seemed ever more distant goals of monetary and political union. Amid a flurry of pre-presidency surmise on how Belgium would try to tilt the EC balance back towards federalism, the government has dismissed suggestions that it will seek an early revision of the strict fiscal and monetary convergence criteria for economic and monetary union (Emu), and flatly denied that it will push for federalist reforms of EC decision-making ahead of the constitutional review foreseen by Maastricht for 1996. By then, up to four new member states should be inside the EC, if enough Austrians, Swedes, Finns and Norwegians can be persuaded by their governments that this is worthwhile. Most of the crunch points in the negotiations with the applicant countries will be reached on Belgium's watch  -and it will be judged in large part on how it handles them. More streamlined decision-making, implying less room for national vetoes, is seen as the inevitable consequence of the EC enlarging to take in new members. But the present accession negotiations are supposed to get the applicants in by January 1995 - last month's EC summit in Copenhagen decided  -with only minor adjustments to EC decision-making. Mr Claes told the FT it would be 'logical, democratic and fair play' to wait until the new members were in before discussing more far-reaching reforms. But he added that the goal of the Community 'is not an economic one but a political one. We need an open debate and a sincere debate in Scandinavia and in Austria on this target'. 'Maastricht,' he emphasises firmly, 'is not an ending point.' But Mr Claes, a Flemish Socialist in Mr Dehaene's Christian Democrat-dominated coalition, says his priorities are to speed up the EC enlargement talks, the fight against recession and unemployment, and implementing the Maastricht treaty, which should become fully ratified - Belgium hopes - by September at the latest. He is seeking to lay modest but solid foundations for the two new 'pillars' in Maastricht: agreement on two to three areas of its Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the embryo of a common stance on emigration and asylum policy as part of the 'third pillar' of co-operation in justice and home affairs. 'I should think that is more than enough for six months,' he says with sobriety but clear relish. EC federalists have been chastened by the backlash against the Community and the speed of European integration set off by Denmark's initial rejection of Maastricht just over a year ago. But it is, in any case, fair to say that EC partners who do not share its longer-term ambitions had always expected Belgium to run a pragmatic presidency. 'You can take it from me,' says a senior British official intimately involved in the UK's presidency last year, 'that they will be completely fair; unlike us, there will be no spin on the ball.' 'It is not wise to exaggerate the possibilities and power of a presidency,' Mr Claes says. 'We know you need consensus to make progress, and that we are just the go-betweens.' But while it is only natural after a year of EC drift for Belgium to discourage high expectations, its presidency faces a series of challenges going beyond its stated priorities. Money. Its first task will be to preside over the share-out of Ecu157bn in EC regional and structural development spending for 1994-99, when all its partners except tiny, rich Luxembourg are unhappy with Commission plans for spending it. Gatt. The Uruguay Round world trade reform talks will come to a head under the Belgian presidency. Belgium will have to contain growing tensions between France and its partners over the EC's stance, at a time when the Belgian government is increasingly sympathetic to the Paris hard line on farm trade. Mr Dehaene called last November's EC-US breakthrough on cutting farm subsidies 'a tactical blunder' in a recent interview, saying it had to be 'corrected'. EC monetary policy. It falls to Belgium to kick-start the second phase of Emu, due to start in January with the creation of the European Monetary Institute, precursor of the European Central Bank foreseen at the third stage later in the decade. The presidency will have to arbitrate amid continuing tensions arising from high German interest rates. It will also have to resolve the competition to host the EMI/ECB, as part of a complex package locating other EC institutions. Bosnia. The EC's increasingly bad conscience about not doing enough to resolve the Bosnian conflict led Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to champion lifting the arms embargo on ex-Yugoslavia to allow the Bosnian Moslems to defend themselves. At Copenhagen, the EC instead said it would send more troops to defend the Moslem 'safe areas'. Mr Dehaene has acknowledged that if not enough troops are sent, the embargo issue will come back. Beyond this lies a minefield of more mainstream EC business and concerns. On the environment, for instance, the Belgian presidency will have to arbitrate in the increasingly ill-tempered row over German waste exports for recycling, partly by pushing hard to get the stalled EC directive on packaging waste through. Having introduced its own eco-taxes (green tax) Belgium is also committed to the planned EC energy tax to combat global warming. But Britain is flatly opposed to this. The Belgians will be scrutinised closely, too, to see how well they conform to the EC's new pledge to be more open in its decision-making.</p>

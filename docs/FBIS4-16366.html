			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade April 14 TASS -- Russian envoy Vitaliy  Churkin met with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday to  discuss the situation in Bosnia and new Russian initiatives on  resolving the crisis, following NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb  positions near Gorazde.    In a brief statement for the press, Churkin refrained from  commenting on the substance of the proposals. He said though  that they aim at putting an end to hostilities in Bosnia and  restoring normal life in the republic, which is a prerequisite  for a political settlement of the conflict.    ITAR-TASS learnt from informed sources that the Serb leader  and Bosnian Serb officials may meet with Churkin shortly to  discuss Russia's initiatives and work out their position.</p>

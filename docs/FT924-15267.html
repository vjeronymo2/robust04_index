			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: End Gatt talks soon, says Hills NEGOTIATORS in Gatt's Uruguay Round must move forward in their talks over services, market access and agriculture 'in a parallel fashion', in a last-ditch effort to conclude this month the most complicated multilateral trade talks in history, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said yesterday. The task must be essentially completed in October if lawyers, working out final details, are to get a finished text to the US Congress before a March 1 deadline, she added. It is at that point that the US executive branch would lose its 'fast-track' negotiating mandate, which prevents Congress tacking amendments on to a finished deal. Mrs Hills and Mr Edward Madigan, US agriculture secretary, meet EC trade and agriculture officials in Brussels next Saturday and Sunday in a final attempt to achieve a breakthrough in the farm talks and settle a menacing dispute over oilseeds. Mrs Hills has repeatedly delayed retaliatory sanctions against the EC's oilseeds regime, although it has been twice found illegal by a Gatt dispute settlement panel. Retaliation, she said, would have 'an injurious effect on US industry', but if no solution was found, she would have no choice but to act. A solution on oilseeds would most likely have to precede an agreement on the round, but the settlement would also affect 'how Europe looks at its agriculture programme', Mrs Hills said. 'They have to deal with oilseeds. They know they do. They can fix oilseeds within the CAP (Common Agriculture Policy) reform.' One option was to cut subsidies to oilseeds producers. She hoped a breakthrough on agriculture would come when the French, second-biggest providers of services worldwide, realised the benefits they could gain, and took the necessary steps on agriculture.</p>

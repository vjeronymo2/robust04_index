			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster The meeting between the British and Irish prime ministers planned for today should result in an agreed statement on the way forward to a peace deal for Ulster. It is always a mistake to be unduly optimistic about Northern Ireland, as the latest IRA 1,000lb bomb, discovered and defused in Belfast yesterday, indicates. Yet there is evidence of a strong desire for peace in both the north and south of Ireland. More to the point, the possible outlines of an eventual peace agreement that should command support from all but the most recalcitrant extremists can now be discerned. One element might be some form of devolved assembly for the governance of the province. Its exact composition and functions would have to be negotiated with the legitimate political parties of Ulster. Once the IRA has convincingly turned away from violence Sinn Fein will doubtless be invited to join those negotiations. Mechanisms for co-operation between Dublin and Belfast might be included in the eventual package. Such constitutional details are of secondary importance to the Anglo-Irish declaration of intent on which Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds spent so much telephone time yesterday. In this delicate area every word is potentially lethal. Both prime ministers propose a guarantee that the constitutional status of Ulster will not be changed without the consent of its people, but agreement on everything else has been difficult. Referendum The IRA, which should not be permitted to call the tune, might, it appears, accept a northern veto on Irish unity, but only if the proposition is first approved by a referendum of all the people of the island of Ireland, north and south. That is unacceptable to many unionists. Mr Reynolds has offered to relinquish the articles in the republic's constitution that claim the territory of Northern Ireland, in return for a British statement recognising as legitimate, and promoting, the aspiration for Irish unity. Mr Major has had to consider the possibility of setting off a new outburst of violence by loyalist paramilitaries if he appears to lean too strongly in the republican direction. In marches and opinion polls the people of Ireland and Ulster have expressed their desire for the talks between the two prime ministers to succeed. Business leaders concur, as the FT's survey of senior business opinion in the province indicates. The poll, taken on Thursday and Friday of last week, reflects the views of chief executives of leading firms. Of 80 companies approached, 56 responded. This suggests an unprecedented willingness to express a business view of the politics of Northern Ireland. It is a measure of the economic damage that the troubles have done. Opportunities Perhaps it is not so surprising that 90 per cent of those who replied to the FT questionnaire said that an agreed political settlement that achieved an end to the violence would have a 'very' or 'fairly' positive effect on business and economic opportunities. The chief executives were, however, evenly split on the prospects. Most of them do not believe that terrorism can be defeated by military means. Some 70 per cent believe it impossible to defeat the IRA; the corresponding figure for the loyalist paramilitaries is 64 per cent. In the nature of things in the province business leaders are more likely to be Protestants than Catholics. It is striking that 61 per cent of them accept the notion of separate referenda in both parts of the island, albeit on the assumption that the purpose would be to affirm a deal guaranteeing a majority veto in Northern Ireland and leading to an end to the Republic's constitutional claim to the north. There is also a remarkable degree of support for negotiation with Sinn Fein  -36 per cent at once, or as soon as the IRA announces that it will abandon violence, and 59 per cent after the IRA has kept to a peaceful path for a period of time. Just over half the respondents favoured stronger devolved power structures in the province, and a third thought business would prosper if there were north-south links. This survey reflects moderate opinion. Today's statement of intent should challenge terrorists on both sides to lay down their arms.</p>

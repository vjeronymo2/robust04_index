			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Import fall lifts trade surplus JAPAN'S trade surplus last month rose by 18.5 per cent to Dollars 7.6bn largely as a result of a sharp fall in imports, according to figures published yesterday by the Finance Ministry. Senior officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said they are ready to open discussions with the incoming Clinton administration in the US on a new approach to trade frictions to replace the Structural Impediments Initiative, which was launched in 1989. Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of the ministry's international trade policy bureau said: 'We are ready to discuss changing the SII forum for discussing structural trade issues, particularly if a new forum included a wider group of academics and business people to analyse the situation.' Exports last month were virtually stagnant, rising by just 0.7 per cent to Dollars 27.2bn from a year before. The growth in the surplus was mainly because of a 4.8 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 19.7bn. In yen terms exports fell 5.1 per cent to Y3,351bn, while imports were down 10.5 per cent to Y2,414bn. The slowdown in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll in corporate bankruptcies, according to a report published yesterday by the Teikoku Data Bank, a research agency. Bankruptcies with debts of more than Y10m last month were 15.7 per cent up on last year, with bankruptcies in manufacturing up by 47 per cent and retail bankruptcies up by 29.7 per cent.</p>

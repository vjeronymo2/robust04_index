The rule is intended to ensure that government attorneys adhere to the highest ethical standards, while eliminating the uncertainty and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations of state rules, some of which have been incorporated by reference as local court rules in a number of federal district courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule establishes a general prohibition, subject to limited enumerated exceptions, against contacts with ``represented parties.'' This prohibition derives from the American Bar Association (``ABA'') Code of Professional Responsibility and its successor, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The proposed rule generally permits investigative contacts with represented individuals or organizations who have not yet been named as defendants in a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding or arrested as part of a criminal proceeding. However, the rule would not permit contacts with represented persons without the consent of counsel for the purpose of negotiating plea agreements, settlements or other similar legal arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department intends to issue substantial additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual (``Manual'') to provide additional direction to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals and organizations, in order to accommodate more fully the principles and purposes underlying the bar rules. Those provisions further restrict government attorneys when they contact targets of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations who are known to be represented by counsel, and when they communicate with other represented persons. The intended additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual are provided for reference as part of this commentary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before April 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be submitted to: The Office of the Associate Attorney General, United States Department of Justice, 10th St. and Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20530. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  F. Mark Terison, Senior Attorney, Legal Counsel, Executive Office for United States Attorneys, United States Department of Justice, (202) 514&hyph;5204. This is not a toll-free number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. General Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department issued for notice and comment a proposed rule on the same subject on two previous occasions. See 57 FR 54737 (Nov. 20, 1992) and 58 FR 39976 (July 26, 1993). The Department received many thoughtful comments from members of the bar, state courts, bar counsel, federal and state prosecutors and others during those comment periods. The current version of the proposed rule includes substantial revisions based on those comments. Accordingly, the Department is issuing the rule again for comments to ensure that all the interested parties have an opportunity to comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal reflects the Department's commitment to fostering ethical behavior consistent with the principles informing DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Rule 4.2 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while setting forth clear and uniform national guidelines upon which federal attorneys can rely in carrying out their responsibilities to enforce federal laws. The regulations make clear that federal attorneys generally continue to be subject to state bar ethical rules where they are licensed to practice, except in the limited circumstances where state ethical rules clearly conflict with lawful federal procedures and practices. With respect to willful violations of the contacts rules as embodied in the Attorney General's proposed regulations, federal attorneys would remain subject to state bar disciplinary sanctions. This new proposal is the product of extensive review, comments and vigorous debate among judges, federal government attorneys, members of the private bar, disciplinary officials, academics and ethicists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In essence, the proposed regulations would permit federal prosecutors and agents to continue to conduct criminal and civil investigations in routine fashion against all individuals, whether or not those persons are represented by counsel. They would allow Department attorneys to continue to make or direct undercover or overt contacts with individuals and organizations represented by counsel for the purpose of developing factual information up until the point at which they are arrested or charged with a crime or named as defendants in a civil law enforcement action. However, the regulations generally would not permit federal prosecutors to attempt to negotiate plea agreements, settlements or similar arrangements with individuals represented by counsel outside of the presence or without the consent of their attorneys. These regulations also would preclude, with certain very narrow exceptions, any contacts with represented parties after an arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint on the subject matter of the representation. The principal exception to these general prohibitions occurs when the defendant voluntarily and knowingly initiates a contact with the government attorney, in which case the regulations would require the government attorney to take the matter before a district judge or magistrate judge to obtain approval for the communication or to obtain the appointment of substitute counsel for the defendant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States Attorneys' Manual will set forth further guidance. The proposed Manual provisions, which are set out in their entirety at the end of this commentary, prohibit overt approaches by federal attorneys to represented targets of criminal or civil enforcement proceedings without the consent of counsel, unless certain enumerated exceptions are met. The Manual also will require that government attorneys receive approval from their supervisors before communicating with any represented party or represented target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since early in this century, the rules of professional conduct that govern attorneys have required that lawyers for one party in a dispute communicate only through an adverse party's lawyer, rather than directly. DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

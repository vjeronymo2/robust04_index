			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] With under a week left of Borhanoddin Rabbani's  presidential term, no dazzling breakthrough that could indicate  a closeness among the rival factions' stances on future policy  or government in Afghanistan has been perceived. The only  important step taken in this regard is the proposal by Deputy  Foreign Minister Jalil Shams for a conference in Herat in which  the representatives of every group, apart from General Dostam's  representative, will participate to discuss Afghanistan's future.    This proposal has reportedly been ineffective due to  differences of opinion on whether General Dostam's  representative should attend. This issue, along with the stances  of Golboddin Hekmatyar and Borhanoddin Rabbani on the manner of  the transfer of power after Rabbani's presidential term, has  aggravated the existing differences.    Political observers predict that if these difficulties are  not resolved in the next seven days, when Rabbani's tenure of  office ends, Afghanistan will witness more intense clashes and  bloodshed. Remember that continuing clashes--regardless of the  pretext--will not be justifiable as far as the Afghan people are  concerned. The military and political leaders of Afghanistan  and the people should have realized by now, after two years of  war and bloodshed, that military means can achieve no positive  outcome. They have no option but to resort to other means.    If the rival factions in Afghanistan do not resolve their  differences amicably they will answer to the Afghan people for  the consequences of their actions. It appears that there is  still a chance to reconcile differences. The Afghan groups  should readjust their demands and should display flexibility and  a regard for the rights of other groups. They should refrain  from intransigence and should give priority to national  interests over group interests and thus end the Afghan crisis.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Britain pushessingle market BRITAIN, which currently holds the EC presidency, yesterday called for member states to rally round the single market project as an antidote to turmoil elsewhere in the Community. Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, told internal market ministers they should make a special effort to complete the barrier-free market by the January 1, 1993 deadline. But within hours of the start of yesterday's meeting, the 12 ministers were embroiled in a familiar but fruitless debate about the working language of the planned European trademark office. The office is supposed to provide a single agency for EC companies to register trademarks. Ministers agreed yesterday that EC leaders should discuss a second problem - the site of the office - at the Edinburgh summit. Similar problems with the location of various new European agencies will also be raised there. But the 12 were unable to settle the dispute about whether the office should accept trademark applications in any of the nine official EC languages or adopt a simpler and cheaper system based on the use of English, French and German. The Commission has estimated that a nine-tongue solution could cost as much as Ecu112m (Pounds 87m) to initiate. Yesterday's meeting was also addressed by Mr Peter Sutherland, a former EC competition commissioner, who is working on a report on how to implement and enforce the market. He said before the meeting that member states should not be allowed to invoke the concept of subsidiarity to wriggle out of single market commitments. The committee he is chairing is likely to recommend centralised controls to help settle disputes which cannot be solved at national level. 'Subsidiarityshould not be used to wriggle out of single market commitments'</p>

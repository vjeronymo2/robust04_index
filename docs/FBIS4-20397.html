			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang De (1728 1795): "How Much Will Prices Rise </F> This Year"]    [Text] An authoritative national agency predicts that the  main features in the price situation in 1994 will be about the  same as during the past two years, namely high economic growth  and price reforms will continue to be the main causes of price  rises.    The source predicts that the 1994 price index will remain  generally the same or be slightly lower than in 1993. An  approximately 13 percent rise is predicted. This means that it  will not be less than two digits, and will not very likely  exceed 15 percent. If the economic growth rate is nine percent,  this will not have too strong an impact on economic life. So  long as no great ups and downs occur in the operation of the  economy, the degree of increase in prices will be tolerable.    Persons concerned feel that there are more favorable factors  in the price situation in 1994 than in 1993. The situation may  be looked at from the following several angles:    First, the intensity of price reform has diminished. The  degree and range of decontrol of prices for both means of  livelihood and means of production is already substantial in  China's pricing system. Although some price reform measures may  continue to be inaugurated during 1994, the effect will be less  than in 1993.    Second the degree of opening of China's markets to the  outside world will continue to expand in 1994. This is  particularly true of means of production markets. To a certain  extent, this will help international market resources keep in  check the overly high degree of rise in means of production  prices, thereby stabilizing China's markets.    Third, the situation in means of livelihood markets suggests  continuation of a pattern of supply being greater than demand.  This will help hold down price rises attributable to panic  buying, and it will also help restrain cost-driven currency  inflation.    Conversely, unfavorable factors may also appear in the  following several regards:    First, a fairly large amount of currency was issued in 1993,  and forecasts call for no marked weakening of this trend during  1994. This may exert a certain amount of demand pull on market  prices.    Second, prices of transportation, energy, and raw and  processed materials have risen greatly during the past two  years, spurring a rise in costs, thereby increasing market  pressures in 1994.    Third, the merging of the two different exchange rates in  1994 may give rise to price rise factors to a certain extent.    Fourth, main agricultural products are in relatively short  supply today. Prices of staple and non-staple foods may exhibit  a rising trend in 1994.    Overall, the overall price level in 1994 will be limited by  overall social supply and demand and the market environment. If  the double digit economic growth rate of 1993 is to be  maintained, the government will have no choice but to increase  credit. Reportedly, a finance and banking conference decided  that all banks in the nation must rigorously control total  credit in 1994 at below 4.5 trillion yuan. This total may not be  exceeded.    The state has made control of currency inflation and  maintenance of sustained, steady, rapid, and healthy economic  development its economic development plan for 1994. It was on  this basis that a few days ago the State Council stated the  present need to intensify macroeconomic regulation and control,  increase control over prices, and not permit prices to rise at  will. Otherwise, not only will the standard of the living of  both city and countryside residents be hurt, but this could  trigger overall instability.    Given the not insignificant current "inflation rate," there  is ample reason for having confidence that the nation's existing  macroeconomic regulation and control measures will be effective.  This is because the forecasts of an authoritative source  suggests that the income of Chinese residents used to pay living  expenses will still be higher than the degree of rise caused by  currency inflation.    However, it is hoped that this result can be realized.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILIES BURY TWO SOLDIERS KILLED IN ACTION  </P> <P> The mailman in this tiny northern Pennsylvania hamlet took an hour off Thursday  and the manager of the auto parts store locked up at 11 a.m. as hundreds of  townspeople paused in their daily toil to say goodby to a fallen son.  </P> <P> Staff Sgt. Larry R. Barnard, 29, father of three and husband to his high school  sweetheart, Tammy, was killed Dec. 21, the second day of the invasion of  Panama. But Panama seemed light years away Thursday from the rolling dairy land  along the Susquehanna River.  </P> <P> "If Larry ever brought anyone home, it was always someone who was hurting,"  said the Rev. Keith Benjamin at Barnard's funeral. "Whether he was volunteering  to mow lawns for older neighbors or offering some other help, he was the kind  of guy who could not pass a person on the street if he saw that they were  suffering."  </P> <P> At Arlington National Cemetery, across the Potomac River near the nation's  capital, Spec. Alejandro I. Manriquelozano, 30, of Lauderhill, Fla., was also  buried Thursday. A young man from a Peruvian peasant family, "he was the kind  of guy who, if you had no shirt, he would give you his," said his cousin, Jose  Canalas of Long Island, N.Y., a hotel manager.  </P> <P> The two men were among nearly a dozen American soldiers killed in the U.S.  invasion of Panama who were buried this week in ceremonies across the United  States. A total of 27 Americans -- 25 servicemen and two civilians -- were  reported killed in the fighting, but not all have been officially identified.  </P> <P> Manriquelozano was the first Panama casualty to be buried at Arlington. His  father, mother and other family members looked on sadly under a bright winter  sky. The family was given two American flags and two Purple Hearts by Army  officials.  </P> <P> Without the means to fly to the United States for the funeral, the family was  helped by Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), who arranged free airline tickets and  hotel rooms.  </P> <P> Barnard never dreamed of anything but the Army -- "100% Army," as one friend  described him a few days after his death. He volunteered for service after he  finished high school and eventually became a Ranger, a high-profile job that  led to his participation in the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983.  </P> <P> Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey had visited the Barnard family and President  Bush sent Maj. Gen. Paul Cerjan to express his country's condolences. But the  real message was the 400 people -- seemingly the entire town -- who gathered in  the new-fallen snow at the United Methodist Church here for the funeral.  </P> <P> "Thank you all so much for coming," were the only words Barnard's older  brother, Ray, could manage. His father, Ray Sr., simply broke into tears,  clutching the tri-folded U.S. flag presented to him by the military.  </P> <P> "His parents were always apprehensive (of his military work), but they were  very aware and very proud of the fact that (the Army) was of his choosing,"  said Trudy Zurn, a family friend.  </P> <P> "The thing helping the (Barnard) family at this point has simply been their  faith in God," she said. "The family has chosen not to comment on the  activities in Panama."  </P> <P> At the age of 25, Manriquelozano had left Peru and emigrated to Florida. He had  hoped to become a U.S. citizen. He enlisted in the Army two years ago.  According to family members, he hoped to earn a college degree in civil  engineering with the help of the military and remain in the Army as a career  officer.  </P> <P> On Dec. 16, four days before the invasion of Panama, the 30-year-old soldier  called his father in Peru and told him that the United States was planning to  invade Panama. "He couldn't talk too much," said Canalas, the cousin. "And he  didn't want his mother to know. He thought she would worry."  </P> <P> Manriquelozano's unit parachuted into Panama City's Torrijos Airport and  immediately engaged in a fierce firefight. Ripped by machine-gun fire almost as  he touched the ground, Manriquelozano was killed instantly, the family said.  </P> <P> The circumstances of Barnard's death still are unclear.  </P> <P> Stewart reported from Hallstead, Pa., and Soble from Arlington National  Cemetery.  </P></p>

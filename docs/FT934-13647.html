			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Britain tries to bury the Euro-myths IT'S OFFICIAL. There is no EC ban on curved cucumbers; there is no such thing as a standard Euro-lavatory; and reports that the EC intends to ban traditional British mince, fresh-farm turkeys and the sale of ripe pheasant are simply not true. The British Foreign Office would also like the rest of the world to know that it is untrue that Mr Jacques Delors' head will appear on British notes and coins; that EC rules prohibit British oak from being used for Euro-furniture because it is too knotty; and that charity shops will not be able to sell second-hand toys. These findings appear in a new British Foreign Office study published today which aims to lay to rest some of the wilder stories about Community-wide legislation, particularly that involving the Single European Act. The project is the inspiration of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, and a firm supporter of his country's EC membership. Mr Hurd's pamphlet on 'Euro-myths and Euro-scares' is an attempt to better inform a British public notoriously ambivalent about the Community. However, it is also a counter-blast against British Euro-sceptics who hijacked the recent conference of the ruling Conservative party. In a self-penned introduction, Mr Hurd appeals for a British sense of fair play. The Single Market obviously requires EC legislation, both to protect the British business selling abroad and the British consumer buying goods from elsewhere in the EC. 'But we need to strike the right balance,' he says. The Foreign Office used Britain's popular press as the source for many of the Euro-myths, but it also concedes that some of the fairy-tales are grounded in fact. Hence, it is true that EC rules will restrict British wine production, even though the UK is a minnow compared with France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. EC rules say that countries producing more than 2.5m litres of wine may not plant new vines. It is also fact that carrots are listed as a fruit under a 1979 EC directive on jam. This was agreed so that the Portuguese could continue using carrots in the production of jam. Less black and white, perhaps, is the British view on the EC directive on limiting the working week to 48 hours. Despite the support of 11 other EC member states, Her Majesty's government position remains that the law is 'pointless, unwelcome and will be challenged in the European Court of Justice' once it has been adopted.</p>

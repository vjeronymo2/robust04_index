			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2-A BOYS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH SHAKES OFF BISHOP, 73-62  </P> <P> Leading by two points with about four minutes remaining, Laguna Beach High  School was finally able to shake a quick and determined Bishop team Tuesday  night, taking a 73-62 victory in the Southern Section 2-A playoffs at San  Clemente High school.  </P> <P> Guard John Trevino began the 15-6 closing run with a 10-foot shot with 3  minutes 22 seconds remaining, then made another 10-footer in the key to give  the Artists (21-5) a 62-56 lead. Josh Borella, who had a game-high 28 points,  made three of four free throws and Trevino drove the lane, took a pass from  Brady Butcher and scored to give Laguna Beach a 67-57 lead with 1:55 left.  </P> <P> With 1:32 remaining, Dain Blanton took a lob pass and scored on a layup to give  the Artists a 12-point lead and put the game out of reach.  </P> <P> "Josh did a good job helping to break the press," Laguna Beach Coach Ed Bowen  said. "We can break a press easily. And Trevino went in there and got some  points when we needed them in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "It took us longer to win tonight then I thought it would. They (Bishop) play  tough -- they're good athletes. And after a trip like that, that must be hard."  </P> <P> Bishop, which traveled more than 300 miles, led, 18-14, after the first  quarter. But Laguna Beach came back and took a 23-22 lead with 4:41 left in the  half.  </P> <P> A spurt late in the second quarter, led by Borella's nine points, gave Laguna  Beach a 36-29 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Bishop (15-10) fought back to go ahead, 51-49, early in the fourth quarter, but  a 15-footer by Blanton with 5:54 left gave the Artists the lead for good,  53-51.  </P> <P> In the 2-A:  </P> <P> El Segundo 80, Orange Lutheran 63 -- Despite shooting 51% (23-45) from the  field, Orange Lutheran fell at West Torrance High.  </P> <P> El Segundo (15-13), which made 30 of 53 field goals for 57%, was led by Scott  Panfil's 26 points.  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Luke Aucoin's three-pointer on the opening possession of the  second quarter gave the Lancers (16-11) a 19-18 lead. But Panfil scored the  game's next six points on consecutive three-point baskets, and El Segundo led  the rest of the way.  </P> <P> With 12 first-half points on six-of seven shooting, junior center Brian Bedord  kept the Lancers close and they trailed 35-31 at halftime.  </P> <P> But Panfil scored 15 third-quarter points, mostly on mid-range jump shots, to  give El Segundo a 58-48 entering the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "We let them have their shots in the second half," said Bedord, who finished  with 21 points. "It was just bad defense." DAVID RAATZ  </P></p>

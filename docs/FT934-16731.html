			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Prague on the Thames Over the next three weeks, the South Bank is running a 'Czech Season': not just a matter of dusting off familiar Dvorak and Janacek, for there are unfamiliar and intriguing pieces too - by Suk, by Kozeluch and Krommer, Eben and Benda, orchestral pieces and chamber works old and new, in all three of the South Bank halls. Among the visiting Czech performers, on Saturday we had the venerable Czech Philharmonic to open the season in the Festival Hall. Their programme consisted, grandly and simply, of Smetana's six-part cycle Ma Vlast, 'My Fatherland', which we scarcely ever hear in a complete end-to-end performance. Everybody knows the enchanting river-scape Vltava, but the other five panels get only occasional exposure. If the programme-book was over-excitable in declaring Ma Vlast 'without a doubt the most complete embodiment of the Czech spirit in music', the conductor Jir Belohlavek and his players persuaded us that the cycle is indeed aglow with national spirit and that nobody is likely to deliver it so fairly and fervently as Czechs. Calling the components of Ma Vlast 'symphonic poems' is stretching a point. Smetana offers even less symphonic argument or development than Berlioz or Liszt. Except for Vltava, each of these pieces works chiefly by alternating tuneful sections, with the odd academic fugato and loud, emphatic repetitions at the close. The saving virtues are Smetana's natural, unadorned fluency (folk-based but inventive too), his special and affecting turns of modal harmony, and his pristine orchestration: no recherche tricks or blends, but a lovely appreciation of plain instrumental character. His strings always sound like strings, his clarinets like clarinets, his horns like horns; the sophisticated ambiguities of a Strauss or a Debussy were still some way off. Like his Russian contemporary Balakirev, Smetana was a master of 'honest' orchestral sound. It is a rare Western band that can play him now with the right unforced, uncomplicated candour - but the Czech Philharmonic did. Ma Vlast was wonderfully bracing to hear, even for us non-Czechs who lack the native response to the most resounding patriotic tunes.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Case history Hope that professional investors attending Singer &amp; Friedlander's Company Investor Show on Thursday pay a bit more attention than they did last year. The idea is to give small quoted company stocks an opportunity to tell their story to the investment community. Last year, fund managers, brokers and analysts attending were asked to pick the three stocks that would perform best over a six month period. No one came close to picking the winning portfolio - car distributor William Jacks, chemical colours company European Colour or Regent Hotels - and no prize was awarded. All jolly embarrassing. In a bid to tickle the palates of a better class of punter, this time round the organisers are offering a case of White Burgundy - 1992 Meursault.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Shareholders' banker If there is such a thing as a popular banker, then Sir Eric Faulkner, the former chairman of Lloyds Bank who has just died, fitted the bill. He spent over 30 years at Glyn, Mills &amp; Co, a small bank where a disproportionate number of City bankers cut their teeth. Sir Jeremy Morse, Sir Richard Lloyd, Alan Moore, Alex Ritchie, John Sclater and John Butterwick are just a few of the figures who learnt their trade under Sir Eric. He would probably have stayed at Glyn, Mills but for a quirk of fate. Sir Reginald Verdon-Smith, chairman of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, had been lined up to take over from Sir Harald Peake as chairman of Lloyds in 1969. But Sir Reginald withdrew after a Public Accounts Committee report criticised the excess profits made by Bristol Siddeley Engines on official contracts. Meanwhile, Glyn, Mills was on the point of merging with the National Bank and William Deacon's, and Faulkner probably realised that he was not going to get the top job in a group dominated by the Royal Bank of Scotland. One can only wonder what would have happened if he had taken charge of the Royal Bank of Scotland rather than a rudderless Lloyds Bank which had just been refused permission to merge with Barclays and Martins Bank. The Royal Bank drifted for more than a decade until it became an obvious takeover target. By contrast Lloyds Bank, the smallest of the big four, set off to become a successful international bank. When the secondary banking crisis struck in the early 1970s, it was Faulkner, as chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers, who helped organise the various bank rescues. If only the City had bred more bankers in Sir Eric's mould then the high-street banks might not have had to tap their shareholders for so much money to shore up their balance sheets in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

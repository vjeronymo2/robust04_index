			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Banks step in to stem dollar's advance CONCERTED DOLLAR sales by European central banks and weak economic news from the US yesterday took some of the steam out of the dollar's rise. Eleven central banks, spearheaded by the German Bundesbank, took action to support the D-Mark with large bouts of dollar sales around midday in European trading. The German currency, stricken by domestic political shocks and economic uncertainty, has been the main victim of the dollar. The US unit's rise has quickened as signs of an emerging economic recovery have rapidly followed the end of the Gulf war. Traders reported that the central banks of Finland, Norway and Denmark as well as the UK, Italy and France were selling dollars, pushing down the US currency about 2 1/2 pfennigs in Europe. The action possessed an element of surprise. The markets had to begun to believe that the Bundesbank was against intervention while the Federal Reserve was content with the level of US interest rates. There was no apparent trigger point for the intervention but the banks were thought to have been spurred by the currency's French fixing at DM1.7580, the 16-month high it set on Monday. The attempt to cap the dollar was aided by news that there was an unexpectedly large 6.2 per cent drop in new orders for US manufactured durable goods last month. Analysts said the intervention was likely to have only a very limited effect. Further dollar strength and D-Mark weakness were in store. In New York, the dollar closed at DM1.7435, after finishing at DM1.7420 in London, where it had closed at Dollars 1.766 on Monday. On Wall Street the economic news, and comments by the Fed chairman about interest rate policy, had a damping effect on share prices after a string of strong first-quarter company results spurred a modest recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.73 higher at 2,930.45. Fall in US durables, Page 6 UK trade gap, Page 20 Currencies, Page 31 Wall Street, Page 37</p>

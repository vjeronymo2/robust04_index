The Bezeq Company did not  order employees to return to work last night and conducted  negotiations with them to secure their agreement to end the  disruptions. Our correspondent Meron Tzur reports that the  employees have not said whether they will end disruptions before  the District Labor Court issues a judgment on Sunday.</p>

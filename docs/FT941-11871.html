			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / People: Terry Upsall Terry Upsall, who has died, apparently from a stroke while on holiday, was one of the best known figures in the UK housebuilding industry. He was 56 and leaves a wife and two children, both married. Upsall was one of the principal architects behind the expansion of Beazer Homes from a small West Country builder to the country's third-largest housebuilder. He became chief executive of Beazer Homes in 1974 two years after joining the company, and subsequently he became chief executive, as well, of Beazer's US housing and and property interests. In 1991 he assumed additional responsibility for contracting in the UK. When in that year Beazer decided to float its UK and European operations, it named Upsall as prospective chief executive of the company - to be named CBH group. The flotation was aborted after Hanson, the UK and US conglomerate made an agreed bid for the whole of the Beazer Group. Hanson recently announced that it intends to float Beazer's UK housebuilding business by the end of March. Upsall was highly respected as one of the country's most successful housebuilders and in 1990 became president of the House Builders' Federation. He retired from Beazer in 1992 and became a non-executive director of housebuilders Berkeley Group last year.</p>

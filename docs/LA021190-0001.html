			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLOUCHING TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM  </P> <P> As a teacher, parent and concerned citizen, I wish to respond to Vartan  Gregorian's opinion on education. The last sentence of his second paragraph --  "More and more, the first two years of college resemble the last two years of  high school" -- strikes me not as just a fact but as a solution to the problem  of school drop-outs, truancy, apathy, teacher shortage, overcrowded classes and  sites.  </P> <P> Why not adopt the European method of testing students and graduating them at  16, thereby offering them the opportunity of starting college earlier or  entering a vocational program or training as apprentices on the job?  </P> <P> Industry needs to become more involved by beginning in the junior high schools  to promote its needs for skilled employees and then providing opportunities for  observation-participation days.  </P> <P> Vacations should be emphasized as well. Students who travel learn more about  geography, history, math, sociology, psychology, English and other languages by  exposure rather than enforced study for a grade.  </P> <P> The time has come to not just wring our hands but review, revise and reduce the  number of years that students are supposed to stay in school.  </P> <P> CLAIRE WEINBERG, Granada Hills  </P></p>

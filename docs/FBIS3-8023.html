There was no immediate confirmation from Belgrade.  The Macedonian press Thursday said unpaid debts by Macedonian  airlines had risen to 2.5 million dollars.    The measure would mean another hardship for Macedonia, which  is already suffering under a controversial trade embargo imposed  last month by Greece in a dispute over Macedonia's name. The  Greek embargo effectively cut off Macedonia's oil supplies.    Vanja Bitoljanu, director of Macedonia's biggest airline  company Paler Makedonija, told AFP there was no way for airlines  to pay their debts to Yugoslavia since there was no transport  agreement between the two former members of the old Yugoslav  federation.    Rump Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and  Montenegro,  has not recognized Macdonian independence, which was declared in  1991.    Air traffic taking off from Macedonia has been rerouted over  Bulgaria and Romania, which adds an average 30 minutes to  flights and increases the cost by some 2,500 dollars each time,  the press reports said.    Bitoljanu also said that for the last two years only  Yugoslavia was receiving payments of taxes for the 300 to 400  yearly overflights airlines make over Yugoslavia and Macedonia  en route to Greece.    Analysts cited Thursday by the daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA  suggested there was a link between the reported ban on  Macedonian flights over Yugoslavia and the trade embargo imposed  by Greece, a traditional ally of Serbia.    Greece has challenged Macedonia's use of its name, the same  as a Greek province. It accuses Skopje of usurping part of  Greek heritage and harboring expanionist aims over Greek  territory. Its trade embargo cut off Macedonian access to the  Greek port of Salonika, though which most of Macedonia's  essential supplies including oil arrive. A prolonged blockade  could strangle Macedonia's economy.    NOVA MAKEDONIJA also said the European Union had agreed to a  15 million-dollar credit for Macedonia to finance the  development of its air transport system. Britain meanwhile has  granted 50,000 pounds (75,000 dollars) to modernize Skopje's  airport.</p>

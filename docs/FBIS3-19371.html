The new loss was discovered yesterday during an  extraordinary  and detailed accounting of weapons and ammunition of all units  ordered by Army General Staff (YES) chief Lieutenant General  Voulgaris, following the theft of the G3 A3 guns from a Larisa  unit a few days ago. The weapon (G3 A4) was missing from the  command unit of the 651 AVIP [expansion unknown] located in  Ayios Stefanos. A sworn investigation was ordered. According to  YES officials, it is possible that the weapon was stolen long  ago.    It is believed that in December another G3 A4 gun was stolen  from a unit of the Kavala division.    In Larisa, the investigation revealed, among other  shortcomings, that rules of internal security were not kept.  [passage omitted]</p>

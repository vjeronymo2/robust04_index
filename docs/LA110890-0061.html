			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAMONA COACH GALLI QUITTING AT END OF SEASON  </P> <P> One career victory shy of 100, Ramona Coach Mel Galli might have only one shot  left -- Friday night against Rancho Bernardo -- to reach the milestone.  </P> <P> Galli, the Bulldogs' football coach for the past three years, is retiring from  coaching at the end of this season.  </P> <P> Galli, 43, has accepted a position as Ramona's dean of students and also will  relinquish his duties as athletic director.  </P> <P> Ramona, which made the playoffs for the first time in school history last year,  is 4-5, 2-4, heading into Friday's game against Rancho Bernardo at Ramona. A  victory might put the Bulldogs in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "Actually I decided a couple of years that I was only going to do the job at  Ramona for a maximum of three years," said Galli, who retired once before after  stays at Carlsbad High (eight years) and schools in Utah and Washington. "I  really didn't know if I was going to stay at Ramona or move somewhere else."  </P> <P> Galli said when he got the job as dean, it became official. He was retiring  from coaching.  </P> <P> He did, however, add: "This time I'm not quite as naive to think I'll never  coach again. In the back of my mind, I just can't quite picture (not coaching).  Everyone that really knows me, knows it will be hard to picture me not  (coaching)."  </P> <P> In another coaching change, Fred Sills has resigned as girls' volleyball coach  at Southwest High. Sills, however, will remain as boys' volleyball coach and  athletic director. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

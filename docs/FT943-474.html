			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Guidelines on directors' option schemes issued The Accounting Standards Board, which regulates financial reporting in the UK, yesterday issued non-mandatory guidelines on the disclosure of directors' share-option schemes. In June this year the ASB's urgent issues taskforce put out a draft proposal to encourage greater disclosure amid an increasingly controversial debate on executive pay. It recognised at the time that when it was eventually published the code would not carry the force of law and could not be enforced by the Financial Reporting Review Panel. However, the urgent issues taskforce has sought to give the abstract some teeth by urging both the government and the Stock Exchange to back the code by modify-ing company regulations. It is urging the Department of Trade and Industry to update its company law review and the Stock Exchange to include disclosure in its listing requirements. The ASB hopes that the abstract will add significantly to the pressure on companies to comply with what it sees as best practice and publish details of share option schemes. The board points out that greater disclosure of executives' remuneration was urged by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance in its report published at the end of 1992. Companies are being asked to show option information for all directors, and separately listed for individual directors. They should also reveal the exercise price and the prevailing share price of any options exercised during the financial year to which the accounts refer. The original aim was to make its recommendations compulsory. However, they were caught by a loophole in the law. The 1985 Companies Act calls for disclosure of emoluments payable to directors, including 'the estimated money value of any benefits . . . otherwise than in cash.' But the drafting of the law means that if the benefits cannot be precisely quantified, they do not have to be disclosed at all. For most companies, the proposals will require extra effort, although some, including SmithKline Beecham, British Petroleum and Reuters Holdings, already provide quite extensive disclosure of the value of share options as part of the data on directors' remuneration.</p>

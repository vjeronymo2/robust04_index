			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Further trials loom for Lamont: The difficulties the chancellor faces in preparing the Budget THE trials of Mr Norman Lamont show few signs of ending. Having survived the trauma of sterling's devaluation last September, the chancellor faces a difficult two months in which to fashion his Budget. The main challenge for Mr Lamont and his Treasury advisers - who will discuss the Budget today and tomorrow at his residence in Chevening, Kent - will be how to tackle the mounting financial deficit without constraining any fragile recovery. One option for the chancellor is to announce in March a modest increase in taxation of perhaps Pounds 4bn with the aim of reining back the mounting public sector borrowing requirement. As any tax rise is likely to be unpopular, he may also want to cut interest rates, now at 7 per cent, and announce measures to help industry. He will almost certainly take some action to reduce the rise in the deficit, which according to the Treasury's published assumptions will reach Pounds 37bn this financial year and about Pounds 44bn in 1993-94. Mr Lamont could gain an extra Pounds 4bn or so in tax revenues in 1993-94 through measures such as extending value added tax to newspapers and heating bills, imposing an environmentally helpful increase in petrol tax and ordering non-indexation of some income-tax allowances. Without such measures and using calculations based on a rule of thumb used by the Treasury to link likely deficits will projected growth, the PSBR could easily stay at Pounds 40bn to Pounds 50bn until at least 1995-96. On the worst-case assumption that growth remains extremely weak over these years, the deficit could climb by then to Pounds 75.8bn or 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This would be a far cry from the position in the late 1980s, when Britain for several years chalked up a surplus. Although a long period of large deficits would not necessarily be catastrophic, it would probably weaken international confidence in the UK. It might also require high interest rates to gain funds from overseas investors via the gilts market. The main culprit for the slide in the government's finances has been the recession, which has eaten into tax revenues and pushed up government spending on unemployment and social security. If strong recovery were in prospect, the PSBR could be counted on to come down fairly quickly as tax income rose and the jobless register fell. But to many economists this appears unlikely. The main restraints on a sharp upturn include the world economic slowdown, together with continued nervousness by UK consumers and businesses about taking on new credit after the large borrowings of the late 1980s. As a result, real inflation-adjusted growth this year will probably be no more than about 1 per cent, according to the Treasury and many private-sector economists. As for what happens after this year, the Treasury assumed in the Autumn Statement that growth would pick up relatively quickly, reaching about 3.7 per cent in both 1994-95 and 1995-96 after 1.9 per cent in 1993-94. Even on this fairly optimistic view, which implies higher growth figures than those projected by many economists, the Treasury rule of thumb gives PSBRs for 1994-95 and 1995-96 of Pounds 44.6bn and Pounds 43.7bn respectively. The arithmetic based on this rule also implies a PSBR in 1993-94 of Pounds 48.3bn. The rule of thumb, which assumes tax policy stays unchanged, is linked to how GDP changes in relation to the 'trend' - the optimum rate at which the economy can expand without either high unemployment or bursts of inflation. This figure is normally taken to be about 2.25 per cent a year. According to the rule, a drop in GDP of 1 percentage point below the trend rate for a specific year leads to a fall of 0.3 points in the ratio of government revenues to GDP. Although the rule gives only a rough guide to expected deficits, it can indicate how periods of high or low growth will affect the PSBR. On the basis that the economy follows a 'medium growth' path - with GDP expanding by 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 2 per cent in the three financial years from 1993-94 - the deficit would climb to Pounds 64.4bn in 1995-96, equivalent to 9.3 per cent of GDP. Such large figures appear plausible to many City economists. Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers expects the PSBR to climb to more than Pounds 60bn by 1995-96. One view is that after the long recession output might rebound quickly, with projected growth figures even higher than those published by the Treasury in the Autumn Statement. But this argument is looking less respectable given that a period of sharp growth, perhaps helped by large cuts in interest rates, would almost certainly lead to a big rise in imports. As well as pushing up the large current-account deficit this would certainly lead to unacceptably high inflation, especially given the pound's depreciation since its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PROJECTIONS OF GOVERNMENT DEFICITS UNDER DIFFERENT GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1992-93   1993-94   1994-95   1995-96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High growth* Govt revenues (Pounds bn)       223.1     232.8     252.4     271.7 PSBR (Pounds bn)                 37.7      48.3      44.6      43.7 PSBR as % of GDP                  6.3       7.6       6.6       6.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium growth ** Govt revenues (Pounds bn)       223.1     228.6     240.4     251.0 PSBR (Pounds bn)                 37.7      52.5      56.6      64.4 PSBR as % of GDP                  6.3       8.4       8.6       9.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Low growth *** Govt revenues (Pounds bn)       223.1     228.6     236.2     242.2 PSBR (Pounds bn)                 37.7      53.9      63.3      75.8 PSBR as % of GDP                  6.3       8.6       9.7      11.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assumes tax policy unchanged.

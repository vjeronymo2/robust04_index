			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HURDLE CLEARED FOR COLUMBIA S&amp;L BOND SALE;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE U.S. ADOPTS A NEW POLICY ON HOW TO HANDLE SUCH DEALS.  </P> <P> A policy adopted last week by federal officials removes a major hurdle for  ailing Columbia Savings &amp; Loan to sell its collection of junk bonds, most  recently valued at $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> Columbia's previous agreement to sell the bonds for $3 billion to a  Canadian-led partnership, in a deal that the Beverly Hills-based thrift would  have financed through a note, was scrapped in September by federal savings and  loan regulators.  </P> <P> One of the main reasons cited for the deal's cancellation was that the  government lacked a policy for financing such a sale. Last week, however, the  board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency mopping up the  thrift mess, approved a broad policy expanding the ability of thrifts to  finance similar transactions.  </P> <P> Unlike most insolvent thrifts, Columbia has not been taken over by the  government because regulators would like to sell the junk bonds first in a  private sale. But the thrift is insolvent by $710 million, stemming from the  free fall in the value of its junk bond portfolio, and has acknowledged in  public documents that it will probably be seized eventually. Because the thrift  is so troubled, regulators want the terms in any sale to follow their own  policies.  </P> <P> As previously reported, seven groups have expressed interest. Of those, four  are believed to be favorites. They are the Gordon partnership and groups led by  three Wall Street firms -- Salomon Bros., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and the  Lehman Bros. unit of Shearson Lehman Bros. Holdings. The Salomon group is  believed to also include Citicorp and the investment firm Odyssey Partners.  </P> <P> Because of the new policy, Columbia executives are expected to begin more  detailed talks with prospective bidders this month.  </P></p>

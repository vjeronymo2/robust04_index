			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Nestle expects 10% growth in profits NESTLE, the world's largest food group, expects net profits to grow by about 9 or 10 per cent this year from last year's SFr2.47bn (Dollars 164m), Mr Helmut Maucher, the chairman, said. Nestle also revealed it plans to split its registered shares 10 for one later this year and to convert its participation certificates into registered shares next year. In the wake of its recent takeover of Source Perrier, the group intends to establish a headquarters in France for its global mineral water business, with Mr Serge Milhaud, a long-serving group executive, and a French national, in charge. Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said Nestle and its bidding ally, Banque Indosuez, had more than 80 per cent of the capital of Perrier following the closing of their offer last Thursday. He said the net cost of the purchase to Nestle, once the Volvic mineral water and Caves de Roquefort cheese businesses had been sold, would be just over SFr2bn. No new capital needed to be raised to pay for it. The group's net debt stood at SFr4.5bn at the end of last year, representing only 26.9 per cent of shareholders' equity, he explained. Also, profits from the Perrier business were expected to cover the interest costs involved from the July 1 takeover date. The addition of Perrier's mineral water assets to Nestle's existing brands would make the group the largest mineral water supplier in the world with annual sales of 1bn litres, worth SFr3bn. Mineral water would then account for about 6 per cent of group sales. Mr Domeniconi said the group's handling of the takeover would not be affected by the outcome of the investigation being carried out by the European Commission's cartel office and due to be completed late in July. Nestle is taking advantage of a new Swiss law enabling it to split its shares. The Nestle registered shares now trade at about SFr9,600 each, so the split would make them more affordable for small investors.</p>

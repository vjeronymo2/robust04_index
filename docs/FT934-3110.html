			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Ford unveils credit card to rival GM Ford has joined forces with Barclaycard to enter the UK credit card war, following its rival Vauxhall's entry to the market in October. Ford already issues credit cards in the US. Ford's approach is two-pronged. It will issue Ford-Barclaycard credit cards, available from April next year. It will also forge a link with Barclaycard's existing customer-loyalty programme, giving Barclaycard holders the chance of discounts on Ford cars from January. The Ford-branded credit cards, available as Visa or Mastercard, can be seen as a direct response to Vauxhall's GM Mastercard and Visa, to be issued from January. Both work as normal credit cards, but heavy spenders can earn rebates on new cars: 5 per cent of each transaction is given back as points towards rebates of up to Pounds 600 a year (maximum Pounds 1,800) with Ford, and Pounds 500 a year (maximum Pounds 2,500) with Vauxhall. The difference with Ford's scheme is that it will not be necessary to have a Ford-branded card to participate. About 3m of Barclaycard's 8m customers are already registered with its Profiles scheme, which gives one Profiles point for every Pounds 10 spent. Points currently buy gifts from a catalogue, but from January they can also be used towards buying a new Ford. Cardholders not registered with Profiles will be invited to join. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, predicted that the first car bought at a discount using the Barclaycard scheme would be on the road by the end of January. About 250,000 existing Barclaycard holders already have enough points for a Pounds 600 rebate. The Ford card has two disadvantages compared with the GM card. It will charge an annual fee of Pounds 10 (waived for the first year), whereas GM has no plans for a fee for its card. Secondly, the interest rate for Barclaycards is higher, at 1.585 per cent a month, compared with GM's 1.53 per cent.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Commons tactics to be sharpened The Labour leadership left the Blackpool conference yesterday planning a radical overhaul of the party's parliamentary activities to sustain the momentum of Mr Tony Blair's modernisation drive. Mr Blair, who believes that the conference has changed the nature of the Labour party, has told friends that he will refuse to 'follow the government agenda' when MPs return to Westminster this month after the summer break. He believes Mr John Major's government can be unsettled by more imaginative use of Labour's parliamentary rights, and better attendance by Labour MPs. The campaign will start with a shake-up in the frontbench team, including the shadow cabinet, to give talented younger MPs more opportunity to shine. But the focus will be on Mr Blair's performance at prime minister's question time, the twice-weekly ritual intended to allow MPs to hold Mr Major to account. Mr Blair believes he can rattle Mr Major by avoiding the formulaic approach of most recent opposition leaders in favour of a more unpredictable strategy. Allies say he intends to illuminate Labour's political approach rather than merely seek to exploit government embarrassment on topical issues. Mr Blair may also decide to ask a single question occasionally, rather than the often repetitive ration of three to which custom entitles him. The change of parliamentary tactics is part of a series of measures intended to put fresh life into Labour's image, which party strategists believe has put off voters. The revised approach was signalled as the conference drew to a close and Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, promised that the leadership would 'put a smile on the face of our politics'. As delegates prepared for the ritual singing of The Red Flag - assisted this year by printed songsheets to avoid embarrassing stumbling over the words - Mr Prescott called for an end to 'dreary meetings' attended by half a dozen members. Launching a recruitment drive intended to raise membership from 290,000 to 500,000 in two years he told delegates: 'There is more to Labour than composites and committees.' In a witty speech largely delivered from notes - unlike his barnstorming end of conference speech on one-member-one-vote last year - he told delegates to 'stop speaking the language of the past and start practising the politics of the future'. Mr Prescott warned against complacency, but said the Conservatives were 'running scared' of a Labour party which had learned its lessons and was again hungry for power. 'Tony Blair is leading a party which is reaching out to people and inspiring them with a new politics,' he said.</p>

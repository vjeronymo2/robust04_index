			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USC TEACHER CONVICTED IN CHILD PORNO CASE  </P> <P> The principal bass player for the Los Angeles Philharmonic was convicted of a  misdemeanor charge Wednesday in a child pornography case that City Atty. James  K. Hahn called a "classic glimpse into the shadowy world of pedophilia."  </P> <P> After 1 1/2 days of deliberations, a Los Angeles Municipal Court jury convicted  Dennis M. Trembly of exhibiting material depicting a child engaging in sexual  conduct.  </P> <P> Trembly, 41, of Los Angeles, who performs with the Philharmonic in addition to  serving as a music professor at USC, gave an undercover officer a copy of a  magazine featuring child pornography, Hahn said.  </P> <P> Investigators, armed with a search warrant, also found an untitled 8mm film  featuring child pornography in Trembly's home, according to a spokesman for the  city attorney.  </P> <P> "This case is a classic glimpse into the shadowy world of pedophilia and  (shows) how pedophiles operated," Hahn said when the charge was filed in June.  </P> <P> Police became aware of Trembly when U.S. Customs Service agents seized a child  pornography magazine addressed to him, said Deputy City Atty. Tracy Webb.  </P> <P> An undercover detective, feigning interest in child pornography, contacted  Trembly and began corresponding with him, the prosecutor said. After exchanging  several letters and phone calls, Trembly mailed the officer a copy of  "Lollitots," which featured young girls in sexually explicit poses, Hahn said.  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Share options put under spotlight THE EXERCISING of share options by directors would have been significantly curbed if guidelines being considered by institutional investors had been in force in 1991 and 1992, says research by Incomes Data Services published today. Institutional investors have been increasingly concerned about generous remuneration packages for directors, and have turned their attention to share option schemes, which require shareholders' approval. Guidelines suggested by the National Association of Pension Funds say options should be exercised only if the rise in the company's share price at least matched the rise in the FT-A All-Share Index over the option period. According to the June issue of IDS Management Pay Review, one-in-five options exercised by directors of top companies during two quarters in 1991 and 1992 would have been disallowed by the association's guidelines. The National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers disagree over how tough guidelines should be. They have delayed until next month their announcement of joint guidelines on share options as the main part of their platform for curbing excesses in directors' pay.

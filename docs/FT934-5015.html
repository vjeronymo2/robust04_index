			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax relief is ended on extortion payments Payments made as a result of extortion by terrorist groups or other criminals will not be allowed to be offset against income for tax purposes, the Inland Revenue said. The intention was to discourage people from simply submitting to extortion, and to make it clear that such payments will not be subsidised through the tax system. The new provision will apply to payments made on or after today.</p>

The State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a  regular new briefing that Christopher and Qian "will discuss a  full range of issues, including international questions  requiring joint cooperation and bilateral issues that affect our  relations." Bilateral issues include "human rights,  non-proliferation and trade," she added.    In answering questions, she confirmed that the State  Department "reviewed earlier in the week about the specific  connection of the human rights issue to MFN (most-favored-nation  trade status)."    The Clinton administration's position on this issue, she  said, is that there has been "some progress, but not the kind of  progress that we're looking for in terms of conditions that have  been set for a renewal of MFN.... There is still a long way to  go."    The spokeswoman denied the reported divergence between the  views of U.S. ambassador in China, Stapleton Roy, and  administration's position on the human rights issue.    Ambassador Roy said in an interview published in the NEW  YORK  TIMES two weeks ago that China had made "dramatic" progress in  improving the lives of its people and that this record should be  taken into account when the U.S. policy toward China is reviewed  in the new year.    Shelly noted that Roy's policy analysis, his policy  recommendations to the administration "do carry particular  weight." However, she argued that the ambassador's remarks and  total interview "definitely should be taken as a whole."    During Christopher's trip to Paris, Shelly said, he will  also  discuss with French officials president Clinton's meetings in  Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva and address "a wide range  of subjects of mutual concern."</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shares lose 39p as Eurocamp is cautious about 1993 A CAUTIOUS statement from Eurocamp, the self-drive camping holiday specialist, cut 39p off the shares which closed at 307p yesterday. Eurocamp reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m for the year to October 31, 15 per cent higher than pro forma profits of Pounds 8.16m the previous year, and compared with actual profits of Pounds 6.94m. Eurocamp went public in July 1991, raising Pounds 24.8m, at a price of 225p. Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said: 'Our early booking returns for 1993 for our UK businesses have to date fallen below normal expectations.' Bookings through the Dutch and German operations, which contributed 37 per cent of bookings in 1992, were better. Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said that the UK market had been slow but had firmed up recently. He said booking patterns were changing with people delaying bookings. Normally about 75 per cent of the group's bookings are made by the end of February. A statement about bookings would be made at the annual meeting in March. Turnover last year rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 61.3m, with the number of bookings rising 19 per cent. Operating profits were up 11.6 per cent to Pounds 9.6m, as lower margin parts of the business performed better, although margins in each segment were held, Mr Atkinson said. Interest took Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 470,000 pro forma). Mr Atkinson said sterling's devaluation last September would not affect costs in 1993 but would have a small impact in 1994. A large part of the costs are covered by revenue from the Dutch and German operations. Earnings per share were 24.2p (21.1p pro forma) and a final dividend of 6.3p (5.5p) gives a total of 9.75p, up 14.7 per cent on the notional dividend for the previous year. COMMENT It is near impossible to predict current year profits at this stage, though by the AGM the picture should be much clearer. But yesterday's share price fall looks a touch overdone, especially given the results. Eurocamp is a much safer bet than the average tour operator, not dependent on last minute bookings and better able to tailor its costs to sales. Further it is in a growing niche of the market, and is expanding well on the Continent. Same again profits and earnings would give a reasonable p/e of 12.7. If the news is better in March the shares should have a run.</p>

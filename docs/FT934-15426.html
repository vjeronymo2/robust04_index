			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: European at heart - William Packer on the work of American artist Thomas Eakins The small but choice study at the National Portrait Gallery of the work of American painter, Thomas Eakins, brings a significant artist to European attention for the first time. That in itself is remarkable: for Eakins died in 1916 aged 72, and though he spent all his working life in his native Philadelphia and never cultivated a fashionable reputation, he has stood high in American critical regard since at least the 1930s. A single work in the collection of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris is the total of his success abroad. That this has been a great mistake and, from a European point of view, our loss, is manifest from the work we now see. But the real problem, perhaps, lies deeper. He was, after all, an artist of the generation of Sargent, Whistler and Merrit Chase, who, like them, came to Europe and, in particular, to Paris to study. It is clear from his work that he took full advantage of his years away, acquainting himself not only with the work of the old masters, particularly of Ribera and Velasquez, which he travelled to Spain to see, but also that of his contemporaries. For Paris in the 1860s was in a ferment of activity, with the growth of impressionism to set against the academicism of the Salon, and a general social realism holding the middle ground. It is on this middle ground that Eakins takes his rightful place, to be considered as a realist painter with his peers. For this reason, the quality of his work needs to be seen in relation to that of his contemporaries in France and elsewhere. Fantin-Latour, in his capacity as a portrait painter, Carolus-Duran, and early Degas spring to mind, so too do John Millais for his later portraits, and GF Watts and the German, Max Liebermann, the Russian Ilya Repin, to say nothing of the young Sargent. Whether or not Eakins knew of all these artists' work is not the point: clearly something was in the air. That he should then choose to return to America and never go abroad again would hardly matter except that even now some people make an issue of it. The very sub-title of this show obliquely raises the question: 'The Heart of American Life'. The truth is that Eakins painted Americans because he was living in America and his friends and sitters were American: he painted rowers because he went rowing himself. The 'Heart' of life he was painting was not American so much as his own, the commitment not so much philosophical as circumstantial. His true character as a painter, for all the apparent provincialism of his material, is far more cosmopolitan than his apologists allow. Thank goodness he has come into his his proper place on the international stage at last. If his American condition has kept him back in reputation for so long, it is America's fault - for we can hardly celebrate what we have not seen. Indeed, with American art in general, there seem to be several critical and emotional forces at work. Sometimes isolation is entered as a special plea, the uniqueness of the work thus proved and the achievement left beyond doubt: sometimes, as with the current survey of 20th century American Art at the Royal Academy, selective myopia ignores the individual contribution and relies upon a collective authority by which to claim an international pre-eminence. Awkward Americans who go European, such as Sargent or Whistler, Tobey or Kitaj, hard to place, are left aside. As in history, so in art: America stands either quite alone; or first and still alone. The choice is between an inflated reputation; no reputation at all; or, as in Eakins' case, both at once. Eakins is simply a very good painter who complements a somewhat dour eye with a hand that is vigorous and active. He was evidently serious-minded, his pictures tending towards the sombre, well thought-out and thoroughly accomplished. He was particularly interested in the science of perspective, and science and scientists in general. Yet the composition is always unfussy, the drawing strong, the modelling firm, the surface of the paint never dull or turgid. The essential 'manliness' of his work has been remarked, and while too much should not be made of it, especially in relation to the images of rowers, yachters, boxers and shooters, there is most certainly a truth to it in principal, in the quality of its making. But the greater strength is in the quality of his observation. A portrait is always something more than an accretion of brush-strokes, and Eakins was a wonderful painter of portraits, tender and sympathetic in his immediate address, deep in his personal insight. He was clearly intrigued by psychological states, and his sitters, men and women alike  - which is not always the case - are never less than convincing in their preoccupations, now melancholy, now reflective, now rapt in concentration. He is especially good with women of a certain age, and ageing men. He never worked to a fashionable clientele, but set himself, rather as Watts did in England, to painting distinguished contemporaries - scientists, artists, academics. The full-length portraits, on the grand scale yet intimate, are all impressive: the concert singer, Weda Cook; the physicist, Professor Roland; the surgeon, Dr Agnew; the brother-in-law, Louis Kenton. Yet, as always, it is in the studies and sketches, heads and half-lengths, close up and concentrated, the paint fresh and direct, that the truer artist, the man himself, is revealed.

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Customs chief insists job cuts are in the line of duty: Battlelines drawn up as unions attack the plan to shed 4,000 staff Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, has denied union claims that the shedding of 4,000 jobs over the next five years is driven solely by the government's need to find scope for tax cuts before the next election. She said the plan - attacked by unions as risking increased drug smuggling and a loss of VAT revenue - 'does not represent for us a fundamental change in direction. It is a further pretty big step down the road we were already travelling.' The Customs and Excise service has already seen changes in recent years, not least through the opening of European border controls under the single market. Its 25,000 staff is split between 12,000 doing value added tax work; 9,000 in customs (looking for drugs, firearms and pornography); 2,000 in excise (responsible for duty collection from brewers and distillers) and inland customs, and 3,000 support staff. In the year to March, the service gathered revenue of Pounds 66.7bn - 45 per cent of the total government tax yield. Nearly 60 per cent of the department's revenue comes from VAT and only 3 per cent from Customs duties. Customs officers no longer limit the amount of duty-paid drink and cigarettes individuals can bring into the country from the rest of Europe - so long as they are for private consumption. But 240 plain-clothes excise verification officers monitor pubs and off-licences to check that goods imported in this way are not being sold on. The NUCPS and the CPSA, the main civil service unions involved, had been campaigning for an increase in anti-smuggling staff. They said: 'The incentive to potential smugglers is all too clear if you consider the potential profits involved. A single lorry load of smuggled cigarettes would result in a loss of tax revenue of over Pounds 600,000, most of which would end up as pure profit to the smuggler.' The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said that, if customs staff were to be weakened, 'it can only be good news for bootleggers and the French chancellor'. Mrs Strachan said that 'adding back' customs staff into intelligence work would maintain, or even improve, effectiveness. She added: 'We will be placing a greater emphasis on high-risk and complex work, and give less priority to routine activity where the risks are lower and results have been less.' The unions argue that cutting 550 front-line anti-smuggling officers risks increased drug smuggling. They point out that two of the UK's biggest drug hauls - cannabis worth Pounds 35m last month at Felixstowe and Pounds 9m worth of heroin at Sheerness, Kent, in October  - were the result of routine checks, not specific intelligence. Mr John Amos, of NUCPS, said: 'Smugglers aren't idiots - if they see there are gaps, they will exploit them.' However, police officers welcomed the shift in anti-smuggling work towards operations against trafficking. Mr Keith Hellawell, the chief constable of West Yorkshire who chairs the drugs committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'The fight against crime will not be affected by the changes because our work is already intelligence-led.' Most attention has focused on the dangers of increased drug smuggling, but the biggest single group of jobs to go from the department will be 2,000 VAT officials. Mrs Strachan said a large part of this reduction was due to 'rethinking our approach to VAT control'. She added: 'Many businesses are either very small or very compliant or possibly both.' They did not need to be visited as often as they were. Mr Dave Morris, NUCPS assistant general secretary, said that all businesses are guaranteed a visit by a Customs inspector within three years of registering for VAT under the Citizen's Charter. 'We will have to tear up that commitment - we simply cannot do it with these proposals,' he said. The department's most recent annual report, for the year to March, admitted that only 80.5 per cent of newly registered businesses were being visited within three years. Mr Ian Hanford, policy chairman for the National Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'If you are given bad tax advice and it is five or six years before the VAT officers come in, there could be horrendous penalties which could wipe the business out. 'Where VAT officers are looked on as protection, fewer inspections could be bad news.'</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Coopers &amp; Lybrand settles TGI claim Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte has settled a longstanding legal claim by TGI, an electronics company which had accused the accountancy firm of negligence. Coopers continues to deny the charge but has said it will pay TGI Pounds 725,000 in final settlement. The agreement ends a dispute whose origins lie in TGI's acquisition of Audix, Coopers' audit client. TGI took over Audix, a maker of public address systems, in 1989 and agreed a price linked to its new subsidiary's subsequent earnings. Coopers signed off on Audix's 1989-1990 results but the profits reported for the financial year were later restated as a loss. TGI asked Coopers to resign and began legal proceedings. Coopers' move to conclude the Audix affair follows a similar decision recently by a fellow Big Six firm. Touche Ross undertook to pay Pounds 1.35m to Caparo, a conglomerate which took over a Touche client, Fidelity, the electronics company. Both Coopers and Touche settled rather than risk the public scrutiny of their auditing procedures in court.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Time for an awakening Once upon a future time the Labour party will awaken from its narcoleptic trance. It may happen this autumn. We will then see whether what is being made ready to stalk the land is an ageing and impotent Frankenstein's monster, something out of a comic book of historic horrors, or a strangely revitalised young princeling . . . hang on a moment. It is Mr John Smith we are talking about here. Forget the young princeling. Let us settle for middle-aged Edinburgh lawyer. The Smith part of the fairy story is due to come true on Saturday week. The ancient machinery of the Labour leadership election process will creak and bubble in a laboratory somewhere in London. The trade union bosses will incant their chosen name. The constituency parties and members of parliaments will each contribute a limb or two. A bolt of electricity will crackle, and there, twitching into life, we will see the Smith-led Labour party. What it may well find, as it sits up and consciousness slowly returns, is a Conservative government in trouble. We can imagine the scene as MPs come back to Westminster from their summer holidays. The recession is still on, with no sign of any corner to turn. Drastic measures, such as devaluation or leaving the exchange rate mechanism, are still not contemplated. The Tory backbench rebellion against ratification of the Maastricht treaty continues, fed by the unease over the economy. The French vote 'yes' to Maastricht (this is a fairy story, remember) and the other 10 members of the European Community look to Britain to ratify, in order to put pressure on the Danes. Suddenly the Labour party matters, even if only slightly. What it proposes to do if the bill is returned to the Commons becomes an element in the government's calculations. Mr Smith begins to enjoy himself hugely: not only is the party alive, it is kicking. It is also, as Mr Smith acknowledged at the weekend, divided over Maastricht. That weakens Labour as a potential anti-Maastricht force. Yet, skilfully led, the opposition could make passage of the treaty legislation even more uncomfortable than it might otherwise be. Labour's backbenchers would surely unite over obstructive tactics designed to embarrass the Conservatives, although they would be divided on a strategic vote on the principle of the thing. With luck, Labour could have more influence over events in the House of Commons than at any time since 1979. Such considerations could lead to the postponement of the re-introduction of the bill from late autumn 1992 to anybody's guess in 1993. In short, not everyone is ready to write Labour off as an effective opposition, even though to my mind its long-run future is in doubt. The Conservatives take Mr Smith's troops seriously. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury and a rising ministerial star, told a Tory Reform Group meeting on Saturday that he did not believe that Labour was unelectable. It would be 'hopelessly complacent' to assume that it was. The government had been re-elected on sufferance; it had not received anything resembling a resounding vote of confidence for its record since 1987. It needed to earn the electorate's support. Mr Dorrell then went on to explain how Mr John Major's policies would achieve that. There are other ways of making the point. Labour scored a miserable 34 per cent of the vote on April 9, but this was an improvement on 1987 (31 per cent) and 1983 (28 per cent). Its performance in seats won was likewise on a rising curve. Consider also the Conservative central office's index of negatives. In 1987 five reasons for not voting Labour were confirmed by Tory research. The party was disunited. It could not be trusted on defence. It was dominated by the left. Unions had too much influence. Finally, Mr Neil Kinnock could not be accepted as prime minister. By 1992 the first four negatives had been eliminated (union influence was not a particularly salient factor this time), but a new one was added by the Conservatives. Labour was made to be seen as a high-tax party. However badly the Tories had performed, Labour would make matters worse. Now that Mr Kinnock has gone only the high-tax label remains. Mr Smith has already begun to detach it from his sleeve. Meanwhile the government will surely reduce income tax, even at the cost of further indirect taxes. In that way it can make the distinction between itself and the opposition clear. Labour will have to look for positive reasons for being elected. It will be bombarded with suggestions, such as the one in a Fabian pamphlet* due to be published on Friday. The author, Mr David Lipsey, proposes a change of name, to New Democrats. I would agree that 'Labour' suggests to many people 'don't vote for me' but what about 'John Smith's party?' It is too soon to say. The creature is still in the lab, waiting for the switch to be pulled and the lightning to strike. *The Name of the Rose. 11 Dartmouth Street, London SW1H 9BN.</p>

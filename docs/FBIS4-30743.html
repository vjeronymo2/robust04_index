			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz received the  leading representatives of the parties in the parliament  building earlier today.    [Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] If I myself had to  define what the electorate voted for or against I would say that  the country had two desires. One of these is that the country  itself should not break into two societies -- with a society of  the poor people on the one hand and a society of those amassing  immeasurable riches for themselves on the other. Parallel with  this -- obviously not consciously -- is that we should not break  into two parts, east and west Hungary.    As a result of the election the parties have several moral  obligations. First, they should focus their energies to achieve  an economic revival as much as possible and in accordance with a  thorough plan. Neither the government nor parliament can  fulfill this task on its own. In the interest of a common  objective, a national consensus must be established -- as wide  as possible -- for the fulfillment of this goal. In other  words, in my judgment efforts should be made for establishing a  coalition government, but naturally I cannot interfere in this,  nor do I want to. [passage omitted]    I must add that I am convinced that the electorate of the  country has helped bring to victory a future modern and European  social democratic party.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  voice support for the convocation of a national conference to  seek a way for the great unity of the whole nation on the  occasion of the forthcoming August 15 liberation day, which was  proposed by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political  parties and public organisations of April 11. They praise it as  a patriotic initiative to promote the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country.    In a commentary titled "Patriotic Initiative for Great  National Unity" NODONG SINMUN declares it is an urgent matter to  achieve great national unity through the implementation of the  ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in  view of the grave situation caused by outside forces and their  zealous followers, the flunkeyist traitors.    The news analyst says:    If our nation fails to achieve harmony and unity under the  acute and strained situation, it will unavoidably suffer the  disaster of a nuclear war and fall a victim to outside forces.    When a historic national conference is convened as proposed  by the North, the convocation itself will mean a big stride  toward reconciliation and unity and it will be possible to  attain national unity and find a way of achieving peace in the  country and reunifying the country in the 1990s through  unconventional and open- hearted exchange of views.    If the conference is to be convened, it is important to  create a climate and conditions for it. The South Korean  authorities must renounce the policy of depending on outside  forces, take the position of national independence and stop all  sorts of confrontation and war moves aimed at hurting and  attacking fellow countrymen with the help of outside forces.  They must scrap the "National Security Law" and other fascist  laws and give up such things as "unified channel of dialogue"  intended to monopolize dialogue.    What position one takes toward the national conference,  which  would be an epoch-making event in the history of national  reunification, is a criterion distinguishing whether one wants  national unity and reunification, or not.    An analyst of MINJU CHOSON emphasizes that if the South  Korean authorities want the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country, they must positively respond to  the proposal for the convocation of a national conference.</p>

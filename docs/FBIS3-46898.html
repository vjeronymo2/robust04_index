The 30-minute meeting at the  prime minister's official residence opened with a briefing by a  Labor Ministry official on the current employment situation  followed by discussion, Hatoyama told a news conference.    The official cited some depressing data on the nation's job  situation, including recent government reports showing the ratio  of job openings to job seekers fell to 0.65 in November, off  0.02 percentage point from October, while the nation's  unemployment rate in the month rose 0.1 percentage point to 2.8  percent, the highest since August 1987.    The task force comprises the entire cabinet except for the  justice minister. Foreign minister and deputy prime minister  Tsutomu Hata serves as acting head of the body.    Deputy heads of the body are Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Chief Manae  Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister Chikara  Sakaguchi and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato.    At the meeting, Hosokawa instructed the cabinet ministers  present to do their utmost to secure employment for the sake of  the public's welfare, Hatoyama said.    Some participants explained about their respective  ministries' and agencies' efforts to tackle the job problems  facing the nation, he added.    Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu and Kubota of the EPA  spoke  of the need to ensure employment of female university graduates.  Akamatsu was quoted as saying female university students'  dissatisfaction with sexual discrimination should be removed.    Hatoyama told reporters that no specific timetable was set  for the task force's activities.    It is the first government team on employment to be created  since 1986 under Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the  nation was again suffering from the yen's sharp appreciation  against the dollar.    Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-member  Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the  establishment of a government task force on employment to cope  with the nation's rapidly worsening job situation.</p>

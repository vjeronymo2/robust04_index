			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Greece to suspend phone tap charges GREECE'S ruling conservatives are to suspend charges of illegal telephone tapping against Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former Socialist prime minister, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Parliament will vote this week on Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis's proposal that no further legal action be taken. Mr Papandreou denies accusations that he ordered the Greek secret service to tap telephones belonging to Socialist cabinet ministers, journalists and conservative politicians while in office in 1989.</p>

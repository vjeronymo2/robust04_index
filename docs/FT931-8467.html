			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Europeans still agonising over carbon taxes - EC Energy Policy THE US energy tax measure removes one obstacle to the introduction of European energy and carbon taxes, but many impediments remain. Unlike the US proposals, the European initiatives have so far been driven more by environmental pressure than a need to raise money. The European Commission has proposed a tax on energy and on its carbon content to encourage efficiency and to discourage the use of fossil fuels which emit carbon dioxide and could contribute to global warming. EC countries are committed under the convention signed at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to find ways of stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000. However, the EC proposals are conditional on most industrialised countries adopting similar ones, to avoid handicapping European industries. In addition, there have been disagreements between EC countries about the best form of these taxes. Poorer countries want them directed only at the heaviest polluting countries  -the industrialised ones - while a UK Treasury minister said in parliament on January 15 that Britain was 'not yet convinced that a Europe-wide tax was a necessary or appropriate response to global warming'. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner, said in a recent interview that the difficulty of getting internal agreement within the EC, as well as with other industrialised countries, meant that proposals for the taxes were unlikely to make much progress this year. In the form originally proposed, the EC energy and carbon taxes had most impact on the energy sector. However, intervention by governments in their power generation markets, such as the present UK coal review, could impede the working of the tax. The UK parliamentary select committee on the environment last week argued that a carbon tax would be of little use in persuading electricity generators to switch to cleaner fuels if the UK government was proposing to subsidise coal. The US decision has removed the European fear of competitive disadvantage. However, any hopes that this will speed up European negotiations may be premature.</p>

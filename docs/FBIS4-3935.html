			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently,  public security organs and the border guards in the cities of  Shantou, Huizhou, and Foshan in Guangdong Province cracked three  major cases of illegal emigration organized by lawbreakers  inside and outside the mainland. They detained 153 illegal  emigrants from Fujian and Hunan and seized four organizers [she  tou 5748 7333] from Taiwan and the mainland.    On 20 March, the frontier guards brigade of Huidong County  and the Apojiao branch of the Huidong Border Defense Station  received information from the public: A boat carrying illegal  emigrants was intercepted at sea off Huangbujiao Cape, and 33  people who tried to emigrate illegally to Hong Kong were seized.    On 12 April, after public security and border defense organs  received information that the Taiwan fishing boat "Risheng 17,"  which was berthed in Shantou, planned to carry illegal emigrants  from the coastal area of Huidong County, they immediately took  action to intercept the boat. That afternoon, after the fishing  boat left Shantou, it was detained by the Shantou Public  Security Sub-bureau. The captain of the ship admitted that a  boss called Li Chun-hsiung ordered him to carry more than 100  illegal emigrants by sea between Huidong and Hong Kong to Mexico.    On 15 April, the Guangdong Provincial Border Defense Bureau  received information that more than 100 people from Fujian had  gathered in the Banyuedao Holiday Village in Nanhai City,  Guangdong Province, and planned illegal emigration. The  provincial public security department organized and commanded  the action and dispatched policemen from Foshan and Nanhai to  search Baoyuedao and round up people who had tried to emigrate  illegally. As a result, 99 people from Fujian who had tried to  emigrate illegally were detained.</p>

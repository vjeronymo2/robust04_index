			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Killing Him': a bit of a twitcher The first voice is that of Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, sounding remarkably resonant about the British government's determination to defend the value of sterling within the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. The only seating place on stage is on top of a large bundle of apparently unread copies of the Financial Times: what is known in the trade as returns. The chancellor was speaking before September 16 last year, a date generally though not universally regarded as Black Wednesday. In the play, the characters call it White Wednesday, not because they have an alternative economic policy based on a floating pound, but because they did well out of the speculation. Between them they picked up about Pounds 90m. Killing Him is written and directed by Crispin Whittel, co-founder of a relatively new company called Cambridge Nights. The striking fact is not so much the quality of the play as the subject. Can it really be true that you fill a pub theatre in Camden Town on a Saturday night with jokes about the Bundesbank? The answer is yes. Actually, the best part of the play has nothing to do with currency dealing. It is based on a serious bird-watcher or 'twitcher' called Kevin (played by Will Keen) who takes a more long-term view of the world than the speculators. Remember, however, that Norman Lamont is also a bit of a twitcher; there may be some deeper meaning here, maybe not. This is not the only obscurity. It is not obvious, without being told, that the girl in the play (Nicola Walker) used to work as a spy for the old East German regime. That is why she sleeps with bankers and knows the secret wishes of the Bundesbank. Some of the basic techniques of story-telling still have to be learned, but here at least is a piece that enters new territory. So far as I can make out the attitude to currency speculation is morally neutral. Etcetera Theatre Club, London N1 until March 7, 9.30 pm (not Mondays). (071) 482 4857</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: US needs no prod in pursuit of 'worthy' farm subsidy goals Sir, It has been dismaying to read reports from Europe that blame the US farm lobby, and my organisation, for sabotaging an agreement on oilseeds during talks in Chicago on November 2 and 3. Those observers who misread the US government's resolve on this dispute would do well to consider the FT's proposed solution ('How to escape the trade war', November 10), which outlines how the EC stumbled to the brink of a trade war. Our government is simply upholding the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and of the Uruguay Round, in which both the EC and US committed themselves to substantial and progressive reductions in farm subsidies. Our officials need no prodding from farm organisations to pursue such worthy goals. In Chicago, there were no hordes of American farmers marching, shooting fire-crackers and building bonfires, as European farmers did in December 1990, when the Uruguay Round first unravelled. Our government and farmers have shown much patience with the EC, but it is spent. It does not take any nefarious lobbying to do what is right. Dean Kleckner, president, American Farm Bureau Federation, 225 Touhy Avenue, Park Ridge, Illinois 60068, US</p>

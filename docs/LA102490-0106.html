			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN APPARENTLY OKD TO REVIVE PARENT OF 7-ELEVEN  </P> <P> The troubled parent of the worldwide 7-Eleven convenience store chain edged  toward bankruptcy Tuesday, but bondholders apparently approved a quick  reorganization plan that could get the company back on its feet within months.  </P> <P> Bondholders apparently endorsed a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy plan  Tuesday, Southland Corp. officials said, although no official results were  announced.  </P> <P> The vote came after months of abortive effort by Southland to persuade  bondholders -- owners of $1.8 billion in Southland debt -- to agree to a buyout  proposal that would have bailed out the Dallas-based company without going into  bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> In this prepackaged bankruptcy, a company goes into federal court with a  reorganization plan largely worked out and the approval of roughly two-thirds  of its bondholders. With most of the issues already negotiated, a company can  emerge from bankruptcy in months instead of years.  </P> <P> "It's really a new lease on life if they can do this," said Southland analyst  Wayne A. Josephson at Fitch Investors Service in New York. With a prepackaged  reorganization, there is "a significantly lower toll on the company in terms of  expenses and declining customers."  </P> <P> Under the terms of the plan, Ito-Yokado Co. would pay $430 million in cash for  70% of Southland, perhaps the biggest Japanese investment in a U.S. retailer to  date.  </P> <P> In addition, bondholders would accept new bonds that would have only half of  the face value of their old investment in exchange for 25% of the company. And  the Thompson family of Dallas -- Southland's founders and principal owners --  would end up with just 5% of the company.  </P> <P> But prepackaged bankruptcy plans are not foolproof, and analysts warned Tuesday  that Southland's problems are not necessarily over even if the prepackaged plan  is indeed accepted by bondholders.  </P> <P> "If they go into bankruptcy court their plan may not be allowed," said David  Glatstein, president of Barre &amp; Co. Inc., a Dallas brokerage. "You're  asking a court to rubber-stamp everything you want to do. A court's not  necessarily going to want do that."  </P> <P> Bondholder approval of a prepackaged plan "is a very, very positive development  for the company," said Southland analyst Jim Bennett of R. D. Smith in New  York. "The risk is that you could get a crazy nut who goes into bankruptcy  court and tries to disrupt the plan, a creditor who takes a lawyer to court and  tries to challenge it."  </P> <P> Southland, parent of the world's biggest network of convenience stores, has  been brought to the brink of collapse largely by the huge interest payments  stemming from the $4.9-billion management buyout in 1987. At the time,  Southland was maneuvering to avert a takeover by Canadian investor Samuel  Belzberg.  </P> <P> Along with other convenience-store chains, Southland was stung by stepped-up  competition from supermarkets and gasoline station mini-markets. By last  November, the company acknowledged that it faced a cash crisis and began  working on a corporate overhaul. As part of that overhaul, it sold its 58  stores in Hawaii for $75 million to Ito-Yokado's 7-Eleven Japan unit.  </P> <P> In March, Southland tentatively agreed to sell 75% of the company to  Ito-Yokado. But bondholders balked at the plan. Despite an improved offer that  came in ensuing months, bondholders never provided the 95% support needed for  the deal to go through.  </P> <P> As a result, Southland and Ito-Yokado came up with a similar plan that would  send the company into bankruptcy court. This plan, which was voted on Tuesday,  only required the support of two-thirds of the holders of each class of bonds.  </P> <P> Scott A. Pearce, a franchisee with two 7-Eleven outlets in San Bernardino  County and a member of Southland's National Advisory Council, said most  7-Eleven franchisees hoped the company would stay out of bankruptcy. He  expressed concern that a bankruptcy, even a prepackaged bankruptcy case, will  trigger bad publicity that could hurt business.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Pearce said the prepackaged bankruptcy plan ensures that  7-Eleven's suppliers will continue to be paid on time. He added that  franchisees believe that Ito-Yokado's planned investment will provide needed  funds to remodel stores, increase advertising and install computerized cash  registers.  </P> <P> "It'll be back to the old Southland, when it was No. 1 (in the convenience  store business) by leaps and bounds," Pearce said.  </P> <P> John Gordon, chairman of the steering committee representing bondholders and  preferred shareholders, expressed frustration that the out-of-bankruptcy buyout  offer failed to win the needed 95% approval.  </P> <P> He called the minority who rejected the deal "dopes." "They took money out of  their pockets and out of my pockets," Gordon said.  </P> <P> Still, Gordon said, the prepackaged bankruptcy is much better than regular  Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which he estimated would take three years or  more.  </P> <P> "I feel very comfortable with the prepackaged bankruptcy plan, and I'm glad  we're getting on with the show," Gordon said.  </P> <P> "The business is going to be business as usual. It's not going to affect sales.  It's not going to affect day-to-day operations. The only people being asked to  take hits are the bondholders."  </P></p>

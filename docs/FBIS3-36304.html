Talks have been held between  the heads of states and the official delegations. After  statements by the heads of state, Vlachislav Vasilievich and  myself will give you a possibility to ask questions in turn, but  please ask questions only at the microphones.    Boris Nikolayevich, as our guest, we ask you to make a  statement.    [Yeltsin] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Today's visit by  the Russian delegation to the Republic of Georgia is proceeding  quite successfully. A major, joint work has been carried out.  The time has come already to sum up with you at least the  preliminary results of the meeting. I think that we have every  grounds for satisfaction. The fates of our peoples are closely  intertwined. From ancient times, Georgia has seen in an alliance  with Russia the guarantees for preserving its culture and for  saving the nation from plunging into catastrophe. Our bonds are  strong and many-sided, and mutual fondness is genuine.    Everybody in Russia knows Ilia Chavchavadze [famous Georgian  writer, poet, and public figure] and honors the memory of Grand  Duke Bagration. Everybody has heard about Meliton Kantaria  [Georgian soldier in WW II]. History itself calls on the  peoples of Russia and Georgia to live in peace and agreement.  There is no other sensible solution. We have gone through  difficult times in the past as well; however, our great  predecessors used to always find ways to guarantee a calm and  respectable life for our peoples. We have no right to destroy  what we have inherited.    The aims of Russian policy are clear and  concrete--establishing not simply friendly but also allied  relations with Georgia, of course, mutually taking into  consideration legal, state, and national interests.    As you know, Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze and I have  signed a comprehensive agreement on friendship,  good-neighborliness, and cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Georgia. This was the main  official aim of the Russian president's visit to Tbilisi. We  assess the agreement highly. The agreement lays a solid legal  basis for our cooperation. I hope that it will work effectively  for the development of future Russian-Georgian relations.    Altogether, 25 documents have been signed. Eduard  Ambrosyevich and I have exchanged opinions on bilateral  cooperation, on regulating the conflicts in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia, on pressing international issues, and on the situation  in the Transcaucasus.    The Russian side supports a fundamental improvement of  relations with Georgia in all fields, the speediest restoration  of broken economic, cultural, and spiritual bonds, and a gradual  rapprochement and integration. Joining of efforts will help our  countries to find a way out of the complex economic situation in  which they found themselves after the disintegration of the  Soviet Union.    I would like to stress once again that Russia is proceeding  from the necessity of observing Georgia's territorial integrity  and fully securing the interests of the multinational population  of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia supports a full-scale  settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian  conflicts through peaceful political means and supports mutually  acceptable solutions regarding state and political arrangements.    The Russian representatives will continue, together with the  Georgian and Abkhaz sides and the CSCE, to participate in  efforts directed toward regulating the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.  They will keep on achieving considerable growth in the number  of international observers, both military and civilian, and in  using peacekeeping military forces in the conflict zone.    The issue of refugees from Abkhazia is an acute one. Russia  is ready to assist in resolving it. We are, once again,  addressing the sides to launch a full-scale operation for  supporting peace in Abkhazia. The Russian contingent could also  take part in it. The main goal of these forces is to guarantee  a secure return of refugees. It is necessary to keep on  searching for mutually- acceptable solutions to the conflicts in  Abkhazia and South Ossetia that will help turn the Caucasus  region into a zone of solid peace and stability.    The issue of ethnic Russians is vulnerable for us and,  although the official stance of the Georgian authorities must  not give us a cause for alarm, the departure from Georgia of  150,000 Russian- speaking people over the last two years cannot  but put us on guard. There have been instances of oppression at  the social scale--usurpation of servicemen's apartments, etc.  We expect an active counteraction against such negative  occurrences and others. It is in the interests of both of the  countries and in the interests of deepening friendship and  cooperation between our peoples.    Russia is ready to cooperate bilaterally with Georgia,  within  the CIS, and on the international arena. Only under the  circumstances of peace can economic and democratic developments  be safely guaranteed.    Using this opportunity, I would like to express my  gratefulness for a warm, friendly welcome extended to the  Russian delegation in friendly Georgia.    Thank you for your attention.    [Shevardnadze] Ladies and gentlemen! Esteemed Boris  Nikolayevich! Thank you for participating in the news  conference, and for the attention you paid to the first official  visit of the Russian president in our country.    I have already said at the negotiations that it is a  significant event in the 200-year-old history of relations  between our peoples. This event undoubtedly deserves great  attention from both of our countries. I think that the  negotiations and the documents signed here in Tbilisi--and not  only negotiations--will assist in strengthening friendship and  cooperation within the framework of the CIS and the region as a  whole.    For the first time in the ancient history of relations  between Russia and Georgia, we have been presented with a chance  to build them on a totally different basis. For the first time,  unlike in the past, we have decided to confirm each other's  strategic aims and interests as two equal and independent  states. For the first time following a long period marred by a  string of events, the aftermath of which we will still have to  be overcome through joint efforts, there is a hope for restoring  traditionally friendly relations between our peoples. The  importance of the visit by Boris Nikolayevich and such an  imposing delegation goes beyond the boundaries of Russo-Georgian  relations. The normalization of these relations is closely  connected with the complexity of regulating the Caucasus and the  Black Sea regions and of achieving peace and stability here.    Boris Nikolayevich and I talked about activating the  Caucasian factor in the process of regulating all conflicts  about which the whole of the world knows. It is a great tragedy  for peoples of the Caucasus.    We have talked about the necessity of holding a dialogue on  the Caucasian issue with the participation of the three  Transcaucasian states and, naturally, with Russia's  participation and about inviting the Russian Federation  subjects. I mean the North Caucasian republics. By the way, I  discussed this issue the day before yesterday with my  colleagues, [Azerbaijani President] Geydar Aliyev and [Armenian  President] Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who support this idea with great  enthusiasm.    We have just signed a comprehensive agreement between the  Russian Federation and Georgia. I suppose that the name speaks  for itself. It includes friendship, good-neighborliness, and  cooperation. This is what, for several centuries, Georgia has  aspired for in connection with its great northern neighbor.    A package of documents containing many agreements have been  signed. Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned the number of  the agreements. I would only like to name several that are  principally important for our countries: agreements on free  trade, culture, education, relations, international highway  links, regulating the processes of migration, guarding the human  rights of the dispossessed, and preventing and (?liquidating)  emergency situations. Several agreements on regulating military  cooperation have also been signed; I mean the issues connected  with border troops and, on the whole, the status of the Russian  Army, and many others.    We have, in principle, agreed to create bases for Russian  troops. I think that it is in accordance with the interests of  Georgia and Russia and the whole of the Transcaucasus. We have  signed a protocol about setting up a special working group that  will study all aspects of granting the presence of the Russian  Army a new principle. Our primary aim is that the terms of the  treaty and other agreements signed today be implemented as soon  as possible. It is in the interests of Russia and Georgia and  the whole of our region and, of course, the world's peace and  security. It was the main subject for our present talks and  negotiations, which were a continuation of the dialogue that had  been started a long time ago.    We have examined in detail and thoroughly the status and the  prospects of developing relations between our countries. I  would like to stress a mutual aspiration for a comprehensive  improvement of relations. The conclusion has been drawn that  the current situation is favorable for this and that we will  make every effort in order to achieve the realization of these  goals.    Much time, and maybe the most significant time, was  naturally  devoted to Abkhazia, to the political settlement of this and  other conflicts under the auspices of the United Nations and  with Russia's most active participation and mediation.    All aspects for regulating the Georgian-Ossetian conflict  have been discussed. I told Boris Nikolayevich that I did not  see the reasons why we could not resolve these most complex  issues of modern times in the near future. They are the most  complex issues, but the traditions of friendship that are  centuries-old and the relations between the Georgian and  Ossetian peoples--the Georgian and Abkhaz peoples--and the  favorable influence of Russia and the whole of the world public,  give us a chance to resolve these issues in the near future.    We have also discussed the situation in the Transcaucasus on  the whole and expressed our own views on the situation. As  Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned, there are no serious  gaps between us in connection with all these pungent problems; I  mean the region and the CIS on the whole.    The subject matter of our talks also included the issues of  perfecting the activities of the CIS. Skimming through the  international situation, we fixed our attention on the issues of  guaranteeing collective security and the different forms of  strategic cooperation in this important trend between regional  and intergovernmental structures. Naturally, the results of our  negotiations will help establish peace and calm in the  Transcaucasus, strengthen the CIS, strengthen the alliance of  the Black Sea countries where Russia is playing a very active  role, as well as Georgia and our neighbors--Turkey, Ukraine, and  other states, such as Azerbaijan and Armenia. Naturally, there  are no conflicts between those international organizations and  the European structures with which we are collaborating.    Great prospects are opened, and I would like to express deep  gratitude to the president of Russia, Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin, and all members of the delegation for the good will  displayed to us and the wish to establish principally new  relations with independent and democratic Georgia. Thank you.    [Rcheulishvili] I would ask the journalists to introduce  themselves, and since there are a lot of people here and not  every one of you will be able to approach the microphones, I  would request you to state your questions loudly.    [Unidentified moderator] The first question is from  Ilyashenko, RIA Novosti. Louder.    [Ilyashenko] Boris Nikolayevich, have the issue of Georgia's  joining the ruble zone or the issue of granting credits to  Georgia been discussed during talks today?    [Yeltsin] Both these issues have been discussed. The issue  of credits has been decided on the governmental level, and a  definite sum of money will be earmarked for Georgia. As for the  ruble zone, when Eduard Ambrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and I were  having tete-a-tete negotiations, we agreed that considering the  complexity of this issue, we would set up working groups that  will weigh everything, all pros and cons for both Georgia and  Russia. Only after that will we make decisions.    [Shevardnadze] There are a lot of talks about the issue of  the ruble zone. Some are protesting; others demand that we join  as soon as possible. As far as I understand it, the door has  not been opened yet, so to say. The issue should really be  researched.    [Moderator] Ibervisia TV company.    [Correspondent] The "Monitor" program, Ibervisia Independent  TV company. Boris Nikolayevich, what has caused such a negative  attitude by the Duma toward your visit and the signing of the  treaty, and why does the aspiration for the stabilization of the  situation in Georgia stir up such a negative attitude in North  Caucasia?    [Yeltsin] I do not know from what sources you draw this sort  of information, that the Duma regards this visit negatively.  This is an official state visit of the president of the  country; therefore, the Duma will ratify this treaty. There is  another thing. There will apparently be certain discussions  during ratification, and this is not ruled out during the  ratification of any international agreement that is being  signed. I do not remember a treaty being ratified immediately,  without any discussions. We also expect discussions on this  issue. Nevertheless, I am certain that the Duma will regard  this full-scale treaty with the independent Republic of Georgia  positively.    [Correspondent] What about North Caucasia? [no reply given  to this question as heard]    [Grushenko, INTERFAX correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, can  you tell us please to what extent the comprehensive political  treaty can assist the growth of Russia's potential for  stabilizing the situation in the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus  in this region. I think that Georgia also must have the say.  Could the head of the Georgian state, esteemed Eduard  Ambrosyevich, comment on this question too? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] During our one-on-one discussions and talks, we  devoted most of our time to this very issue. If we do not  regulate properly the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,  then there will be difficulties in the development of our future  relations. Thus, the key aim for us is to regulate these  relations. As to how and in which way we will do it, we have  agreed that we will be working jointly--Russia, the UN, and the  CSCE will all act to introduce peacekeeping forces there [in  Abkhazia]. Subsequently, Georgia must grant a definite  political and legal status to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This  is so that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will work together with  Georgia on the draft of the new constitution that is being  worked out now. It will also improve the situation. Therefore,  I hope that with joint efforts we will manage to regulate the  situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.    [Shevardnadze] I agree with Boris Nikolayevich, and I would  like to add that resolving these conflicts--if we are talking  about strategic goals, then it is the most important issue--is  in Georgia's interest in all aspects because the country is on  the brink of starvation, literally on the threshold of poverty.  Our strategic interests coincide completely, and there is a  complete, mutual understanding in this respect. As for how we  understand strategic interests, I have already said during the  talks that several months ago--I think it is worth  remembering--I asked Boris Nikolayevich what Russia's strategic  interests in the Caucasus and, in particular, Georgia, were.  Boris Nikolayevich answered that they wanted to deal with the  single, integral Georgia, the integral state that would develop  democratically and have good-neighborly relations with Russia.  I think that we understand it correctly that Russia, naturally,  has its geopolitical and strategic interests. We have found a  complete and mutual understanding when we talked about strategic  interests.    [Unidentified correspondent] Georgian News Agency. I would  like to ask how the Russian president and the Georgian head of  state assess the last UN resolution on Abkhazia, passed on 31  January, and how you visualize the return of refugees to  Abkhazia, or whether all this will remain on paper. Before I  receive an answer to this question I would like to make use of  an opportunity and hand over to you, Boris Nikolayevich, an  appeal by Georgian correspondents and their Russian colleagues  about the fate of a well-known Sukhumi correspondent, Aleksandr  Berulava, who is still...    [Unidentified woman, interrupting] You can hand it to me  later.    [Correspondent] All right.    [Yeltsin] I regard the UN resolution as the one that meets  the interests of both the Abkhazian and Georgian peoples, as  well as the interests of Russia as a mediator.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, will you please allow  Georgian  TV to ask a question?    [Shevardnadze] I beg your pardon, but I would like to remind  those who ask this question or those who are interested by this  problem that the resolution, the last UN Security Council  resolution, was drawn up with the active participation of  Russian representative at the United Nations. Thus I can say  that we have a complete agreement with regard to the views and  interests over this issue.    [Moderator] Sergey Medvedev, Ostankino Television, please.    [Medvedev] I have a question for the two leaders.    [Moderator] Only one question, please.    [Medvedev] Boris Nokolayevich, I would like to hear an  answer  to the following question: Boris Nikolayevich, The Abkhazian  side, a conflicting party, is very concerned about the Union  agreement -- let us put it this way -- with Georgia, with regard  to the fact that Russia will participate in building up the  Georgian Armed forces, and it is concerned that this will not  encourage a peaceful settlement of the conflict. although I  have been warned, I would like to get an answer to another  question. Do you think that the economic situation Georgia has  found itself influences this treaty, or that the signing of a  document like this is a conclusion to a strategic trend?    [Yeltsin] As regards Paragraph 3 of the agreement, which  reflects the issue of rendering assistance in building up the  Georgian Armed Forces, we certainly do not mean a huge army.  Georgia is unable to feed a big army. We mean a minimal number  of forces in these armed units, assistance with equipment, and  so on. And this is not expected today or tomorrow. This is a  ongoing topic and it will be enough to help settle the Abkhazian  issue. This is a common army. It is not planned for the  territory of Georgia without Abkhazia and without Ossetia. No.  This is an army of an integrated Georgia, and the Abkhazians do  not have to be nervous about it. Moreover, we will be in  complete control this issue.    [Shevardnadze] As for the army, we are not intending and  actually we are not able to have a gigantic army. No one will  threaten us, and it is unreal that we will threaten someone.  Therefore, we will be building a small army. Without Russia, we  are unable to create even a small army. I think this is in  Russia's interest, too. Regarding what we had in mind when  signing the comprehensive treaty and a package of economic and  other agreements, I agree it was the economic situation. I  believe that it was a mistake, a big mistake, when Georgia  isolated itself. It did not gain anything. Neither Russia nor  any other countries who cooperated with us gained anything. But  not only economy. I have already spoken of a strategic interest  between Georgia and Russia, and the interests of the  Commonwealth states, of our neighbors. So, the approach was a  complex one. And there was complex interest toward building new  relations with Russia.    [Moderator] Introduce yourself, please.    [Bakhtadze] Vakhtang Bakhtadze, the FORUM newspaper. A  question to Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze. It is known and  it is a fact that the Republic of Georgia became the 179th  member [not further specified] on the basis of the Act of  Independence and the results of a referendum held on 31 March  1991, when 99 percent of the people said yes to independence.  It was said that everything infringing independence is  unlawful. Do you not think that the agreements signed by you in  the spheres of credits and finances, [words indistinct] and  customs, as well as in the military sphere, are contradictory,  to say the least, and can be regarded as a different  interpretation of the definition of total independence and total  sovereignty. Will you please state what you mean by the  definition of the independent state of Russia and the  independent state of Georgia. Thank you.    [Moderator] Thank you for your speech.    [Shevardnadze] I will answer. When drawing up and signing  all the documents, the comprehensive treaty, the economic  package, and all the rest, which regulate relations between the  two countries, the interests of Georgia and the interests of  Russia were fully considered. And if some compromise approach  can be observed in some cases, I believe that it is impossible  to survive without compromises during our time. I am stating  with full responsibility that neither all these treaties nor all  these agreements contradict the act you mentioned. They comply  with the interests of Georgia, and not only the present Georgia  but also tomorrow's problems and prospects.    [Rcheulishvili] Thank you very much, and for God's sake  excuse us, but the time is up.    [Moderator] The stipulations of the protocol demand that we  finish the news conference.</p>

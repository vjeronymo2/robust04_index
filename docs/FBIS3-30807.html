The goal of the draft bill we submit is to improve in a  qualitative manner the normative basis of this sphere, under  conditions of social democratization and the new international  relations. The Law on General Military Service, which has been  operative since 1958, does not correspond any longer to the new  social requirements. The establishment of state organs which  have leading functions vis-a-vis the Armed Forces and the  defense, as well as the separation of powers among them, must be  resolved by a law. Thus much friction, which is evident now,  will be eliminated.    The draft bill is based on the fundamental principles of  civil leadership and parliamentary control over the Armed  Forces' activity, banning the Bulgarian Army from participating  in resolving tasks of internal political character, legally  determining the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the  military and improving their social prestige, legally  determining the prerogatives of the state organs related to  guiding the country's defense, providing the legal possibility  of alternative service without having to operate weapons,  legally settling the Army's participation in the organs of local  administration, and determining the physical and judicial  entities involved in the country's defense.    As a structure the bill consists of two logically related  parts -- on defense and on the Armed Forces. They treat the  subject of the higher state organs' prerogatives in the area of  defense, the prerogatives of the president of the Republic of  Bulgaria as the supreme commander in chief, and the prerogatives  of the Council of Ministers related to the general leadership of  the Armed Forces. The draft bill explicitly points out that the  minister of defense is and will be a civilian. This conforms to  the ban on the military's political activity and represents one  of the manners of implementing a total civilian control. The  functions of the defense minister and chief of the General Staff  are regulated by the draft bill.    On the basis of Article 9 of the Bulgarian Constitution the  draft bill envisages that the Armed Forces consist of the  Bulgarian Army, the Interior Ministry Troops, the National  Intelligence Service, the National Security Service, and the  National Protection Service. A separate bill will regulate the  Military Police's organization and activity. This is an  important Army unit.    A special attention was devoted to the status of the  military, namely, entering the regular military service, the  municipal organs' role in preparing mobilization, the military's  rights and duties, social security, and disciplinary, property,  and administrative- penal responsibility. The conditions of the  military's training and professional development, as well as  their material security, leisure, and leave are specified in the  draft bill. The draft bill envisages that the length of  military service will be 15 months. It also envisages the  possibility of alternative military service without the use of  weapons. The regulations and conditions of carrying out  military service will be settled through another special draft  bill.    In the interest of national security the draft bill  envisages  a ban on the participation of the military in political parties,  organizations, and associations with political goals.  Simultaneously, as an expression of democratism, they have been  afforded the possibility of uniting in associations on a  professional basis. The new elements in the draft bill are  related to the military ranks attached to specific officers'  duties. Promotions will be effected when the officers are  transferred to posts which require a specific rank. This is a  very important element. I must tell you that four years ago  there was a very grave situation in the Army, when many  high-ranking officers implemented inappropriate tasks. This  caused then a certain inflating of the officer corps. I think  that the normal pyramid of military subordination will be  restored through the adoption and implementation of this bill.  The contract principle is established by the draft bill as the  strategy in cadre policy, which provides the military with  legal, professional, and social guarantees. This will create  the possibility of a gradual transition toward a professional  army. The military service age limit for the various ranks was  determined in accordance with the practice in most European  states and needs of the Army itself.    I think that the draft bill that has been submitted to your  attention represents a legal foundation on which all legislative  aspects of the sphere of the Armed Forces and defense will  develop. The adoption of this draft bill will facilitate the  implementation of the reform in the Army in accordance with the  processes of democratizing society. Thank you for your  attention!</p>

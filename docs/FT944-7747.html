			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northern Foods declines 26% - Threat of second-half restructuring charges to cover closures Northern Foods warned that plant closures and job losses would force it to take a restructuring charge in the second-half as it reported a 26 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 53.7m. The dairy and foods manufacturer blamed the setback on rising milk costs and intense pressure on its selling prices from retailers. Milk costs were up 10 per cent or Pounds 50m after price increases by the Milk Marketing Board and Milk Marque, its successor. Mr Christopher Haskins, Northern's chairman, attacked Milk Marque for 'its abuse of monopoly power'. Northern's profits are expected to fall by about Pounds 15m this year but longer term the group hoped to recover about half the increased costs through higher prices. The rest will come from closures and other cost-savings. Analysts, who estimate the restructuring charge could be about Pounds 30m-Pounds 35m, were disappointed that it would also cover non-dairy areas such as cutting van distribution to small retailers and rationalisation of meat production. The shares closed down 8p at 204p. Operating profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 72.6m in the six months ending September 30. Interest charges were Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 9.3m) and there was a Pounds 11.5m loss on disposals. Dairy operating profits fell 14 per cent to Pounds 34.5m on unchanged sales of Pounds 476.4m. Doorstep milk sales fell by 12 per cent while supermarket sales rose. Home milk sales were likely to fall from 45 per cent of Northern's total milk sales to 30 per cent. Convenience foods fell 18 per cent to Pounds 18.2m on sales down 2 per cent at Pounds 262.3m. Factors included lower bread sales, start up problems at a Manchester plant and reduced sales from its delivery vans to small shops. However sales volumes to Marks &amp; Spencer rose 5 per cent and sales to it and three other large chains, J Sainsbury, Tesco and Asda, now accounted for 35 per cent of group sales. Meat products fell 16 per cent to Pounds 8.2m on sales down 2.6 per cent to Pounds 125m. Progress with large chains offset declining sales to small shops and caterers. Grocery profits rose 25 per cent to Pounds 11.9m on sales up slightly to Pounds 106.6m. Fox's biscuits, the bulk of the division, increased its market share by half a percentage point to 6.5 per cent. The interim dividend was unchanged at 3.5p from earnings per share of 6.37p (9.37p) or 8.37p before exceptionals. COMMENT These disappointing results show that Northern has a lot of remedial work to do across the group. Moreover, it is revisiting long standing problems such as doorstep milk delivery and van sales. Pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 130m, before provisions, are possible for earnings of 17p and a sector typical prospective p/e of 12. With no prospect of earnings growth for 12-18 months, the shares will live on their 5 1/2 per cent yield.</p>

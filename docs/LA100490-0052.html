			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> 1 HOSPITALIZED AFTER TRUCK CRUSHES CAR  </P> <P> The driver of a car that was crushed beneath an 18-wheel truck on the Ventura  Freeway in Thousand Oaks was listed in good condition Wednesday.  </P> <P> Yaron Nechemia, 25, of Agoura was admitted to the intensive care unit at  Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village for observation after the accident,  a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> Nechemia was driving his Nissan Sentra south on the freeway, near the Live Oak  underpass, about 11:45 a.m. Tuesday when a truck on his right tried to move  into his lane, said Officer Jim Utter of the California Highway Patrol. Lori  Nechemia, 28, and Elissa Nechemia, 16 months, also were in the Nissan, he said.  </P> <P> A preliminary investigation showed that Nechemia tried to avoid the truck and  lost control of his car, which spun in front of the truck, Utter said.  </P> <P> The truck, which was driven by Jesus Arauz, 35, of North Hollywood, struck the  car, Utter said. The car continued to spin out of control and lodged under the  right side of the trailer, he said.  </P> <P> The truck veered and left the road, still dragging the car. As the truck went  up an embankment, the car dislodged, Utter said. But the truck overturned and  came to rest on the Nissan, crushing it and trapping the occupants, Utter said.  </P> <P> It took more than an hour for the Ventura County Fire Department to extricate  the Nechemias from their car, he said.  </P> <P> Arauz suffered minor injuries. Lori Nechemia received severe facial injuries  with cuts to the scalp and the child received minor cuts and scratches, Utter  said.  </P> <P> They and Arauz were taken by ambulance to Westlake Medical Center. All except  Yaron Nechemia were treated and released, hospital personnel said.  </P> <P> Yaron and Lori Nechemia were wearing seat belts and the child was riding in a  car seat, which tipped sideways and protected her as the car was crushed, Utter  said.  </P> <P> The investigation is continuing, he said.

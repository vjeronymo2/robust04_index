			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Exports lift Chemring to Pounds 2.92m STRONG EXPORTS helped Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof clothes, to report a 10 per cent increase in interim profits. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.65m to Pounds 2.92m on sales up 15 percent at Pounds 21.3m. Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 9.49p and the interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 3p (2.725p). Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said defence markets - which account for 55 per cent of group business - would continue to enjoy steady growth. Measures to deter missiles attracted by heat and radar signatures would continually need to be improved. Sales of distress rockets and marine-related safety equipment - which make up part of the 45 per cent of non-defence sales - were benefiting from the introduction of new safety regulations. The group was looking at some sizeable acquisitions which might require a call on shareholders.</p>

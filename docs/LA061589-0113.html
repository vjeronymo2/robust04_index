			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> 8% TELEPHONE TAX IMPOSED  </P> <P> Starting in September, Santa Monica residents will pay an 8% tax to the city  for out-of-state and international telephone calls.  </P> <P> The city has been taxing only long-distance phone calls made within California.  The council voted 6 to 1 on Tuesday to impose additional taxes for interstate  and international telephone calls originating in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The tax will apply to any telephone communication service, including mobile  phones and facsimile machines.  </P> <P> If taxpayers can prove they have already paid a tax on a phone call, they will  be given a refund. This condition was included, said City Atty. Robert M.  Myers, for those few cases in which a call originating in Santa Monica might be  taxed by the city of Los Angeles, for example.  </P> <P> Councilman David Finkel asked the city staff to look into exempting low-income  residents, senior citizens and nonprofit organizations from the tax.  </P> <P> Councilman Herb Katz said he opposed all telephone taxes and voted against the  measure.  </P></p>

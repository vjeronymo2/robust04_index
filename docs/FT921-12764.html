			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / US middle-class voter wooed: The not-so-discreet pitch for the bourgeoisie EARLY days yet in the 1992 presidential election campaign, but one common theme has emerged: the American Middle Class is being treated like royalty. Scarcely a day passes without President George Bush, or one of the five Democratic party candidates seeking to stand against him in the November poll, profferring new-fangled tax breaks or federal entitlements to the millions of Americans who consider themselves middle-class. Electoral mathematics make this inevitable. At least 70 per cent of the population fit the middle-class label, ranging from the mechanic earning Dollars 19,000 a year to the lawyer making Dollars 90,000 (Pounds 50,000). The difference this year is how explicit the pitch has been. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner, laments the 'forgotten middle class' - a conscious echo of President Richard Nixon's televised appeal to the 'Silent Majority' over the heads of the Vietnam war protestors who ringed the White House in 1969. Mr Clinton's economic agenda includes a 10 per cent cut in middle-class taxes, a new Dollars 800 tax credit per child, and a pledge (ill-defined) to make health care available for every American. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero, supports similar tax relief for the middle class, supported by a comprehensive reform of the health care system which would extend coverage to more than 37m Americans who are uninsured. Mr Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a former senator, opposes an across-the-board tax cut for the middle class. 'Twinkie economics,' he calls that. But he is still targeting middle-income voters, mixing 'Buy American' appeals with old-fashioned, government-backed industrial policy to restore prosperity and guarantee jobs. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa alone has sought out low-income workers, the unemployed and disadvantaged. He has cast himself as an old-fashioned Democratic in the Franklin Roosevelt style, who supports huge public works programmes (plus a heavy dose of protectionism and Japan-bashing). His message has fallen flat. With four weeks until the key New Hampshire primary election, he is counting on a late TV campaign to turn the race around. The Democrats have not discovered the discreet charm of the American bourgeoisie by accident. Having lost five out of the last six presidential elections, strategists and candidates seem to have grasped at last the cost of the party's liberal bias. This has meant candidates being buried by Republican charges that they are soft on crime and communism, and prone to helping blacks and other minorities at the expense of law-abiding whites. Put differently, Mr Clinton, who comes from a conservative southern state, understands he must counter Republican efforts to cast him in the same mould as earlier, unsuccessful Democratic candidates for the presidency - Senator George McGovern (1972), Mr Walter Mondale (1984) and Governor Michael Dukakis (1988) - that of a big spender interested in funnelling tax-payers' money to the poor at the expense of the middle class. Two factors should help the Democratic cause in 1992. The absence of Rev Jesse Jackson - civil rights activist, defender of the down-trodden and showman extraordinaire - should broaden the party's appeal. Mr Jackson correctly observes that he won more than 7m votes in the Democratic primary elections in 1988; but the more pertinent (albeit unanswerable) question is how many middle-class voters his ubiquitous presence cost the Democrats in the 1984 and 1988 general elections. Democrats may also take heart from the weak US economy. In the last weeks of the 1988 campaign, Mr Dukakis started to catch up with Mr Bush, then vice-president, by declaring himself on the side of 'working families'. Government, he said, should make good the deficiencies of the Reagan-Bush era by raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing health and child care, helping to finance affordable housing and college education. In 1988, when the US economy was still growing, the message (and the candidate) was not alluring enough; in a stagnant economy, where polls show Americans insecure about jobs, crime, and the direction of the country, the message could prove attrative if offered by an attractive candidate. Democrats cannot afford, however, to place all bets on the economy. If Mr Bush's advisers are correct, signs of a recovery should be evident by the summer; this would immediately weaken the standard argument that the Democrats can make middle-class Americans more secure with 'safety net' programmes. On closer inspection, some of the Democratic candidates' current proposals are less mouth-watering than they at first appear. Mr Clinton's middle-class tax cut would be financed by a new top tax rate of 38.5 per cent (up from 31 per cent now) on incomes of Dollars 90,000 for single people and Dollars 120,000 for heads of households. This leaves the governor open to charges that he is robbing middle-class Peter to pay middle-class Paul. Likewise, Democratic proposals for comprehensive health care for all Americans carry a huge-price tag, perhaps as high as Dollars 60bn. This was enough for Mr Patrick Buchanan, the Republican challenger to Mr Bush in New Hampshire, to admit candidly to pensioners last week that he was not ready to support any health-care plan, although the need for reform was pressing. During the 1992 campaign, candidates' public spending plans will be scrutinised more closely by the press and public alike. So, there is a fair chance that voters will understand that tax breaks and other giveaways promised by the politicians now will be financed later - by the middle class.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: News in Brief GEORGE BUSH,the US president, is not the only one to promote family values this year. TSB Group, the UK bank, is offering a 'family bonus' to encourage several members of the same family to open savings accounts. However, the TSB is taking a rather more liberal view of the term 'family' than would be popular in the Republican party. Unmarried couples are as entitled to benefit from the bonus as lawfully wedded ones. Terry and Julian can join as well as Terry and June. Indeed, TSB will welcome any group of eight or fewer who want to register as a family - there will be no checking into their antecedents. The bonus will work by treating, for interest rate purposes only, the several accounts of separate family members as one big deposit. Because savings accounts have a 'banded' structure, with higher rates for higher deposits, this should mean increased returns for all family members. Say Mr and Mrs Smith, and their children John and Jane, each have Pounds 1,500 in TSB's 60 day notice account. Each deposit would normally earn 8.2 per cent in gross annual interest, the rate TSB pays on amounts between Pounds 500 and Pounds 4,999. Under the new scheme, the accounts are treated as if they were each one big deposit of Pounds 6,000. Each family member would thus earn 8.5 per cent gross, the rate TSB pays for deposits between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999. TSB insists there will be no loss of privacy. Each account will be kept separate, and family members will only be made aware of the total account balance, not the individual components. There are some limits. The maximum band into which family accounts can move is the Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999 range; so any individual with a balance of more than Pounds 25,000 will not benefit from the scheme, although other members of their family might. The products which qualify for the scheme are the 60 day notice account, the flexible savings account and FirstSave. The aim for TSB is to attract additional retail deposits and to establish brand loyalty among their existing accountholders. The bank says it is only aware of one other scheme (in Canada) which is run on the same lines. The scheme will be launched in October, with an advertising slogan 'Now Everyone in the Family Counts for More'. It cannot be long before some politician pinches the line.                          *       *       * THE INLAND Revenue has issued Form 18 for married couples who wish to apply to transfer all or half of the basic allowance of Pounds 1,720 to the wife. It should be returned before April 6 next year. Full details are available in leaflet IR80.                          *       *       * UNIT-LINKED life assurance products show a worrying variance in performance, according to a survey for Money Marketing by the actuaries Clay &amp; Partners. It also provides further evidence that with-profits bonuses are likely to fall, and casts doubts on the rules for disclosure of costs currently being used by Lautro, the life assurance regulator. The survey includes details of the full range of unit-linked life assurance investment products - maximum investment plans, personal pensions, and the old Section 226 policies. Performance varies widely within and between companies, suggesting that switching between funds needs to be done very carefully. On maximum investment plans, on a monthly premium of Pounds 70 over a 10-year period, Standard Life has the highest maturity value for a managed fund with Pounds 13,479, while Target Life comes last with Pounds 9,563. For single premium bonds, the best performer over five years is London &amp; Manchester's property fund with an increase of 63.97 per cent. Cash and - perhaps surprisingly - property funds dominate the list of best funds over this time period, while Far East and Japanese funds have been worst. With-profits pay-outs are much higher than equivalent unit-linked contracts, suggesting that with-profits bonuses have not yet come down by enough accurately to reflect market performance over the last five years. The average Pounds 35 per month 10-year with-profits endowment had, at March 1 this year, paid out Pounds 8,290. The average UK managed unit-linked MIP made Pounds 6,009, while the total variation in all unit-linked MIPs was from Pounds 8,636 - still barely above the average with-profits - to Pounds 3,001. Clay &amp; Partners also sounded a warning on pension charges. The survey says that the reduction in yield on an average single premium personal pension for someone aged 59 would be 7.5 percentage points. According to Lautro, this figure is only 6.21 per cent. This sounds unimportant, but these figures show how much charges would deduct from an annual yield of 10.75 per cent. If Clay &amp; Partners are right, charges would gobble this down to 3.25 per cent - below the rate of inflation. Beware the small print.                          *       *       * STOCK MARKET analysts take many factors into account when assessing shares, but rarely mention one of the factors most useful to private investors - the perks made available to shareholders. The Savers Organisation, administered by Hargreaves Lansdown, Bristol BS8 (0272-767767), has now published a booklet, Attractive Perks for UK Shareholders. Some of the advantages which can come with share-ownership make the current market look very good value. For example, all shareholders in The Savoy Hotels have a 10 per cent discount on accommodation at a range of hotels, including The Savoy and Claridge's. Whitbread last year offered all its shareholders a discount equivalent to Pounds 45 on purchases of Pounds 300. If you believe in the product . . .                          *       *       * SMALL COMPANY shares have finally escaped from their downward spiral. The prospect of lower interest rates, which pushed up the FT-SE 100 by over 250 points in 2 1/2 days this week, allowed smaller stocks to rally. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index rose 1.4 per cent to 1009.02 over the week to September 17; the County Small Companies Index increased by a more modest 0.1 per cent to 790.0 over the same period.</p>

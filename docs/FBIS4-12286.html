			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Acid Test of Sanctions"] </F>   [Text] Contrary to some interpretatons that try to portray  Jordan's linking of its resumption of the peace talks to ending  the siege against al-'Aqabah as political posturing, the Kingdom  will prove that it means business when it comes to vital  national interests. An upcoming multilateral meeting in the  Hague on the environment will not be boycotted. Instead Jordan  will be sending a junior diplomat to the meeting in a gesture  that is meant to send a double message to the international  community: The Kingdom is committed to the peace process; yet  it will not accept to be taken for granted when a national  interest is at stake. Jordan will thus attend the meeting to  prove that we will go all the way to advance the cause of peace  in the region. But by doing so, at a minimum level of  representation, we intend to drive the point home that unless  our legitimate rights and concerns are properly addressed, we  will have to do what is necessary in the future to protect this  country and its people.    All through its history, Jordan has demonstrated its genuine  interest in bringing about a just and lasting peace to the  region. In the words of many American officials, Jordan has been  an oasis of moderation in the area. The Kingdom never played  the spoiler game. it is not about to start that now. The  warning that the unfair and unjustifiable siege against  al-'Aqabah should end was a call prompted by the country's real  need to have that done right away.    For years, the Kingdom has been applying quiet diplomacy to  have its concerns dealt with. But little attention did the  decision-makers in Washington and the United Nations give to the  country's requests, it seems. When Jordan exhausted all  possible channels without receiving a positive answer, it  resorted to the only option left to it: Let the whole world  know that it is no longer willing to have its rights violated at  a time when it is meeting all its obligations under  international law and norms.    The United States, which repeatedly said it "understood"  Jordan's concern, was supposed last week to discuss means of  enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without continuing to hurt  the Kingdom. Yet that did not happen, apparently because the  various U.S. government organs needed more time to study the  matter, but more likely because the Clinton administration did  not want to appear as bowing to pressure from a small country  like ours.    The U.S. would be wrong to think Jordan is merely playing a  political game over the issue of sanctions and their  implications on our economy. We do not need to make political  capital this way. Jordan wants a speedy solution and has gone  out of its way to prove its goodwill, by sending a delegate to  the Hague's meeting. Washington should reciprocate. Nobody  doubts the ability of the U.S. to find a suitable way of  enforcing the sanctions against Iraq without hurting Jordan if  it wanted to. Otherwise, Jordan has at least to be compensated  for all the economic losses sustained as a result of those  sanctions. After all, the way the international community  chooses to deal wth this problem will be an important indication  of what it might do to bring about real peace in the region. If  it is going to be an imposed, shaky peace, Jordan might not need  it anyway.</p>

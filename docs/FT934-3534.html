			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Foods achieves turnround Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted food manufacturer, achieved a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.06m to profits of Pounds 104,000 in the half year ended September 30. The company said the benefits of reorganisation were being seen but continued sales growth and stringent cost controls would be needed in the second half to counter effects of the price war between the retailing multiples and intense competition between manufacturers. Turnover amounted to Pounds 8.1m against Pounds 11.1m which included Pounds 4.11m from discontinued activities. Earnings per share came through at 0.28p (2.96p losses) and again there is no dividend.</p>

Even the concept of service is foreign.  </P> <P> Equipping the operation with American television, communications modems, laser  printers, phone lines, video conferencing gear and the like, tough as it will  be, isn't the real challenge. Radisson has done that all over the world.  </P> <P> The main challenge, faced before only by McDonald's, is to find Soviet workers  and motivate them to say "Yes, I can," a Radisson slogan, when a more  traditional Soviet response has been to say "No, I can't."  </P> <P> Radisson's venture is a joint one with Intourist, the well-staffed Soviet  foreign tourism ministry, which built the structure. But none of the workers  will be hired from it.  </P> <P> "We want young, friendly people -- people inclined toward helping others," said  Juergen Bartels, who heads the Carlson Hospitality Group, a $2.2-billion  enterprise -- including Radisson -- within the Carlson Companies.  </P> <P> "We will look for nurses and teachers," he continues. "We will not be hiring  any of the hotel and restaurant people of Moscow."  </P> <P> The entire operation, says Bartels, a perfectionist who worked his way up  through European and North American hotels, rises or falls with the quality of  the people. His staff, he said, will choose, train, motivate and rate them.  </P> <P> Bartels and his crew plan to employ 30 full-time foreigners, Americans  included, and bring in 20 others temporarily from Radisson operations during  the first weeks. Each foreigner will be understudied by one or two Soviets.  </P></p>

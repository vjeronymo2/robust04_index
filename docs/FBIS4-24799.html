			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Ai Xiao (5337 4562): "Our Country Will </F> Vigorously Pursue Health Education in the Face of the Invasion  of AIDS"]    [Text] Beijing, 31 May (RENMIN RIBAO)-- Faced with the  invasion of AIDS, China will launch a vigorous health education  campaign as a major preventive and control measure against the  disease. At the three-day "seminar on the prevention and  control of AIDS in China" jointly held by the State Council  Research Office and Ministry of Public Health that begins today,  studies by expert and academic research groups will be presented  and examined in preparation for a formal submission of a  "proposal on the prevention of AIDS in China."    Globally 400,000 AIDS cases -- half of which occurred in the  United States -- were recorded between June 1985, when the  world's first case was reported, and the early 1990's. Dramatic  changes occurred in the mid-1990's when the spread of AIDS in  developing countries exceeded that in the United States. A  conservative estimate by the WHO projected that, by 2000, 50  million people around the world will have been exposed to the  HIV virus, most of them in countries and regions such as Asia,  Africa, and Latin America.    It has been learned that a total of 118 new AIDS cases were  reported in 10 provinces and cities between January and May. A  total of 1,361 AIDS cases have been recorded in 22 mainland  provinces and cities (1,106 patients are mainland residents, and  255 are foreigners and overseas Chinese) and 40 of these  carriers have developed full-blown AIDS (22 of them have died).  The figures, however, came only from small-range tests of less  than 3 million people.    State Councillor Peng Peiyun; Wu Jieping, National People's  Congress Standing Committee vice chairman; Qian Zhengying,  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice  chairman; Yuan Mu, State Council Research Office director;  Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang; among others attended  today's seminar.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Random talk on Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao" column by He </F> Biao (0149 2871): "View of 'Division of Sovereignty' Should  End"]    [Text] Recently, when speaking on relations between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui has  repeatedly promoted the view of a division of sovereignty,  claiming that "sovereignty belongs to the whole people" and  "Taiwan is a sovereign state," opposing the PRC's "possession of  sovereignty over Taiwan," and stressing that the two sides of  the strait are "split, separately ruled, and separated." These  remarks run counter to historical facts, disregard the  principles of international law, and completely conflict with  the aspirations of compatriots on the two sides of the strait  for the reunification of the motherland.    As everyone knows, state sovereignty can be neither divided  nor shared. Therefore, the PRC is the sole legitimate  government representing the entire Chinese people and Taiwan is  a province of China. This is a fact generally recognized by the  international community.    Li Teng-hui's attempt to use the view of a "division of  sovereignty" to mislead the public and to create "two Chinas" or  "one China, one Taiwan" can only be a vain one.    Last year, the Taiwan authorities conducted activities  around  the world aimed at "dual recognition" in an attempt to force the  question of discussing Taiwan's UN representative onto the  agenda of the UN General Assembly, and openly declared that they  had to pursue the "two Chinas as a phase" policy, but they only  came to grief in the end. Since the beginning of the year,  Taiwan leaders have been all the more unscrupulous in  successively using "vacation diplomacy," "in-transit diplomacy,"  and "dollar diplomacy." All these activities only ended up with  fruitless trips to and fro. Therefore, they lamented that  "sovereignty is a dangerous word" and then changed to promoting  "sovereignty rests with the people" instead, in an attempt to  avoid the "legitimate central government," which is crucial to  determining where sovereignty rests. They use the separation of  the people between the two sides of the strait as an excuse to  split state sovereignty in order to achieve the goal of  splitting Taiwan from the mainland.    Following the advocacy of such views as "one country, two  governments," "political entities on an equal footing," and "two  Chinas as a phase" by a small number of people in Taiwan,  including Li Teng-hui, they have now put forward the "view of a  division of sovereignty," repeating the old trick in a new way.  Their real intention is to obstruct the process of the  motherland's peaceful reunification so as to build a "small  royal palace" in a peaceful corner.    Safeguarding the unity and integrity of national sovereignty  and promoting the realization of the reunification of the  motherland are in the fundamental interests of the entire  Chinese people as well as the common aspirations of compatriots  on the two sides of the strait. Will one not bring disgrace and  ruin on oneself if one acts against this great trend?!    Taiwan leaders should have a clear understanding of the  situation and should not continue to slide down the path of  splitting the country and splitting the nation.</p>

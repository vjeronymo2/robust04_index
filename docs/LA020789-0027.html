			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG TRIAL;  </P> <P> AMBASSADOR WON'T HAVE TO TESTIFY  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday refused to order the U. S. ambassador to Mexico to  appear as a witness in a complex drug trial in San Diego.  </P> <P> A defense attorney had requested that the ambassador testify about the true  status of several defendants the prosecution claims were high-ranking Mexican  government officials when they were arrested in an undercover sting.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge William B. Enright did agree to privately review State  Department documents to determine whether they can be used in the trial of four  Mexicans and three Bolivians on drug charges.  </P> <P> "If they (the documents) are admissible, I'll be happy to release some or all  of them," the judge said.  </P> <P> The case began in 1987 when the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and U.  S. Customs set up an undercover sting with the intention of snaring corrupt  Mexican officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrested in La Jolla  </P> <P> The investigation ended in January, 1988, when federal agents posing as drug  dealers arrested the men in a La Jolla supermarket parking lot after $500,000  changed hands.  </P> <P> At the time of the arrests, U. S. officials called them significant because  they supposedly showed complicity of Mexican officials in the international  drug trade. Three of the defendants, Jorge Carranza Peniche, Pablo Giron Ortiz  and Hector Manuel Brumel Alvarez, were identified as well-connected Mexican  government or military officials.  </P> <P> However, defense attorneys in the trial, which started several weeks ago, are  trying to show that Carranza, Giron and Brumel did not hold Mexican government  positions. The attorneys contend their clients were posing as Mexican officials  in order to sting U. S. drug agents, who they thought were drug dealers.  </P> <P> Attorney Cynthia Aaron, who represents Carranza, wanted Ambassador Charles J.  Pilliod to testify about conversations with Mexican government leaders at the  time of the La Jolla arrests.  </P> <P> In reports published last year, Pilliod was quoted as saying that Mexican  officials told him that Carranza was discharged from the Mexican army in 1970,  that Giron was never a commandant in the Mexican Federal Judicial Police and  that Brumel was never a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compared to North Trial  </P> <P> Aaron, in asking Enright Monday to uphold her subpoena for Pilliod, compared  the case with the arms-for-hostages trial in Washington, in which former  President Ronald Reagan has also been identified as a potential court witness.  </P> <P> "Nobody is above the law," Aaron said. "Even President Reagan is  </P> <P> being held on hold under subpoena in the Oliver North case."  </P> <P> However, Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen Nelson argued that the information  Pilliod obtained was nothing more than hearsay and should not be allowed as  evidence in the trial.  </P> <P> He also argued that Pilliod is "not a trained investigator" and therefore  cannot testify to the veracity of the information he received about the  Mexicans' backgrounds.  </P> <P> "He shot from the hip when he made his comments" in the media last year, Nelson  said. "It's the opinion of someone who has no personal knowledge. It's rank  hearsay. He talked to someone who didn't have a clue about this case."  </P> <P> In ruling in favor of Nelson's motion to quash the subpoena for Pilliod, the  judge said he did not think there was sufficient evidence to show that the  ambassador's testimony would be relevant. But he did say he would review State  Department correspondence between Pilliod and Mexican government officials and  rule on whether any of that material may be entered as evidence in the trial.  </P></p>

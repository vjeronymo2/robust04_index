Black-market train ticket transactions have  become a headache for the public security sector that have not  been stopped despite repeated attempts.    China's rail transport industry has grown rapidly in the  over  four decades since the founding of the PRC, with rail-operation  mileage at 53,565 km by 1992, up 140 percent from 1949.  Moreover, rail freight volume is up over 20 times, while our  population has nearly tripled. So in contrast, railway  construction remains severely lagging.    China's per capita rail length is now equivalent only to  that  of a cigarette, leaving Chinese railways ranking lower than  100th place in the world based on territorial area. As to  running speed, the world has at least 25 countries with trains  running at a top speed of over 140 km per hr, with running speed  above 100 km per hr, while China has only a few lines on which  trains run at a top speed of just 120 km per hr, with running  speed generally at only 10-100 km per hr.    This low volume and slow speed, in addition to our rail  transport industry being responsible for 52 percent of our  passenger service and 70 percent of our freight volume, has left  our railways operating at overload capacity while fighting for  consumption and equipment, with rail trunk-line transport in  all-out shortage, and both capital and consumer goods entering  and leaving east, south, southwest, northwest, and northeast  China piled up like mountains. Sichuan Province, commonly known  as a land of plenty, has not even one multiple-track line,  leaving Governor Xiao Yang [5135 4441] to sigh about Sichuan's  productive forces being packed in a bottle. National  trunk-line passenger volume is similarly exploding, with  exceptional service shortages every spring. During the 1993  Spring Festival, Shanghai experienced 8 consecutive days of  passenger volume averaging 560,000 a day, Chengdu had over  50,000 passengers stuck in stations, and the surging crowds in  the Guangzhou station broke through six arm-thick iron railings.    So how are we to change our rail transport industry's  shortages and slowness? In recent years, everyone from Central  Committee and State Council officials to communications and  transportation experts, scholars, and industrialists have been  paying attention to and exploring this question, with almost all  holding that we need to speed up the pace of our railway  construction, doing all that we can to build new lines and  upgrade old ones. But what sort of new lines are we to build,  and how are old lines to be upgraded? I interviewed many  concerned figures on these details, with most holding that the  basic way out for China's rail transport industry is to raise  its running speed, by building high-speed railways. In recent  years, high-speed rail construction has gradually found its way  onto our economic-development agenda.    High-speed rail refers to a railway system with speeds  topping 200 km per hr, using special lines with no grade  crossings and absolute running safety. It concentrates high  technology in fields, such as pulling force, rolling stock, line  and track structure, communications signals, driver command and  control, driving organization, and operating model, having  advantages, such as large transport capacity, high speed, good  safety, low consumption, little pollution, and small area  occupied, having become the general railway-development trend in  today's world.    When Japan's new east-coast trunk-line from Tokyo to Osaka  began commercial operation in 1964 at a speed of 210 km per hr,  it was the world's first highspeed-rail system. France's  high-speed train, the TGV, began operation in 1981. Italy's  Baishi highspeed train connected Milan to Rome in 1988.  Germany's high-tech ICE train went into official operation in  June 1991. Spain started to use a rail service system with  speeds over 250 km per hour in 1992. Britain, Sweden,  Switzerland, and the former Soviet Union have also built their  own highspeed railways. And in addition to the European  countries, others, such as the United States, South Korea,  Canada, India, and Australia, are also planning their own  highspeed railways. The world now has 8,000 km of highspeed  railways, with the fastest running trains being France's TGV  (515 km per hr), Germany's ICE (406 km per hr), and Japan's  WIN350 (350.4 km per hr).    High-speed rail construction in all countries generally goes  through stages, such as discussion, planning, demonstration,  project-establishment, construction, and commercial operation.  Japan set a 7-year record for the whole cycle, which is  generally about 10 years in other countries. I learned from my  investigations and interviews that China's high-speed rail  construction is assimilating advanced world experience, by  combining the discussion, planning, and demonstration stages  into one, with a series of design and planning details now in  systematic progress under the leadership of four commissions and  one ministry (the State Planning Commission, the Economics and  Trade Commission, the State Restructuring of the Economic System  Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the  Ministry of Railways).    To greet the return of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China  in  1997, by providing China's high-speed rail construction with a  scientific experimental line, the State Council decided to build  a high-speed railway from Guangzhou to Shenzhen (with a top  speed of 160 km per hr and a running speed of 100-120 km per  hr). In March 1990, the Ministry of Railways' S&amp;T Research  Academy formed an expert taskforce to jointly tackle the key  problems involved. Then in December 1991, the official  foundation-laying ceremony was held at Shilongqiao with, by the  end of November 1993, the line's bridge upgrading being  basically completed, engine and car samples having been  developed, and construction smoothly underway, now in the  crucial stage of all-out rail-laying and station-upgrading on  the whole line. Plans are for this high-speed railway to be  finished and opened to traffic in 1994.    On 19 April 1992, Fujian's local railway head office signed  a  contract of intent with Japan's Jingkawa Trust and Investment  Group, with the two parties signing on 15 July the  cooperative-grounds agreement documents. This agreement  provides for Sino-Japanese cooperation in building a new  bullet-train line from Fuzhou to Xiamen, to be completed by no  later than 1998, at which time bullet trains will speed between  Fuzhou and Xiamen at 210 km per hr. While a number of factors  have kept bilateral cooperation on this line from making  substantive progress, leaving the bullet train still in "a sort  of dream" state, concerned figures indicate that the Chinese  Ministry of Railways and Fujian Province are very determined to  build this highspeed railway, either as a joint venture or  alone, to turn this dream into a reality.    In late September 1992, a high-level forum was held at the  Jingxi Hotel in Beijing, whose theme was how to develop China's  highspeed railways. It was proposed at this conference that the  development of China's highspeed railways should begin with the  Beijing-Shanghai line, and then proceed to the construction of  the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Harbin lines.    The Beijing-Shanghai line is China's busiest north-south  artery, being 1,462 km long. It runs through four eastern  coastal provinces and the three large municipalities of Beijing,  Tianjin, and Shanghai, connecting the two major economic zones  of Beijing-Tianjin-Tang Shan and the Chang Jiang [Yangtze]  Delta. Along this line, the population makes up 26.2 percent  of China's population, the GVIAO accounts for 37.9 percent of  China's, and the per capita national income is over twice the  national average. While this line accounts for only 2.8  percent of China's railway mileage, it is responsible for 14.3  percent of China's railway passenger turnover, with a  passenger-traffic density 5.2 times the national average, and a  freight-volume density 3.6 times the national average. The  experts hold that building a highspeed railway first between  Beijing and Shanghai will be of extremely far-reaching  significance to our whole national economic development.    Long before this high-level conference, experts from the  Ministry of Railways and concerned departments had done much  preliminary work for the building of the Beijing-Shanghai  highspeed railway, studying the overall program and plan. This  conference then strengthened everyone's resolve. It is  understood that the Ministry of Railways' Third Research Academy  has completed the "feasibility-study report for the  Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway," which holds that highspeed  trains on this line will travel at 250-300 km per hr using  highspeed engines and cars, with the key equipment being  purchased abroad. The whole 1,400-plus km line will be elevated  and closed, and gradually developed into separate passenger and  freight lines. Once the Beijing-Shanghai railway is finished,  its annual passenger and freight volume will reach 100 million  trips and 100 million tons respectively, shortening the travel  time from Beijing to Shanghai from 17 to 6-7 hours, to make it  possible to "set out in the morning and arrive by evening," not  to speak of its impact on national economic development and  efficiency.    As to the investment, projecting price changes, the overall  investment will reach 30 billion RMB. The experts hold that  the Ministry of Railways should be the major investor, paying  6-7 percent of the 3 billion yuan a year over the 10-year plan.  Then, construction funds raised every year for the  Beijing-Shanghai railway could amount to 15-20 billion yuan.  This would ensure the funding. And provinces and  municipalities along the line could also invest through shares,  or use land for share-investment, to take part in the building  of the highspeed railway in line with national preferential  policy.    As to ticket prices, Beijing-Shanghai highspeed-rail  passengers could pay two-thirds the price of CAAC airline ticket  prices for the same distance. This would meet the terms for  repaying the capital with interest, in addition to the possible  sale of stocks and bonds, the use of foreign loans, and even the  attraction of overseas technology and equipment for  joint-venture shareholding.    The construction of the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway  will promote tourism, industrial and commercial, and real estate  development along the line, which will have a great impact on  eastern China over the next decade.    Concerned figures and certain experts and academics have  appealed to the policymaking sector to make a resolute decision  as quickly as possible after detailed examination and approval  of the feasibility report and further demonstration, so that the  Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway can be established as a  project and put under construction as soon as possible.    Certain figures hold that if it is pushed hard, it will be  entirely possible for construction to start on the  Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway in one to four years, with  construction to be completed in about a decade, by which time,  China's rail transport industry will have pioneered a new age.</p>

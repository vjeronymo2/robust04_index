Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PENTHOUSE TARGETS SOVIETS  </P> <P> Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said today that he is planning to sell his  magazine in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Guccione said he has reached agreement with Moscow to start distributing the  magazine in the Soviet Union within the next two months.  </P> <P> He said he also has plans to distribute it in Poland, Hungary and  Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> He said some high-ranking Soviet officials have private subscriptions, part of  Penthouse's worldwide sales of nearly 4 million a month.  </P> <P> "Five of the 17 bureaucrats I spoke to when I was negotiating with the Soviet  ministry told me that they get it every month," said Guccione, who's in  Australia to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the magazine's Australian  edition.  </P> <P> "They thought in light of perestroika the Russian male was likely to benefit  from a lifestyle magazine like Penthouse. I naturally agreed with that."  </P></p>

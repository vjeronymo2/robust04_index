			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / American Airlines cleared of low-fare aggression A FEDERAL jury in Galveston, Texas, yesterday cleared American Airlines, one the biggest carriers in the US, of allegations that it had deliberately priced fares below cost last year in an attempt to drive some of its financially weaker competitors out of business. The anti-trust case was brought against American by Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, two other sizeable, but smaller, US carriers. It turned on American's 'value pricing plan', which was unveiled in the spring of 1992 and was a short-lived attempt to simply the different domestic fares schemes into four basic fare classes. These fares were generally below previous levels in the same classes. Continental and Northwest, which claimed to have lost a total of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) when forced to match the new lower fares, argued that American was engaged in deliberate predatory pricing. Some colourful evidence, designed to demonstate American's ruthless management approach, was produced  -including an internal memo in which Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, had scrawled in the margin 'Crush these guys', meaning Pan Am. American emphatically denied the charges, maintaining that the value pricing plan was a strategy to help the airline and the industry. Yesterday, the jury took less than four hours to find that American had not tried to monopolise air service with its 'value pricing plan'. Afterwards, Mr Crandall said he was 'enormously pleased', but 'outraged by the time and cost' of the case. American, he said, had spent upwards of Dollars 20m. 'The brevity of the jury's deliberations underscores how baseless the allegations were,' commented Mr Crandall. Continental said it might appeal the verdict, but declined to announce a firm decision. On Wall Street, shares in AMR, parent company of American Airlines, rose yesterday by Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 .</p>

He said in a statement in Ulundi he had been  "extremely shocked and aggrieved" to hear of the massacre.    Chief Buthelezi said: "We are never going to have peace and  prosperity in South Africa by eliminating each other through  such terrible acts of violence." He had noted with regret that  there had already been some conjectures by the Midlands  leadership of the African National Congress [ANC] about who was  responsible for the carnage.    Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said on  Saturday he suspected those who didn't want people to vote were  responsible for the massacre. The ANC said the victims were  preparing for an ANC voter education workshop on Saturday and  police said they were inside a hut when four gunmen shot at  them. Some of the victims were stabbed to death.    On the resignation of IFP's Deputy Secretary-General Simon  Gumede, Chief Buthelezi said Mr Gumede, a chief, wanted to spend  more time looking after the affairs of his people. There was no  bad feeling between himself and Mr Gumede, Chief Buthelezi added.</p>

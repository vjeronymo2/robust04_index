			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Abarinov under the "Details" rubric: </F> "Export of Peacekeepers Does Not Earn Profit. General  Podkolzin Relies on False Information"]    [Text] When SEGODNYA published in its 19 May issue a  statement by General Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne  Troops, that Russian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia have  helped slash Russia's debt to the United Nations from $1.5  billion to $200 million, it expressed its doubt as to whether  the information was relliable. Now we have full justification  for calling it false.    According to our information, Russia's debt to the UN Fund  of  Peacekeeping Operations stands at around $550 million. In the  past two years (the period to which Yevgeniy Podkolzin  referred), not only has the debt failed to shrink, but it has  even grown. Payments due to Russian servicemen for  participation in UN operations do not count toward debt payment.  The Russian paratroopers receive from the UN fund just as much  as servicemen of other countries -- around $1,000 per person per  month. The rest is paid by the countries that have sent their  contingents. Alas, the Russian Government does not pay any  extra money -- hence a significant gap in wages.    Therefore, the "export" of peacekeepers does not bring  Russia  any earnings. Nor does it have any bearing on the Russian  contribution to the UN Peacekeeping Fund -- this is another sum  of money and another debt.</p>

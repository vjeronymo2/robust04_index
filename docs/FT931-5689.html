			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad fertiliser sector prepares to resume growth - Depressed prices have tempered the industry's buoyancy DEPRESSED PRICES over the past nine months, caused mainly by increased production in the Ukraine, have tempered the buoyancy of Trinidad and Tobago's fertiliser industry. This has exacerbated a slowdown in growth of the industry over the past three years following rapid expansion in nitrogenous fertiliser output between 1980 and 1989. The Caribbean republic remains one of the world's leading producers of ammonia and urea - the leader since the break-up of the Soviet Union, claim local officials. Senior representatives of the energy and natural resources ministry say they are not greatly concerned at the sate of market as the country has the capacity to take advantage of the rebound that they believe is inevitable. This, however, will depend on a quick and significant increase in production capacity. Combined output of ammonia and urea last year was 2.4m tonnes, while installed capacity is 2.5m tonnes. The feedstock for the fertiliser plants is locally-produced natural gas, and officials say any significant expansion in ammonia and urea output must await an increase in gas recovery. This is expected from a major gas field off Trinidad's south-east coast in which three state-owned companies and Enron Oil and Gas of Texas are investing USDollars 250m over the next five years to recover 150m cubic feet of gas a day. 'The development of Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry has been assisted significantly by the advantage of local supplies of energy,' explains Mr Rupert Mends, the permanent secretary in the energy and natural resources ministry. 'We are also favoured by relatively easy and quick access to our major markets in the US and Europe.' Ammonia and urea production in 1991 was 4.6 per cent more than in 1990, indicating a significant slow-down after a five-fold expansion between 1981 and 1989. The Trinidad and Tobago central bank, in a recent report, suggests that such rates of growth may not be repeated in the short term. The bank says that in the first half of last year production of nitrogenous fertilisers totalled 1.23m tonnes, marginally higher than in 1991. But it reports that international ammonia markets have been depressed, and that this has coincided with the end of the fertiliser application season in North America and Europe, with reduced demand in these areas. 'In addition, the easy availability of the product from the Ukraine contributed to oversupply on global markets and consequently to lower prices,' the bank says. It reports that Trinidad and Tobago's ammonia averaged USDollars 77 a tonne (fob Caribbean) in the second quarter of last year, against Dollars 97 a tonne in the second quarter of 1991. Urea prices fell Dollars 21 from Dollars 155 per tonne in 1991. Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry was born 30 years ago when WR Grace of New York established Fedchem, an ammonia plant with a rated capacity of 250,000 tonnes a year. Thirteen years later the US company and the Trinidad and Tobago government created a joint venture, Tringen, to run a 400,000-tonnes-a-year ammonia plant. The facility was expanded in 1988 and now has a rated capacity of 920,000 tonnes a year. Following a corporate decision to divest itself of its holdings in fertilisers, WR Grace has sold its operations in Trinidad and Tobago to Norsk Hydro of Norway. A third ammonia plant, Fertrin, a joint venture between Amoco Oil of the US and the Trinidad and Tobago government, began production in 1981. The sole urea producer, the wholly state-owned Trinidad and Tobago Urea Company, has a capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year. The government is seeking buyers for its 51 per cent holding in Fertrin and for the urea company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Combined ammonia and urea production                 ('000 tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992                               2,400 1991                               2,400 1990                               2,300 1988                               2,200 1986                               1,800 1984                               1,400 1982                                 900 1981                                 470  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source; Trinidad and Tobago energy ministry and Trinidad and Tobago central bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

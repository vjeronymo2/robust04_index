			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Dormobile comes to an end Dormobile, once a prominent name in the motor industry, came to an end yesterday when its 200 staff were dismissed by a liquidator at the factory gates in Folkestone, Kent. The company, which for more than 20 years produced a successful range of minibuses and motor caravans that were frequently used in television and film (above), went into voluntary liquidation days before it was due in court to fight a bid to have it compulsorily wound up. The 200 workers had agreed to work for Pounds 50 a week, a quarter of their normal pay. Dormobile's problems have been mounting for 12 years since production of the Bedford chassis-based van ended when the design became obsolete. It shifted emphasis to produce bigger, 29-seater buses based on Iveco Ford and Mercedes chassis. Until last week it was producing around six buses a week at Pounds 24,000 each. The company had orders worth Pounds 3m for buses but was unable to convert the orders into vehicles.</p>

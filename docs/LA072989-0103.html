			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTO REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHILLING TRIP IN THE SPEED LANE  </P> <P> "i was born in tulsa oklahoma in 1943. when i was sixteen i started shooting  amphetamine. i shot with my friends everyday for three years and then left town  but i've gone back through the years. once the needle goes in it never comes  out."  </P> <P>  -- Larry Clark, from the introduction to his photo exhibit and book, "Tulsa"  </P> <P> "Tulsa," a photographic chronicle of life and death among amphetamine users, is  not a pretty picture. But for San Diego, the country's speed capital, "Tulsa"  may be a chillingly appropriate one.  </P> <P> The exhibition's unfolding series of images at the Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery  Gallery amounts to a documentary portrait of seemingly innocent, all-American  youths who took a wrong turn growing up and hit the speed lane. Photographer  Larry Clark, himself an acknowledged drug abuser, made these pictures of  friends in his Oklahoma hometown  </P> <P> between 1963 and 1971.  </P> <P> In the 1960s and '70s, speed was a hot drug-culture chemical. The drug has  become popular again, replacing crack and cocaine because of its ready  availability and low cost, drug enforcement officials say.  </P> <P> The photographs about amphetamine use in the '60s seem to fit present-day San  Diego County, which accounted for 25% of all methamphetamine labs seized in the  United States in 1986, according to federal records.  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine anyone not being moved viscerally by the rawness,  intensity and ultimate tragedy of these pictures, which gallery owner Lemery  chose to exhibit as a key example of autobiographical photography.  </P> <P> "For general commercial appeal, these are not the sort of prints people want on  the wall above the fireplace," Lemery said. "Serious collectors would be  interested in these prints. In the Monsen collection that was shown at the La  Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, they had two pieces (from 'Tulsa') in their  collection. 'Tulsa' is considered one of the major works in . . . a series of  autobiographical works that were done in the 1970s."  </P> <P> The exhibit's black-and-white images have a relentless, unforgiving quality as  a compilation of moments in the lives of these Oklahomans. Clark portrays young  people sticking hypodermic needles in their limbs or, as observers, with their  eyes gazing uncertainly at their peers. Over time, he shows the cost of such a  life style in brutality, injuries and deaths.  </P> <P> As in the accompanying book, published in 1971 and recently reissued, the  exhibition is arranged in chronological order. The first three images are of  bare-chested teen-age boys. Their faces look bored and tough, yet naive.  </P> <P> Click. Click. Click. Clark records the dissatisfaction with life that drove him  and his friends to enhance it synthetically. The boys turn to amphetamine,  making fists of their hands to produce a good vein for the needle.  </P> <P> In one photograph, four boys are having a party. One boy injects himself while  another snaps a light for a cigarette. One laughs hilariously as if the other,  who is bending over, had just told a good joke. In the background, hanging over  a mantel, is a painting of Jesus, looking away from the scene.  </P> <P> In these photographs from the early years, up to 1968, the boys are the ones  doing the drugs. Clark shows the girls as lacking any semblance of joy. The  young women sit hunched with legs and arms crossed, turning in on themselves,  with brooding expressions on their faces. One, in a bouffant hairdo of the  period, watches the proceedings, a mirthless, silent observer clutching a beer  in one photograph, a cigarette in another.  </P> <P> The tone changes between 1968 and 1971. A sense of claustrophobia envelops the  series of photographs. Most of the images are taken inside a house where group  members live. A crudely lettered cardboard sign, addressed to the police with  racist comments, is a reaction of the group to an apparent raid on the house.  </P> <P> Violence and death become prevalent themes. Two portraits carry the simple  caption "dead." A fascination with handguns has pervaded the group. In a series  of images made using a movie camera, Clark records what appears to be one  member of the group shooting another with a pistol. In the 1971 section, one  man carefully aims a pistol at something or someone off camera.  </P> <P> Clark is on the scene when a man is accidentally wounded with a pistol. We see  the man grimacing in pain on a bed, his pants pulled down, the small thigh  wound, the blood stains on his trousers, a towel, and nearby, the tiny  automatic pistol. A woman sits next to him, head bent, apparently distraught.  </P> <P> The lives Clark records increasingly become oriented around drugs, violence and  sex. Men inject bare-breasted women. One woman, who has welts on her arms in  one photo, is shown in bed with a huge black eye and a large bruise on her  shoulder.  </P> <P> Death comes again. A woman who looks to be nine months pregnant is shown bathed  in the daylight flowing through a window as she applies a hypodermic needle to  a vein in her arm. On the following page is a woman at a funeral carrying a  flowering plant. Turn the page and there's an infant in a tiny coffin.  </P> <P> Before the series concludes, Clark shows an apparent renewal of the cycle as  new faces, younger people, cluster around, administering the needle. Their  innocence is the same as Clark's friends portrayed in the earliest photographs.  </P> <P> In exhibiting these difficult photographs for sale, Lemery, the gallery's  proprietor, reveals a genuine passion for art that goes beyond the merely  commercial. He could easily have found prettier, more saleable art.  </P> <P> "Tulsa" makes the viewer think about the choices available to these young  people and why they took the path they did.  </P> <P> The exhibit continues through Aug. 5 at the gallery, 744 G St., Suite 205.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["IAEA Secretariat Should Look Squarely at Reality and </F> Return to Position of Impartiality -- Statement of Spokesman for  General Department of the Atomic Energy" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  General Department of the Atomic Energy of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today concerning  the fact that a spokesman for the Secretariat of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] submitted a wrong  report on the reactor core refueling operations in the DPRK to  the UN Security Council and the council subsequently adopted a  "presidential statement" on it.    The statement reads:    Recently, the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) submitted to the UN Security Council a wrong  report related to the core refueling operations at the five  megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the DPRK,  misrepresenting facts as if the method of the core refueling  operations employed by the DPRK would offer slim technical  possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods, and the UN  Security Council, accordingly, adopted posthaste a "presidential  statement".    As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power  plant had no other choice but to begin the core refuelling  operations from early May for technical or safety reasons.    Since we are in a unique status following the temporary  suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from  the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty, we are not under  obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections under the  safeguards agreement but are obligated only to ensure the  inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge.    The selection and securing of some fuel rods requested by  the  IAEA with regard to the core refueling operations is activities  for the verification of the completeness of the initial report.  In the long run, this activity falls under the category of ad  hoc inspection.    The selection and securing of some fuel rods, therefore, can  never be allowed before our unique status is removed.    But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a  manner that we fully preserve technical possibility for later  measurement of such fuel rods as requested by the agency in  token of good faith, anticipating a dissolution of our unique  status.    At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the  fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel pond and damaged fuel  dry storage are under strict containment and surveillance by the  agency.    Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the  reactor hall where refueling is going on, are monitoring the  core area, fuel channels and equipment hatch and movements of  the refueling machines. And the IAEA spent fuel rod counter  system with a silicon semi-conductor detector, a fission  chamber, an ionization chamber and a position sensor has been  installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to constantly  measure and count the spent fuel rod being discharged into  baskets.    The agency has planted thermoluminescence detectors and  seals  in all the channels which may be considered to be diversion  paths and two surveillance cameras in the building of the spent  fuel pond, to monitor and control the flow of nuclear material.    Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to  make efficient use of the surveillance devices of the agency  during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested  by it, such as the replacement of computers and their parts in  the spent fuel rod counter, the installation of uninterruptable  power supply to the IAEA surveillance devices and lighting  system for spent fuel pond building.    Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the  refueling, is firmly guaranteed.    This is admitted by the inspectors of the agency now  observing the whole processes of refueling.    Our core refueling operations is being done in such a manner  that we preserve technical possibility of later measurement.    The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by  the  refueling machine channel by channel, channel group by channel  group in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel  rods from four channels have been discharged into one basket.    Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of  the spent fuel pond.    Accounting and operating records concerning all the  operation  of refueling, including the basket identification number, the  channel identification number, the sequence of fuel rods in  channels, and the position of baskets in the pond, are being  kept at facility.    Also the identification number of baskets and their  positions  in the pond are being strictly ascertained by the agency's  inspectors now present during the operation of refueling.    This shows that the refueling operations are now being  conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner  that we preserve technical possibilities of their future  measurement.    So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel  rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any  time if necessary.    The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in  them can be identified by means of the measured value of the  gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the  distribution of neutron flux along the channels.    This method has been fully proved through experiment under  wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the  working amount of measurement may slightly be larger than that  by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But  it is the only rational method in our present situation.    It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the  spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate  the transparency of our nuclear activities.    At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as  regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation, too,  said that the DPRK-proposed method was reasonable from the  theoretical point of view and that he would study it back at the  agency, and inform us of the results.    This notwithstanding, some officials of the IAEA Secretariat  hurriedly submitted to the United Nations Security Council a  report based on their unilateral, wrong judgement that the  technical possibility of a future measurement of the fuel rods  is insufficient, on May 27 when the negotiations were under way,  before the consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for  the results.    Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after  going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and  technical clarification.    Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council did a very  irresponsible and unfair act according to a scenario written by  some member nations beforehand, claiming that the core refueling  operation must be made in accordance with the standards of the  agency and, if not, the technical possibility of later  measurement of the fuel rods might be lost.    Such an unjustifiable behavior of the agency Secretariat and  the UN Security Council was by no means fortuitous.    The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided presence at the  refueling ignoring our just proposal for its presence from the  beginning, and hindered the normal operation of our nuclear  facilities.    When we were compelled to start the refueling operation for  technical or safety reasons, it charged that we started the  refueling in the absence of its inspectors.    The unjustifiable pressure campaign launched against us by  the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security Council with  regard to the core refueling operation in our country bears  close resemblance to the previous pressure campaign based on the  results of the inspection in March.    It is their trite method to lay deliberate obstacles in the  way of the solution to the nuclear issue by unreasonably taking  the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the United Nations and  internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress  was made in its solution by the DPRK's sincere efforts and  flexible position.    Facts clearly indicate that the agency Secretariat has  pursued a sinister political purpose of stifling the DPRK from  the beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from  taking a stand for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    If some officials of the agency Secretariat declare that the  technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods  is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure.    If the IAEA Secretariat truly want a solution to the  "nuclear  issue" of the DPRK, it must not continue expanding its  partiality with such unreasonable acts as hurriedly submitting a  report based on a wrong judgement to the UN Security Council as  it did this time, but squarely look at the situation and return  to its original, fair position befitting an international  organization.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Rewards for the loyal shopper - Wooing and keeping customers Boots the Chemists was this week putting a brave face on what must be judged, at the very least, a public relations embarrassment. Its vouchers-for-sports equipment scheme is not in the same league as Hoover's free flight fiasco of a year ago. But it does highlight some of the dangers inherent in the current rash of customer loyalty schemes, designed to attract and reward regular spenders. Between September and November Boots issued 36m vouchers to customers - one for every Pounds 5 spent at its stores - which could be exchanged by schools for sports equipment. A total of 22,000 schools throughout the UK registered for the scheme and started eyeing equipment in the Boots' catalogue for which they hoped parents would collect tokens. Unfortunately, the vouchers were worth so little individually that customers threw them away; when the required volume of vouchers failed to get through to schools there was a stream of complaints. Boots has recently announced it would halve the number of vouchers needed for each piece of equipment. Such a miscalculation is just one of the traps to be avoided by companies tempted to join the customer loyalty industry. Existing schemes range from Air Miles (run by a British Airways subsidiary), now believed to be collected by one in 10 UK households, to tie-ups between petrol stations and retailers. Premier Points, for example, are collected at Mobil and redeemed at Argos. One of the largest schemes is yet to come. AT&amp;T Istel, an information technology subsidiary of the US communications group, is currently negotiating with UK retailers to set up in the spring an 8m-member loyalty card programme. The company will manage the scheme on behalf of non-competing toy, grocery, petrol, DIY, electrical and clothing retailers, restaurants and hotels. Customers can pick up points whenever they use a participating outlet and will be able to redeem them for a range of discounts, goods and services. AT&amp;T Istel will manage the database of card members and participating companies will get shared access to the data, allowing them to mail each other's customers. AT&amp;T Istel plans to spend Pounds 8m marketing the scheme in each of the next three years. Arguably there is little new about customer loyalty programmes - the 'dividends' offered by the co-operative society shops, Green Shield stamps and store cards were all antecedents of the current schemes. But industry observers say recent interest is unlikely to abate. The recession has made companies question the cost-effectiveness of traditional mass-marketing techniques, and turn to more focused methods, according to Stephen Taylor, Air Miles' marketing director. In good times, the fact that advertising is not as targeted or as effective as might be desired 'doesn't really matter, because you're establishing your brand name', he says. The economic benefits of keeping existing customers loyal, rather than focusing on the short-term recruitment of new customers, has also received much attention. The longer the 'life' of a customer, the more initial recruitment costs will be spread. With an 80 per cent annual retention rate, for example, a customer base will need renewing once every five years; by increasing the retention rate to 90 per cent, the base need only be renewed every 10 years. 'Customer loyalty appears to be the only way to achieve sustainably superior profits,' Frederick Reichheld, a director of the consultancy Bain and Company, wrote in the Harvard Business Review earlier this year. One of the examples he used was the life insurance business, where, Reichheld says, 'a five percentage point increase in customer retention lowers costs per policy by 18 per cent'. The latest research from Cranfield School of Management, published this week, which looked at shopping patterns in 10 large shopping centres across the UK, found that loyal shoppers spend up to four times more in their first-choice store than those who are 'promiscuous' in their shopping habits. The payoff for keeping customers is clear, but it cannot be assumed that the current craze for the card, token and voucher-based loyalty schemes is necessarily doing the trick. Says Tim Denison from Cranfield who, together with Simon Knox, carried out the retailing research: 'How effective loyalty schemes are is still in question.' It is not known, for example, whether customers behave tactically towards the schemes, reaping a few advantages and then moving on to a new offer. Denison points to a lack of monitoring by companies, and accounting practices which fail to highlight which customers are most worth keeping. Taylor suggests that deferred discount programmes - which offer discounts after points have been accumulated - can 'work, ultimately, against the whole notion of a customer loyalty programme' by devaluing the brand. Schemes such as the Mobil-Argos tie-up may not devalue the brand, adds Taylor, but they can easily be copied. Inflation of the currency, of the type that led, in part, to the eventual demise of Green Shield stamps, may then follow. Mobil, which says it was first into the market with the plastic 'swipe' card, rather than tokens or stamps, confirms Taylor's view. 'It's like shooting at a moving target,' says Mobil's spokesman Roger Newstead. Premier Points gave an initial boost to sales, but competitors pinched the idea within a short time and now it is hard to identify to what extent the scheme has increased or maintained those sales, he says. Mobil knows it needs some sort of promotion all the time, otherwise sales drop. Clearly the danger is that competitors engage in what Taylor describes as a 'zero sum game' where everybody will be 'spending money on programmes just to keep the playing field level, rather than to have an advantage'.</p>

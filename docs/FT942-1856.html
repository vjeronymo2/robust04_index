			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water Even after yesterday's 3 per cent fall in its shares, Wessex remains one of the two best performing water companies since privatisation. Since it again delivered the largest dividend increase in the sector, some outperformance is not surprising. As well as having merits as a utility - operating costs on the water side have fallen two years running in real terms - the joint venture with Waste Management International appears to be delivering the promised growth. Earnings per share rose fractionally even after adjusting for the rights issue made 18 months ago to fund diversification. Wessex will have to drive the waste side hard if it is to avoid diluting earnings in the years to come. By 1998 there could be 160m shares in issue, against little over 100m at privatisation. With Pounds 65m rights money still in the kitty - and more to come as other classes of capital convert into ordinary shares - Wessex and its partner do not have to rely on organic growth. Yet little more than Pounds 10m was spent on waste acquisitions last year, which underlines that attractive assets are thin on the ground. If Wessex does manage to spend its money wisely, the stock market will have to decide how to value a combined water and waste group. Putting this year's likely waste earnings on an average market multiple makes Wessex's interest in the venture worth about Pounds 1 a share. Floating a portion of the venture would be the best way of putting such valuations to the test, as well as lifting the veil a little more on exactly where the growth is coming from.</p>

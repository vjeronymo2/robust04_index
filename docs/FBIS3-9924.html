			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections,  scheduled for 20 March 1994. Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential  candidate for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front-Democratic Convergence-National Revolutionary Movement,  FMLN-CD-MNR, coalition, said in a speech to the Salvadoran  Chamber of Construction Industry that the country needs a policy  to give every Salvadoran a dignified home. "We believe more  emphasis should be placed on providing the necessary funds for  low-cost homes," he said. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in  Spanish 0300 GMT 16 Feb 94)    Zamora said the government's indifference toward the  investigation of corruption cases proves its complicity. He  said the government "is guilty of a cover-up in connection with  all these cases" because "the committee appointed to  investigate" the cases did nothing. Zamora said the U.S.  Congress decision to freeze $20 million in aid is a result of  the current Salvadoran Government's failure to investigate the  cases and punish the culprits. (San Salvador Canal Doce  Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 23 Feb 94)    The FMLN Womens Group on 23 February presented their  platform  to the leftist coalition, demanding greater participation in the  party and the government, free health care and education, and  equal pay for equal work. The women proposed the creation of a  women's ministry to protect women's interests. (San Salvador  Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 24 Feb 94)    All the presidential candidates' platforms include promises  to solve water, health, education, crime, and economic problems.  Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, candidate Armando  Calderon Sol stressed the peace achieved by the Cristiani  Government will be consolidated when his ticket is elected.  Christian Democratic Party, PDC, candidate Fidel Chavez Mena  said he will change the direction of the economy, freeze prices,  and eliminate the Value Added Tax. FMLN-CD-MNR coalition  candidate Ruben Zamora said farmers will have access to credit,  all the villages will have potable water, crime will be  controlled, and the government will fight corruption. National  Conciliation Party, PCN, candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia  claimed the most important projects were carried out during the  PCN administration; adding the same will be done during his  administration. National Solidarity Movement candidate Edgardo  Rodriguez Engelhardt said he supports a decentralized government  with more local autonomy. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in  Spanish 21 Feb 94 p 3)    Approximately 26,000 demobilized Armed Forces members  threatened to obstruct the upcoming elections if a series of  irregularities concerning the payment of their compensations is  not corrected soon. They claimed the government played a dirty  trick because their documents state they have abandoned their  posts. This has caused great discontent among the demobilized  men, who are prepared to take up arms again and fight for their  rights. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT  24 Feb 94)    The UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, reported today  400,000 Salvadoran citizens will not vote in the 20 March  elections although their names appear on the electoral lists.  Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Luis Zaldivar questioned  the veracity of the report because, in his opinion, no one can  predict how many people will vote in the next general elections.  The voters' registration list shows 2.7 million people are  registered to vote, but the Onusal report said the list should  have been purged because it includes people who live abroad and  others who never showed up to claim their electoral card.

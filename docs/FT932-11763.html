			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Canberra gives TV rights to outsiders THE Australian government yesterday awarded the right to subscription television licences to two new and relatively unknown media interests. The powerful consortium most widely expected to win, led by media magnate Kerry Packer and US-based Rupert Murdoch, was beaten on price. The winning bidders were YCOM Pty, which offered ADollars 177m (Pounds 82.3m), and Hi Vision, which tendered ADollars 212m. About 50 tenders were received for the two four-channel licences. The winning bid will now require the approval of the competition regulator, the Trade Practices Commission. Australia's subscription television policy allows for three satellite-delivered services. The third licence, with two channels, has been reserved for the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The bidding process was criticised for supposedly allowing highly speculative bids from groups that did not have strong financial backing or enough experience in operating television networks. The communications department had decided the richest bids would automatically win the rights. The companies will have 30 days to pay and obtain the licences. Failure to raise the equity will allow the government to grant the rights to the next highest bidders. Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, said the department had very strange bidding rules. He said he did not expect the two winning companies to operate viable subscription television services.</p>

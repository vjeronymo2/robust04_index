			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Future will test wisdom of miner's gamble - Nikki Tait assesses Western Mining's ADollars 1bn link with Alcoa's bauxite/alumina business A senior mining analyst was in a dither yesterday following Australia's Western Mining Corporation's decision to buy into Alcoa's international bauxite/alumina-related operations at an effective cost of about ADollars 1bn (USDollars 700m). 'I'm trying to decide whether we're positive or negative about this deal. 'There's a list of pluses, and a list of minuses,' he said. Not surprisingly, WMC, one of the nation's largest mining companies, is altogether less equivocal. It says that the deal, announced yesterday, is an important step towards moving WMC from being a predominantly Australian company, to becoming more of a 'global player'. It will also enable the company to expand and to diversify a core business and partly shift it from raw commodity production towards proprietary products. It will also allow WMC to expand with a US partner it knows well. The last element is incontrovertible. In the 1950s, several Australian companies - including WMC - realised that bauxite deposits in the Darling Range in Western Australia could form the basis of an integrated aluminium business. Alcoa, the US company, was brought in to provide industrial expertise and, in 1961, Alcoa of Australia was formed. WMC has over the years bought out its fellow Australian partners, so that its current interest in Alcoa of Australia stands at 48.25 per cent. Alcoa, the US parent, holds 51 per cent. It has been a successful venture. Alcoa of Australia has become the world's largest alumina producer and - in spite of oversupply in the world aluminium industry - made an after-tax profit (before abnormals) of ADollars 389.4m last year; an increase of ADollars 130.5m over the previous period. Sales were ADollars 2.19bn. These results, assisted by a decision to extend the Wagerup Refinery, largely explained a sharp increase in WMC's own profits during the six months to end-December, the first half of its financial year. The latest proposal is that WMC and Alcoa should put all their international bauxite, alumina, and alumina-based chemicals interests into one 'enterprise,' and share them on a 40:60 basis respectively. The amalgam of businesses, made up of Alcoa of Australia and Alcoa's other international bauxite/alumina-based interests, would account for about 25 per cent of the world's alumina production and have total sales of about USDollars 2.7bn. To effect the deal, WMC would buy into Alcoa's other bauxite/alumina-related interests. The 'ballpark' cost, according to Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, would be about ADollars 1bn, but this would not just comprise cash. WMC would pass about 9 per cent of Alcoa of Australia to Alcoa of the US, reducing its own interest to 39.25 per cent. It would then pay a further USDollars 360m to the US group. WMC would also expect to contribute about USDollars 120m of working capital, on a short-term basis, to the new group. The deal would be completed by the end of 1994. Although WMC's balance sheet is modestly geared, the mining company plans to raise ADollars 720m to help fund the transaction. That will be done via a one-for-eight rights issue at ADollars 5.80 a share. The problem for some analysts yesterday was that WMC proposes to give up 9 per cent of an established low-cost producer for a larger, 40 per cent interest in operations which, on historical data, appear to be lower quality (in terms of return on shareholder funds, for example). Alcoa's bauxite/alumina-related interests are numerous, but include: the Point Comfort alumina refinery in Texas; 55 per cent of the Suriname alumina refinery, plus a Suriname smelter and hydroelectric facility; 50 per cent of a Jamaican alumina refinery; 55 per cent of a refinery in Brazil; Alcoa Steamships; Alcoa's alumina-based chemicals division, which comprises 20 plants worldwide and had revenues last year of USDollars 500m. According to figures provided to WMC by Alcoa, these operations saw revenues peak at USDollars 2.32bn in 1990, falling to USDollars 1.16bn in 1993. Earnings before interest and tax went from USDollars 527m in 1990, to USDollars 81m in 1992, and then edged up to USDollars 88m last year. 'But that's the historic view,' admits Mr Chris Bain, senior research manager for resources at ANZ McCaughan. 'Everything depends on the growth outlook for the Alcoa businesses. You could argue that WMC is getting in on the ground-floor of the alumina-chemicals business. It's just hard to know what the prospects are.' WMC admits the deal is dilutive at current alumina prices. In terms of 1993 earnings, the loss of 9 per cent of Alcoa of Australia's profits - which works out at USDollars 35m - would be exactly offset by the contribution of 40 per cent of the acquired businesses' earnings. However, the rights issue means that once the deal is completed there will be more WMC shares in issue. Confronted by these analysts' anxieties, Mr Morgan points out that it is the future which matters. The deal will give the company more leverage in the alumina market, increasing its share of production capacity by one third to 3.9m tonnes per annum or 10 per cent of world production. The entry into alumina-based chemicals is 'an important element' of the transaction. 'It's a business with high growth rate, high margins,' he says.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the five railroads GAO visited, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (``CNW'') was found to have the most effective internal control procedures for updating injury and accident information prior to reporting to FRA. CNW's procedures involved extensive communication between its safety office, which reports accident information to FRA, and other departments within the railroad. CNW also centralized its reporting responsibilities and updated injury and accident information before reporting to FRA. Specifically, (a) CNW's safety office and claim office met once a month to compare lists of injuries; (b) CNW used a ``15-day'' report (this report accurately disclosed the severity of each injury) to update the status of each injury before reporting it to FRA; (c) for train accidents, initial field estimates of property damage were compared with repair shop estimates before submitting a report to FRA; and (d) CNW required a final accident report to its safety office within 20 days following the accident to allow for further updating of information on the accident/incident report and the identification of additional reportable events prior to filing a report with FRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the ANPRM, comments were solicited as to whether FRA should require railroads to implement specific internal control procedures to assure proper reporting or simply establish strict performance standards and hold railroads accountable for accuracy of the submitted data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters did not support mandated internal control procedures, primarily because each railroad is different organizationally. Since internal control procedures would be adapted to the organizational structures of individual railroads, most commenters felt it would be unreasonable to prescribe a rigid set of rules governing the audit function for universal application. Instead, it was proposed that each railroad submit their own internal control procedures to FRA for review and subsequent approval. FRA would then have the ability to audit the railroad based upon the railroad's own operating plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One labor association suggested that internal control procedures that ensure accurate information should be mandated by FRA. It was proposed that this could be accomplished by requiring the railroads to update all initial information within a certain time period;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> after filing the initial monthly report, the railroad would be required to supplement any and all changes that existed at the time of filing the initial report within a specified time frame. It was also recommended that railroads should file an annual report that would supplement each monthly report and that the railroads' reporting information be crosschecked with accident data obtained from the Railroad Retirement Board and the Travelers Insurance Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

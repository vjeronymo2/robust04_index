			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDS RUN INTO PORTUGAL AT HOUSTON, LOSE, 5-2  </P> <P> Mark Portugal is two different pitchers.  </P> <P> There is the one who pitches like a Hall of Fame candidate in the Astrodome.  And the one who can't get .200 hitters out on the road.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the slumping Cincinnati Reds, they had to face Portugal at  Houston Wednesday night.  </P> <P> While the Astros pecked away at Danny Jackson (5-6) and four relievers,  Portugal (10-10) shut the Reds out for six innings en route to a 5-2 victory.  </P> <P> With Juan Agosto choking off a rally in the eighth inning, Portugal improved  his record at home to 7-2. In his past 40 innings in the Astrodome, he has  yielded only six earned runs On the road, he is 3-8.  </P> <P> The Reds retained their 4 1/2-game lead over the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Just eight days ago, the Reds were seven games ahead of the Dodgers and the San  Francisco Giants. Cincinnati has gained half a game on the Giants, but the  Dodgers have closed some ground.  </P> <P> The Reds' skid can be traced to the failure of veteran left-handers Tom  Browning and Jackson.  </P> <P> Browning, beaten Tuesday night by the Giants, is 1-3 in his last five starts  with an earned-run average of 8.78.  </P> <P> Jackson failed to make it through the third inning, giving up three runs and  seven hits. In the last four starts, Jackson has given up 28 hits and 16 runs  -- 14 earned -- for a 7.00 ERA in 18 innings.  </P> <P> "What you really need at this time of the season is consistent starting  pitching," Red Manager Lou Piniella said. "Right now, we have one really  pitching well, Jose Rijo."  </P> <P> Rijo (12-7) has a 4-1 record and an ERA of 1.13 for his last six starts.  </P> <P> "What we need," pitching coach Stan Williams said, "is three other guys  pitching the way Jose is. The trouble is, where do you find them? We need some  big efforts from some of these guys." DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS AND DUKE'S ELECTION  </P> <P> According to Jason Berry in Opinion ("A Master Racist Jumps Parties to Land in  the Louisiana Legislature," Feb. 26), former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, now  Louisiana state legislator David Duke has learned the strategic necessity of  political deception. His National Assn. of White People News advises that since  the public regards white supremacy as immoral, racist activists should conceal  their opinions and only talk about racial differences. Duke characterizes his  group as a "civil-rights organization."  </P> <P> In the same section of The Times, former Reagan Administration war planner, now  right-wing think-tank member Fred C. Ikle declares that the Reagan  Administration had us on a fast road to democracy in Central America when the  Congress interfered by stopping military funds for the Contras and now may even  cut military funds for El Salvador ("Sell-Out in Central America," Op-Ed Page).  </P> <P> Ikle is more circumspect than Duke, but if he were equally frank he might  advise that since the public regards terrorism, death squads, and massacres as  immoral, war advocates should be careful to speak only of the fast track to  democracy.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H. FORTHMAN  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Italian rail deal raises wage cost fears Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister, has again stirred up controversy by intervening to avoid industrial action by a maverick transport union, at the risk of provoking increased salary demands from other employees. Mr Fiori struck an informal deal on bonus pay with Comu, the Italian train drivers' union, at the end of last week, averting a strike which threatened to disrupt rail traffic on the busiest holiday weekend. The accord provoked a sharp reaction from Italy's larger unions, and has raised fears that it will be difficult to rein in labour costs as the government's economic team has demanded when the Ferrovie dello Stato, the state-owned company which runs the railway system, begins formal negotiations with its 140,000 employees in September. Last month, Mr Fiori waded into the dispute between Alitalia, the state airline, and cabin staff, by announcing an inquiry into the failure of the company's management to foresee wildcat strike action by a small breakaway union. An accord was eventually reached on radical restructuring plans in spite of Mr Fiori's intervention, which management feared would undermine their efforts. In the wake of the Comu deal, stationmasters have called strikes for August 21 and September 10. The FS has estimated the cost of the informal deal at L70bn (Pounds 29m) for the 20,000 train drivers, rising to nearly L400bn if the company is forced to concede similar bonuses to other staff. The FS yesterday refused official comment, pointing out merely that Mr Fiori's intervention was 'anomalous' given the FS's shareholder was not the Transport Ministry, but the Treasury - which, under Mr Lamberto Dini, had been pushing for a strict line on wage negotiations. Mr Fiori, a member of the far right coalition member, the National Alliance, said last week that the agreement with Comu would 'commit' the FS to pay the bonus to the drivers from October 1994. The FS believes the accord is not legally binding, but is still worried about the political precedent which has been set. Doubt has also been cast on the necessity for such concessions. The state railway claims earlier industrial action by the union affected less than half of rail services, with inter-city services running normally. Leaders of the main union federations have also criticised the deal, pointing out that their members can hardly be expected to support the government's tough economic objectives if ministers grant individual increases to single categories of workers.</p>

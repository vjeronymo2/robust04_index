			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in </F> Corfu; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] The European Union summit in Corfu has ended in  a major crisis. [passage omitted] Jean-Luc Dehaene made a  statement after the Corfu summit. He remains a candidate and  (?takes note of) the British veto. Here is his statement  recorded by our special correspondent in Corfu:    [Begin Dehaene recording] I can see that Great Britain  opposed my election, not for personal or national reasons, but  for reasons of principles. In order not to make the work of the  German presidency more difficult, I will not make any more  statements about the issue of the presidency until the German  presidency organizes the special summit.    I am disappointed for Europe today. However, I am calm about  the whole situation. Indeed, I did not put myself up as a  candidate. At the request of some colleagues, I was and I remain  available, if necessary, if a consensus is reached. However, I  am not desperate. As I have said on several occasions over the  last few days, the results of the European elections in Belgium,  and especially in Flanders, have reinforced my desire as prime  minister to achieve all of the government's program. I am  convinced that it will transpire at the end of my mandate that I  will get the support of voters to devote myself and commit  myself to many more years at the service of Belgium and Europe.

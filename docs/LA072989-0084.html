			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIRING BIAS AGAINST LEGAL ALIENS CALLED WIDESPREAD  </P> <P> More than half a million employers follow a "pattern of discrimination" in  their refusal to hire legal aliens and first-generation Americans for fear of  contravening recent changes in immigration laws, the U.S. Civil Rights  Commission charged Friday.  </P> <P> The commission reviewed a report by the General Accounting Office on the  Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986, which prohibits employers from  hiring illegal aliens.  </P> <P> The law requires employees to provide proof of citizenship or legal status in  the United States. But based on an employer survey conducted by the GAO,  employers are discriminating against potential employees who only look or sound  foreign, the commission said.  </P> <P> According to the survey, 16% of the employers said they had begun using new  methods of screening applicants for jobs since the immigration law was  implemented. Ten percent said they hired only U.S. citizens, and 7% said they  asked for documents establishing legal status only from applicants who looked  or sounded foreign. More than 80% of those reporting that they had taken these  precautions said they feared the possibility of sanctions.  </P> <P> "We think the survey points to a pattern, if not a widespread pattern, of  discrimination," said commission spokesman John Eastman, adding that Hispanics  and Asians are the two groups most frequently discriminated against.  </P> <P> Eastman said the commission will ask the GAO to provide more data on  discriminatory practices. If this data reveals widespread patterns of  discrimination, it could lead to a change in the immigration law, including a  provision that would remove employer sanctions, Eastman said.  </P></p>

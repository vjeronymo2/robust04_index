			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salah Sabir] </F>   [Text] The Research Center for International and Political  Development has organized a seminar on the points of agreement  and difference between three major currents within the Islamic  movement. These currents are the Muslim Brotherhood, the radical  Islamic groups (al-Jihad current), and al-Azhar.    The differences between these three currents were pinpointed  regarding their stands on the Copts, the class distinctions  between the leaders and cadres in these three currents, the  state and social institutions, relations with the outside world,  and the organizational peculiarities of each of these currents.    Regarding the differences, some of those who took part in  the  discussions were of the opinion that there are no differences  between the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist Muslim  currents and that what the Muslim Brotherhood is currently  claiming--that it rejects violence and accepts pluralism and  democracy--is a tactical stand. This stand is based on the  principle of dissimulation [al-taqiyah] which they adopted from  the Shiite doctrine. Those who expressed this viewpoint were  Dr. Majdi 'Allam, secretary of the National Democratic Party's  youth branch in al-Jizah, and Major General Fu'ad 'Allam, who  noted that the idea of accusing society of being blasphemous is  being copied from what the Brotherhood's youth wing did in 1946.  Shaykh al-Banna did not reject it, although he did point out  that it is not in their interest to revive these ideas at this  point in time, before the Muslim Brotherhood has taken control  of the state, and he said that they should not provoke conflicts  with the state while they are weak. These same ideas were  revived by Sayyid Qutub during the early sixties. He leaked  them from prison and they reached the Guidance Bureau. Qutub's  stand was the same as that of the former imam. Therefore, there  are no differences among the various groups, nor between them  and the Muslim Brotherhood. The apparent differences are  personal ones over leadership, or because one group indulges in  infighting with another, or for reasons dealing with the  weakness or strength of some group or the availability or  absence of funding for it.    Others believe that a distinction should be made between two  things: The political approach and the actual behavior of the  Islamic groups, with all their differences. Regarding the  Brotherhood's political approach, we find that much of it is  blasphemous. As for their current behavior, we find that they  have moved away from violence. The Brotherhood and al-Azhar  agree with the other groups with respect to their political  lines, but differences remain in their actual behavior. Those  holding this opinion were Dr. Jihad 'Awdah, head of the Research  Center for International and Political Development; Dr. 'Ali  Fahmi; and Alain Rousion [last two names as transliterated],  head of the Sidage Center.    On the other hand, the points of agreement between the  Islamic movement's three currents were spotlighted, such as  their stand on implementing the Islamic shari'ah, the rule of  non-Muslims, assessing the West's political approach and  economic dealings, and on general social and cultural factors.  The three currents agree on implementing the shari'ah, setting  up an Islamic caliphate, disdaining Muslim rule over  non-Muslims, and being hostile to the West (by using hostile  slogans), and on having economic dealings with the West as long  as it is in the interest of the Muslims. The seminar concluded  by proposing many ideas. The most important of these were:    -- Finding a link between the growth of the Islamic  movements  in the Islamic world and funding coming from the oil-producing  countries. This explains the reason why there is a similarity  between the Islamic groups' thinking and the Pakistani and  Wahabi ideas.    -- By dealing with religious violence solely through  oppression without looking into the social and economic issues,  the state encourages increased religious extremism. Ambassador  Tahsin Bashir supported this idea.    -- Al-Azhar does not disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood  and  the Islamic groups on the level of jurisprudence, only on the  mechanism for relations with others.    -- The concept of al-shari'ah is vague and general. There is  no such thing as al-shari'ah, but there is jurisprudence.  Whoever talks about al-shari'ah is talking about a defined and  strict regime that incorporates some ideas of jurisprudence and  ignores others. It uses the former to govern with. This leads  to the establishment of a theocracy which, according to  jurisprudence itself, is contrary to true Islam. This notion  was confirmed by Dr. 'Ali Fahmi.</p>

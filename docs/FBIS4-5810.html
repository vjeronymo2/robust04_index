			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Nearly 70 percent of the  nation's prefectural and major city governments have loosened  controls on land prices and deregulated land transactions, the  National Land Agency said Thursday [14 April].    A total of 39 local governments -- 29 of Japan's 47  prefectures and 10 of its 12 ordinance-designated cities --  eased such controls as of April 1, agency officials said.    Five or six local governments are expected to follow suit by  the end of May, the officials said.    All prefectures, except Aomori in northeast Japan, and all  12  ordinance-designated cities established systems to monitor local  land prices after they experienced skyrocketing prices in the  booming economy in the 1980s.    They have obliged those who trade land of more than a  certain  acreage to report the transaction to the local authority.    Such relaxations followed an agency instruction last  November  that local governments deregulate land transactions to help  stimulate the sluggish economy.    The local governments may have believed that drops in land  prices indicated strict controls were no longer needed, they  said. A government report released last month said Japan's land  prices in 1993 dropped for the third consecutive year.    In most cases, only those who buy or sell 300 square meters  or more are obliged to report the transactions to the local  government, while the previous requirement applied to 100 square  meters or more.    Gunma Prefecture northwest of Tokyo is the only prefecture  that scrapped all prefectural areas under such control.    It is expected that more than 10 local governments will not  ease controls, including Nagano Prefecture, where land prices  may rise in line with the hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympics,  they said.</p>

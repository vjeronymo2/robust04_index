			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Magnum force Unilever's results may have failed to set the City alight yesterday. But nothing was going to deter outgoing chairman Sir Michael Angus from celebrating his last annual press conference in inimitable knockabout style. First, there was the teasing build-up to a showing of a 'banned' video. It turned out to be the commercial for 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]'. The vegetable-fat spread's promotion - depicting a truly sickly yuppie couple getting back together over a cake - was banned from British television because it fell foul of EC advertising regulations. On reflection, Angus admitted, viewers had some reason to be glad that the Independent Television Commission had kept it off their screens. Then followed a story about his 'stimulating' staircase encounter with a Swedish model who features in another Unilever campaign. Finally, Angus regaled everyone with a collection of his favourite limericks before repairing to the hospitality suite to do battle with a large and sticky 'Magnum' ice cream. It will be interesting to see if he keeps up this sort of behaviour when he takes over as president of the CBI.</p>

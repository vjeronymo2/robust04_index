			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: The Japan that insists it can say No says Yes - Satisfaction in Washington and embarrassment in Tokyo at cell phone deal The young sales lady at the IDO Plaza in central Tokyo reached over the counter to pick up a mobile phone from a row of nearly a dozen, mostly Japanese, models the company offers. She chose a Motorola Microtel. 'If you are thinking of subscribing to a cellular phone service, we have two systems you can choose from,' she said, brandishing the Motorola. Whatever the complaints about uneven access to Japan's cellular phones market the US may have had, in the shops where Motorola's handsets sit side by side with those of Japanese makers, the trans-Pacific argument over mobile phones that has become a US crusade to open Japan's markets, seemed worlds away. The Japanese government has tried to keep the latest bilateral bickering strictly in the hands of private business. But the agreement reached over the weekend dashed any hopes that in the world of US-Japanese trade anything that promises as much profitable growth and fierce competition as Japan's mobile phones market can be left strictly free of government intervention. The agreement between Motorola and IDO, the Japanese mobile phone operator has, for now, satisfied both the US government's, and Motorola's, contention that greater investment by IDO in Motorola's system was needed to ensure fair access to the Japanese mobile phones market. The US side has hailed the agreement as a model that could be used to resolve other bilateral trade disputes. For US negotiators who have been angered by Japan's refusal to agree to measurable indicators in opening the country's markets to imports, the IDO-Motorola deal contains just about everything they have been calling for. There are concrete figures - IDO has consented to build 159 additional base stations for Motorola's mobile phones systems in the Tokyo-Nagoya region and reallocate 1.5MHz of radio frequency to the US system. There is a time scale - IDO has consented to begin operating those additional base stations and provide coverage to 95 per cent of the population in its region by the end of fiscal 1995. And, most important, there is a government pledge to ensure that IDO carries out its commitments. The Japanese government agreed to monitor IDO's progress in fulfilling those goals and to 'take all available measures to ensure compliance'. 'We think (the agreement) ends a long 10 years of frustration,' Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, said yesterday. 'We believe that both Motorola and IDO are pleased with it and that it is good news for the Japanese consumer.' In Japan, however, officials have found themselves desperately fighting any suggestion that the government has caved in to US demands. Having resisted just a month ago US calls for the setting of numerical indicators to measure the openness of its markets and having underlined, to wide public acclaim, the 'need to say No' at times to US demands, the government appears to have turned around completely and swallowed precisely those demands. The government has tried to pretend that its involvement was limited to merely giving its stamp of approval to a private business agreement. Mr Takenori Kanzaki, the minister of posts and telecommunications, stressed that the agreement did not represent Japanese acceptance of US demands for objective criteria in opening up the country's markets. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, was yesterday also obliged to defend the Japanese position, stating that Japan had not bowed to US pressure. 'It is not that we yielded to US pressure, but the agreement was reached after private level talks made headway,' he said. Their defence of the Japanese position reflects the extent of public concern in Japan that the mobile phones agreement has sent the wrong signal to the US. The fear in Japan is that not only has the agreement confirmed US suspicions that trade can be 'managed' by applying sufficient pressure on the Japanese government in the form of threats of sanctions, it has also provided the US with a strong case for proceeding in a similar manner on other bilateral trade issues. Despite protests to the contrary, the Japanese bureaucracy's central role in the negotiations is well recognised. 'I thought it was charming to sit in the ministry of posts and telecommunications and to hear that the government was not involved,' Mr Mondale said yesterday. Neither has IDO managed to hide its unhappiness with the deal. 'The agreement is not all positive,' Mr Toshio Enomoto, vice president of IDO said in reference to the enormous capital investment the company is being forced to make in Motorola equipment - up to Y60bn (Pounds 380m) from a planned Y27bn. And while Japanese officials were at pains to explain that the agreement would not set a precedent for other bilateral trade deals, the US side is already pointing to the deal as a model for others to come. By showing what can be achieved when decisions are made at high government levels, when the two sides get practical and results-oriented, the agreement provides a lesson for 'how to proceed on other matters', Mr Mondale said. If that is the lesson the US learned from the agreement, Japanese concerns that it has set a risky precedent could prove well founded.</p>

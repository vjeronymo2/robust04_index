			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian leader and former Soviet Foreign </F> Minister Eduard Shevardnadze by Giulietto Chiesa in Tbilisi;  date not given: "Those Were the Days, in the Kremlin With  Gorbachev"]    [Text] A marathon session in parliament, which has lasted  until the evening, has just ended. It has borne a closer  resemblance to a brawl than to a debate. I watched him at  length as he listened: motionless, impassive, taking the floor  briefly just to clarify a point now and again in his monotonous,  colorless voice, as if he hoped it would have a pacifying  effect. It is late evening by the time that, surrounded by a  group of swaggering youths with bulging jackets and submachine  guns that do nothing for the line of their double-breasted  suits, he reaches his office on the fourth floor of the former  Institute of Marxist Leninism.    [Chiesa] Eduard Amvrosyevich Shevardnadze, are you satisfied  with your parliament?    [Shevardnadze] (laughing heartily) We are learning. What do  you expect? Demagogy rules the day, but you cannot make the  transition from totalitarianism to democracy without going  through this stage.    [Chiesa] You were a leader in the USSR in 1989, in the days  of the first relatively democratic parliament in Soviet history.  Do you see any difference, any progress?    [Shevardnadze] There is greater pluralism, but apart from  that I would not say that we have come much further.    [Chiesa] What balance can be drawn from the two years that  have gone by since your triumphal return to Tbilisi?    [Shevardnadze] It is a complicated balance. I am worried  because we have not solved the main problem, that of the  territorial integrity of the country. The economic situation is  extremely serious. As you have seen, we have a very poor  standard of living. On the other hand, we have managed to avoid  the worst, civil war on a major scale.    [Chiesa] Do you really regard this danger as a thing of the  past?    [Shevardnadze] We shall have serious problems, of course,  but  there will not be a civil war. And we have established a lot of  relations with the outside world; we have emerged from our  isolation.    [Chiesa] The Shevardnadze effect ...    [Shevardnadze] No, I have merely made a contribution. It was  very important that they should recognize us and help us. The  people here have reached starvation point. If it were not for  outside aid, from Russia, Kazakhstan, and the European  countries, we should now be facing the threat of physical  extinction.    [Chiesa] Nevertheless, opposition to you personally in  parliament is very tough. They accuse you of losing Abkhazia,  and what besides?    [Shevardnadze] A lot of these youngsters just want seats to  warm. From time to time I am tempted to go home and leave them  to it. Then I think to myself: They are my people. I cannot  just abandon them. I would like to make way for the younger  generation, but they are just the offspring of the city  intelligentsia. First we have to build a solid foundation for  those to come. There are now more than 100 parties, all  microscopic, without power. That is why I decided to promote  the "Citizens' Union," a movement that sets out to unite the  responsible forces. Then we shall approve the constitution and  organize fresh elections. I am also trying to ensure that a  strong opposition party takes shape ...    [Chiesa] A two-party system?    [Shevardnadze] Yes, two or three parties, but serious ones.    [Chiesa] You are now president of parliament and head of  state. Are you aiming for a presidential republic?    [Shevardnadze] Yes. For strong presidential powers and a  strong parliament to counterbalance them.    [Chiesa] You have your eye on what is happening in Moscow,  where the only powers, however, are presidential ...    [Shevardnadze] Yeltsin wanted a constitution that would  guarantee the integrity of the state, and he got it. Perhaps he  failed to deliver democratic guarantees. I shall bear other  people's mistakes in mind.    [Chiesa] You have chosen Yeltsin and the Moscow democrats as  your allies. What will happen if there is a changing of the  guard in Moscow?    [Shevardnadze] In spite of all the difficulties, Boris  Yeltsin still has great potential. If he manages to remain in  office for his full term, I think that people will have time to  understand democracy better.    [Chiesa] Tell me about your trip to the United States,  where they are trying to remedy the decisions taken over the  last few years. Did you get the impression that they understand  what is happening in the former Soviet Union?    [Shevardnadze] They are analyzing the situation. I cannot  say that they understand it fully, but often we ourselves do not  fully understand what is happening here. I told them that a  reversion to the cold war between Russia and the United States  must be prevented at all costs, because it would bring the most  reactionary forces in Russia onto the scene, and that would be a  catastrophe.    [Chiesa] But I have the impression that there are some  circles in the United States that want to cut Russia even  further down to size.    [Shevardnadze] Maybe, but I only met sensible people.    [Chiesa] Anyway, there is no talk of UN blue helmets in  Georgia.    [Shevardnadze] My view is that the Security Council cannot  declare itself helpless to act. The secretary general of the  United nations is a decent politician, but he has little  understanding of the problems of the Caucasus. The world at  large has little understanding of them, and when it becomes  aware of them it will be too late. It is worse than the Balkans  here.    [Chiesa] Anyway, the Americans will not be coming. Bill  Clinton has made that much clear. Would you agree to Russian  blue helmets?    [Shevardnadze] I have set out three alternative options:  firstly, the traditional scenario, involving several countries  including Russia, and it does not matter if Russia accounts for  30 percent of the peacekeeping force or more; secondly, a  Russian force under the auspices of the United Nations, although  I doubt that this will be acceptable to the Security Council,  and, thirdly, a request for Russian intervention, with observers  sent by the United Nations. If all three come to nothing, there  will be a war against Abkhazia.    [Chiesa] What about a UN force without Russians?    [Shevardnadze] No, it would make for confrontation between  Russia and the United Nations, and there would be war in any  case. There can be no final settlement of the dispute without  Russian involvement. Indeed, I now bitterly acknowledge the  mistake that I made when Abkhazia attacked and the Russians  said, "We will send our troops in and reestablish order." I  rejected their offer because I was convinced that we would be  able to defend Sukhumi by ourselves. It was a mistake; I should  have agreed.    [Chiesa] Have you ever regretted your decision to come back?    [Shevardnadze] I know I was crazy, but I knew what to  expect.  This is my country, and I want to share its fate.    [Chiesa] They say you have become religious ...    [Shevardnadze] I am a believer. I always have been deep  down, even though communist ideology forbade it.    [Chiesa] And how are your relations with Gorbachev?    [Shevardnadze] We phone each other, though relatively rarely  in recent times. I have always respected him. He is a great  man, a moving force behind all these changes. We have also had  our disagreements, but that does not diminish his merits.    [Chiesa] Of course, he was the one who changed your life.    [Shevardnadze] Yes. It came as a surprise. He called me and  announced that he was going to put my name forward for a high  foreign policy office, but he did not specify which. I objected  that I had no experience. What I really thought was that he  wanted to propose me as secretary to the central committee on  international policy, but the next day he called me back and  said distinctly, "We will propose a new office of major  importance to Andrey Gromyko." I repeated that I thought it  would be a mistake and that ministries such as defense, foreign  affairs, and the KGB could be held exclusively by Russians. I  added that I could not merely play an executive role. But he  had already spoken to the whole politburo, and the decision had  in fact already been taken.    [Chiesa] With hindsight, how do you judge that decision?    [Shevardnadze] I remember that the first time I went to the  ministry, I was on my own. I had never been there before. I  told the board: "Gromyko was like a great ship sailing the  ocean, and in comparison Eduard Shevardnadze was just a dinghy,  but a dinghy with an engine." They all laughed. That is how I  began. And difficult decisions were taken, on Afghanistan, on  tactical missiles, on strategic missiles. In the beginning it  was easy, then the attacks began and we had to come out  fighting. But Shevardnadze's handwriting was already clearly  visible in those decisions. It was rather a thrill to see that  what you said one day had actually happened the day after. The  West met us halfway. Those were great, historic times. They  were the best years of my life.</p>

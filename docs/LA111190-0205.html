			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNHIP AND UNFAZED;  </P> <P> EDIE BRICKELL'S SENSITIVE SONGS WITH THE NEW BOHEMIANS MAY BE TOO SWEET FOR  SOME TASTES, BUT HEY, WHAT IS COOL, ANYWAY?  </P> <P> "I don't think it's uncool to write about squirrels!" protested Edie Brickell  -- gently and decidedly -- when asked if it ever struck her that a song like  "Oak Creek Bra," about a woman in her brassiere on her front porch watching  rural rodents darting across the road in front of station wagons, might be  perceived in some urban rock camps as, well, a little unhip.  </P> <P> Writing about squirrels isn't the only potentially uncool thing that Brickell,  leader of the Texas-based band the New Bohemians, has gotten away with. She has  a guileless persona of the sort that a lot of older bohemians love to hate --  charmingly introverted and innocent, apparently unaffected and given to writing  sweet, sketchy, sensitive verse about life and rocky relationships outside the  big city.  </P> <P> This unlikeliest of rock stars is an odd combination of gracefulness and  gangliness, still as much the archetypal poetic college girl as she seemed  before her surprise Top 10 hit single, "What I Am," took off two years ago.  </P> <P> Two and a half million albums, tours with Don Henley and Bob Dylan, and a  rumored relationship with Paul Simon ("He's a great person and a great friend")  later, she still hasn't lost her Texas accent or learned how to schmooze.  </P> <P> Asked how playing big halls on the last tour was a change from Dallas clubs,  she answers: "Well, it's not as hot."  </P> <P> In both settings, her seemingly un-self-conscious performing style remained the  same, with a stance so famous it's already the stuff of parody: Smile like the  Mona Lisa, sing standing with one bare foot planted firmly on the ground and  the other dangling crooked somewhere in the air behind, maintain that  uncomfortable-looking, peg-legged position for an entire song.  </P> <P> That fame hasn't changed Brickell much should come as a comfort to those who  relate to her songs as heartfelt and unusually open or unguarded.  </P> <P> There are those who don't, of course; the critical community is divided between  avid fans and cynical detractors. Spy magazine's October issue, in a trend  piece titled  </P> <P> "Innocents Amok," grouped her in with Rickie Lee Jones, Suzanne Vega, Stevie  Nicks, the Roches and Joni Mitchell as part of their mythical "all-waif  chorale" -- a waif being someone whose deliberately childlike musical world  view, bare feet and berets Manhattan sophisticates don't buy.  </P> <P> New Bohemians guitarist Kenny Withrow hopes Brickell doesn't get typed as a  "diary act" -- that is, as one of those artists whose lyrics read a little too  much like a personal journal.  </P> <P> "I hope Edie's not lumped into that too much," said Withrow in a separate  interview. "Edie can be serious, and she's not just a little girl writing  little-girl tunes. She's smart, and she's definitely got it together, and she  can touch a lot of different subjects and emotions really well. . . . 'What I  Am' was kind of a quirky, identifiable thing that clicked, but quirkiness isn't  really what we're about."  </P> <P> Brickell, for her part, claims not to think about her image. She doesn't talk  to her fans too much or read mail about how her songs might have affected them,  worrying that "it might make me overly conscientious about what to write about,  if I take a poll about what people like, what they relate to and what they  don't."  </P> <P> One aspect of how she's perceived does annoy her, though -- being called shy.  </P> <P> "In general it's something that comes and goes and you can't really get a  handle on it," she said. "So I don't want to sit here and say, 'Yeah, I'm  really shy,' because with some people I am and with some people I'm not. And it  backs me into a corner; it means you're describing yourself somehow, and that's  limiting. It's never something you want to say about yourself anyway. It's  uncomfortable."  </P> <P> Brickell, 24, can seem generally uncomfortable in the interview setting. At  breakfast at a West Hollywood hotel  </P> <P> recently, while in town to shoot a video for the single "Mama Help Me," she was  able to finish her hot oatmeal with honey and Welch's grape juice (which she  asks for by brand name) fairly quickly, since her answers tended to be shorter  than the questions.  </P> <P> There were pauses where she thought long and hard for an answer, before  deciding that how her music hits people -- pro or con -- is something she  doesn't even want to ponder.  </P> <P> "I don't really want to draw attention to those kinds of things. I want to let  people think for themselves as far as what they see in the music and how they  relate to it, and not make any comment on what I want or don't want them to  see. . . . That's why I kind of edge around these questions."  </P> <P> If Brickell avoids self-consciousness as a rule, the other band members did  think long and hard about how they were perceived as a group before making  "Ghost of a Dog," their newly released effort.  </P> <P> The New Bohemians existed as a largely improvisational, jazzy, bluesy  instrumental outfit well before Brickell was coaxed -- under the influence of  Jack Daniels, she has recalled -- into joining them on a Dallas club stage one  night. They'd been trained at music schools and raised on Miles Davis and the  Dead; Brickell, by contrast, was a wholly inexperienced SMU art-major dropout  who'd never performed in public before that fateful evening.  </P> <P> So it was humbling when the record company insisted on appending Brickell's  name to the group's, and the producer of their debut replaced them with studio  musicians on some tracks, subduing their strong live sound in the process.  </P> <P> This time, said Withrow, "We definitely wanted to be taken a bit more seriously  . . . maybe even rock out a little. It would be nice to appeal with this album  to the college scene . . . people our age. I mean, hopefully we're representing  something of our generation."  </P> <P> Brickell, though, almost seems like a premature member of the thirtysomething  generation at times, so it's not hard to  </P> <P> imagine why the New Bohemians claim more baby-boomers than college-radio  hepcats as fans. It's easier to picture her as the stay-at-home-and-hearth,  poetry-by-the-fireside type in sweater and jeans than it is in her actual  occupation as pop star.  </P> <P> If she's an unlikely rocker, she seems like a probable pet owner if ever there  was one. The first album had her drawing of a cat on the cover, and the new one  -- pesky road squirrels and an occasional bird or cow aside -- is filled with  recurring canines, including the title dead one.  </P> <P> So the question begs itself. To paraphrase the Marx Brothers: Why a dog?  </P> <P> "I was writing a lot of the lyrics to my songs in my apartment with my door  open at night, and I could hear dogs barking, I guess," Brickell said. "Maybe  they just kinda subconsciously slipped through. It was the music  </P> <P> that was happening from the street and in my neighborhood when I was writing  this stuff. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Plus, I just think  there's something so innocent about 'em. Or, you know, they're like . . . just  sweet."  </P> <P> She doesn't own a dog, though. "I used to have a cat, but he got run over. I  can smile about it now, but it hurt a lot." That can be heavy, it's dutifully  noted. "It is heavy! It was rotten."  </P> <P> Brickell spends more time on "Ghost of a Dog" singing about rotten  relationships. At the end, she's "a prisoner of freedom" in "Me by the Sea," a  wonderful evocation of that universally weird feeling of cherishing solitude  and wishing for someone to share it with -- "I'm glad no one's here, just me by  the sea / But man, I wish I had a hand to hold."  </P> <P> You can almost hear Spy magazine's editors gagging. Still, Brickell's music  seems genuinely disingenuous, and her ability to write wisely about the bad  stuff of romance with a marked lack of anger toward the opposite sex makes her  unique and -- for post-modern romantics -- endearing.  </P> <P> "Well, anger's so much of a waste of time," Brickell said, "and unless I'm  super-angry, I don't feel the need to express it and put more of it out there  in any kind of form. I want people to feel moved, but not to get riled up  listening to somebody else's anger. I don't think that's much fun. Not for me,  anyway. I do want to hit some emotional corners, but there's enough anger in  the street and on the news. I don't want to put it on my stereo. . . . Unless  it's funny. If it's funny-angry, then I like it."  </P> <P> Mightn't she make herself a target by revealing so much?  </P> <P> "I don't feel vulnerable, really. It feels good to express things that I feel  like everybody feels. I don't think these songs are overly personal or show  anything but human feelings. I don't feel exposed or anything. I don't think  I'm that different from anybody else."  </P> <P> Having sold several million more records than the average anybody-else, though,  has success taught her any life lessons?  </P> <P> "I think it's important not to make room for any huge negative experiences.  Sometimes, I know, they just happen, but if I don't allow 'em much room in my  thoughts, then it makes it harder for 'em to creep into my life. That's  something I've learned."  </P> <P> And, perhaps sensing that that sounded a little too New Agey -- or maybe a  little too waif-like -- she added, "Maybe, though, I've just been really  lucky."  </P></p>

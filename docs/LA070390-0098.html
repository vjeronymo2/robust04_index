			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MCI's Credit Rating Lowered: Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a major credit-rating  agency, downgraded its rating on some of MCI Communication Corp.'s debt.  </P> <P> S&amp;P said it lowered by one notch its ratings on MCI's senior unsecured debt  and subordinated debt due to MCI's acquisition of Telecom USA Inc., another  long-distance phone company. "The acquisition, which will likely be financed  with borrowings of up to $1.5 billion, should initially result in a sharp  deterioration in the capital structure (of MCI) and correspondingly higher  fixed charges," S&amp;P said. Kathleen Keegan, a spokeswoman for MCI, said the  company was disappointed by the rating change.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIT CHIEFS SCRAMBLE TO FILL GAP AS AZTEC BUSES HALT SUDDENLY  </P> <P> Aztec Bus Lines, one of the county's oldest charter bus companies, has closed  without warning, causing a scramble among county transit officials Thursday to  replace the firm's buses on two East County routes used by about 600 people a  day.  </P> <P> The Spring Valley bus company has apparently filed for protection under the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code as a result of a National Labor Relations Board ruling  against the company that required it to rehire 75 former employees and pay back  wages reportedly amounting to several million dollars.  </P> <P> Aztec owner James Pike of Los Angeles did not return phone calls to his office  Thursday, but, according to a company letter faxed to county transit officials  Thursday morning, the firm has filed under Chapter 7 bankruptcy provisions and  is no longer in business.  </P> <P> The letter was the first formal notice county transit officials received about  the closure. A bus driver tipped off county officials late Wednesday that the  company was planning to close shortly before midnight.  </P> <P> The tip sent officials on a last-minute scramble to find replacement minibuses  for two East County routes serviced by Aztec through a contract with the  county.  </P> <P> "Needless to say, we were not real excited" about having to find replacements  on about four hours' notice, said Larry Watt, a principal transportation  specialist for the county.  </P> <P> One route, No. 864, carries passengers from Alpine to El Cajon, and the other,  No. 856, takes people from Cuyamaca Community College through Spring Valley and  Lemon Grove to the Marketplace at the Grove shopping center. Buses begin  picking up passengers as early as 4:57 a.m.  </P> <P> The county contacted Community Transit Services Inc., which also has a county  contract to provide bus service on other routes, and the company provided  replacement buses and drivers. Watt estimated that the two lines had 90% to 95%  service, and full service should be restored by this morning.  </P> <P> Aztec entered into a contract with the county in April, 1988. The contract runs  through June, 1991. Watt said Aztec had met its obligations under the contract  and had provided adequate service on the two East County lines.  </P> <P> Community Transit Services has agreed to a short-term, stopgap contract to  operate the two routes. The county, Watt said, will negotiate a long-term  contract with the company.  </P> <P> People answering the phone at Aztec offices declined to comment on the closure,  referring calls to Pike in Los Angeles. Pike, who reportedly owns and operates  other bus lines outside San Diego, bought Aztec in late 1986.  </P> <P> Aztec was once one of San Diego's largest charter companies, with a fleet of  buses and contracts with government agencies, providing service ranging from  the San Diego Unified School District and unincorporated areas of East County  to the cities of Poway, La Mesa, Santee and El Cajon.  </P> <P> Festering problems between management and the union representing the company's  bus drivers, however led to a long and bitter strike 10 years ago, labor  claims, lawsuits and a retrenchment.  </P> <P> The NLRB ruling calling on Aztec to rehire workers and pay back wages was made  last July.  </P></p>

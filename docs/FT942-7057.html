			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Ban on arms sales to Israel lifted The UK is to lift its 12-year embargo on arms sales to Israel and will consider similar action on Syria if further progress is made towards a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement, it was announced yesterday. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said in a Commons written answer that the decision to resume arms sales to Israel had been taken 'in the light of favourable developments in the Middle East peace process, in particular the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho'. Israel has long pressed the UK government to lift the embargo, which was imposed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, welcomed the move and, in an interview on Israel Radio, said the decision would make it easier for Israel to sell arms to the UK. 'It has been very difficult for us to sell Israeli weapons in Britain because, in many cases, there was a formal or informal condition that some of the components had to be British,' he said. Mr Moshe Raviv, Israel's ambassador to the UK, also welcomed the move, saying it would help to improve relations between the two countries. The decision brings Britain into line with the rest of the European Union, but is not expected to yield quick results for UK defence industries. The US is Israel's largest arms supplier, offering substantial military aid and soft loans as part of its commitment to maintaining that country's arms superiority in the region. Mr Hurd said applications for arms sales to Israel would be considered within established international guidelines. No early decision is expected on an end to the eight-year embargo on arms sales to Syria.</p>

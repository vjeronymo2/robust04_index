			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'FUTURE' FUELS THE BOX OFFICE; WEEKEND MAY TOP $100 MILLION  </P> <P> Hollywood movie studio executives were still counting receipts from the  five-day Thanksgiving weekend this afternoon, but one thing they were sure of:  It was the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever, perhaps topping the $100-million  mark.  </P> <P> As expected, "Back to the Future, Part II" jumped to the top of the chart,  taking in about $40 million at 1,866 screens between Wednesday's opening and  Sunday's last show. The sequel to the 1985 box office smash did $7.7 million  opening night and went on to out-gross the previous Thanksgiving holiday champ,  "Rocky V," which also opened in 1985.  </P> <P> Although "Harlem Nights," backed by the superstar power of Eddie Murphy, held  on to the No. 2 spot in its second weekend with $11.1 million, "Back to the  Future" led a holiday weekend surge of family dramas and children's movies:  Disney's animated fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" claimed the No. 3 spot with a  strong $8.4 million, followed by Tri-Star's tenacious fall hit "Look Who's  Talking" ($7.9 million) and ensemble drama "Steel Magnolias" ($7 million); Don  Bluth's animated Disney challenge, "All Dogs Go to Heaven" ($5 million);  Orion's live-action reindeer fantasy, "Prancer" (estimated $ 3.9 million);  Universal's father-son reunion, "Dad" ($2.9 million); and Tri-Star's outdoor  adventure "The Bear" ($2.3 million).  </P> <P> Industry box office analysts estimated that the take from this Thanksgiving  will be 60% higher than it was one year ago.  </P></p>

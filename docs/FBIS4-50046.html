			<p>BFN     [Text] After reading a XINHUA news account about the press  units symposium sponsored by the central propaganda department  in the country's capital, which urged the authorities to sound  frequent warnings to the press circles, Governor Wu Guanzheng  issued an important written instruction on strengthening the  building of professional ethics in the journalist ranks. In his  instruction, the governor urged journalists to draw a lesson  from the fact that a small number of reporters violated the law  and committed offenses in the illegal fund-raising activities of  the Great Wall Company. He told them to behave properly and  stick to correct opinion guidance as the society undertakes  major changes, to attach importance to ideological problems, and  to strive to remold their own subjective world while changing  the objective world.    The Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee Propaganda Department  attached great importance to the building of professional ethics  in the journalist ranks. Zhong Qihuang, Standing Committee  member of and propaganda department director of the provincial  party committee presided over a regular meeting of principal  persons in charge of the press units under the direct  jurisdiction of the provincial government on media, publication,  and propaganda work. The meeting worked out a specific plan to  thoroughly educate the press in professional ethics and  strengthen the building of the ranks of journalists and decided  to slate May as the professional ethics education month for the  province's journalists. For this purpose, the meeting issued a  circular containing the requirements of the month's activities.</p>

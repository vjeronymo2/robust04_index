			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> ALPHA LEAGUE  </P> <P> Montclair Prep  </P> <P> COACH: Walt Steele, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 16-6-1; 1st in league at 10-0  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team lost just one player from last year's undefeated  league champion. Granted, it was All-Southern Section pitcher Chris Anderson,  but the number of proven players should more than compensate. It is still a  young team: Just three seniors will start. Among them is All-State shortstop  Keyaan Cook (.500, seven home runs, 35 runs batted in), a Division I prospect.  The other elder statesmen are pitchers: Kevin Grant, a starter who went 4-2  last season, and short reliever Scott Saklad (3-1, 4 saves, 1.00 ERA), a  submarine pitcher. Six juniors will figure prominently. All-league first  baseman Andy Shaw hit .353. Catcher Brent Polacheck batted .424. Outfielder  Jared Baumblatt hit .348. How deep are the Mounties? Second baseman Shad  Knighton (.311) is still battling junior Geoff Taylor for his starting job.  Basketball star J. T. Billingslea, a "defensive whiz," according to Steele,  will man left field. Junior football standout Leland Sparks (.322) will patrol  center field. Sophomore Russell Ortiz, a third baseman and short reliever, is  perhaps the team's hardest-throwing pitcher. Freshman Chris Garza also will  pitch.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: It is difficult to imagine this team not repeating a league sweep,  although Village Christian will provide competition. Still, since the inception  of the Alpha League, Montclair Prep has either won or tied for seven  consecutive league titles. "We can't underestimate the league," Steele  cautioned. "With a streak like that, sooner or later something's going to jump  up and nip us."  </P> <P> L.A. Baptist  </P> <P> COACH: Joe Koh, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 15-7; 3rd place in league at 5-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Koh means business in taking over the Knights program. His  list of cuts surprised most with an emphasis on youth in anticipation of a  "two-year building program." Still, some veterans will provide leadership.  Among them are senior shortstop and basketball star Reid Chobanian, senior  outfielder Eric Hein and senior center fielder Chris Robinson, the football  team's quarterback. Also returning is junior Danny Shackelford (.366, seven  doubles), who will wind up in the outfield or at second. After that, youth  reigns. The pitching staff is composed of sophomores Heath McElwee and Darrell  Smedley and freshmen Steve Klein and John Gabrielson. The rest of the lineup is  full of new names. Brad Imbler, according to Koh, is a pleasant surprise at  second base. Catcher Chris Tate is a junior who was handed the job because last  year's junior varsity catcher chose not to play. Sophomore Justin Simpers will  play first base.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: In a league with Montclair Prep and Village Christian, L.A. Baptist  has its work cut out. But Koh, a former assistant at Chatsworth, expects  success. A realistic goal? "I'd be happy with the team if we finished third and  made the playoffs," he said.  </P> <P> Village Christian  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Henzie, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 18-8; 2nd place in league at 7-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: This year begins with a note of sadness for Village  Christian: the Crusaders will not play home games at cozy Bluebird Field. But  that's all that will be worth grieving over this season: the Crusaders have  talented players returning -- especially on the mound where four proven  pitchers will be counted on to carry Village Christian a step past last year's  semifinal loss. Junior Matt Henzie, the coach's son, will pitch and hit -- he  batted .500 with four home runs and an .806 slugging percentage last year.  Junior Matt Smay can perform on the mound and at the plate. The  shortstop-pitcher was 5-4 with a 2.60 ERA and batted .376 with four home runs  and eight doubles. Senior Matt Bates went 4-1 with a 3.20 ERA as a junior and  batted .327. A fourth quality arm comes in Mark Vail, the football team's  quarterback. In the field, utility man Jeff Cortez will play catcher, replacing  the injured David Brownfield, who was slated to bat either third or fourth  before suffering a stress fracture of the spine. First baseman Panos Panay is a  sharp-fielding player who was promoted from the junior varsity. Herbie Gonzalez  will play both third base and shortstop.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Village Christian poses the greatest threat to Montclair Prep's  vise-like grip on the league. With four quality pitchers, Henzie exudes  confidence. "Montclair Prep is no pushover," he said. "But I'd like to think  title."  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates high MONEY market interest rates throughout Europe remained on the high side yesterday at the start of another critical week inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. Pressure on the French franc subsided as dealers waited to see how the Bundesbank would respond to the latest crisis in the exchange rate mechanism at its council meeting on Thursday. French money market interest rates were more or less unchanged at 9.5 per cent. But dealers in the interest rate futures market were looking for more than 2 percentage points off three-month French francs by the middle of September, with the September Pibor contract closing yesterday at 92.67. The clear belief is that France will reduce interest rates either because the Bundesbank has done so or because the French currency has quit the ERM. There was speculation that the Bundesbank would reduce interest rates at Thursday's council meeting, but there were wide differences of opin-ion over the extent of the cut. Some dealers felt that the Bundesbank would have to lower the discount rate by a full percentage point to take pressure off the French currency. But the price of interest rate futures appeared to imply that a 50 basis-point cut was in the offing. In recent days, the September Euromark contract has gradually risen from 93.20 to a close of 93.40 last night. This implies that three-month D-Marks would be at 6.60 per cent by mid-September - and that would imply a reduction in the German discount rate, currently at 6.75 per cent, of at least 50 basis points. Sterling interest rate markets were affected by the currency crisis yesterday, with dealers speculating that German rate cuts might allow the UK to ease policy. In the middle of last week, the December short sterling contract hovered around the 94.20 level. Yesterday it closed at 94.39, up 6 basis points on the day. Some dealers believe that there could be  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base rates later this year. However, three-month sterling cash was virtually unchanged on the day at 6 per cent. Most of a Pounds 1.65bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in the early round of discount market trading.</p>

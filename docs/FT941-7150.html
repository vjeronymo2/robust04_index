			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (7): Offset rules sustain the local market  -Mark Nicholson explains how Kuwait uses arms purchases to win inward investment Kuwait has high hopes of its offset programme. The requirement that defence contractors re-invest a nominal 30 per cent of the value of their deals in new Kuwaiti joint ventures is, for example, expected in the short term to provide the biggest source of foreign investment in an economy which has seen little of it since the Gulf war. The government also sees its offset programme as among the best of few available tools for regenerating Kuwait's private sector, which has also invested little of its own money in the state since the war. The programme appears to offer the best hope of introducing new technology and training opportunities into the country. The government also expects it to provide new products for export. Finally, but probably as important as any economic benefits, the government hopes the offset programme will provide the country with a strategic bulwark. 'If we have foreign interests inside the country,' explains one offset official, 'this will obviously help the government get strategic help if it ever needs to ask for it again.' The offset programme is thus expected to double Kuwait's strategic gain from its defence dollars, buying both weaponry and a sort of 'human shield' of foreign investments and investors. The catch in what otherwise appears an elegant one-off solution to many of Kuwait's most pressing post-war needs, however, is that the Gulf state's multi-billion-dollar rearmament programme is obliging defence contractors to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of re-investment projects, and it is unclear where such big opportunities lie. Kuwait's non-oil sector was not highly developed before the Gulf war and has shrunk considerably since. The juiciest parts of the oil sector itself lie, for the present at least, quarantined from foreign investment. In addition, since the offset programme requires foreign investors to find joint venture partners to hold 51 per cent of any project, the plan assumes that incoming companies will awaken local investors to projects they have somehow missed. But as one offset-seeking executive puts it: 'Kuwaitis have been investing themselves in what opportunities there are in this country for the last 40 years. This is a very well ploughed field indeed.' The architects of Kuwait's offset programme were well aware of these limits to Kuwait's ability to attract and absorb investment and have accordingly designed what many defence contractors consider among the most flexible of such schemes in the world. A unique feature of Kuwait's programme, for instance, is that it will permit offshore joint ventures with Kuwaiti partners to count against the offset requirement: re-investment in other Gulf countries, the Arab world or anywhere else are acceptable, in that order of preference. Neither do defence contractors have to make the re-investment directly. To satisfy the programme's requirements, they need only introduce the investment to Kuwait - though they would retain overall responsibility for its performance. For domestic investment, which is the government's priority, the scheme also includes a series of multipliers designed to encourage investment in preferred sectors. Investment in education, management, training or manufacturing, for example, earns a multiplier of four, so that a Dollars 1m investment in these areas counts as Dollars 4m against the offset obligation. Assembly, processing or partial manufacturing projects earn multipliers of three. Investment in services earns a multiplier of two. 'The plan is designed to reflect government priorities rather than to force investment towards them,' says an offset official. But even given these incentives, the scale of investment obliged under the scheme is forcing defence contractors to search with considerable imagination for new projects. Proportionate to the sum of defence contracts already awarded by the Kuwait government, a notional Dollars 500m worth of reinvestment has either already been obliged under the programme or is in immediate prospect. 'It's really become a big race,' says one western arms supplier. 'No-one can see that value of reinvestment out there, so it's a question of getting in there first.' So far three companies have signed preliminary agreements under the offset scheme. Hughes Aircraft, the US defence group, was the first, committing itself in late 1992 to a Dollars 27.6m offset under a Dollars 92m deal to sell Kuwait early warning radar. Hughes has already set up a joint venture to establish a training centre directly related to its defence sale. Aerospatiale Missiles of France late last year signed a Dollars 5m offset deal as part of its supply of an undisclosed number of missiles to Kuwait, but has not yet detailed its proposed project. Neither has Raytheon, the US group which has agreed a more than Dollars 300m sale of Patriot missiles to Kuwait, giving it a formal offset obligation of Dollars 98m. However, Raytheon executives have already tantalisingly suggested they are preparing a direct investment in a manufacturing project in Kuwait which they say will far exceed this nominal requirement. No details of what Raytheon has in mind have so far been released. By March, GKN, the British automotive and defence group, is expected to sign a memo of understanding on a Dollars 300m offset requirement as part of its near Dollars 1bn deal to supply just over 250 Warrior armoured personnel carriers. The company is in the earliest stages of examining what projects might be offered. But even without the further defence purchases for which Kuwait has, at least for now, budgeted, offset commitments will almost certainly rise further. Within a month or two, according to offset officials, the government intends to extend its offset obligations to all supply contracts, defence or civil, exceeding KD1m. With Kuwait's absorptive capacity already beginning to look strained under the weight of such sums, contractors are already looking with slightly anxious hope towards the government's embryonic privatisation plans. 'It would seem the perfect fit for us to satisfy our offset requirements by plugging into privatisation sales,' says one western executive. Just now, however, the timing is awkward. Most offset deals already signed must lead within a month or two to specific 'concept papers' on projects to be pursued. The earliest real privatisation offering is not expected before the end of this year. Kuwait, meanwhile, will undergo perhaps the most thorough scouring for investment opportunities in its history.</p>

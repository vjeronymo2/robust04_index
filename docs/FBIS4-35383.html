			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 May (MENA) -- MENA has learned that Iraqi  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf objected during the  evening session of the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] ministerial  conference to some things that were said in the speech of his  Kuwaiti counterpart Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, such as  accusations leveled at his country.    During the session, al-Sahhaf asked 'Amr Musa, chairman of  the session, for permission to comment on the word "regime,"  which was used in Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's speech in reference to  Iraq. Al-Sahhaf pointed out that it had been agreed to discuss  the basic issues that were listed in the report of the NAM's  president. He noted that agreement was reached during the  meeting of ranking officials not to raise the issue of the  Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute.    He said that the attacks on Iraq in the speech of the  Kuwaiti  foreign minister were not listed in the president's report that  was submitted for discussion during the ministerial meeting.  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa then spoke in his capacity as  chairman of the current session. He said that he had taken note  of the Iraqi foreign minister's comment. He then asked the  Kuwaiti minister to continue his speech.    In his speech, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad spoke at length about  Iraq's non-adherence to the Security Council resolutions on  recognizing Kuwait's international borders. He noted that there  are still Kuwaiti prisoners being held in Iraq.    The Iraqi minister had told MENA before the session started  that the issue of lifting the international sanctions on Iraq  and the damage Iraq is being subjected to would not be discussed  during this meeting because it is not on the agenda.</p>

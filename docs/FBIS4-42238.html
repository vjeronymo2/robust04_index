			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hedwige Chevrillon: "The Real Mistakes of </F> Lyonnais"]    [Text] Nonexistent controls, secretive fiefdoms,  bureaucratic inertia... The excesses of the Haberer era at  Credit Lyonnais have become a political issue that could  threaten cohabitation. Most worrisome are the serious  deficiencies they reveal in the management of France's largest  bank.    It all erupted so suddenly no one saw it coming. More than  the private school affair, more than the CIP [youth vocational  training contract] affair, it threatens to become the first  major crisis of cohabitation, and may even foment divisions  within the majority itself. The Left saw the dismissal of  dethroned senior civil servant Jean-Yves Haberer as an attack on  the Elysee and an implicit swipe at Pierre Beregovoy. Bercy  [Finance Ministry] and the Treasury Directorate take the episode  as an infringement on their prerogatives. For them, the worst is  probably yet to come. The fact that Philippe Seguin is  personally chairing the parliamentary commission of inquiry is  probably not unconnected with the fact that Treasury's director  at the time was Jean-Claude Trichet, now governor of the Bank of  France and mortal enemy to all opponents of the strong franc  policy.    Even the timetable of the probe is tainted with partisan  considerations: The inquiry's report is supposed to be submitted  on 11 September, coincident with the beginning of the final  stage of the presidential race. Now as "luck" would have it, the  principal target of the majority deputies is expected to be  Bernard Tapie--undeclared candidate in the presidential  elections--by virtue of his controversial ties with SDBO, a  Lyonnais subsidiary. The rich political trappings of this big  showdown could divert attention from the most important question  raised by the affair: How could France's biggest bank have  adopted such dysfunctional operating procedures? Because there  was no actual wrongdoing, not in the juridical sense. And the  alarm was sounded much earlier than people today find it  convenient to remember.    In fact, it all began three years ago, in late 1990, with  the  MGM affair. MGM--that glorious and expensive Hollywood  studio--fell into the portfolio of the French bank almost  without warning. Concerned at the volume of money involved, the  Banking Commission asked Lyonnais for all the details on the  Parretti imbroglio. By dint of increasingly insistent pressure,  the Banking Commission finally had its way, and the figures  provided to it at that time turned out to be accurate. It was at  this point that the bank monitoring body decided, contrary to  what had been said since, to put Credit Lyonnais under close  surveillance. This was in autumn 1991 (as confirmed by  memoranda). What was disturbing was the sharp augmentation of  Lyonnais's activity (loans out and portfolio participations) at  a time when the economy as a whole showed obvious signs of  getting winded--and the bank's accounts looked entirely too good.  <H5>  Failure To Inform </H5>   In July 1991, the profit-and-loss statement for the first  half of the year, though very favorable on its face, confirmed  the commission's doubts and convinced it to continue  investigating the bank.    It decided to begin by focusing the investigation more on  the  subsidiaries than on the parent company. In November 1991 the  inspectors started with Altus, Jean-Francois Henin's fiefdom.  That was the focus until April 1992. Their labors bore fruit:  They demanded specific reforms on provisions, calculation of  earnings, and accounting practices. A long letter was sent to  the titular president of Altus, Jean-Yves Haberer, in which the  inadequacy of internal controls was mentioned. As regulations  stipulate, he was the only recipient. It was up to him to inform  the shareholders, to wit Lyonnais and Thomson, and the auditors.  He did not do so.    The second subsidiary on the list was Bernard Tapie's  generous provider, SDBO, where the mission remained from the end  of May to September 1992. Then the focus shifted to Clinvest and  International Bankers, both headed by former Lyonnais president  Jean-Maxime Leveque. The commission meanwhile wrote again to  Boulevard des Italiens [Credit Lyonnais headquarters] reminding  the president of the conditions attached to the 1991 settlement  of accounts. Once again, the shareholders of Credit Lyonnais  were not informed officially. At the same time, before the final  closure of the 1991 accounting year, the governor of the Bank of  France--Jacques de Larosiere, the president of the Banking  Commission--hosted a "summit meeting" with Jean-Yves Haberer and  Francois Gille, the bank's director general. Coincidence?  Anyway, the net amount for provisions to cover "bad" risks was  increased 50 percent over the 1990 level. Thanks to Altus,  Credit Lyonnais still showed a net profit of 3.2 billion francs  [Fr]. But the situation worsened under the weight of economic  recession, especially the real estate crisis.  <H5>  Image-Conscious Auditors </H5>   After publication of the accounting figures for the first  half of 1992, the Banking Commission opted to probe into the  core of the reactor. In October 1992, it would audit the parent  company. As the tutelary authority for the banking sector, the  then-economic affairs minister, Michel Sapin, was informed; he  in turn sent a letter to Jean-Yves Haberer on 22 September  directing him to furnish a detailed analysis of the bank's loan  portfolio. A new anomaly: The Banking Commission was unaware of  the existence of this letter. Apparently, it knew nothing about  it before it was published recently in the pages of LIBERATION.  Conversely, Michel Sapin was probably unaware that the Banking  Commission was already within the gates. In the meantime,  however, informal contacts were established with the Treasury  Directorate, which after examining the six-month accounting  statements, warned the minister's staff. But officially, at the  political level, no decisions were made. Finally, the 1992  accounting year ended with a loss of Fr1.8 billion. The picture  was reportedly "improved" by an accounting artifice--reducing  the country-risk provisions by Fr2.5 billion--with the  acquiescence of auditors Ernst &amp; Young and Coopers &amp;  Lybrands.  The auditors made no special comments in the final auditors'  report, despite the violent arguments they had with the office  of the director general. The excuse made by one of the auditors:  "We didn't want to destroy the image of the bank, and we  continue to stand by that position."    Dissimulation? Under the law, the auditors have no right to  pass information to other persons. Lack of judgment? No, because  at the time they believed, as did the regulatory organism, that  the bank would be able to solve its problems by itself. Why then  should they create a furor in Paris financial circles? A  sentiment with which the Banking Commission would concur, right  up to May 1993. But when finally it received the report from its  inspectors, it judged the time opportune to inform the  shareholders: in this instance, the state. In August 1993, the  governor of the Bank of France sent a very official letter to  the minister. The solemn terms employed and the unusual nature  of this step left little room for doubt: The affair would have  to be dealt with under Article 52 of the Banking Law of 1984,  which obliges shareholders to take responsibility for the  collapse of their institution. The solvency ratio of "the bank  that always says yes" was at risk of falling below the 8 percent  level required to meet international banking standards. In his  letter to the minister, Jacques de Larosiere mentioned a  Fr7-billion shortfall in parent company provisions. An estimate  which, according to Jean-Yves Haberer, reportedly was reduced to  Fr5 billion after heated discussions initiated by Francois  Gille. Rumors began to circulate quietly here and there, but  nothing official leaked out. Surveillance of the group resumed,  as ritually performed as two episodes of "Santa Barbara." The  Commission inspectors returned to monitor compliance at Altus  and SDBO, and were upset to see there had been no slowdown in  activity at Altus, in the first six months under the leadership  of financial high-flyer Jean-Francois Henin, despite generally  deteriorating economic conditions. Not surprisingly, the probe  led back, in November 1993, to the parent company, this time  under the eye of an observer from the Treasury Directorate. But  by now it was too late to avoid the political fallout.  <H5>  Politics and Prestige </H5>   Several more weeks, and this auditors' headache would become  an "affair." Ultimately, the Banking Commission was to reckon  the real loss for 1993 at just over Fr15 billion. But the  official figure, disclosed on 24 March, was only Fr6.9 billion,  to which the observers added Fr18.4 billion in state guarantees  to OIG, the real estate company where Fr40 billion worth of  Lyonnais' "problem" assets and real estate loans had been  placed. So now we are up to more than Fr25 billion. Of course,  that is just an approximation. The guarantee covered only Fr14.4  billion of dubious real estate credit. The other Fr4 billion was  for future interest expenses and carrying costs. Is all this  just bickering among the experts? No, it's more than that.    First of all, the amounts of money involved are shocking,  since they don't even include the three huge scandals the  Lyonnais carries like millstones around its neck (Maxwell, MGM,  and Sasea), already in large part funded in 1992). Second, what  the battle is really about is not so much accounting as image  and politics. Otherwise why would we have seen so much wrangling  between high-level bureaucrats who rarely indulge in public  scenes? These masters of the bureaucratic bromides taught at ENA  [National Public Administration School] would soon fall into  dissension. Between the outgoing president, who thought the bank  could resolve its own problems; the Treasury Directorate,  outraged by the criticisms leveled at Jean-Pascal Beaufret,  chief of its office of financial and monetary affairs, manager  of the bank since 1992; the cabinet of Edmond Alphandery, weakly  defending the ministry's role; and new Lyonnais president Jean  Peyrelevade, supported by the Matignon [office of the prime  minister] but characterized as "cowardly" by his banking  colleagues.    In the last analysis, how much money did Credit Lyonnais  lose  in 1993? It all depends how you look at it. When a business  loses money on a real estate asset, or an ownership interest in  such an asset, it must recognize the entire loss at once if it  is forced to sell it in less than a year. On the other hand, if  the business deems it strategically important to keep, the  potential loss can be stretched out over two or three years.  Everything depends on whether management regards it with a  short- or medium-term perspective. The same goes for loans. By  way of example, BNP [National Bank of Paris] did not provision a  single centime for EuroDisney, though it has lost Fr5.3 billion.  For one simple reason: It believes that the loan is not at risk  since interest payments continue to be made.    "This very often is the explanation for all the changes in  the accounting picture whenever a new president comes on board.  In the Lyonnais affair, the judgments made about operations  already under way suddenly changed," says one of the  protagonists. From the perspective of his industry-bank  strategy, Jean-Yves Haberer was fully within his legal rights  not to recognize the total potential loss, since from the  standpoint of his objectives it was a long-term investment.  Today, it is obvious that Jean Peyrelevade views the situation  in terms of a definitive clean-up of accounts that will free his  hands for the future. As shown in the real estate loans. At the  height of the crisis, to prevent banks from being dragged down  with their developer clients an ad hoc agreement was negotiated  with the tutelary authorities: Treasury, the Banking Commission,  the association of chartered accountants, etc. Written  directives were sent to allow real estate provisions to be  stretched over several years. "But the new Lyonnais management  decided to set aside all the provisions at once," notes one of  the company's directors.    What if the financial position of the OIG real estate  company  were to improve dramatically tomorrow--what would be the  judgment then? That Catherine Tron, the expert into whose hands  its management was entrusted, performed brilliantly? That the  financial arrangements put together by the Banking Commission,  Treasury, and the bank were astute? Or simply that the crisis is  over? "If it hadn't been for the recession, everyone would have  said it was a work of genius," a critic of Jean-Yves Haberer  readily admits.    That, in any case, is the line of defense taken by the  former  president of Credit Lyonnais. But that defense cannot excuse the  company's managerial errors. It is not enough to have a grand  strategy: One must also mind the store. And Jean-Yves Haberer  ran Lyonnais like the Treasury Directorate, without bothering to  find out what was really happening. Here's one revealing  example: The Olympia &amp; York case, one of the world's biggest  real estate disasters. "I learned in the press that we were  involved; it was not up to me to keep tabs on that, there was a  system of delegating authority already in place when I arrived,  and I kept it," says Haberer. "But I asked for an investigation  to find out how it happened." The bank lost a trifling Fr2  billion in that Fr70-billion real estate collapse. One fact  uncovered in the probe was that Bernard Thiollon, then-director  general, gave a green light, against the company's  recommendation, to the financing of Canary Warf, the famous  London real estate project that led to the ruin of the Reichman  brothers.    From the moment he arrived, Jean Peyrelevade put an end to  the practice of delegating unlimited authority to the  directors--a practice that does not exist in the other big  banks--and simultaneously reduced the total of tied-up funds.  Similarly, he created a directorate of loan commitments staffed  with four investigators to keep a close eye on the 400 biggest  clients with which the bank has commitments in excess of Fr100  million. The criterion? Their ability to pay back their loans  tomorrow, or at worst within five years. At Societe Generale and  BNP, there is a prestigious monitoring unit called the  inspectorate general. It is almost unthinkable that Boulevard  des Italiens should have nothing comparable. That until 1991  there were no consolidated statements, client by client,  developer by developer, and there was no centralized risk  management. For France's largest bank, truly incredible! This  awesome mismanagement is at least partly to blame for anomalies  like the Parretti affair, or the Pelege disaster in the real  estate domain.  <H5>  Autonomous Fiefdoms </H5>   Another explanation of this incredible chaos: the fiefdoms  that Jean Peyrelevade began denouncing as soon as he took  office. Within the bank, the largest fiefdoms were in commercial  banking, the directorates of the big subsidiaries, real estate,  and international lending. Among the subsidiaries, the most  notorious were SDBO and Altus, which seem to have been the  source of about 80 to 90 percent of the losses. Thus Michel  Gallot, inspector of finances, president of SDBO with almost  unlimited autonomy, took advantage of his friendship with  Haberer to circumvent the hierarchy. With the results now  familiar to everyone. As for Jean-Francois Henin, the "Mozart of  easy money," he reported directly to the office of the  president. To complicate matters even further, the two previous  directors, Jean-Maxime Leveque and Jean Deflassieux, continued  to cast their own shadow on the company. The first personally  introduced three of the bank's big clients--including Robert  Maxwell and Michel Pelege--to his successor. The second  continued to exert a strong influence on international lending,  notably to CLBN, the Dutch subsidiary through which the MGM  scandal arrived.    One can certainly see why Jean Peyrelevade is so cool to the  idea of seeing the parliamentary commission of inquiry take the  torch from the State Audit Office and make a public spectacle of  all the tangled and damaging threads to this affair. At this  level of dysfunction, the bank will require more than provisions  for bad credit...to undo the moral damage to its own.  <H5>  [Box, pp 58-59] </H5> <H5>  Disinvestments </H5>   The word went out to sell. Jean Peyrelevade's originally  announced objective--a disinvestment of Fr20 billion--has been  revised upward now to Fr35 billion over two years, to calm his  overly-excited colleagues. At every level, in all the  subsidiaries of Credit Lyonnais: 1,200 industrial  participations, totaling Fr50 billion, were examined with a  fine-toothed comb. The simplest transactions were those in the  orbit of Clinvest, the group's merchant bank. A special unit was  set up to take charge of unloading shares held in various  businesses; it was staffed by five of the bank's forty-odd  employees, under the direction of Henri Filho. Their mission: to  sell off as many assets as possible. But it proved to be an  arduous task. First, because the recession and sluggish stock  market were against them; second, because in most cases Lyonnais  had been content with minority ownership positions of 10, 15, or  20 percent, rarely more (only in disastrous situations), to  avoid the need to consolidate them into its own accounts.  Moreover, the bank's withdrawal risked leaving the companies  involved vulnerable to the horrors of investor turmoil, at a  time when they were only just beginning to recover from the  economic recession. So the new CEO wrote personal letters to his  principal clients, to assuage hurt feelings.  <H5>  In Progress </H5>   Already Fr2 billion of shares have been transferred,  including TF1 [television network], the Naf Naf textile group  which has just gone on the Stock Exchange, and Essilor. These  disentanglements were carried out quickly and most often  discreetly. In some cases, as with Sylea, a Labinal subsidiary,  they were accompanied by financial restructurings. If computer  chip card maker Gemplus goes on the Stock Exchange, Clinvest  will also seize the opportunity to reduce its holdings.  <H5>  Being Considered </H5>   The temptation is great to disinvest from Marne et  Champagne,  one of the biggest champagne wholesalers, weighed down as it is  with the takeover of Lanson. Likewise the bank on Boulevard des  Italiens is reportedly tempted to distance itself from the  Bourgoin company, but the fragility of the country's second  largest poultry concern makes that operation very sensitive. The  objective of Henri Filho's team is to find buyers capable of  reaching an understanding with the majority shareholders. For  the moment, shares in companies quoted on the secondary market,  and small enterprises not traded on the Exchange, are proving  easier to unload. Flo breweries may soon follow in Naf Naf's  footsteps.  <H5>  Hoped For </H5>   The financial situation of some companies such as  Aerospatiale and Usinor-Sacilor offers little if any hope of a  rapid and honorable withdrawal, though Credit Lyonnais has quit  even trying to hide its desire to extricate itself from these  two groups as soon as possible. As for FNAC, it could change  owners much sooner than expected. Several prospective buyers  have signaled their interest. Quite a few, actually: Compagnie  Generale des Eaux, Pinault-Printemps, Bertelsmann, Kingfisher,  etc. The complicated dossier of France's biggest bookseller  could, paradoxically enough, turn out to be the easiest to  resolve.  <H5>  Impossible </H5>   In general, these large transactions are being carried out  in  a pragmatic way, taking advantage of opportunities as they  arise, the ideal being to trade a capital loss for a good exit,  as in the case of TF1 (Clinvest ceded 3 percent of its shares).  While partial disinvestments are relatively easy to arrange,  solutions must still be found for participation in  control-holding groups such as Artemis (Pinault), Sofitbol  (Bollore), Arnault et Associes, and Christian Dior (LVMH). The  resolution of Altus' situation will necessarily entail  lightening its portfolio, but investments in the controlling  companies of certain large groups, and in "financial chain"  entities such as Novalliance, seem to be locked in where they  are.  <H5>  Partial Disinvestment </H5>   While it may be out of the question to withdraw altogether  from major enterprises such as Bouygues, Lagardere Groupe, etc.,  it is still clear that the bank is looking to reduce its  equities in other companies. There have been some gradual share  transfers, notably vis-a-vis Lagardere Groupe. Reduction of its  external ties has become an obsession, but cessation of  investment is already a reality. Apart from a very few symbolic  transactions, the king of industrial banking has decided it does  not want to buy into any more companies.  <H5>  [Box, p 60] </H5> <H5>  Haberer Interviewed </H5>   [L'EXPANSION] The parliamentary commission of inquiry is  trying to focus on the dysfunction that supposedly existed in  the relationship between Lyonnais and the ministerial  authorities. What is your position?    [Haberer] I don't see any "dysfunction" to complain about. A  public bank lives in very close intimacy with its shareholder,  the state, and with the Bank of France. Coordination of these  two entities is not the bank's responsibility. The Treasury  Directorate did its job. The three successive administrators it  delegated--Philippe Jaffre, Denis Samuel-Lajeunesse, and  Jean-Pascal Beaufret--are remarkable men whose critical  faculties never failed them. France's biggest bank has a  macroeconomic role. It has an obligation to conduct itself  responsibly. At the time, France's enterprises were suffering  from equity capital shortages, so they welcomed the  industrial-bank strategy.    [L'EXPANSION] You are accused of having made decisions in a  vacuum.    [Haberer] This is the classic tactic for dodging  responsibility--and invoked by the very people that were  supposed to be setting policy! Credit Lyonnais is a  statutory-law company. When it comes to extending credits,  nothing is decided without a committee meeting and official  minutes. And in a bank that has 8 million clients, it is not the  president's job to ensure in each case that the collateral is  sufficient. On the other hand, as soon as I arrived, I set up a  committee, like the one at Paribas, where capital investments  were discussed. At all events, the criticisms leveled at me  should be seen in terms of the big picture.    [L'EXPANSION] Why did you invest in Usinor-Sacilor?    [Haberer] I wouldn't do it again today. But at the time,  people were criticizing Lyonnais for only financing financiers.  This particular idea came from the [Usinor-Sacilor] president,  Francis Mer, and his enterprise flourished. The deal was also a  beautiful piece of financial engineering that augmented our  equity capital, despite the restraints that impeded us.... The  Cooke ratio gave us no choice!    [L'EXPANSION] Some of the bank's losses come from the  subsidiaries, Altus and SDBO, which you have defended.    [Haberer] Their recent reverses have weighed less heavily  than the provisions required for the commercial bank: the motion  picture industry, small- and medium-size enterprises, real  estate. In France, the parent companies, with their monolithic  traditions, don't have close ties with their subsidiaries. If  they did, how could they manage to run up a consolidated balance  of Fr2,000 billion without paralyzing centralization? You have  to give the subsidiaries their commercial autonomy. Altus made  more money in four years than it lost, and I regard as unfair  the sarcastic criticisms directed at Jean-Francois Henin, one of  our country's best financiers. The SDBO has a long history, an  entrepreneurial culture, and it works in market niches that  Lyonnais itself seldom frequents.</p>

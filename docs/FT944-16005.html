			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tie Rack rise held to 6% by French result Pre-tax profits at Tie Rack, the fashion neckwear and accessories retailer, rose 6 per cent from a restated Pounds 384,000 to Pounds 407,000 in the 28 weeks to August 14, its seasonally weak half. The company scoffed yesterday at reports that it was considering any action against British Rail as a result of the adverse impact of the summer's rail dispute on its outlets within BR stations. Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said the stoppages had been 'an irritant', but were 'of no major consequence'. He estimated that they had affected Tie Rack's UK retail sales by up to 2 per cent in July and August, and sales in the first six months by 'less than half a per cent'. He said that the summer's hot weather across Europe had a much more inhibiting affect on sales. Like-for-like sales fell 5 per cent, said Mr McGinley, because of the weather, declines in Australia and the Netherlands as well as France, and a reduced range of higher value items. In spite of continued losses from the now reorganised US operations, Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said it was 'a satisfactory first half'. With operating profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 299,000) on turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 33m), the pre-tax line was affected by losses doubled to Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 82,000) at the French associate and interest receivable up by Pounds 89,000 at Pounds 256,000. Cash balances grew to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 6.9m). Mr McGinley said margins improved by about 1 per cent, as the company achieved higher volumes with the same fixed costs. In the half, 13 new shops were opened, bringing the number of countries where it trades to 18. Earnings rose to 0.53p (0.47p) per share and as usual there is no interim dividend.</p>

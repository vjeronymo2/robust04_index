[words indistinct] outlaws have  been receiving arms secretly and they think that United States  and its alliance are the source of these arms. The British  journalist goes on to say that Washington has offered the green  light to one of its allies in the area to provide arms to the  outlaws' movement from the American arms stores following the  Gulf war. He pointed out that the plane which is now in Cyprus  is a part of the campaign to overcome the lack of arms in the  outlaws' hands, adding that the eyewitnesses said they had seen  a number of trucks carrying arms in the borders.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Deliberate use of consensus system Sir, I commend your editorial 'Overkill in Japan' (March 12) on the risks to the global financial community posed by Japan's mounting financial problems. Yours is one of the few publications to treat the issue with the gravity it deserves. Yet I beg to differ with your analysis of the consequences of the recent scandals, which instead of threatening Japan's consensus system may be its salvation. In fact, these scandals may have been the product of a deliberate decision of the 'consensus system' to vitiate the obligations of the securities houses to pay loss guarantees and to fulfil other questionable promises that they could not satisfy in a free-falling market. By deliberately provoking a public controversy, the consensus system could relieve the brokerages of financial obligations they could not meet and, thereby, avoid disaster. The lawsuits filed by some of the investment funds suggest that the brokerages may have miscalculated the effectiveness of this ploy. Nevertheless, these kinds of dispute may be merely signs of self-correction, to be resolved through the consensus mechanism. I hope your prognostications come true. Reform of Japan's finance is critical not only to Japan, but also the world. The scandals of 1991-92, which would have sent a western financial system to its knees, in the Japanese context appear only to be a conscious venting of the economic steam engine, while the train roars onward. Robert Wang, 1667 K Street NW 990, Washington DC</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Leading Article: The battle for Midland TWO fundamentally different offers have now been proposed for Midland Bank. The deal unveiled yesterday by Lloyds Bank implies substantial and painful rationalisation of a type that the UK financial services sector has never experienced. Symbolically, the name of Midland, once Britain's biggest bank, would go. The offer contrasts with the bid from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which has already been on the table for more than a month. This is a very different sort of exercise. It will introduce new capital to Midland and possibly reinvigorate its management, but it will not address the apparent problems of overcapacity and poor returns on capital in British banking. At one level it is up to shareholders to decide. Normally the more radical solution would be likely to be more profitable for them, although the benefits from bank mergers in the past have often proved to be disappointing. Indeed, Lloyds is offering a price some 20 per cent higher than the Hongkong Bank. But this raises public interest considerations, because although it would be acceptable for Midland's value to be enhanced through increases in efficiency, the same would not be true if the gains were to be achieved through monopoly profits arising from the reduction of the number of major clearing banks from four to three. Special safeguards Although it is right that banks should be exposed to market forces by way of takeovers, there need to be special safeguards as well: banks are different. The security of depositors' funds is paramount, and in the case of the largest banks, at least, it is supported by an implicit state guarantee. There are also broader questions about the stability of the financial system. So to some degree, competition must be subordinated to prudence. The regulators must maintain a balance between the encouragement of sensible behaviour by the banks and the availability of economically priced and progressive services to the public. Then there is the position of the shareholders: by and large they have been badly served by their directors in recent years (though Lloyds has been an exception). Midland in particular has been allowed to stagger from one crisis to another over nearly 20 years during which its share price has hugely underperformed the stock market as a whole. The bid battle erupting over Midland is a welcome sign that even bankers are not immune from the consequences of their mistakes. Avoid a squabble The crucial decision that has to be made now concerns the nature of whatever investigation needs to be made into the UK's biggest banking reorganisation since the mergers of the late 1960s. Both the European Commission in Brussels and the Monopolies Commission in London may have claims for jurisdiction, and it will be important to avoid a squabble. There may well be a real problem here of overlapping jurisdiction: the European authorities will be keen to get their teeth into the Hongkong bid, which is one of the most important mergers to take place since they acquired their powers. But at the same time, a probe into the domestic UK implications of a Lloyds-Midland merger seems desirable. Although there is plenty of competition in personal banking and big corporate lending, the same is not true of lending to the small business sector. Whatever the legal niceties, the desirable outcome is that both bids should be scrutinised by the same competition authority, and that oversight should lie within the UK. This is not to deny the possibility that Brussels has a legitimate interest in this affair. But the main public policy issues at stake here are domestic in character. Only within the UK will there be major shifts in market penetration as a result of either of these offers. Midland is the weakest of the UK clearers, and its future as an independent bank is uncertain. So the fact that it is now on the receiving end of two very different bids from well capitalised banks is to be welcomed. It is right that these should be officially scrutinised. But there is a strong case for a shake-up in the UK banking sector. There would have to be very powerful arguments to justify opposition to either of these bids on competition or other public interest grounds.</p>

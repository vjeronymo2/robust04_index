			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALE MIDWIFE SAYS TOO MANY MEN MISSING OUT ON 'TERRIFIC' CAREER  </P> <P> Despite his mustache, Norman Taylor likes to think of himself as just one of  the girls. But as one of only 12 or so practicing male midwives in Britain, out  of an estimated 35,000, he is still a rarity.  </P> <P> Taylor, 30, works in the delivery suite of the Princess Anne maternity hospital  in Southampton. A midwife for five years, after eight years in general and  psychiatric nursing, he has delivered nearly 200 babies and assisted in the  births of many more. Confident and diplomatic, with a cheeky sense of humor, he  chooses his words with care and is conscious of the fact that his sex gives him  a voice often denied his female colleagues.  </P> <P> Taylor admits that he has always liked children, but denies that there is  anything special about male midwives. No unusual upbringing, flag-waving desire  to break down stereotypes or superior qualities distinguish the men who choose  to make a living helping babies into the world, he says. Instead, some women  may mistakenly enter the "caring professions" because it is expected of them,  rather than through genuine commitment. "Sensitivity and confidence are the  qualities necessary for this job; it doesn't matter what sex midwives are as  long as they really care about what they do."  </P> <P> What attracted Taylor to the profession was the mix of psychological and  physical care. "I've been run off my feet as a midwife, and women can sometimes  be acutely ill in pregnancy, but for the most part pregnant women are well  people who are going through a normal physiological process. You have more time  than in general nursing to concentrate on parent education and physiological  care," he says.  </P> <P> Despite Taylor's insistence on being ordinary, there has been opposition to  male midwifery since the first experimental schemes were set up in two London  and Stirling hospitals in 1976. Men were finally allowed to train and practice  on equal terms with women in September, 1983, but in six years the takeup has  been slow and doubts persist.  </P> <P> Ishbel Kargar, secretary of the 1,200-strong Assn. of Radical Midwives (ARM),  which believes that midwives' traditional skills have been eroded by  technological intervention and the decline in home births, says that some  members regard male midwives with suspicion. "As an association we don't have a  dogmatic view. But some members are violently against the whole idea and  question the reasons for men wanting to get into midwifery. For some men it's a  power trip. Midwifery and child-care have traditionally been women's field and  men have only been involved in positions of power. Sex should not come into it  because most men can be just as caring, but many of them use the qualification  as a step on the promotion ladder."  </P> <P> ARM allows men to become members, but the association's regional groups make  their own rules and only two or three male midwives have joined. In one south  London group they are banned, but this is partly because its meetings take  place in a women's center.  </P> <P> Some members have practical reservations about male midwives, as well as ones  of principle. Kargar says that in times of worsening staff shortages,  chaperoning -- whereby male midwives must be accompanied during procedures such  as internal examinations -- can create problems. Women who might not wish to  have a male midwife might also feel obliged to keep quiet for fear of being a  nuisance in a busy ward, she says.  </P> <P> Taylor, however, thinks that chaperoning can benefit patient and midwife. "If  my integrity were questionable, I would not be employed as a midwife in the  first place. But I have to be protected against accusations that may not have  any grounds, and I believe it is preferable to have someone with you to comfort  the patient. I never do a vaginal examination without first saying that this  can be uncomfortable and undignified, but if you get distressed, then here is  'X' to hold your hand."  </P> <P> Taylor has sympathy with some of ARM's views, but thinks members can be too  hard on men. "I believe that men can be feminists, too, and can have the  interests of women at heart."  </P> <P> Similarly, he feels that some radical midwives go too far on the issue of  intervention-free childbirth. "I'm a supporter of natural childbirth and  believe in women having choices, but you need to strike a balance. In an ideal  world every baby would come out head first, face down, with no distress, but  you get breeches, babies with growth retardation, large babies and small women  -- the list is endless. Yes, be radical, but don't throw all caution to the  wind."  </P> <P> Despite the controversy, Taylor has never had much hassle over his choice of  career. His parents and two sisters were "quietly proud" of his decision, and  he expresses "enormous gratitude" to female colleagues, who have rarely created  problems over his sex.  </P> <P> Patients, too, after the initial surprise, have been supportive. Taylor fully  respects the rights of women who, for religious or other reasons, may not wish  to be attended by a male midwife. But on only one occasion has he had to  withdraw tactfully from the delivery room, sensing that his presence was  causing embarrassment.  </P> <P> After five years in the job, Taylor says it is still "terrific" to witness the  beginning of life. He regrets, however, that no other men have been through the  system at Princess Anne during his time there, and believes they might be  missing out. "I see no reason why men shouldn't become midwives, as long as  they have the right qualities. After all, I'm living proof, aren't I?"  </P></p>

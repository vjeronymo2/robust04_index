			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan, EC fail to agree likely demand for cars JAPAN and the European Community appear to be heading for a clash over automobile trade after failing to reach agreement during two days of talks in Tokyo on the expected outlook for new car demand in Europe next year. Japanese officials said Tokyo expected a slight improvement in the market, while the EC believed the market would decline slightly. European officials refused to comment in detail on the talks, which ended yesterday, but described them as technical in nature and said there were no negotiations on the level of Japanese exports to Europe next year. The two sides agreed to meet again in Brussels in January to try to resolve their differences. However, the difference in forecasts for automobile sales will make it difficult for the two sides to reach agreement on the level of exports. Last April, in view of the weak demand for cars in the EC, Japan agreed to cut 1992 exports to Europe by 6 per cent, from 1.26m vehicles. Japanese automobile companies have seen profits decline sharply this year because of weak markets at home and abroad and will be unhappy to see the level of exports reduced again. Japan and the EC have agreed to a monitoring procedure until 1999 aimed at limiting Japanese exports to Europe and giving European car makers time to improve competitiveness. In the meantime, however, car production by Japanese companies in Europe has begun to rise sharply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor de la Hoz from the "Day to Day" newscast] </F>   [Text] CADE [Annual Conference of Business Executives] 94,  organized by the Panamanian Association of Business Executives  [APEDE], continued today with the participation of the  presidential candidates, who explained their government  platforms.    The first candidate to speak was Ruben Dario Carles of  Change  94. He was followed by Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire  Panamenist Party, then by Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United  People alliance.    Professor Ruben Dario Carles pointed out the previous  government's administrative mistakes in handling public  finances. Carles said that 21 years of military government left  a $7.2-billion financial disaster due to the lack of an  appropriate fiscal policy. The Change 94 candidate stressed that  payment of the foreign debt must be preceded by attention to the  country's social debt.    [Begin Carles recording] There has been an obvious, general  deterioration of basic public services, but this failure is not  the result of a lack of funds. It is due to a lack of  structural efficiency by the government caused in many cases by  legislation imposed by the dictatorship. Gentlemen, forget it;  the government cannot do it all. Those who believe that the  government is going to satisfy everyone who asks for something  are dead wrong. That is impossible. This country is bankrupt  and has no credit. [end recording]    The event is organized by the APEDE and is being held in a  local hotel. Six of the seven presidential candidates are  participating. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber declined to attend.    Doctrinaire Panamenist Party candidate Jose Salvador Munoz  seriously criticized President Guillermo Endara's  administration, calling it a continuation of militarism. He  also said that the country's social problems have not been  solved. Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People alliance  based his speech on giving priority to resolving the country's  social problems as part of his government's platform.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] The potential natural,  human, and financial resources that Panama has available  guarantee an increase in Panamanians' quality of life. The  previously mentioned human development guidelines implicitly  include the adoption of a strategy of equitable economic growth  to serve as a source of and support for the country's overall  development.    In my administration, the economic growth program will mean:    1. [number as heard] The rational and effective use of the  reverted areas and areas that will revert in accordance with the  Torrijos-Carter Treaties. This should allow us to coherently  plan our development model, ensuring that the benefits gained  are accessible to all areas of the country and to all  Panamanians. [end recording]    CADE 94 ends this afternoon.</p>

Such a petition may be granted under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and 49 CFR part 593 if the Registered Importer demonstrates (1) that the vehicle is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) that it is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. Following publication of the notice, Champagne Imports informed NHTSA that it was unable to demonstrate such compliance for the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 and that, accordingly, its petition was being withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA possesses insufficient information to determine independently whether the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards, and therefore will make no decision regarding that vehicle at this time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) and (C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.7; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: May 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

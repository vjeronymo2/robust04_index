			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Pounds 27m expansion at S Wales plant AIWA (UK), the subsidiary of the Japanese audio and video equipment company, is to double the size of its south Wales plant in a Pounds 27m expansion which is expected to create 480 jobs. The plant, at Crumlin, Gwent, is Aiwa's only European factory but there was competition for the investment from other countries, especially Malaysia. It is the single biggest Japanese investment project in Wales for more than two years. The investment is backed by regional selective assistance from the Welsh Office. The Welsh Development Agency will build a 116,000 sq ft extension to the factory, which makes hi-fi systems and video cassette recorders. The workforce is expected to increase to about 1,100 by 1996, making it one of the largest Japanese employers in Wales. About two-thirds of the plant's output is exported to continental Europe with the rest sold in the UK. Work on the factory is expected to start before the end of this year with it coming on-stream 12 months later. It will be the third expansion at Crumlin since Aiwa (UK) first set up there in 1980.</p>

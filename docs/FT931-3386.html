			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar struggles to advance AGREEMENT ON Germany's Solidarity Pact yesterday strengthened expectations on the foreign exchange markets for a cut in the Bundesbank's official lending rates, writes Emma Tucker. Hopes that the German central bank will announce a  1/2 percentage-point reduction in the discount rate on Thursday were buoyed by reports that Germany's political parties, federal states, employers and trade unions had agreed on a public financing package to underpin the east German economy. Initially the US dollar was the chief beneficiary of the news, although by the end of European trading it had failed to break through Friday's close of DM1.6655. Analysts are somewhat bemused as to why the dollar remains trapped in such a narrow trading range after good non-farm payroll figures of a week ago, political unrest in the former Soviet Union and strong prospects for a German rate cut should have combined to give the currency a strong upward boost. Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank in London said: 'I think the markets are getting a bit impatient with the inability of the dollar to move higher, but at the same time no-one has the guts to push it too far down because the expectation is still that it will rally.' Mr Dunis pointed out that the difference between US and German lending rates remains significant as the market waits to see what the Bundesbank will do later this week. The dollar made no gains on the day, ending easier at DM1.6615, and in New York at DM1.6623. The pound did not respond to the growing prospects of German monetary easing, continuing to trade in a very narrow range ahead of today's Budget. Although a cut in German rates would make it easier for the UK authorities to reduce interest rates, the Bank of England and the Treasury have been discouraging expectations of further monetary easing. Official resolve will have been strengthened by yesterday's news that manufacturing output rose a better than expected 0.8 per cent in January. The figure added to evidence that a modest economic recovery is taking place in the UK. The pound lost  1/2 pfennig to close at DM2.3825. Against the dollar it ended barely changed at Dollars 1.4345. Tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism were held at bay. The escudo, which came under pressure at the end of last week following reported differences between the central bank and the government, regained stability. In later trade it eased to just above Es93 per D-Mark. The peseta was also slightly weaker, closing at Pta71.41. The French franc was virtually unchanged at FFr3.401. Potential for strains within the system remain, however, and dealers yesterday warned that failure by the Bundesbank to act on Thursday could put the mechanism's weaker currencies under pressure.</p>

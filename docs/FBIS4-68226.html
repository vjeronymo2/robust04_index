			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reprint of extracts from "Information Memorandum `On State </F> of Affairs in the Northern Fleet,'" followed by commentary by  Colonel Robert Bykov, carried under general heading "Russian  Northern Fleet Is Being Killed Slowly and Tastefully.  Sensational Document Falls Into KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's Hands"]    [Text]  <H5>  Information Memorandum "On State of Affairs in the Northern </H5> Fleet"    1. General Evaluation of the State of the Northern Fleet and  of the Problem of Ensuring the Combat Activity of the Fleet's  Forces and the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their  Families and Civilian Personnel    The Northern Fleet is one of the most powerful and modern of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces' operational-strategic  formations.... At the present time the Northern Fleet is the  only force capable of opposing the NATO countries' naval  groupings in the North Atlantic region.    The fleet's role in, and responsibility for, the defense of  the Russian Federation's economic interests in the transpolar  region is increasing because of the exploitation of oil and gas  reserves on the continental shelf, the protection of fishing,  the escort of transarctic crossings and ships traveling from  Europe to the Far East and Southeast Asia, and also the  provision of reliable cover for access to the world's oceans.    The viability and combat effectiveness of the fleet depend  on  full and timely financing. However, in recent times the Russian  Federation Ministries of Finance and Defense have been  implementing only partial financing of the Northern Fleet. The  shortage of money has led to a 45 percent reduction in the  Northern Fleet's ships and vessels since 1988. Industry  delivers only two combatant ships every year. At the same time  more than 50 ships were decommissioned in 1991-1993. Special  alarm is caused by the state of the recycling of nuclear  submarines, the storage and reprocessing of radioactive waste,  and by questions of radiation and ecological safety. The  irregularity of finance and the inability to pay suppliers is  causing serious breakdowns in the provision of fuels and  lubricants to the fleet. The absence of a mechanism for the  practical implementation of individual articles of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" for the provision  of social and legal guarantees and privileges to servicemen and  their families, and also delays in payment and indexation of  wages and allowances, are having a detrimental effect on the  vital activity and morale of the fleet's naval and civilian  personnel....    The cadre problem has become acute -- as a result of the  exodus of the population from the Kola Peninsula to the  countries of the CIS and the Russian Federation's central  oblasts a great shortage of skilled specialists has arisen in  the maintenance services and subdepartments which ensure the  vital activity of Northern Fleet garrisons. The situation is  exacerbated by the fact that the most qualified specialists are  moving into local administration structures because of the low  level of pay in comparison with similar services in the Russian  Federation's housing and utilities sector.    The difficulties of maintaining the fleet's personnel levels  at full strength are growing. Analysis of the young replacement  recruits arriving on the ships showed a sharp reduction in the  qualities exhibited by draftees. The number of servicemen with  health defects and inadequate physical development has grown  significantly (from 1.2 percent to 6.7 percent), and the number  of new-arrivals with disproportionate heights and weights has  increased. One in five young seamen are guilty of deviant  behavior; one in six were brought up in single-parent families,  mainly by the mother....  <H5>  On Ship Repairs and the Recycling of Ships and Radioactive </H5> Waste    In 1993 the Northern Fleet had 332 ships in need of repair.  These included 35 nuclear submarines, seven diesel submarines,  39 surface ships, and 251 service craft. On the basis of the  quantity of money allocated only 21 combatant ships were sent  for repairs. Thus the fleet's total repair requirements were met  by 27 percent. The repair of auxiliary fleet ships is a cause  for special alarm. With a total requirement of 5.0 billion  rubles [R] and $40 million for these purposes only R283 million  were allocated in 1993, which constitutes 3.8 percent. This  state of affairs could lead to failures in ensuring the fleet's  combat effectiveness by as early as 1995. At the same time it  is essential to bear in mind that as of today 42 percent of  ships have completed their regulation service lives and are  liable to be withdrawn from the fleet, while the period between  repairs has been allowed to overrun for 53 percent of ships.    There are 112 foreign-built ships in the fleet. The routine  repairs of more than 70 of these are overdue. Since 1993 these  ships have ceased to be sent abroad for repairs because of the  lack of hard currency appropriations....    In order to fulfill the recycling program and the START  treaties, appropriations at the level of R899.0 million (in  current prices) are needed. In 1993 the fleet received  R1,566,700,000 (17.4 percent of the sum requested).    A critical situation has arisen in the fleet over the  removal  of spent nuclear fuel. In 1992 the fleet ended the practice of  dumping liquid and solid radioactive waste in the sea. The  temporary storage areas for solid radioactive waste are  completely full....    Because of the absence of finance for the capital  construction of storage facilitiesfor spent nuclear fuels and a  permanent special-purpose wharf [statsionarnyy tekhnologicheskiy  prichal] in the Andreyev and Nerpichye inlets and for the repair  and modernization of the railroad from Kola Station to Nerpichye  Station, the fleet cannot begin the removal of spent nuclear  fuel in the new ecologically safe TK-18 containers....  <H5>  On Missile and Artillery Weapons </H5>   Efficiency in the solution of questions regarding the repair  of missile and artillery weapon components and the replenishment  of spare parts, tools, and accessories kits has sharply  deteriorated. Since January 1991 the Navy Armored Tank Supply  Service has failed to achieve the task of supplying the Northern  fleet with new MAZ-537 tow trucks to replace those whose engine  life has expired.... The fleet has four floating cranes left  which are permitted to be used on operations involving  special-category freights; new ones are not being delivered....  The cranes are being stretched to the maximum. Their failure  would entail the end of work with special-category freights....  The problem of recycling arms and munitions currently in  operation at Northern Fleet bases and storehouses is acute. A  large number of missiles for which there are no carriers has  accumulated....  <H5>  On Mines and Torpedos </H5>   It is essential to accelerate the production of mines and  antimine weapons at the Russian Federation's defense industry  plants in the cities of St. Petersburg, Perm, Votkinsk, and  Yekaterinburg, where the necessary production facilities exist.  This is connected with the fact that the chief plants for the  production of these weapons are in Kazakhstan, and arms  production at them has already ceased. There is no possibility  of replenishing arms reserves in the fleet....  <H5>  On Supplying Fuels and Lubricants </H5>   In connection with the fleet's monetary debts to industrial  enterprises, supplies of petroleum products and solid fuel to  the fleet have virtually ceased. The fleet received 68 percent  of its diesel fuel requirement in 1993. There are not  sufficient tanks to store fuel....  <H5>  On the Maritime Engineering Service </H5>   At the present time worker and employee manning levels in  the  Northern Fleet's communal services stand on average at 20-30  percent. In order to maintain the stock of housing and barracks  and communal facilities in proper running order the command  authorities have been forced to divert personnel to the  aforementioned work. This is seriously detrimental to the  combat training and combat readiness of the fleet's units.  Given the existing personnel shortage (around 40 percent),  people are being seriously physically overstretched....    In view of the manning levels and the technical condition of  the ships, the fleet is delivering only 36 percent of the  planned level of stocks, including 50 percent (52,000 tonnes) of  liquid fuel requirements and 17 percent (15,000) of dry freight  requirements by means of its own resources; hence the fleet is  forced every year to hire ships from civilian ship owners, which  requires additional monetary expenditure, including of hard  currency. The fleet does not have ships of its own capable of  transporting the necessary amount of freight. Of the 50  transport ships the fleet needs, it actually has just 35 (70  percent), among which 19 (54 percent) have completed their  regulation service lives and are due to be written off.  <H5>  On Clothing Supplies </H5>   At the present time, because of shortfalls in supplies from  industry of a large number of items of military dress, the  situation as regards the provision of clothing to the fleet's  forces remains tense. Thus, for example, supplies of fur  jackets for submariners meet 1 percent of requirements, supplies  of footwear, 76 percent of requirements.  <H5>  On Food Supplies </H5>   The nonfulfillment of the Russian Federation President's  directive "On the Abolition of Advance Payment for Products  (Commodities) Delivered to Regions of the Far North and  Equivalent Localities" is leading to increasing difficulties in  providing food for personnel.    The safekeeping of food is a pressing problem, owing to the  shortage of storage capacities. In individual garrisons there  are shortages of up to 30 percent of the storehouses, depots,  and refrigerators that are required. The material-technical  base of military trade remains a tricky problem. In garrisons  in Pechenga, Vysokiy, Kilp-Yavr, Afrikanda, Korzunovo, and  Kildin Island, and others, 70 percent of enterprises are housed  in delapidated, unadapted premises built before the war.  <H5>  On the Provision of Housing </H5>   The Northern Fleet has a sufficient material and technical  base and sufficient personnel to construct and commission the  necessary facilities.... However, questions of funding housing  construction today encroach extremely painfully on the interests  not only of people, but also of production units. Social  tension is growing in the labor collectives of  "Sevvoyenmorstroy"....  <H5>  On Ensuring the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their </H5> Families    The adoption of a package of laws on the social protection  of  servicemen and their families has been positively received in  the Northern Fleet. However, the adopted laws of the "military"  package are not yet operating fully....  <H5>  On Closed Administrative-Territorial Enities </H5>   The majority of the Northern Fleet's remote garrisons have  the status of closed administrative-territorial entities. The  peculiarities of life in these entities require an increased  level of budget finance and additional social protection  measures, privileges, and guarantees provided at state level.  Analysis shows that the Russian Federation Law "On the Closed  Administrative-Territorial Entity" is not being fully  implemented.    Appeals received from inhabitants of the cities of  Murmansk-140, Murmansk-150, and the settlement of Vidyayevo  reflect the most typical socioeconomic problems of the Northern  Fleet's remote garrisons. These appeals (they are forwarded to  the apparatus of the Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government) demand the adoption of additional measures  to ensure the implementation of the law.  <H5>  Our Commentary </H5>   The Northern Fleet was in 1993 recognized as the best fleet  of the Russian Federation. The authors of the memorandum --  high-ranking Russian military men -- try in the language of  facts and figures to explain to the State Duma and the minister  of defense that the country could soon be deprived of its most  combat-effective fleet, and thus by the end of the century be  without a proper maritime strategic defense system.  Unfortunately, this is happening at a time when, in accordance  with the START-II treaty, the proportion of the sea-launched  grouping of ICBM's in Russia is doubling. Perhaps the situation  in the world has thawed to such a degree that other countries  have kissed their navies goodbye? It would appear not: In the  United States, for example, more than 100 ships are being  commissioned in 1993-1995, including three aircraft carriers,  seven missile-carrying submarines, 18 nuclear multi-purpose  submarines, eight cruisers, 16 destroyers, three amphibious  warships, three acoustic research ships, and seven tankers.  This is no accident: Any state that pretends to the role of a  great power must ensure its naval power.    So, is it possible to resolve the Northern Fleet's problems  under real economic conditions? One method was proposed at a  session of the Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security  held 28 April under the chairmanship of A. Kokoshin. The  proposal was to derive funds to set up a new infrastructure for  the Northern Fleet on the basis of "centers of growth" of  industrial production and the diversification of  military-industrial complex enterprises and through the  subsequent increase of the tax base and the influx of private  money. The minimum number of ultramodern combatant ships in the  fleet will be determined on the basis of national security  interests, and the full support of these ships with auxiliary  vessels and shore services should eliminate the disproportion  between the combatant ships' requirements and the possibilities  of servicing them. All the same the impression arises that  moods leading, to put it mildly, to the underestimation of the  role of a strong Navy -- which is designed to support Russia's  strategic interests -- have gained the upper hand in the  country's military-political leadership. All the attention of  several Ministry of Defense leaders is today focused on mobile  forces, and the backbone of these forces -- Airborne Troops,  which are intended to be the basis of Russia's military might.  However, it is no secret that mobile forces are designed  primarily for fighting an internal enemy. Does this mean that  danger to Russia from without no longer exists?</p>

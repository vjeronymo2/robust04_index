			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Qantas to axe 1,835 in cost-cutting programme QANTAS, the government-controlled Australian airline, plans to make 9 per cent of its workforce redundant over the next two years to help cut costs by ADollars 158m (USDollars 108.9m) a year. Yesterday's announcement follows a review by Coopers and Lybrand, the accounting firm, which said the 1,835 redundancies would save ADollars 95m a year. The remainder of the savings are to be achieved by increasing efficiency. The review was set up after the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline, in September. The two airlines have already shed a total 5,000 staff in the past 18 months. Mr John Ward, Qantas chief executive, said the savings were essential to increase efficiency in the run up to the flotation of the government's 75 per cent shareholding, expected later this year. 'The Qantas group can currently be counted among the top 10 airlines in the world. The simple truth is that we must continue to improve our productivity by 5 per cent per year to retain this position,' he said. Mr Ward said Qantas would shortly begin discussions on potential synergies with British Airways, which recently acquired a a 25 per cent stake in the airline. He said the discussions could lead to further job losses. Qantas said it hoped the trade unions would co-operate with the redundancy programme, which will be delayed until early next month to give them time to respond. The airline hopes to achieve at least 60 per cent of the job losses through voluntary redundancy. Qantas recorded a net profit of ADollars 137m in 1991-92, but Australian suffered a loss of ADollars 38.4m, mainly because of recession and fare-cutting following the deregulation of Australian domestic aviation in 1990.</p>

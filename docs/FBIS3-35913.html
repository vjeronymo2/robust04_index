			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondents Ssevindzh Adullayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 31 Jan -- Talks between Gasan Gasanov,  Azerbaijan foreign minister, and Vladimir Kazimirov, special  envoy of the Russian president and Russia's roving ambassador,  lasted more than two hours behind "closed doors" today. The  Russian diplomat, who arrived in the republican capital after  visiting Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, brought a draft agreement  on cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    In an interview with journalists after completing the talks  Vladimir Kazimirov stressed that during his trip to the region  the issues raised at the recent meetings in Moscow of the  Russian foreign minister with the heads of the foreign political  departments of Azerbaijan and Armenia were discussed. In his  view, the positions of the sides involved in confrontation  remain inflexible. He expressed the hope that, as an initial  measure, an accord on a general cease-fire will be reached  tonight.    According to Gasan Gasanov, Azerbaijan would benefit from  signing an agreement on truce, either short or long-term. The  republic, he stressed, adheres to a position of political  peaceful settlement to the conflict. If Armenia undertakes to  withdraw its troops from Azerbaijan, the latter, in turn, is  ready to "immediately start talks and sign an agreement," the  minister said. At the same time, touching upon Armenia's  position, the head of the republican foreign political  department noted that it has not changed significantly and  remains inflexible. "Armenia is still trying to talk to  Azerbaijan from a position of strength," Gasan Gasanov stressed.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> SHRIMPS IN HIGHWAYS SERIES  </P> <P> When they're really cooking, members of the local performance art group Shrimps  can reveal antic and unexpected connections among sports, games, everyday  behavior and stereotypic gender roles.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, very little of that happened when the group entered the final  round of the current "Dance Traffic" series Thursday at Highways in Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> (The final performance is tonight.)  </P> <P> In their most focused and tightly organized work, "Scrap" (from 1987), men in  business suits (Ryan Hill, Martin Kersels and Steven Nagler) and women in  athletic shorts and shirts (Weba Garretson and Cindy Furchner) turned the  dribbling of basketballs into competitive challenges, dodgeball games,  strip-tease acts and wrestling bouts. Somehow, the evolution looked inevitable.  Nothing seemed arbitrary.  </P> <P> Described as a work in progress from which excerpts were drawn, "Tongue," not  surprisingly, failed at this stage to cohere very much. More links occurred  through its use of shadow-theater techniques (including wicked projections of  simulated sex acts) than by its thematic gender reversal obsessions. (Alder  Dixon and Nicole Soulanille joined the others for the piece.)  </P> <P> "Looks" (1990), however, had no excuse for its sprawling, indulgent messiness.  By now, seeing the boys mincing about in various degrees of stripped-down drag  and the girls flexing their powerhouse muscles had become routine, and antic  gave way to frantic. Or maybe, desperate.  </P> <P> The girls looked up the boys' dresses, the boys played pick-up sticks with  brooms, everyone carried or pushed or posed with or hurled down giant gourds.  At the end, the men were vanquished, the women triumphed, the gourds were ready  for puree.  </P> <P> Pamela Casey choreographed "Tongue" and "Looks." Steve Stewart and Mark Wheaton  composed serviceable music for "Tongue" and, with Garretson, for "Looks." CHRIS  PASLES  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>   [Text] The cabinet meeting has ended. Major General Dani  Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the  territories, presented the ministers with a gloomy report on the  territories. The economic situation there is deteriorating, Arab  laborers are not being employed within the Green Line, there are  difficulties in exporting agricultural produce, and the promises  to send funds to the territories have not been met. The clear  outcome of all this is an erosion of support for the Israeli-PLO  agreement. We must remind you that the Taba talks resume  tomorrow against that gloomy background, and they will be  extensive, at least according to Minister Yosi Sarid:    [Begin Sarid recording] I heard optimistic evaluations by  PLO spokesmen about the talks lasting two or three weeks. I  would gladly join in their optimism, but knowing all the  problems from close up, I am not so sure that we are talking  about two or three weeks. I would be very pleased if that  happens, but I believe that six to eight weeks is more  reasonable. If I am proved wrong, I will be the first to be  pleased. [end recording]    Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer hopes an agreement will be  reached in Taba.    [Begin Ben-Eli'ezer recording] The message that emerges from  the cabinet meeting is that we welcome the resumption of the  talks, and hope with all our hearts that this time the  Palestinians will realize that time is critical and that Israel  is not prepared to give up one iota on security-related issues.  At the same time, however, we want to enter into talks which  will lead to the implementation of the agreement. [end  recording]    We should recall the remarks made by Foreign Minister  Shim'on  Peres a week ago. He said that Israel will not bank on the  issues on which agreement was reached in Cairo -- the scope of  the withdrawal in Jericho and the procedures for border  crossings at the bridges.    Shim'on Shetrit referred to the bazaar atmosphere that  characterizes the negotiations and makes progress very  difficult. He said the Palestinians do not understand that a  handshake and oral agreements are binding.    [Begin Shetrit recording] In the future, I hope that those  who conduct the negotiations will understand that we are dealing  with an eastern bazaar, in which the other side tries to extract  as much as possible all the time. Second, in reference to the  formal procedure of approval by the other side, we need Yasir  'Arafat's signature on the document, otherwise he will say it is  not binding. [end recording]    To return to Minister Sarid, who referred to the reports  about an intention to uproot settlements, and specifically the  plan to uproot Netzarim.    [Begin Sarid recording] I do not know what will happen in  the future, but I know -- and say so in the most authoritative  way -- that in the current Jericho-Gaza First negotiations there  is no talk about transferring or uprooting settlements.  Therefore, any report that says otherwise is baseless. [end  recording]    In other words, the government plans to leave Netzarim where  it is at this stage.    Something else raised in the cabinet meeting were trips to  China, which has become the most attractive destination for  ministers. Foreign Minister Peres criticized his colleagues for  going there en masse. Those who have so far been there are  Rabin, Peres, and Ben-Eli'ezer, while those planning to go are  Mikha Harish, Avraham Shohat, and Shim'on Shetrit. We will wait  and see if Peres' call works.</p>

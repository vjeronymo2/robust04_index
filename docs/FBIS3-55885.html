Lukyanov is convinced that social stabilization  largely depended on the policies pursued by the Russian  president and was possible if the hopeless shock therapy was  brushed away.    Leader of the Democratic Party, Nikolay Travkin, told  Interfax that the current State Duma was the weakest legislative  body in Soviet and Russian history. He said that the Soviet  parliament was the strongest. The radical moods have triumphed  and society has elected the most radical deputies to the  parliament, he said. He noted, however, that the deputies'  rigid organization and experience were the new parliament's  strong points.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Democratic Party,  who scored the greatest number of votes among the deputies  representing political parties (23 percent), does not intend to  discuss the October events or the legitimacy of the adopted  Constitution as opposition deputies propose. "We must carry  on," he told Interfax. Speaking about possible candidates to the  post of the State Duma's chairman, Zhirinovskiy said that he  would not vote for anyone except the representative of his  faction, Vladimir Gusev. (Gusev was born in 1932. He is the  vice president of the scientific and industrial corporation  "Promyshlennik").    Yegor Gaydar, the leader of the Russia's Choice faction,  said  in an interview with Interfax that he did not support the idea  of setting up a parliamentary commission for investigating the  events in Moscow on October 3 and 4. He believes that the  establishment of such a commission would violate the principle  of division of power. He also said that his faction would  support the candidacy of Russian ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir  Lukin (the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc) to the post of the  State Duma's chairman, although his faction was ready to support  any other acceptable neutral candidate.    Another representative of Russia's Choice, Mikhail  Poltoranin, stated that his faction would propose the candidacy  of Sergey Kovalyov, a prominent human rights activist who led  Russia's Choice during the elections. Poltoranin believes that  if Kovalyov fails to score enough votes, his faction would vote  for Lukin.    Chairman of the Karelian parliament and member of the  Federation Council, Viktor Stepanov, believes that the post of  speaker has been reserved for Moscow's representative. He also  believes that this post will be contested by First Vice Premier  Vladimir Shumeyko and ex-chairman of the Moscow Council Nikolay  Gonchar. Stepanov told Interfax, however, that the choice of  the parliament speaker was the most acute problem and that  debates would last for several days.    Stepanov does not rule out the possibility of creating  factions in the Federation Council. In his opinion factions  will be created on the basis of territorial and political  principles. He also noted that representatives of the republics  would pursue the policy of broadening and strengthening  federalism.    President of Kalmykia and member of the Federation Council  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov supports the idea of setting up a  parliamentary commission for investigating the events in Moscow  last October. He told journalists that the government's actions  during those events must be qualified as anti-constitutional.    Ilyumzhinov believes that the Federation Council must ensure  the consolidation of society, which is blighted with a deep  crisis. "If economic recession continues and living standards  continue to fall, social tremors will become inevitable," he  said.</p>

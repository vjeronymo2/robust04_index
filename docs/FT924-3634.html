			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / CBI attacks EC proposal on data law A BRUSSELS-inspired measure to ease the flow of information across national boundaries by harmonising national data protection laws will cost UK businesses millions of pounds, the Confederation of British Industry warned today. It said the measure, a directive working its way through the European Commission's labyrinthine machinery, demanded unnecessarily high levels of protection. Ms Judith Vincent, head of the CBI's law department, said the regulations in the proposed directive were over-detailed. She said: 'It will cost firms millions of pounds in gearing up to comply with the law and in ongoing compliance costs. Cost will arise from increased staffing and record keeping.' The directive, she said, had implications for all companies' customer, personnel and other records containing personal data. It would particularly affect Telecommunications, banking, insurance and travel companies. It could, for example, make it unlawful for a bank to send customers details of a new service without first obtaining the customers' permission. The proposed directive has been a source of controversy since its introduction in September 1990. It was prompted by concerns about the ease with which information held on computers can be manipulated and transmitted. Charities, direct marketing companies, airlines and banks were among the industries that successfully lobbied MEPs into submitting more than 150 amendments when the directive had its first reading last February. Brussels argued that without data protection harmonisation, countries with established legislation such as the UK and Germany might restrict the movement of data to less well protected countries, fearing that it might be misused. Opponents of the directive said the Commission had placed protection of the individual above the need to ensure an open market. The CBI is complaining first about a regulation requiring that consent be obtained from individuals for the use of their names and addresses and other personal data. It says it is bureaucratic and potentially costly to carry out. Second, it is concerned that the directive will apply to manual data not held on a computer system.</p>

			<p>Decline   <F P=102>   944Q0339A Moscow FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA in Russian 7-13 Apr  94 p 2 </F>  <F P=103> 944Q0339A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Mayya Lomidze: "RAMSIR Worried About </F> Its Fate"]    [Text] In the past six months there has been a considerable  decrease in the volume of foreign investments in Russian  industry. As compared with August 1993, investments have dropped  to one-tenth of the previous amount, from $115.7 million to  $13.8 million. In December the share of foreign capital in the  capital stock of SP [joint ventures] constituted 30-40 percent,  as compared with 80 percent in July. In the opinion of certain  Western businessmen, the reason for this decline was not only  the instability of the political situation and the imperfect  nature of legislation, but also the unexpected reorganizations  in the agencies of administration.    The edict entitled "The Restructuring of the Federal  Agencies  of Administration," which was signed in January 1994,  essentially eliminates the only agency that used to carry out a  more or less consistent investment policy. In accordance with  the president's order, the Russian Agency for International  Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) is transferred to the  jurisdiction of MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations]  "with transformation into a state enterprise."    Thus, the work of improving the state registry of  enterprises  is indefinitely postponed. No one knows which department will  engage in the registration of the major investment agreements or  who will guarantee the work of the Commission on Humanitarian  Assistance to Russia, under the RF government.    Currently the government is working on the drafts of edicts  entitled "Procedure for State Registration of Enterprises and  Physical Entities Engaging in Entrepreneurial Activity" and  "Encouraging the Attracting of Foreign Investments Into the  Priority Branches of the National Economy." The president's  administration is preparing a federal investment plan for 1994.  However, if the tendency to "dissipate the functions" of one  department among several others is preserved, one would scarcely  expect those legislative drafts to be effective.    In the opinion of V. Korolev, deputy chairman of RAMSIR, the  actual elimination of the agency will result in the further drop  in investments. Potential investors once again will encounter  complete confusion when one ministry will engage in providing  informational support, another ministry will engage in the  registration of enterprises, and a third one will engage in  export-import problems.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greenwich Comms loss at Pounds 65,300 Greenwich Communications, the USM-quoted supplier of satellite receiving equipment, reported a slight increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 57,500 to Pounds 65,300 in the year ended August 31, 1993. Turnover dropped from Pounds 421,700 to Pounds 261,800, while at the attributable level, after minorities, losses were cut to Pounds 59,700 (Pounds 63,000) or from 0.9p to 0.85p per share. Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said that the Portuguese offshoot, Greenwich Satellite Portugal LDA, was still suffering from recession. In addition, NEC had decided to withdraw its satellite receiving products during the year, but Greenwich was now awaiting the introduction of a new product at the end of the year. Possible litigation from former director Mr J Carrad and his wife, relating to the company's investment in DRL Communications - now in receivership - had not progressed much further, Mr Stirling said. An extension of time had been granted to them, but full particulars of their claim had still not yet been served.</p>

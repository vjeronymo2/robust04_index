			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Matsushita in Chinese phone pager venture MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's biggest consumer electronics company, yesterday agreed to a telephone pager manufacturing joint venture with three Chinese companies. The venture should help Matsushita consolidate its leading position in the Chinese market for pagers. Matsushita sold 150,000 pagers in China in 1990, out of a total estimated market of 200,000 units, and last year sold 200,000 pagers. Pagers in China are popular because of the slow development of the telephone network. Rather than wait for a telephone, many Chinese are receiving messages by pager. The company is to be called Beijing Matsushita Communication Equipment. Fifty per cent is to be owned by MEI and Matsushita Communication Industrial, with the other half owned by China National Posts and Telecommunications Industry, China National Postal and Telecommunications Appliances, and Beijing Telecommunication Components Factory. The company is capitalised at Dollars 2.94m (Pounds 1.7m). Production of pagers, which will have liquid crystal displays, is to start in July.</p>

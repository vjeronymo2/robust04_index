			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TRADING in the derivatives markets continued flat yesterday with the futures ominously breaching new resistance levels, writes Christopher Price. The June contract opened at what was to be its highest level of the session  -2,815 - before buyers moved in and the contract was quickly sold down. Although June found some support at the 2,800-mark - a renowned technical support level - it then proceeded to breach that to head further southwards. Dealers said that sentiment in the futures continued largely negative, not helped by the Royal Insurance rights issue and the feeling that the market is short of liquidity. June struck 2,784, its low of the day, at around lunchtime, before some buyers began to be seen, and the contract began a slow recovery. Even so, it never gained parity with its fair value level of around 7, instead trading at a 3-5 point discount for most of the day. June closed at 2,796, 23 down on the previous close and 6 points off its fair value. Turnover was 8,195 contracts, some 250 down on the previous session. In the traded options market, the total turnover of 27,744 was well up on Monday's closing figure. BAT Industries topped the stock list with 2,831 traded, followed by bid favourite United Biscuits on 2,037, Boots on 1,811 and Glaxo on 1,359.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev May 19 TASS -- "When electing Aleksandr Moroz  chairman of the supreme soviet of Ukraine, deputies were guided,  in my view, not only by political considerations but also by  their own opinion of the personality of the contender",  President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine said in reply to a question  by ITAR-TASS about his attitude towards Wednesday elections.    During four years of work in the previous composition of the  supreme soviet, Aleksandr Moroz was taking an active position in  the parliament, had his own point of view on political, economic  and legal problems of current life and upheld them quietly and  with good reasoning, the president noted.    "I do not remember a case when he offended someone in the  heat of a debate or showed haste in making decisions. By having  elected Aleksandr Moroz deputies hope that he will be able to  unite all of them for constructive work," Leonid Kravchuk  pointed out.    "For me this is also a determining factor. We may have  unlike and even quite different viewpoints on processes of  social life but the main thing for us is Ukraine with its 52  million population. We will be guided by these considerations  in the future," the Ukrainian president stressed.    Leonid Kravchuk expressed the hope for fruitful cooperation  with the new head of the parliament. "If a man has no vanity but  has self-control, his own stand and appropriate culture, it is  always possible to find common ground with him," the Ukrainian  president noted.</p>

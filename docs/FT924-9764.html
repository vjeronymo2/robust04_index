			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Major's shaky authority faces moment of truth - Richard Ryder, the government's chief whip, has presided over a concerted lobbying effort by ministers as the government has sought to head off the biggest uprising by Tory MPs since John Major became premier MR JOHN MAJOR must win. A victory over his party's Euro-sceptics will not in itself restore the shaky authority of his government, but it is an essential precondition. That much was agreed by the prime minister's friends and enemies at Westminster on the eve of today's vote. If he loses, his colleagues will urge him to soldier on. But loyalty is not an adequate substitute for the widespread conviction that his government's authority would be fatally undermined. The Euro-sceptics deny it publicly, but acknowledge privately that they are ready to wreck Mr Major's premiership. Ironically, the actual vote has no legal significance. It was promised by Mr Major after the Danish referendum - a device to placate Tory Euro-sceptics before Labour had swapped its conversion to Europeanism for the more familiar politics of opportunism. The motion for debate calls simply for the MPs to give the go-ahead for consideration in its detailed committee stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. Labour's amendment says that it should be delayed until after the Edinburgh summit. But the legislation has passed its second reading, so, win or lose today, Mr Major could technically press ahead whenever he wished. Defeat would deprive him of moral authority. In politics, that is far more important than legal niceties. He would no longer be in charge of his party. His foreign policy would lie in ruins alongside the economic policy that perished on Black Wednesday. At best, the prime minister could hope to bring the Maastricht bill back after next month's summit. More practically, it is hard to see how the process could resume until next year. Downing Street has retreated awkwardly from the suggestion that defeat would prompt a general election. It is true that each and every one of Mr Major's cabinet signed up to the strategy behind today's debate, some albeit reluctantly. But it has been impossible to find one of them who believes that losing today would be sufficient cause to issue an open invitation to Mr John Smith to win an election. Mr Major's own position is more difficult. In private as well as public, he has made clear that Maastricht is about both Britain's place in Europe and his personal authority. He has suggested that the rejection of the treaty would be an historic mistake comparable to Britain's decision not to sign the Treaty of Rome. He regards the struggle as a fight for the soul of the Conservative party. He has said that if it is not willing to trust him to defend Britain's self-interest in Europe then it had better find someone else. The prime minister has made the direct link between Europe and the economy. His economic strategy was destroyed by sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Now the new emphasis on recovery, based on temporary indifference to the level of the exchange rate and further cuts in interest rates depends for its success on a restoration of political confidence. So if his party acts in a way that suggests it is ungovernable, Mr Major might stand down. There will be no direct pressure to do so from his colleagues. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the most powerful and one of the most pro-European member of the prime minister's cabinet, is his most obvious successor, but he would not wield the dagger. The Euro-sceptics and their Thatcherite colleagues have no credible candidate of their own. If Mr Major wins, he will have the chance to salvage his government. It will not be easy. The economic outlook remains bleak, the Euro-sceptics promise trench warfare when the Maastricht bill returns, the council tax is beginning to look like an unexploded bomb. This week's cabinet sessions underline the difficulties the government will face in meeting its Pounds 244.5bn public spending target. One senior minister at the centre of the storm confessed recently that it was 'madness' to stick to a figure agreed when all were convinced that economic recovery was under way. But like DM2.95 before it, it had become a totem from which the government could not budge. Creative accounting will ease some pressure, but the Autumn Statement next week may foreshadow another stream of Tory rebellions like that over the coal industry. An unaccustomed victory instead of a defeat for the prime minister would bring the possibility also that the Conservative party might come to its collective senses. The disgruntled and disenchanted on the back benches may realise that rebellions harm no one but their own party and their own leader. Mr Major would have a breathing space during which the economy might yet show signs of life; and a chance at least to begin the painstaking process of rebuilding his authority.</p>

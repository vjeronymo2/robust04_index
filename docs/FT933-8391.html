			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Observer: Over zealous No wonder President Bill Clinton is taking so long filling the empty posts in his administration. Shirley Chater, President Clinton's candidate to head the Social Security Administration, seems to be running into some difficulty after admitting that she failed to pay social security taxes for her part-time teenage babysitters between 1969 and 1975. It might sound a terrible crime to non-Americans but on the scale of US tax evasion it is not worth mentioning. Indeed, if this litmus test were used to bar all candidates for high office then the US administration might have to consider importing candidates from abroad.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / S Africa probes state role in activist's death A South African prosecutor said yesterday he was examining new evidence of a state role in the 1985 killing of prominent black activist Matthew Goniwe. Mr Michael Hodgen said a special police team interviewed unidentified witnesses provided by newspapers including Johannesburg's Weekly Mail, Reuter reports from Cape town. 'Our police investigations team. . . is evaluating the allegations made. It is premature to prejudge what the result of the investigation will be,' Mr Hodgen said. The Weekly Mail said it had submitted evidence including the names of state hit-squad members responsible for the murder of Goniwe and colleagues on a remote highway north of Port Elizabeth. Goniwe was among a handful of black leaders who helped to launch a nationwide uprising against white minority rule. The New Nation newspaper published an alleged death warrant earlier this year signed by a senior police officer and ordering that Goniwe be 'permanently removed from society'. President FW de Klerk ordered Mr Hodgen to reopen inquiries into Goniwe's killing, which had been dismissed by an earlier inquest as murder 'by persons unknown'. The Weekly Mail said its evidence pointed to the now disbanded Civil Co-operation Bureau, a secret army unit formed to counter opposition abroad but also deployed to discredit domestic opponents of apartheid, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Johannesburg's Sowetan newspaper said Mr Hodgen had uncovered documents placing former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok, now the minister responsible for prisons, at a State Security Council meeting debating Goniwe's fate days before he died.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Observer: Hitting the target Ever since NatWest chairman Lord Alexander asked for the re-opening of the DTI inquiry into the bank's role in the Blue Arrow affair, the writing has been on the wall for poor old Tom Frost. How could he continue to fulfil the role of group chief executive and devote sufficient time to keeping the inspectors happy? Nevertheless, the scale of NatWest's break with the past is breathtaking. It has leapfrogged two generations and appointed a young man as chief executive who was not even on the board a year ago. Derek Wanless is younger than John Reed was when he took over the reins at Citicorp in 1984, and that experiment in rejuvenating the top management of a big bank can hardly be regarded a total success. If NatWest is so desperate to find an executive untainted by the Blue Arrow affair then Wanless is the right man. His other plus point is that he has made his name in UK retail banking, the very area that should be NatWest's greatest strength. He has not been long enough in the higher echelons of the bank to be seduced by some of NatWest's more wayward dreams. The downside is that he is undoubtedly clever and this is not always good in a straightforward business like banking. Equally important, it is not clear that he has the leadership qualities to rebuild morale of this once great bank.</p>

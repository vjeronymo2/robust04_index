			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dutch name sell-off brokers The Dutch government yesterday named a troika comprised of brokerage houses Morgan Stanley International, SG Warburg and Credit Suisse First Boston to lead the first tranche of the privatisation of the Dutch postal and telecommunications monopoly abroad, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. The Dutch transport and finance ministries said the latest step has completed the basic structure needed for the flotation of the state-owned telecom company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN). The flotation of the first tranche, likely to be 25-30 per cent of the total share capital, is expected in the first half of next year and is by some analysts estimated to gross around Fl 4bn (Dollars 2bn) to Fl 5bn. The names of other banks to be appointed to the syndicate that will finally carry out the flotation will be announced in March.</p>

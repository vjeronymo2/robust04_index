			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall and John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A few hundred students at Beijing University  observed the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre last night  by holding a silent vigil. At midnight, all lights were on at  the post-graduate dormitories of the university and many  students were seen standing out on the balconies.    Earlier, authorities at the university, the centre of the  1989 democracy movement called a meeting of the students to  ferret out those responsible for passing out commemorative  leaflets.    Security at all of Beijing's major universities was very  tight with no non-university personnel being allowed on campus  without first undergoing a rigorous interrogation and  registration process.    Last night, police roadblocks cordoned off the entire  university area in Haidian District, stopping foreigners' cars  -- distinguished by their black licence plates -- from entering.  Every intersection in the college district was guarded by about  half a dozen police. At least two truckloads of the  para-military People's Armed Police were seen patrolling around  Beijing University.    Throughout yesterday, the police apparatus threw a tight  security net over Beijing, covering Tiananmen Square with  uniformed and plain-clothes police, cutting off dissidents'  telephones, and banning gatherings. Tiananmen Square was  swamped with plain-clothes and uniformed police officers  yesterday morning. Hundreds of plainclothes officers -- some  disguised as tourists, others not even bothering to conceal  their identity -- patrolled the square all day.    As soon as foreigners entered the square, they were  immediately followed and videotaped by police armed with a wide  variety of cameras, walkie-talkies, and mobile phones.    Three journalists from the American television network CBS,  who shot some film on the square yesterday morning, were  detained by police and questioned for two hours. All their  videotape was confiscated.    Many people had been told by their work units to stay away  from the square during the anniversary.    A screening of the film Farewell to My Concubine at the  Sino-Japanese Youth Exchange Centre last night was cancelled.  Callers to the cinema were told it was because the theatre had  no electricity. However, it appeared the cinema was following  orders from the police.    Dissident Professor Ding Zilin and her husband Jiang Peikun  went on a three-day fast on Thursday night to protest against  the heavy police surveillance under which they have lived since  May 20 and to commemorate those who died five years ago. The  couple lost their 17-year-old son, Jiang Jielian.    The switchboard at People's University, where the couple  live  and where they used to teach, cut off their telephone line on  Thursday at noon. But one caller managed to persuade the  operator to put a call through yesterday morning. "My son was  shot between 11.05 and 11.15 on June 3. I don't know when he  actually stopped breathing but I'll continue to fast until June  4 because I want to commemorate others who died with him,"  Professor Ding, who has a heart problem, said.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Children's cartoons help video sales surge The story of Mowgli, a boy brought up by some kindly wolves, a conscientious panther called Bagheera and a happy-go-lucky bear named Baloo helped boost UK video sales by 27 per cent last year to Pounds 662m. The Walt Disney version of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book appeared in video form last October. By Christmas it had sold 4.9m copies, making it Britain's best-selling video. Jungle Book provided a substantial boost to what the industry calls 'sell-through' - outright sale of videos as opposed to rental. Jungle Book and several other Disney stories helped children's videos to capture 37 per cent of the UK market, overtaking feature-film videos for the first time. The viewers might have been children, but the buyers were parents who first saw many of the films in the cinema when they were children. Jungle Book made its cinema debut in 1968. Disney's Peter Pan, another of last year's best-selling videos, first appeared in the cinema in 1953. Other best-sellers, all Disney products, were Beauty and the Beast and The Muppet Christmas Carol. The British Video Association said 60m videos were sold last year, 25 per cent more than in 1992. This means the number of videos sold exceeded music cassette sales for the first time. The number of cassettes sold last year was 55.7m. Video sales are, however, still some way behind compact discs, which sold 92.2m last year. Ms Lavinia Carey, the association's director-general, said: 'Long gone are the days when the video industry could be regarded as a poor relation of the cinema or record industry. It has grown up much faster than its elders and there is no reason to think this will not continue.' The association said feature films accounted for 35 per cent of the video market, with The Bodyguard, starring Kevin Costner, at the top of the list. Videos of television programmes accounted for 10 per cent. Sport and fitness videos made up 5 per cent of sales, with Cher Fitness topping the charts. Music videos accounted for 4.5 per cent of sales, with the Manchester band Take That producing the best-seller.</p>

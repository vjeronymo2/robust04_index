			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Dixons to open specialist stores Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, is launching a new store called The Link, claimed to be the first specialist retailer of a range of communications, entertainment and information networks and services. Although it will also sell equipment, The Link's main focus will be helping customers select and sign-up to services such as mobile telephone networks, satellite and cable television networks and on-line computer services - the first time all these services have been marketed under one roof. Dixons says that being a retailer of the latest technology means more than selling hardware such as video recorders or computers. It also means combining access to a network with a piece of equipment. This calls for a different store environment, with information and demonstrations provided by specialist staff. 'These products and services will be one of the fastest-growing consumer markets of the next few years', says John Clare, Dixons' chief executive. Sarah Carpenter, special projects director at Dixons, says The Link is unlike any retail format she has encountered in Europe or the US. It could help Dixons become a leading marketeer of interactive communications services as these develop. The group is opening four Link stores in the London area, starting with Kingston on October 31, then Enfield, Chiswick and Lewisham. Four more open next February and the group will decide next May whether to extend the chain. Although it acquired the Currys and PC World chains, and Silo in the US  - later sold - this is the first time Dixons has launched a new concept. Ideas for The Link developed out of plans for a mobile telephone shop. Stores will have large central desks, giving customers space to fill in applications for services, assisted by staff. The walls will carry information boards and hardware that can be tried out. A mobile communications area will offer details of consumer equipment, networks and tariffs - including Mercury One2One, Orange, Cellnet and Vodafone. The pager area will offer both conventional pagers and services, and new 'calling-party pays' pagers, such as Mercury MiniCall and Swatch's new wristwatch pager, The Beep. A section devoted to satellite television will include five bays where customers can view different channels. Dixons hopes later to include cable TV operators. A telephone area will sell a wide range of faxes, and will also market BT network services, such as call waiting, call diversion, and caller number display - the first time BT has sold such services through a third party. A final section will be devoted to on-line computer services, including Delphi and CompuServe - both offering exclusive services such as computer shopping, plus a gateway to Internet, the global computer network - and Tel-me, a network aimed at business users. Dixons has not always enjoyed the best reputation for customer service, but says The Link's staff have been specially selected and given a three-week course including instruction by service providers. Stores will earn a normal retail margin on hardware, and agency fees or commission on sales of services. Sarah Carpenter says that Dixons was selling some services in its other stores, but that these were not equipped to capitalise on the opportunity. Many consumers signed-up for services in specialist outlets, some run by service-providers themselves, or answered ads in newspapers or magazines.</p>

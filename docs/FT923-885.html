			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften THE RATES for short-dated money in the sterling cash market softened yesterday after a Pounds 1.5bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed by midday. Otherwise, trading in both the interbank and futures markets was quiet after the whirlwind of recent weeks. Dealers are still divided over whether there will be another cut in UK base rates before the Conservative party conference next month, and were waiting for the outcome of yesterday's debate on the UK economy in the House of Commons before hedging new bets. 'The market will doubtless pronounce its view on Friday in some way,' said one clearing bank dealer. Now that the UK is out of the European exchange rate mechanism, a two-pfennig fall of the kind that sterling suffered yesterday has limited effect on the money markets. There is still no clear indication of how far the government would allow the pound to drop before abandoning the idea of another rate reduction altogether. The only event in the currency markets to occupy the minds of dealers was the battle to save the French franc from devaluation. Yesterday, the franc traded more firmly against the D-Mark, but dealers believe that the Bundesbank could reduce rates further in an attempt to save the exchange rate mechanism. Three-month money in the sterling cash market softened to 9 3/16 per cent on the offered side, from a close of 9 1/4 per cent the previous night. This was largely put down to a softening of rates at the short end of the market because of the easier conditions. In spite of the huge shortage caused by its heavy support of sterling on the foreign exchanges last week, the Bank of England is offering to roll-over the facilities that it promised to the biggest banks last Thursday, easing conditions. The one-month rate was slightly softer at 9 7/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent. The December short sterling contract moved within a narrow 12-tick range, but ended at roughly the opening level, at 91.79. Strictly speaking, this assumes that three-month money will be at 8.21 per cent by the year-end. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 14m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 1.44bn in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent.</p>

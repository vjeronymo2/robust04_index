			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REMOVING LENNON PHOTO FROM EXHIBIT A HUGE MISTAKE  </P> <P> Hats off to curator Norman Lloyd, whose intelligent curating would attempt to  educate and revise the rigid images of a public that may in any event continue  down the "heroic" road to cultural destitution.  </P> <P> Board chairwoman Beverly Gunter's obtuse reading of the Lennon-Ono image is  typical of those who reactively and unwisely attempt to remove from the public  view anything that makes them uncomfortable or challenges their assumptions  about the natural order of things.  </P> <P> Lennon's respect for woman is profoundly heroic -- that's what makes the  photograph so extraordinary, and what makes him a hero. If we allow trustees  and government representatives to make decisions like the one Gunter  threatened, we lose all hope of revisioning our past or creating our future  differently.  </P> <P> Art like the Lennon-Ono photograph in the hands of board trustees like Gunter  threatens the very power of creation in the modern world. We must continue to  fund art, and to invite a profusion of images to vie equally for our attention  and instruction.  </P> <P> LORI MILLER, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ENGLISH STORES DEFY SUNDAY LAWS  </P> <P> Hundreds of stores in England and Wales opened in defiance of Sunday trading  laws, taking advantage of one of the last two shopping days before Christmas.  </P> <P> The open violations of the law, in some cases advertised in the newspapers,  followed similar openings last week.  </P> <P> For the large stores, drawing thousands of customers, the fines levied against  them are not a hardship.  </P> <P> Some managers reported "absolutely fantastic" business, the shop-workers' union  said it wasn't fair to the staffs and the Keep Sunday Special campaign said  people were complaining that the shop openings disrupted family life.  </P> <P> The issue of Sunday trading has been controversial for years. Prime Minister  John Major said in Parliament last week that the time is approaching for talks  to find a compromise.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 76ERS EXTEND LYNAM'S CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Philadelphia 76ers extended Coach Jim Lynam's contract two years and signed  top draft pick Brian Oliver to a guaranteed four-year contract at a reported  $1.6 million.  </P> <P> Sixers' owner Harold Katz said today that it took 10 minutes to agree with  Lynam on a contract that extends the coach's tenure through 1993.  </P> <P> Katz then described the signing of Oliver, a 6-4 guard from Georgia Tech, as  "the most difficult of a second-round draft choice I've ever had."  </P> <P> Lynam, 49, was in the last year of a three-year contract that paid him a  reported $700,000. A source indicated that the coach probably will get $700,000  for the additional two years.  </P></p>

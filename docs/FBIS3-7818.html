			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jovan Vlajkovic] </F>   [Text] As of 0800 tomorrow, one soldier of the Serbian  army of Krajina and one member of the ministry of internal  affairs of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] together with  the members of the Nepalese Battalion of the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] will control the crossing of the RSK state  border on the Bridge of Serbian Unity.    This is a result of an agreement between [UNPROFOR] General  Jean Cot and General Milan Celeketic, reached today on the  bridge itself. They also discussed other similar locations in  the RSK; however, the details were left to future negotiations.    According to General Jean Cot, the entire situation  concerning the bridge should not have reached the dimensions it  did. All future disputes will be resolved through talks. It is  not the first time that I have talked with General Celeketic.  Knowing him, I am sure that all misunderstandings will be  resolved through negotiation.</p>

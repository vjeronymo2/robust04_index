			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (14): A kiss of life revives derelict areas - Greater Manchester already has several inter-related urban renewal schemes under way, with substantial government funding / Development Corporations THE FOCUS of urban regeneration is on the eastern part of the city because of its 2000 Olympic Games bid, but Manchester also has two government-funded development corporations charged with revitalising other parts of the city. The Central Manchester Development Corporation (CMDC)covers 470 acres of the city centre. It is an area of faded and sometimes derelict textile warehouses gathered around the Rochdale canal. The difference made by the CMDC since it was set up in 1988 is immediately apparent. Canal walkways have been renewed, some 36 historic buildings revitalised and 21 buildings cleaned. But the CMDC has more substantial achievements. It has built 1,100 homes, some of these in listed buildings and others, such as Piccadilly Village, built from scratch. These developments have helped bring the centre back to life since the city's population decline of the 1970s. The CMDC has aided the Palace Theatre in Oxford Street and the Opera house. Combined with grants to help expand the Granada studio tours and the Museum of Science and Industry, this has given Manchester real tourism products - Granada and the science museum attract 1m visitors a year. The CMDC claims that 1m sq ft of office space has been built as a result of its development work. These include the new British Council headquarters at the southern end of the city centre, and the planned Pounds 40m concert hall, the Bridgewater initiative, which the developers hope will be surrounded by 290,000 sq ft of new office space. The recession has put on hold two other CMDC flagship projects, a World Trade Centre and the conversion of the Northern warehouse into a festival market place. The CMDC has met its investment targets. It has spent Pounds 80m and levered Pounds 292m out of the private sector. But the government has cut its budget for the past year. Mr John Glester, the chief executive, believes, however, the original private sector investment goal of Pounds 500m could be met by 1994, when the CMDC is due to be wound up. There are plans to build the Olympic village and a media centre on the border of the city centre and east Manchester on sites within the CMDC's area. The village would be within walking distance of the Olympic stadium. Mr Glester, also a member of Manchester's Olympics bid committee, says: 'The important thing in all the Olympic developments is that the facilities should have a use after the Olympics. Whether we win or not, and, of course, I believe we will win, the Olympic village could be used for students. 'We have 40,000 students in Manchester. The media centre could be used for conferences and conventions.' The Trafford Park Development Corporation is a different animal to the CMDC. The urban development area was set up in 1987 in an attempt to arrest the decline of the Trafford Park, the world's first industrial estate, in response to complaints from the local council and companies. The estate once employed 75,000 people - today's figure is 36,000. Mr Michael Shields, chief executive of the TPDC, says: 'The real job we had to tackle was to improve the infrastructure and the environment so that companies would want to be in the park.' Trafford Park consists of 3,000 acres and there is a non-contiguous 260 acres at Irlam, the old steel works. Mr Shields says the TPDC has been successful. A total of 10,510 new jobs have been created. Around 550 new companies have been set up. The UDC has spent Pounds 121.5m, much of it on infrastructure. The main development bis a spine road through TraffordPark linking the M62 in the north with the M56 and M6 to the south. Around Pounds 664m of private sector investment has been generated. One coup was to win the a rail freight distribution centre which could eventually create up to 4,000 jobs. The industrial park proper has been a success but there are question marks over office developments. In particular, fears that Exchange Quay, a 500,000 sq ft development, would not find tenants have led Trafford Park to be compared to London's Docklands. Mr Shields dismisses such comparisons. He says: 'They are not similar at all. Office developments, not just Exchange Quay, but also others, cover only 20 acres, a fraction of our total area. There is not a huge overhang of office space. Exchange Quay was hurriedly built to benefit from the enterprise zone status of the land and the tax breaks. 'This came to an end in 1991 so the building became available at the worst time of the recession. But the offices are being let. I understand that Exchange Quay is now one third let.' News that Exchange Quay is finding tenants will please Mr Ted Hagan. He is the private developer largely responsible for the development of Salford Quays, opposite Trafford Park, on the other side of the Manchester Ship Canal. When Salford district council were looking to develop 160 acres they acquired from the Manchester Ship Canal Company, they offered Mr Hagan 30 acres at a peppercorn price provided he could attract other private sector investment. Mr Hagan managed to persuade the Copthorne group to build a 160-room hotel on his land, which is also home to a Cannon Cinema complex. He has also built hundreds of houses on the land. The revival of the Quays is not yet complete. Mr Hagan still has 3.5 acres on the Trafford Road. He wants to build three floors of retail space. He hopes that a Metrolink station will be built on the ground floor, for which he has planning permission. He wants to see the offices in Exchange Quay filling up, and thus provide him with shoppers.</p>

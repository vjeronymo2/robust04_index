			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungarian land law infuriates the business community A new land law passed yesterday by the Budapest parliament severely limits foreign investment in Hungarian agriculture, one of the country's traditionally strong sectors. The act, although it does not affect existing holdings, bans new purchases of land by foreign individuals and companies. It allows non-Hungarian investors to lease no more than 500 hectares and then only for 10 years in general. The business community has reacted furiously to the new legislation. 'Foreign investment in the agricultural field is dead as a dodo,' said Mr Adam Batthyany, head of Batthyany Securities and one of the largest private landowners. Officials in the agriculture ministry have also been critical of the government's policy and included the limits on foreign land ownership under duress. An infusion of foreign capital and know-how had been widely seen as one way to restore Hungarian agriculture to its former health. Hungary was the eastern bloc's largest agricultural exporter but drought, loss of markets and confusion over property rights caused output to fall 17 per cent in 1992 and a further 5 per cent last year. Foreign purchases of land are, however, unpopular among a rural constituency whose support is crucial to the conservative coalition's chances at next month's elections and political calculations have proved decisive. The discriminatory elements of the land act would be incompatible with Hungarian membership of the European Union, for which Budapest formally applied just last week. The government said that the measures would apply only to the interim period leading up to EU accession and until Hungarian land prices, currently a fraction of western rates, reach 'realistic' levels. Nevertheless, Hungary's policy is in general to harmonise domestic legislation with EU directives in advance of membership and the land act breaks with that practice.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In an effort to expedite research, development, and commercialization of the novel estradiol esters, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development seeks a CRADA partner(s) for joint exploration and possible commercialization. Any CRADA proposed for these purposes will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CRADA aims will include the rapid publication of research results consistent with protection of proprietary information and patentable inventions as well as the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities. The CRADA partner will enjoy the benefits of first negotiation for licensing Government rights to any inventions arising under the agreement and will advance funds payable upon signing the CRADA to help defray Government expenses for patenting such inventions and other CRADA-related costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provide the collaborator with all biological data on compositions of matter covered by the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide samples of compositions of matter covered by the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide chemical data on compositions of matter covered by the agreement including synthetic routes, analytical methods employed, and purity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provide conformational analysis of compositions of matter covered by the agreement where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Continue studies on the pharmacokinetics and biological activity of compositions of matter covered by the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Conduct studies to optimize formulations for administration of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement by various routes in rodents and primates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Conduct Ames Test and other genetic toxicology on compositions of matter covered by the agreement scheduled for clinical evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Participate in meetings with the Food and Drug Administration for establishment of the drug safety studies required for Phase I, II, and III clinical investigations of any of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement and provide liaison with that Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of the collaborator will be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Undertake studies to identify any unique properties of the compositions of matter covered by the agreement including pharmacological differences from ethynylestradiol and mestranol (ethynylestradiol-3-methyl ether) which might favor their use as the estrogenic component of combined oral contraceptives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Undertake a broad spectrum of estrogen receptor binding studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Undertake acute, subacute, chronic, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicology studies necessary to proceed with the orderly evaluation of selected compositions of matter covered by the agreement in human subjects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Undertake an orderly sequence of clinical investigations of selected compositions of matter covered by the agreement for their safety and efficacy as estrogens for employment in combined oral contraceptives, postcoital contraceptives and for therapeutic use in gynecic medicine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection criteria for choosing the CRADA partner(s) will include but are not limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The collaborator must present in their proposal a clear statement of their capabilities and experience with respect to the tasks to be undertaken. This would include experience in drug development, regulatory affairs, and marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposal must contain a clear and concise outline of the work to be undertaken, a schedule of significant events, and outline of objectives to be accomplished in a timely manner, and such experimental details as will provide a basis for evaluation of competing submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposal must contain the level of financial support the collaborator will supply for CRADA-related Government activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A willingness to cooperate with the NICHD in publication of research results consistent with the protection of proprietary information and patentable inventions which may arise during the period of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Agreement to be bound by DHHS rules and regulations regarding the use of human subjects in clinical investigations, patent rights, ethical treatment of animals, and randomized clinical trials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Agreement with provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any inventions developed under the CRADA(s). Generally, the rights of ownership are retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to the Government (when a company employee(s) is the sole inventor) or an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the Government employee(s) is the sole inventor).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara M.

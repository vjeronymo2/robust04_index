			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes: "The Economy </F> Will Be Reorganized"]    [Text] The results achieved in terms of inflation and  growth in 1993 and the favorable economic prospects for 1994,  backed by a consistent macroeconomic program, have placed the  Colombian economy on a path of rapid, stable growth. This in  turn makes it possible to consolidate the program of structural  reforms carried out by this government, reforms that are  propelling the country into international markets.    The main macroeconomic objectives set by government  officials  are to reduce inflation to 19 percent, keep to the course of  high economic growth of about 5 percent, limit the accumulation  of reserves to $450 million, and maintain a balanced foreign  exchange rate.    Authorities are employing two types of measures to achieve  these objectives: moderate adjustments in the minimum wage,  official wages, and prices for goods and public services based  on the goal of inflation set, and a mixture of macroeconomic  policies put together by the Bank of the Republic and the  government in order to achieve the goals mentioned, based on  consistent monetary, fiscal, and exchange objectives.    Both types of measures must be adopted. If the basic factors  of inflation are not controlled, inflation will persist even if  increases in wages and prices on goods and public services are  held down. Inversely, if only traditional macroeconomic  instruments are used, the rate of exchange will tend to be  revalued as the result of an inertial behavior of wages and  prices on nonadjustable economic goods.  <H5>  Prices and Wages </H5>   In order to control wages and prices for goods and public  services, the government launched its attack on several fronts.  In terms of wages, increases took both inflationary goals and an  anticipated 2-percent increase in the average productivity of  workers into account. These considerations gave rise to the wage  goals promoted by the government.    In addition, the Ministry of Mines and Energy Regulatory  Commission set 19 percent as the average increase in energy  rates. Consistent with them, the Ministry raised the price of  gasoline 19 percent. The minister of finance simultaneously  requested and successfully obtained the cooperation of mayors in  setting increases in public urban transport rates not exceeding  the inflation goal set. In Bogota and Cali, for example,  increases averaging 19 percent were authorized. Finally, leases,  which are tied to the rate of inflation for the previous year,  cannot increase by over 20.3 percent.  <H5>  Macro Policies </H5>   A. Monetary policy: In the monetary area, the Bank of the  Republic board of directors established M1 growth rates  consistent with the anticipated rate of inflation and will use  the instruments it has to stay within them.    M1 growth is associated, on the one hand, with a demand for  money consistent with inflationary goals and growth in the  product and with moderate, stable interest rates. With respect  to the money supply, the main sources of expansion are the  accumulation of reserves, the liquidation of exchange  certificates issued in the past for the purpose of blocking  foreign exchange income, and the payment of interest by open  market operations (OMAS).    In order to control the supply of money, it will therefore  be  necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of reserves,  which makes it possible to reduce the need to use open market  operations. For that purpose, the government will make a basic  contribution, inasmuch as fiscal measures will limit the  accumulation of reserves and facilitate the task of controlling  inflation enormously. The measures mean a spending cut of .7  percent of the GDP and a decision to use resources from the  fiscal surplus to prepay the foreign debt and invest abroad.    In addition, the recently approved exchange measures will  also make it easier to control means of payment by allowing  fluctuations in the rate of exchange within a margin. The size  of that margin does not allow the government to monetize the  fiscal surplus or act as a de facto mechanism to control public  spending.    B. Fiscal policy: Within the context of modernizing the  government and spending priorities set by the provisions of the  new Political Constitution, this Administration has, during its  four-year term, maintained balanced public finances, thus  helping achieve goals in terms of inflation and growth.    The government will pass on a very favorable fiscal balance  in 1994 and a surplus amounting to 2 percent of the GDP. This  figure results from presuming that revenue from the consolidated  public sector will increase by 37.4 percent, a projection which,  in addition to anticipated collections of the principal tax  resources, incorporates receipts from taxation and collection  campaigns undertaken by DIAN [National Tax and Customs  Directorate], a conservative estimate of monies collected from  the sale of assets (600 billion pesos), and revenue amounting to  $1.2 billion from the cellular telephone concession.    Total expenditures of the consolidated public sector will  rise some 30.7 percent in 1994, 41.7 percent in the Central  Government, and 25.2 percent in the decentralized sector. This  growth is under that of the previous year (33.2 percent) and  achieved by a .7-percent cut in the GDP approved by CONFIS  [Fiscal Policy Council] at the end of December 1993 and the  Council of Ministers in January of this year.    At the top of the list of the Central Government's spending  is investment, up 45 percent over the 1993 figure. Likewise,  transfers will increase an estimated 42.6 percent as a result of  the Law on Competencies and Resources (regulating constitutional  precepts governing the fiscal situation and the participation of  municipalities in the nation's regular receipts) and the payment  of back pensions.    The 45.3-percent increase in spending for personal services  reflects this government's priorities in terms of strengthening  internal security, the effectiveness of the judicial system, and  the quality of the system of education via wage increases for  police officers, the military, and judges, and the hiring of  thousands of temporary teachers.    As noted, the public sector's surplus will be earmarked for  reducing liabilities by prepayment of the foreign debt and  Treasury investments abroad.    C. Exchange policy: The Bank of the Republic's board of  directors has just modified the exchange system in order to make  the monetary and exchange markets more transparent. Exchange  certificates were eliminated, meaning that the exchange rate  will now be freely determined by the market. Nevertheless, the  Bank of the Republic will continue to put pressure on the dollar  exchange rate.    Such intervention will take the form of the buying and  selling of foreign exchange on the market, the establishment of  a margin with maximum buying and selling rates so that the  exchange rate will fluctuate, and the divulgence of a very  short-term indicative exchange rate reflecting the intentions of  the Bank of the Republic with respect to exchange objectives. It  is hoped that these measures will cause the the exchange rate to  fall gradually in keeping with the goal set for inflation.  <H5>  Financial Consistency </H5>   The projected fiscal surplus is consistent with the  aforementioned goal in terms of building up reserves and an  annual 37.5-percent increase in credit to the private sector.  The Ministry of Finance has drafted a financial plan to  determine the deficit that could be financed based on new  prospects for the balance of payments and the sale of government  assets.    Compared with similar programs drafted in the past, the  current plan was based on far more restrictive hypotheses, which  suggests a broad margin of security in planning. In particular,  assumptions included increased credit to the private sector,  less growth in the holdings of financial entities, and a higher  foreign private debt.    It was also assumed that the sale of government assets and  government revenue from the cellular telephone system will  automatically reduce the capacity of the consolidated financial  system to grant credits for uses other than the financing of  such operations. This would happen because the private sector  would have to borrow (domestically or abroad) or liquidate  assets in order to finance the purchase of shares and pay  cellular telephone duties.    The main assumptions of the program were: 19-percent  inflation, a 5-percent increase in the GDP, the accumulation of  international reserves held by the Bank of the Republic  amounting to $450 million, a 27-percent expansion in the private  sector's portfolio (financial savings), a 37.5-percent increase  in the credit granted by the consolidated financial system to  the private sector, and a 28-percent increase in the financial  sector's holdings (excluding the Bank of the Republic).    The results of an analysis of macroeconomic consistency show  that a fiscal surplus of 298 billion pesos, equivalent to 1.48  percent of the GDP, would have to be generated. The required  surplus is smaller than that projected for the public sector, as  previously noted. This means that, instead of excessive  financial pressure from the public sector, we shall have a  promising situation from the standpoint of credit available to  the private sector, which in turn will permit growth in credit,  and therefore in investment, far exceeding the anticipated  growth in the GDP.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   We believe that the picture described in this article ends  once and for all last year's debate on uncontrolled public  spending, and completely frees the government of any fiscal  responsibility for any possible increase in the peso. The  government has taken the necessary measures to guarantee  exchange stability throughout the year and achieve the goal set  for inflation.    In contrast with the views of economic experts connected  with  the different political campaigns, the government believes  firmly that inflation should steadily drop by the year to  one-digit levels and has made a major fiscal adjustment in order  to achieve this goal. However, what is perhaps of greatest  political importance is that the program will not only provide a  balanced fiscal administration, but a prosperous one as well.    We are working to provide the next administration with  resources and room to work financially. Turning the good  prospects that we present into a reality will then depend on the  Bank of the Republic's proper handling of monetary and exchange  policies and on the fiscal responsibility of the next  administration. We have done all we could on the fiscal and  exchange fronts.</p>

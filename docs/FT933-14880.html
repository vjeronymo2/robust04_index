			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential regulation Mr Mick Newmarch of the Prudential has made no secret of his implacable opposition to the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services. The freedom of investment firms to choose their regulator is enshrined in the Financial Services Act, so the threat of a boycott is by no means idle. Without the willing participation of the country's biggest life insurer, the PIA would lack credibility. Since Mr Andrew Large of the Securities and Investments Board has made the PIA's success a cornerstone of his crusade to make the two-tier regulatory system work, the stakes are high. Others in the industry have chosen a more pragmatic approach: since the government is unwilling to introduce new legislation, the best chance of avoiding an embarrassing public row is to make the best of the existing system by signing up with the PIA. But it remains uncertain whether the PIA will deliver an adequate standard of regulation. Even full transparency on sales commissions for life assurance might not weed out sharp practice. Mr Newmarch is surely correct to say that a regulator capable of banning inadequate savings products and over-enthusiastic sales methods may yet be required. It is unlikely that the PIA - even with the participation of all comers - could fulfil such a role. Without statutory backing and an independent cast, the conflicts of interest would be great. It is a gamble, but if Mr Newmarch's opposition forces the government to look again at the question of legislation he will be doing the financial community a service.</p>

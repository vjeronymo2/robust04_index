			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL VIDEOS: A COUPLE OF WAYS OF VIEWING 'THE ETERNAL CITY'  </P> <P> Rome is filled with countless historic, artistic and architectural treasures  that support its claim to the title, "The Eternal City."  </P> <P> It's also a city of elegant shops, outdoor markets, museums, cappuccino bars,  trattorias, gelaterias, sidewalk cafes and monumental traffic jams.  </P> <P> In two diverse Rome videos, each of which is less than an hour and reviewed  below, the producers capture its essence very well.  </P> <P> "Rome" (International Video Network, Video Visits, 55 minutes. 1989).  </P> <P> Most of the historic attractions in this mosaic are at the numerous piazzas  that dot the city. At the piazzas, Romans are usually surrounded by tourists  attracted by the classical palazzos, churches, monuments and fountains.  </P> <P> Some of the many popular places are the Piazza del Popolo, with its huge  Egyptian obelisk; the Piazza di Spagna with the Spanish Steps and the piazzas  Barberini, Navona and Trevi, with their wondrous fountains.  </P> <P> Other stops include the Palazzo dei Conservatori (city of hall) on Capitoline  Hill, where viewers are guests at a wedding, and the impressive Pantheon, the  oldest and best preserved of Rome's ancient buildings.  </P> <P> In the shadow of Capitoline Hill is the ancient Forum, where scenes include the  Colosseum, the site of the Circus Maximus and the ruins of Palatine Hill, where  Rome was founded. A side trip follows the Appian Way to the historic catacombs.  </P> <P> The video also makes visits to the beautiful Borehese Gardens, lake and art  gallery; the Mouth of Truth sculpture, which is said to bite the hand of a liar  who puts his hand in it; the island of Tiberina, and the old Left Bank  Trastevere district, with the lovely 3rd-Century Church of St. Cecilia.  </P> <P> The segment on Vatican City includes the Ponte Vittoria Emanuele (bridge),  Castel Sant-Angelo and St. Peter's for scenes of the Pope, the Vatican Gardens  and museums and the Sistine Chapel dominated by Michelangelo's monumental  ceiling.  </P> <P> Other churches to see include the basilica of St. John Lateran, St. Peter in  Chains and St. Paul's Outside the Walls.  </P> <P> The video concludes with scenes of Rome at night, the Via Veneto at sunset and  lighted views of fountains.  </P> <P> Although it holds no surprises, this is a well-photographed and well-narrated  traditional travelogue that will appeal mainly to the armchair traveler.  </P> <P> It offers no tips or travel recommendations.  </P> <P> A tape is available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino  Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95.  </P> <P> "Rome" (VPI/AC Video, produced by Robin Williams, 50 minutes, 1988). Travel  film maker Williams' video focuses on the cultural attractions found in Rome,  concentrating on classical art, architecture and ancient history. It should  have a special appeal for armchair travelers, and if used in conjunction with  the above "Rome" video, should enrich the trip of a vacationer.  </P> <P> Williams' interest in the piazzas of Rome centers on the fountains created by  such artists as Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini and on the history and architectural  significance of the surrounding churches and palazzos.  </P> <P> A few that he examines include the charming Tortoise Fountain in tiny Piazza  Mattei; the Boat Fountain and the Spanish Steps in the Piazza di Spagna; the  Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini, and the impressive Fountain of the  Four Rivers, the Moor and the Neptune in the Piazza Navona. Others are the  Fountain of Trevi and the elegant churches of the Piazza Quirinale.  </P> <P> On an extensive tour of the Vatican, Williams describes the design of St.  Peter's Square and basilica and singles out the famous "Pieta" by Michelangelo  and "The Throne of St. Peter's" by Bernini, for special attention.  </P> <P> The highlight is a visit to the Sistine Chapel and its ceiling for close  studies and a history of Michelangelo's magnificent work. Also studied is  Raphael's "School of Athens," as well as many of his other paintings in the  Papal quarters.  </P> <P> The Vatican visit concludes with a history and film on the Swiss Guard and a  tour of the Vatican Gardens.  </P> <P> A segment of interest follows the journey of St. Paul from the time he landed  in Italy through his trial, death and burial, including scenes of the Appian  Way, the Forum (with drawings as it looked then) and the Basilica of St. Paul's  Outside the Walls where he is buried.  </P> <P> The video and narration also describe the founding of Rome, the building of the  Colosseum and give a detailed examination of the Forum and its ruins, including  the Arch of Septimus Severus that Napoleon used as a model for the Arc de  Triomphe in Paris.  </P> <P> Other ancient sites include the Palatine Hill, the Circus Maximus and the  Trajan Markets and column.  </P> <P> Two pleasant side trips visit the tower of Tivoli with the Villa d'Este and its  beautiful gardens and fountains and to the lakeside summer retreats of Nemi and  Albano in the Alban Hills.  </P> <P> It seems as if Williams' video was filmed by two cameras. The scenic shots are  often fuzzy, but the artworks are good and the musical score is effective. It  will be helpful to those interested in an aesthetic view of Rome.  </P> <P> No tips or travel recommendations.  </P> <P> A tape is available from VPI/AC, 381 Park Ave. South, New York 10016, (212)  685-5522. Price; $24.95.  </P></p>

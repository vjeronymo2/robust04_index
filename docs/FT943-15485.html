			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Vietnam blocks Coca-Cola plant The Vietnamese government is reported to have blocked plans by Coca-Cola to invest in a bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City, where its arch-rival Pepsi has a local bottling venture already in operation. The Business Times, a Singapore newspaper, said the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment told Coca-Cola that it could not start production, only weeks before the factory was ready to roll. The state committee argued that south Vietnam was already supplied with ample soft drink factories and that new facilities must be added 'in harmony with the demand of the market'. Even before US President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo with Vietnam in February Coca-Cola and Pepsi were jockeying to try to establish themselves as the pre-eminent brand in this country of 70.6m people. Pepsi won the first skirmish by opening a local bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City in the south - where three-quarters of the demand for cola is. Pepsi and its partners - Singaporean investors and Vietnamese local government organisations - laid out Dollars 10m as an initial investment. Coca-Cola, in a blaze of publicity, imported 3.6m bottles a month from Singapore and, last month, opened a Dollars 20m bottling operation in a Hanoi suburb. This is expected to go into production in the first half of 1995 and eventually produce 200m bottles of cola a year. A company spokesman in Singapore said that Coca-Cola would protest against the decision to put its Ho Chi Minh plant on ice and was optimistic that this appeal would eventually succeed. In the meantime it would try subcontracting the bottling of Coke in Ho Chi Minh to Chuong Duong. Pepsi has appeared to be following a strategy of working with the Ho Chi Minh authorities to obtain speedy practical returns on the ground, whereas Coke seems to have put more emphasis on solidifying contacts with the central authorities in Hanoi. Coke's Hanoi factory is a joint venture between Coca-Cola Indochina of Singapore and the state-run Vietnam National Import Export Corp (Vinamilex). Before this setback Coke said it planned to invest more than Dollars 45m in Vietnam in the next five years in an effort to catch up and overtake its rival - much of the money going to revamp an old Ho Chi Minh factory.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (4): Caught in the crossfire - Farming suffers from subsidised competitors IT is a familiar story. Efficient, unsubsidised farmers, most of them in the developing world, are slowly being forced out of business by less efficient but heavily subsidised competitors in the US and the EC. Uruguay, which depends on agricultural exports for about 70 per cent of its hard currency revenues, is caught in the crossfire of the subsidies war. There is little the government can do except protest at this injustice and call for a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade liberalisation talks. As if this was not bad enough, farmers complain that an increasingly overvalued currency is further corroding their incomes - nearly all tied to dollar-denominated export prices. The Rural Association of Uruguay says the exchange rate is overvalued by about 30-35 per cent. Farming is still the cornerstone of the economy. Agriculture may only account for about 10-12 per cent of GDP, but it is the main earner of foreign currency. Falling export revenues inevitably affect the rest of the economy. Uruguay, which is blessed with some of the world's finest soil, grew rich on its beef and wool exports to Britain in the early years of this century. It generated the wealth which enabled Uruguay to begin setting up in 1903 what would become the world's first welfare state. The greatest victims of adverse international conditions are sheep farmers. Wool prices have collapsed in the last four years - hitting their lowest point in real terms this century. A kilo of wool today fetches o more than Dollars 1.50 against Dollars 4 in 1989. The crash in prices is the result of a failure of attempts to control the international market through buffer stocks and interventions, compounded by the drop in demand from big markets in China and the former Soviet Union. The result is a steady drop in production: last year Uruguay produced 82.8m kgs of wool, compared with 96.7m kgs two year earlier. But farmers can do little to escape the pressures of falling prices. Mr Pedro Saravia, agriculture minister, says the adverse international scene hits the small and undercapitalised farmers. Larger and wealthier farms are better able to cope. The social impact on the countryside is grim. About 70 per cent of Uruguay's farms are made up of small (by Uruguayan standards) properties of less than 1,000 hectares. Mr Saravia says: 'People are always leaving the land for the city the world over, and at times of crisis this worsens.' He is quick to point out that the government is not standing idly by: 'We are improving farmers' profits by liberalising the market more and reducing the incidence of the state, lowering costs by reducing taxes and inefficiency.' For example, he says the government has helped farmers by cutting taxes on fuel to 15 per cent from over 50 per cent. He hopes to eliminate the tax altogether by the end of the year. The government also wants to do away with remaining export taxes. At present, exporters must hand over 5-10 per cent of revenues to the tax authorities. For instance, exports of boned beef are taxed at 5 per cent; before, all beef products were taxed. All taxes on wool have been removed. There are limits to liberalisation, though. Congress and the electorate have both rejected government proposals to privatise utilities and infrastructure (although the port of Montevideo is undergoing some limited restructuring). Farmers, of course, see things differently. Mr Urioste, president of the Rural Association, says taxes are still too high: 'Farmers contribute more than other sectors. An average-sized wool or cattle farm of 1,000 hectares pays 38 per cent of its gross output in taxes.' Fuel taxes may have fallen, he concedes, but farmers must still pay heavy land and sales taxes, which he estimates at Dollars 270m a year. The outlook is not entirely grim. Agriculture grew by 7 per cent, in line with the expansion of the economy last year, thanks mainly to increased production of non-traditional crops such as rice and fruit and vegetables. Price are now beginning to show some improvement. In May, wholesale farm prices - led mainly by beef and dairy products - rose 6.3 per cent, almost double the rise in the wholesale price index. Mr Urioste says that Uruguay has become the first country to eradicate foot and mouth disease through mass cattle vaccination. This should help open new markets for Uruguay's beef exports. Despite these encouraging signs, there is little chance that the international context will improve dramatically in the foreseeable future. Falling prices are powering a vicious circle in which declining revenues lead to a fall in investments and yields. Uruguay needs to find an alternative use for its huge fertile prairies. Imitating Chile's widely-praised development of export markets for sophisticated fruit and vegetables is not entirely appropriate for a country with land ideal for extensive farming.</p>

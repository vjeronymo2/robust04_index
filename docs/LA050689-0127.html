			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAN LANDMARK EATERY ON PIER;  </P> <P> GUSTAFSON OF END CAFE DIES OF CANCER AT AGE 59  </P> <P> John Gustafson, owner of the End Cafe, a landmark at the end of Huntington  Beach Pier that was twice destroyed by storms, has died at age 59 of cancer.  </P> <P> Friends remembered him as a generous, friendly, hard-working and determined  man.  </P> <P> Tom Bagshaw said that his friend and former boss often gave free cups of coffee  and sandwiches to those who could not afford to pay and that he often hired  foreign travelers staying at the local youth hostel who needed spending money.  </P> <P> Gustafson always celebrated the birthdays of his employees and regular  customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Flowers, Presents  </P> <P> "He never forgot anybody's birthday," Bagshaw said. "He would have a present  for the guys, flowers for the girls and a birthday cake."  </P> <P> In 1983, the popular End Cafe and a bait shack were left teetering at the end  of the pier after storms ripped out 30 pilings and 500 square feet of the  pier's deck. The cafe was demolished.  </P> <P> The End Cafe was reopened in September, 1985. But a storm in January, 1988,  ripped about 250 feet off the pier and toppled the End Cafe into the sea -- 10  minutes after Gustafson had left the building.  </P> <P> Gustafson, meanwhile, had negotiated with Maxwell's, an upscale eatery at the  front end of the pier, for a small retail space on the side of the restaurant,  where he opened a new place. He affectionately named it Maxie's Other End Cafe.  </P> <P> Said Alice Gustafson, 58, of her husband's setbacks: "He never complained,  although there was no insurance at either time. He was always positive, and he  didn't let it get him down."  </P> <P> The End Cafe was a tourist landmark. Tourists often told Gustafson and his  employees that pilots bringing them in over Huntington Beach had pointed out  the cafe, Bagshaw said.  </P> <P> Born Sept. 8, 1929, in Denver, Gustafson moved with his family to California in  1953 and lived in Gardena and Whittier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Restaurant in '76  </P> <P> But he "loved the pier and said he always wanted to own the restaurant at the  end," Alice Gustafson said. The family moved to Huntington Beach and Gustafson  bought the restaurant in 1976.  </P> <P> He died at home Wednesday night after a 5-month struggle with lung cancer. His  wife and mother were at his bedside.  </P> <P> In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, John Gustafson Jr., 36,  and Frank Gustafson, 33, both of Huntington Beach; three daughters, Christine  Gustafson, 34, of Corona del Mar; Mary Beth Downey, 32, of Huntington Beach and  Linda KinCannon, 41, of Denver; his mother, Willena Gustafson, 81, of Denver  and five grandchildren.  </P> <P> Memorial services are pending. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that  donations be made to the John Gustafson Memorial Fund, in care of Dilday  Brothers Mortuary, 17911 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach, Calif. 92647.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANOTHER EMERGENCY ROOM MAY BE SHUT  </P> <P> A wave of threatened closures of hospital emergency rooms in Inglewood and  Hawthorne to patients who are transported by ambulance could spread to another  South Bay hospital, this time in Gardena, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> "I've tried to hold out as long as possible," Gardena Memorial Hospital  Administrator Phyllis Van Crombrugghe told a recent community forum at  Inglewood City Hall. "The problem must be solved, or our hospital will have to  downgrade as well."  </P> <P> Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood and Robert F. Kennedy Medical  Center in Hawthorne recently announced plans to downgrade their emergency  rooms. They will no longer accept patients delivered by paramedics. Both cite  major financial losses from treating poor, indigent or uninsured patients.  </P> <P> James D. Grant, director of emergency services at Gardena Memorial, said the  small for-profit community hospital has seen a 25% increase in emergency room  patients in the last year as other hospitals have closed their doors to  paramedics or reached the saturation point.  </P></p>

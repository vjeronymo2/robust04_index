			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: IT'S A SMALL WORLD  </P> <P> Kids who couldn't get enough of Disney's "The Little Mermaid" will have plenty  of new mermaid adventure stories and music to look forward to if the Disney  Channel's daily half-hour "The Little Mermaid's Island" show debuts before  year's end, which looks likely. It's been in the planning stages, says producer  John Purdy, since before the animated feature came out.  </P> <P> For the TV version, Ariel the Mermaid will be a real-live lady -- actress  Marietta Deprima -- whose island home and undersea grotto will be inhabited by  Jim Henson puppet versions of characters from the film.  </P> <P> Sam Wright (Sebastian the Crab) and Buddy Hackett (Scuttle the Seagull) are  among those already set to reprise their vocal roles.  </P> <P> Purdy says that four musical numbers per episode are planned, with 10  songwriters already at work.

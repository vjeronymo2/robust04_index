			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Turkey wants to open Iraq oil pipe TURKEY is to urge the UN to lift sanctions on Iraq's oil export pipeline, in the first sign of a shift in Ankara's policy towards Baghdad. Mr Vulkan Vural, senior adviser to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, said yesterday reopening the Iraqi pipeline was the foreign policy priority, and would be the centre of discussion when Mrs Ciller goes to Washington next month. Although Turkey insists it is not considering unilateral action on lifting sanctions, Mrs Ciller's government has adopted a more conciliatory approach, in contrast to President Suleyman Demirel, who made oblique criticism of the government this week. 'Have sanctions removed Saddam Hussein or have they led to the suffering of the Iraqi people?' asked Mr Vural. A recent report from the Food and Agricultural Organisation estimated Iraq's food import needs at around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn), and warned that pre-famine conditions now prevailed. However, Turkey is equally anxious that the current crisis should not jeopardise its long-term economic relations with Iraq, which before the Gulf war was its second largest trade partner. There is also concern at the deteriorating state of the pipeline, which has been shut since August 1990, when under resolution 661, Turkey informed the Iraqis it was suspending loadings at Yumurtalik, Turkey's Mediterranean oil terminal. The two pipelines have a capacity of around 76m tonnes a year, and link with Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields. Turkey is losing an estimated Dollars 750,000 a day as a result of the closure. More than that, the sanctions have devastated the border trade with Iraq that is vital to Turkey's impoverished south east. 'The members of the Security Council should understand that it is unfair to make Turkey suffer for this,' Mr Vural said. Turkey is launching 'extensive discussions' with its allies, he said, and would present its proposals when the UN Security council met on Iraq on September 20.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / German forex reserves rise by DM39.3bn GERMANY'S foreign exchange reserves rose by DM39.3bn (Dollars 22.8bn) in the last week of July as a result of the currency turbulence preceding the decision to widen currency bands in the European exchange rate mechanism and thus avert speculative pressures. The Bundesbank said in its weekly statement that the reserve total was now DM157.9bn. The sharp rise, caused by Bundesbank intervention to support ERM currrencies under pressure  - predominantly the French franc  - only showed up in the figures for the week to August 7 because foreign exchange transactions are reported with a week's delay. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has said some DM60bn flowed into Germany in July as a result of intervention in the ERM. To offset the impact on money supply growth and inflation, it cut sharply the weekly allocation of securities repurchase agreements (repos) in the first week of August. The rise in Bundesbank foreign exchange reserves the previous week was DM7.7bn, also reflecting ERM intervention. The overnight rate of lending in the German money market eased yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised dealers on Wednesday by adding a net DM10.3bn to the banking system. The overnight rate hovered around 6.75 per cent after 6.80 per cent the previous day. Some dealers said the high levels of liquidity had left the market in a good position to meet a season of tax payments which should start next week. A central securities exchange supervisory authority is needed to make Frankfurt more attractive as a financial centre, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports. 'But we must do several things to make the Frankfurt exchange centre so attractive that it can contend on a Europe-wide and worldwide level,' he said in a TV interview. Mr Waigel also said he was in the process of drawing up a law on insider trading abuses.</p>

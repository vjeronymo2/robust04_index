			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Amoco records earnings of Dollars 229m in first quarter AMOCO, the Chicago-based energy company, yesterday reported a net profit of Dollars 229m, or 46 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1993, which compares with a loss of Dollars 619m, or Dollars 1.25 per share, in the year-ago quarter. At the operating level, Amoco earned Dollars 343m, or 69 cents, in the first quarter of 1993, but this excluded Dollars 170m of write-downs from exploration in the Congo and tax benefits of Dollars 56m derived from asset disposals. The comparable 1992 operating figure was Dollars 257m, or 52 cents, before Dollars 924m of charges resulting from accounting changes and tax benefits of Dollars 48m. Amoco's first-quarter revenues were Dollars 6.978bn, up slightly from Dollars 56.389bn a year ago. Mr Laurance Fuller, Amoco chairman, said that, exclusive of the special items, the company's earnings benefited from cost-reduction efforts. He said US exploration and production operations also improved, reflecting higher natural gas and crude oil prices and higher gas volumes. Worldwide capital and exploration spending in the quarter declined to Dollars 597m from Dollars 634m in the first quarter of last year. The company is planning to spend Dollars 1.5bn to develop a large oilfield in the South China Sea, in an area 120 miles south-east of Hong Kong. Schlumberger, the energy industry services group, yesterday unveiled a net loss of Dollars 114.8m in the first quarter of 1993, compared with a net profit of Dollars 156.3m a year ago. The company said the loss was caused by a Dollars 248m extraordinary debit resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards. Excluding the special charge Schlumberger would have had profits of Dollars 133.2m, down by 15 per cent year-on-year. Revenues in the 1993 quarter were Dollars 1.62bn, up slightly from Dollars 1.59bn a year ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis Granovsky] </F>   [Text] Acapulco, Mexico, 3 Feb (AFP) -- Despite official  denials regarding an eventual presence of subversive groups in  Guerrero State, Mexico, the country's press has continued to  insist "the existence of armed groups that invite the population  to join the guerrillas is a widely known secret," as the daily  NOVEDADES proclaimed today.    Under the headline "Subversion Is Promoted in the Costa  Chica  Region," the newspaper published on its front page a map of the  "area with a possible guerrilla presence" and quotes statements  from a police commissioner, a bilingual teacher, and other  witnesses who have informed the authorities of the presence of  armed individuals in the area.    The Acapulco newspaper EL SOL, on the Pacific Coast, had  written on 2 February that there are military training camps,  that more than 20,000 AK-47 assault rifles had entered the state  over the last few weeks, and that there is a "red alert" in the  state due to the danger of "a new guerrilla front, similar to  the one in Chiapas State."    There was a guerrilla uprising in the southern State of  Chiapas on 1 January, and for weeks national newspapers and  magazines have been insisting that in the mountain and forest  areas of Guerrero State there are armed groups, in addition an  intense police mobilization to search for them.    Jose Ruben Robles, Guerrero State government secretary, said  on 22 February the information published by EL SOL reflects a  "lack of responsibility and little professionalism," because "no  subversive groups have been found, much less any military  training camps."    The newspaper also quoted an official document, existence of  which the government has denied, but EL SOL Director Eloisa  Lopez has confirmed to AFP that it exists and that she has a  copy.    NOVEDADES' envoy to the area has described such cases,  however, as that of Huehuetonoc, where the bilingual teacher has  reported that armed individuals, with beige uniforms, had  invited the Indian population to join the guerrilla movement.  This was also denounced by the town's police commissioner.    It has also mentioned the arrest of a retired police  sergeant  who was bearing "prohibited weapons" and who had allegedly  confessed to forming part of a group of eight people armed with  AK-47 assault rifles and M-1 carbines and members of a "town  police."    The government does not deny the presence of armed groups  but  identifies them as crooks, criminals, or kidnappers, not as  subversives.    In Guerrero State there was, in the early 1970's, a  guerrilla  uprising that the Army annihilated quickly.    It is recognized that in the region there are many groups of  drug traffickers that have already clashed several times with  the Army, which is fighting them, and even amongst themselves  for control of the exit routes of the marijuana grown in the  mountains.    There have also been dozens of kidnapings, mostly of wealthy  landlords who have had to pay large amounts of money to be freed.    The only point on which the different versions agree is that  there are many weapons circulating in Guerrero State: the  disagreements regard who has them and for what they use them.  Meanwhile, there is a psychosis of possible clashes in many  towns in the state.</p>

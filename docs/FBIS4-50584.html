			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["A View on Reforms in the Property Rights of Town and </F> Township Enterprises" by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture on 1  April 1994]    [Text] Reforms in the property rights of town and township  enterprises are unfolding in rural areas. To implement  conscientiously the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, to promote and provide guidance to a  deepening of the reforms, and to ensure their healthy  development, we offer the following views:  <H5>  I. Fully understand the importance and urgency of reforms </H5> in the property right system of town and township enterprises.    The unique operating mechanism of our country's town and  township enterprises, formed in the course of reform and opening  up, is not only an important inner engine of growth, but also a  key promoter of our country's economic structural reforms. As  our country's socialist market economy system gradually takes  shape, however, problems surface concerning town and township  enterprises' operating mechanisms and the enterprise system.  Chief among these problems is the ambiguous property right  system in rural collective enterprises: Ownership is shared by  everybody, while noone is responsible for the enterprise;  responsibilities for property rights are unclear, and so are the  respective responsibilities for administrative duties and  enterprise management; rural administrative leaders frequently  interfere arbitrarily with enterprises; enterprises are not  really granted decisionmaking powers; workers' awareness of  being the masters is weak; the lack of cohesiveness within  enterprises; and the legal status and economic nature of some  joint peasant household (cooperative) enterprises and the  cooperative shares system remain undefined, and their legitimate  interests thus are left unprotected. If we do not pay serious  attention to these problems, they will affect and dampen the  efficient, sustained, rapid, and healthy [gao xiao chi xu kuai  su jian kang 7559 2400 2170 4958 1816, 6643 1696 1660]  development of town and township enterprises.    To fundamentally solve these problems, further improve and  optimize enterprise operating mechanisms, and gradually  establish a modern corporate system, town and township  enterprises must accelerate the pace of property right reforms  characterized by the cooperative shares system, make innovations  in the property right system and operating mechanisms, and  continually strengthen enterprises' vitality and dynamism.  <H5>  II. Further clarify the guiding thought and objectives for </H5> town and township enterprises' property right reforms.    The guiding thought for town and township enterprises'  property right reforms is: With the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the direction, with  the "three beneficial's" as the standard, and with developing  the cooperative shares or the joint-stock system as the focus,  we will further clarify property rights; perfect mechanisms;  increase vitality; and promote the highly efficient, sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of our country's town and  township enterprises.    The targets for town and township enterprises' property  right  reforms are: The rational circulation and optimal composition  of various production factors in different regions, trades,  enterprises, and types of ownership so as to ensure that the  cooperative shares, joint-stock, contract, rental and lease,  merger, and joint venture systems all can be perfected and can  develop; that enterprises can become corporate entities with  genuine independent operations, self-constraint, and  self-development, and with responsibility for their own profits  and losses and market competitive entities. This will lead,  finally, to the establishment of a modern corporate system that  can meet the objective requirements of a socialist market  economy and socialized, large-scale production; is clear in  property rights and responsibility and powers; separates  administration from management; and employs scientific  management.  <H5>  III. Continuously enrich the forms and contents of reforms </H5> in town and township enterprises' property rights.    Reforms in town and township enterprises' property rights  involve many types of ownership and are a complicated systems  engineering project. At the present stage, the main forms for  town and township enterprises' property right reforms are: 1)  The definition and clarification of property rights. 2)  Effective property rights transfers. 3) The final realization  of property rights. 4) The management and supervision of  property rights.    The definition and clarification of property rights are the  foundation for town and township enterprises' property right  reforms. In general, we should absorb new shares (including  individual and corporate shares, and so on) on the basis of  sound asset evaluations and further clarification in definitions  of property rights so as to put in place a business organization  that allows diversification in the forms of property.    Effective property rights transfers are a key link in  property right reforms. Localities with conditions gradually  must set up property right exchange markets so as to achieve  effective property rights transfers. For enterprises not yet  pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock systems, the  basic ways for them to transfer property rights are mergers,  auctions, bankruptcy, inheritance, and giving away as gifts. In  the cooperative shares system, property rights generally can be  transferred through conditional internal shares transfers.  Joint-stock enterprises operate according to relevant state  provisions.    Property rights ultimately are expressed as actually  possessing, deriving revenue from, and handling assets by  property-holders so as to maintain and increase the assets'  value. The fulfillment of property rights for town and township  enterprises must comply with the principle of "being driven by  multiple wheels and operating on multiple tracks," and requires  the adoption of a company organization and operating mechanism  in line with the characteristics of a property right-defined  entity. Individual- and privately run enterprises can operate  under the combination of ownership and management rights;  township (town) and village collective enterprises must further  improve the contract management responsibility system, actively  pursue the cooperative shares and joint-stock systems, and  vigorously develop business affiliation and business  conglomerates so as to raise the operating efficiency of their  assets.    Administrative organs in charge of town and township  enterprises must strengthen the management and supervision of  town and township enterprises' property rights, and must  supervise and inspect the enforcement of state laws, rules and  regulations, and policies on enterprises' property rights.  Leaders must participate in the formulation and implementation  of reforms in the enterprise property right system, do a good  job in evaluating enterprises' assets and defining property  rights, handle disputes in enterprises' property rights properly  and in conjunction with the departments concerned, and protect  enterprises' legitimate rights and interests. Property- holders  and operators should realize the management, supervision, and  use of property rights.    The property right system of town and township enterprises  is  being innovated continuously, and the form and contents of  reforms are developing and changing perpetually. We must  passionately support, correctly guide, actively help, and digest  and popularize the organizational form of the new enterprise's  property right created by the broad mass of peasants and  verified thorugh practice.  <H5>  IV. Conscientiously solve the difficulties and key problems </H5> with reforms in the property rights of town and township  enterprises.    At the present stage, the primary and most important form  for  town and township enterprises' property right reforms is the  cooperative shares system. This is a complicated and highly  policy-related job. We should pay special attention to the  following problems:    1. Do a good job of asset evaluation; it is the foundation  of property right reforms. Asset evaluations should be aimed at  correctly determining the value of an enterprise's assets and at  guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of asset  holders and operators; should observe the principles of  authenticity, scientificalness, and feasibility; and refer to  the standards, procedures, and methods provided by the state.  Evaluations generally must be led by administrative departments  one level higher than town and township enterprises, and require  setting up an asset evaluation office that should consist mainly  of personnel qualified in asset evaluations, and of village,  enterprise, and worker representatives. Evaluation work should  be done in the order of establishing the object for evaluation,  asset screening and inspection, evaluations and assessments, and  verification; its scope should include tangible and intangible  assets. Methods for evaluations are tailored to the original  and net value, degrees of newness, replacement cost, and  profitability of the assets. Specifically, these include the  present earnings value method, the replacement cost method, the  present market value method, the liquidation value method, and  other evaluation methods.    2. A rational shareholder composition. The owners of town  and township enterprises' assets are varied, and they should be  determined on the basis of relations between rationally  ascertained asset holdings (including evaluated carryover assets  and increases in new assets). In general, there can be village  shares, individual shares, social corporate shares, and  foreign-capital shares. In pursuing the cooperative shares  system, rural collective enterprises must offer village and  individual shares; other shares are offered subject to the  investment structure.    Depending on needs, after a rural collective enterprise has  changed over to the cooperative shares system, it can offer  ordinary and preference shares, with their respective rights and  dividends clearly defined.    3. Clarify property right relations. In pursuing the  cooperative shares system, rural enterprises must clarify the  property right to their stock assets. The general principle is  that whoever makes the investment owns it, a respect for the  history of the development of the enterprise, and consultation  on an equal footing. There is no need to trace how the former  enterprise got hold of its stock assets, which can be allocated  between village shares and individual shares for the  enterprise's workers.    Dividends for village shares are used mainly for developing  enterprises, the projects of subsidizing and developing  agriculture with industry, and social charities, but they cannot  be used to cover the administrative expenditure of township  (town) governments. As for clarity in property rights, the  property right holder of village shares is to some extent  "postulated." In this regard localities may explore boldly, as  long as it benefits enterprise development.    The workers' individual shares included in the individual  shares come from two parts: One is from capital or other assets  invested by individual workers, and shares offered to match this  part of contribution are the same as social individual shares.  The other comes from a certain proportion of what has been  determined, in asset evaluations, as the stock assets of the  original enterprise. The ownership and corresponding shares of  this proportion of assets should be given to workers according  to their contributions toward the establishment of the  enterprises, their seniority, and their work responsibility.  This kind of workers' individual shares can only generate  dividends and cannot be inherited, given away as gifts, or  transferred. Holders of these kinds of shares are seen as  giving them up when they leave the enterprise for personal  reasons.    4. Do a good job in the distribution of interests. The  rural cooperative and shares system is a special business  organization. Care must be taken to take into account the  interests of the state, enterprises, workers, and shareholders;  to combine distribution according to work with dividends  according to shares; and to handle profit distribution  reasonably. First, pay income taxes according to the law.  Second, pay compensation for confiscated goods, as well as all  tax arrears and fines. Third, make up the previous annual  losses incurred by the enterprise in question. Fourth, withdraw  money from the public and welfare funds in accordance with  current relevant provisions. Fifth, withdraw money from the  discretionary public fund, the amount of withdrawal determined  by the shareholder general meeting or board of directors.  Sixth, shares and dividend distribution should be such as that  dividends match shares, with equal sharing in interests and  risk. Ordinary shareholders should bear the brunt of risk for  the enterprise, and returns on their shares may vary according  to the risk taken, so that dividends may rise or fall in  proportion to the enterprise's economic returns. Preference  shares may be calculated on an interest-guaranteed and  dividend-sharing basis, but the total sum of share interests and  dividends must not exceed the rate of returns on the  enterprise's total assets.    5. Integrate organically the cooperative shares system with  the contract system. The cooperative shares system helps  overcome the problem of short-sighted behaviors prompted by the  contract system, such as reaping profits without bearing losses.  In view of the fact that the contract system is still a major  operating mechanism in rural collective enterprises where it  plays an active role, enterprises not yet prepared to pursue the  cooperative shares system should increase their efforts to  improve the contract system by introducing, one at a time, the  procedures and methods of the cooperative shares system, seeing  the improvement of the contract system as a means of promoting  the cooperatives shares system, and being ready to move into the  cooperative shares system once conditions permit. Enterprises  capable of pursuing the cooperative shares system can introduce  some of the shareholding system into the contract system, so  that the enterprise can have the advantages of both the contract  system and the cooperative shares system, and can integrate the  two organically.    6. Handle well the relations between rural administrative  organizations and enterprises pursuing the cooperative shares  system. As a new form of business organization, the cooperative  shares system differs from the traditional rural collective  enterprise. Rural administrative and economic organizations  cannot manage these enterprises with the traditional management  methods they use with rural collective enterprises. They must  try hard not to interfere administratively and should be  concerned mainly with providing guidance, supervision, and  coordinated services. They should monitor enterprises'  enforcement and implementation of state laws, rules and  regulations, and policies; arrange for management for  enterprises; guide them concerning work in this area, together  with the departments concerned; coordinate relations between  enterprises; help secure economic and technological cooperation;  sum up and popularize enterprises' experiences in development;  mobilize and guide enterprises on how to strengthen ideological  and political work; promote spiritual civilization in  enterprises; and create essential conditions for enterprises to  train and recruit professional and technical staff and to  introduce advanced technology. Enterprises pursuing the  cooperative shares system or joint-stock system also should  handle well their relations with rural administrative and  economic organizations, voluntarily accept their guidance and  supervision, and contribute to local economic pursuits and the  common good.    7. Define the administrative and management responsibilities  of town and township enterprise administrative departments to  the rural cooperative shares system. The pursuit of the  cooperative shares system by town and township enterprises is a  reform and innovation in enterprises' business organization,and  does not change the nature of town and township enterprises.  Therefore, the subordination relation still remains for  enterprises; planning, guidance, management, supervision, and  coordinated services are still done by town and township  enterprise administrative departments. Enterprises of the town  and township cooperative shares system should fulfil their  obligations according to the "PRC Regulations on Rural  Collective-Ownership Enterprises."  <H5>  V. Genuinely strengthen leadership over reforms in the </H5> property rights of town and township enterprises.    A significant change in itself, reform in the property  rights  of town and township enterprises involves adjustment in the  interests of varied parties, and is a job with strong policy  import, cutting across many sectors. Town and township  enterprise administrative departments at all levels must fully  appreciate the importance of town and township enterprises for  property right reforms and the complicated nature of the task;  include this job on their agendas; and genuinely strengthen  leadership, especially in inducing rural and enterprise leaders  ideologically in an attempt to help them overcome ideological  barriers, heighten the sense of reform and opening up, and raise  awareness in pursuing property right reforms. Leaders at all  levels must be personally involved in pilot schemes, sum up  experiences, insist on seeking truth from facts, tailor measures  to local conditions, vary guidance according to different areas  of work, and refrain uniform and sweeping applications. Town  and township enterprise administrative departments at all levels  must make clear who and which organs are responsible for this  task, must actively seek support from party committees at the  same level, and provide policy and legal protection for reforms  in the property rights of town and township enterprises. Under  the unified leadership of party committees and governments, they  must work in coordination with the departments concerned,  cooperate fully, pursue well reforms town and township  enterprises' property rights, and work vigorously to achieve  major breakthroughs in this work.</p>

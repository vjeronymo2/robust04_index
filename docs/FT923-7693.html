			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Plenty of room at the Hotel UK: Occupancy rates are at their lowest levels for more than 10 years Nearly all of Mr Dries de Vaal's 30 British hotels are trading at a profit. Management has been streamlined. The company has driven down costs. Unfortunately for the gloom-laden UK hotel industry, this good news does not come from a hotelier. Mr de Vaal is a partner with accountants and management consultants Touche Ross. All the hotels his firm controls are in receivership. Touche Ross calculates that 125 UK hotels went into administration or receivership last year. By the end of last month, this year's figure had already reached 93. Although Touche Ross can take the credit for the reduced costs and streamlined management of the hotels under its control, most of them were trading profitably when they went into receivership. It was not the plunge in occupancy rates which began with the run-up to the Gulf war and has continued with the recession that drove the hotels out of business, although that has certainly not helped. Instead, they fell victim to the grandiose ambitions of the 1980s and the high debts incurred to accomplish them. Owners of single hotels have suffered far more than the larger hotel companies. 'The main established groups did not buy at inflated prices. They were much wiser,' Mr de Vaal says. One of the survivors, Mr Jonathan Hassell, owner of the 10-room Red House Hotel in Torquay, says that in the pre-recession years, 'there were many people who moved to seaside resorts and bought modest hotels. These were people who had not necessarily been in the hotel industry, but the banks and building societies had a great tendency to lend to them.' Many country house hotels were also taken over by debt-laden novices. Mr de Vaal says: 'Hotels were trading hands at values that were too high and could not be justified by the income streams that were being generated even before the recession.' As property values have fallen, lending institutions have called in the receivers in the hope that something of the business can be salvaged and buyers found. It was not just buying hotels which loaded their owners with debt. UK hoteliers, both new and experienced, borrowed to upgrade and improve their facilities during the 1980s to meet raised expectations of guests. Mr Derek Brown, editor of the Michelin guide, earlier this year paid tribute to UK hotels for raising standards while maintaining or even cutting prices. Mr Hassell, who is also chairman of the hotel panel of the British Hospitality Association (BHA), which represents hoteliers, caterers and restaurateurs, says: 'Standards of hotel furnishings went up during the pre-recession years. Some would even say they went over the top. I've been in the business for a long time and I'm more cautious.' Despite their financial difficulties, Mr de Vaal describes the operational management of the hotels that have gone into receivership as 'middling to good'. He adds: 'Nine times out of 10 we keep the existing management team in place. We take on the role of area manager. We advise them on their marketing and make decisions on their capital expenditure requirements.' Buyers for UK hotels are not easy to find. The large hotel groups are looking elsewhere. Forte, the UK's largest hotel company, is intent on enlarging its continental European presence. Last April, the Rank Organisation put 22 hotels on the market, but has so far only sold two small ones. Mr de Vaal says that between January and May, Touche Ross sold eight hotels. Hoteliers whose finances allow them to remain in business say there is no sign of an upturn. Most report sharply reduced occupancies. The Horwath leisure consulting group says that hotel occupancy in England during the first quarter of this year was the lowest since 1980. Occupancy ranged from 30 per cent in January to 45 per cent in April. Mr Trevor Forecast, owner of the Congham Hall Country House Hotel in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, says business travel has fallen away sharply. Instead of holding meetings at his hotel, senior managers are communicating by conference telephone call. Mr Forecast says he knows of a company whose senior managers fly from around the world to one airport, hold their meeting and then fly home. Occupancy at his hotel is currently about 55 per cent, compared to 75 per cent two years ago. The mix of guests has also changed. Whereas his customers used to be evenly split between business and leisure guests, the latter now account for 75 per cent. Mr Forecast, who chairs the BHA's East Anglia divisional committee, says coastal hotels are faring even worse. 'While car park numbers are up, the spend in hotels and restaurants has come down. People are coming for the day and sitting on the beach eating their sandwiches.' Some of the options open to manufacturing companies during a recession are not available to a hotel owner. Staff can only be reduced by so much before guests begin to complain. Rooms and facilities cannot be allowed to look too shabby in a market where customers are more discriminating than ever. Many hoteliers have kept room rates at the same level as last year - a cut in real terms. Others are offering more drastic reductions, but Mr Forecast believes these are best avoided. 'Offering two nights for the price of one and other heavy discounts is just a way of going broke more quickly, in my opinion,' he says. As difficult as business is, some hoteliers believe the only way to survive the recession is to invest even more. The 51-room St Brannocks Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, says it has enjoyed average occupancies of between 80 and 90 per cent this year. Mrs Gill Merrell, who runs the hotel with her husband and daughter, says the key to its high occupancy level has been a willingness to send coaches to pick up guests from almost anywhere in the UK. The hotel has offered coach travel to its guests for several years, but previously used outside contractors' vehicles and drivers. Last February, however, it decided to spend Pounds 150,000 on two coaches of its own. Direct control of the coaches and drivers helps to ensure higher standards of customer service, Mrs Merrell says. 'The most important things for us are repeat business and recommended business.' But even for hotels that can afford to invest, better service and facilities are not a panacea. 'What we've done means we've been able to hold our own,' Mrs Merrell says. 'We're still working longer and harder for less. That's the simple truth.'</p>

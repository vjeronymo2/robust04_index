			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Important Lesson From Struggle for the Cause of </F> Socialism'" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Papers here Friday  carried "Important Lesson From Struggle for the Cause of  Socialism", an article by Mikhail Zemskov, chief editor of the  Russian paper PATRIOT.    In the article the author wrote that the reality in which  socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism revived in some  countries in recent years gave the serious lesson that of  paramount importance in smashing challenges of the imperialist  allied forces and steadily advancing the cause of socialism is  to correctly solve the question of succeeding to the  revolutionary cause, the question of succeeding to leadership.    Stating that he has read many famous works of Comrade Kim  Chong- il including "The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism  and the General Line of Our Party", "On the Fundamentals of  Revolutionary Party Building" and "Abuses of Socialism Are  Intolerable" and visited Korea on several occasions and made a  deep analysis of the reality, he said he deeply realized in this  course that the question of succeeding to leadership is not only  the basic factor of the advance of the socialist cause in Korea  but the main point decisive of the rise or fall of the  international communist movement.    The socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of chuche which  was started and has been developed by Comrade Kim Il-song is  being successfully carried forward by the heir to him, Comrade  Kim Chong-il, to accomplishment, the author wrote, and went on:    Characteristic of the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il for  carrying forward the cause of socialism to accomplishment is  that he is accelerating the cause of socialism at faster pace  not only by defending and succeeding to the outstanding  ideological and theoretical activities and immortal exploits of  Comrade Kim Il-song but also by developing and enriching them in  conformity with the requirements of the development of the times  and with the aspirations of the people.    In carrying forward the cause of socialism, the  revolutionary  cause of chuche, to accomplishment Comrade Kim Chong-il has  effected new innovations in the revolution and construction as a  whole, always set bold goals and attained them successfully. As  a result, fundamental changes have taken place in all fields  including the party and state affairs, economic and cultural  construction and the building of revolutionary Armed Forces.    The expansion in scope and development of the cause of  socialism, the revolutionary cause of chuche pioneered by  Comrade Kim Il-song in the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, fully show the great personality of Comrade Kim Chong-il  as an outstanding and tested leader.    What I must stress in particular among the victories and  successes made by Comrade Kim Chong-il in carrying forward and  developing the cause of socialism is the singlehearted unity of  the leader, the party and the masses.    In Korea today the whole party, the entire Army and all the  people are unfailingly loyal to their leader, devotedly  upholding his cause and firmly united ideologically and  purposefully and In- moral obligations.    All the people regard Comrade Kim Chong-il, an illustrious  leader, as their father and are united behind him in one mind.  Herein lie the source of the invincibility and durability of the  Korean-style socialism.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is  shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the  imperialists, defending the security of the country and the  dignity of the nation and safeguarding and developing the  socialist system with its invincible revolutionary Armed Forces  and with the might of singlehearted unity.    Conclusions drawn from the present realities of the DPRK,  now  a socialist bastion, and of the international communist movement  which is undergoing ordeals in face of all challenges bespeak  that the cause of socialism will be firmly defended and  accomplished if leadership over the revolution and construction  is carried forward by an outstanding leader, but, otherwise it  will play into the hands of the renegades of socialism and end  in failure.    The DPRK where the question of succeeding to leadership has  been solved successfully by Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genuine  people's leader, serves as a model of world socialism, as a  beacon of hope for the people who are fighting for socialism and  communism.    Political and public figures and progressive people of many  countries in the world look up to and revere Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people, as the  outstanding leader of the present times and are rising in the  struggle to defend and develop the cause of socialism.    Socialism, the ideal and aspiration of mankind, is sure to  be  crowned with victory.</p>

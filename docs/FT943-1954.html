			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Jobs burden for women Economic recession and structural changes in central and eastern Europe have led to more unemployment, increased part-time work and lower wages for women, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. A report prepared for a UN conference next month in Vienna on the situation of women in Europe says that women account for a growing share of the labour force. However, particularly in the service sector, women's jobs are still segregated at the lower end of the labour market, upward mobility and career prospects are limited and many women are left outside the full-time jobs market. A new employment pattern is emerging which is 'highly feminised', the report says. This comprises highly skilled full-time workers and a large 'periphery', usually lower skilled, and employed 'when needed'. The report notes that in western Europe unemployment hits women consistently harder than men, while in central and eastern Europe women have been most affected by the rise in poverty.</p>

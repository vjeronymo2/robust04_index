			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bileca, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Command of the  Herzegovina Corps today issued a cautionary note to the  population of this area. It says that protective measures  should be immediately taken to provide maximum protection for  people and property from possible attacks by the NATO air force.    It stresses that it is necessary to tidy up cellars and  communal shelters and secure the most basic quantities of food  and equipment for administering first aid to the wounded. In  the event of attack one should behave sensibly and follow  instructions by civil defense officials.    The Command of the Herzegovina Corps believes that the  territory of Serbian Herzegovina can be threatened by deliberate  bombardment as well as by technical faults along the flight path  of NATO aircraft. It also points out the possibility of  aircraft carrying lethal loads being shot down or crashing into  each other and their dropping lethal loads at random on  inhabited settlements.    "Serb units are taking every measure to protect free  territory and the population from possible attacks by the NATO  air force and they will warn the population in time about any  possible threat from the air," the Command of the Herzegovina  Corps says in its warning announcement.</p>

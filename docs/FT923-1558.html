			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Macao voters back pro-China line Candidates supporting China easily swept to victory in an election to retain control of the Legislative Assembly in the Portuguese enclave of Macao, which returns to Chinese rule in 1999, according to final results yesterday, AP reports from Macao. The elections, held on Sunday, were for 16 of the assembly's 23 seats. The remaining seven will be filled by Macao's governor. Four candidates from two pro-China parties  - the Traditionalist Development Union and the Traditionalist Union for the Promotion of Progress  - received about 50 per cent of 27,812 votes cast in a direct election. Eight other seats, decided in an indirect election, were won by business interest organisations that normally support China.</p>

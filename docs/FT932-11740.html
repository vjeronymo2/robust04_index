			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London and Dublin 'at one' THE BRITISH and Irish governments 'are at one' on Northern Ireland, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday. After talks in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, Mr Hurd said: 'We need a fair and widely acceptable political agreement . . . which has to cover all three strands of talks that are taking place.' Mr Hurd reinforced recent statements by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that there could be no 'internal settlement' in the province and any solution had to take into account the relations between the two governments, their relationships with Northern Ireland, and relationships between the Northern Ireland parties - hence the three 'strands'. The last such talks on Northern Ireland's future administration ended last November without any significant agreement. The Unionist parties - and the Democratic Unionist party in particular - have since laid down a precondition that the Irish government must drop its territorial claim to the province, written in its constitution, before any new talks can begin. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Spring reaffirmed, however, their determination to see the talks resumed. When asked about the controversial move last month by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, to hold talks with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, at the latter's request, Mr Spring said: 'Our position is that which it has always been, that the government will not enter into talks with the men of violence. If they move away from violence then that opens possibilities for them to enter talks . . . Mr Hume is an experienced politician and I like to think he knows what he is doing.'</p>

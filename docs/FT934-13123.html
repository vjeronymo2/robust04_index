			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): When the penny was black and Britain great FOR ANYONE interested in starting a stamp collection, there could hardly be a better time, writes Antony Thorncroft. The instability is over; a slow upward trend is discernible, though prices are still modest, especially for British stamps. For Pounds 2,000, or even less, a year, a good collection could be assembled. British stamps are the obvious field for the British collector (in the main, nationals favour their own postal heritage). They also have the advantage of attracting foreign collectors, because it was Great Britain, in 1840, which issued the first stamp, the Penny Black, and got the whole enterprise going. Most serious collectors specialise, and Great Britain offers myriad choices. You could spend a lifetime investigating the Penny Black, collecting stamps from the 12 printing plates (Plate 11 is the rarest, and a single Penny Black from here could sell for well over Pounds 500), or multiples, or used examples, or stamps in mint condition, or particular cancellation marks, or Penny Blacks on letters, and letters to particular destinations. (These days, there is much more interest in stamps on envelopes: they should never be removed.) A Penny Black on a letter posted on May 6, 1840, the first day of the new postal system, is extremely rare and would fetch over Pounds 20,000. The first Penny Blacks were issued in sheets of 240, each stamp bearing different letters. You could spend years assembling such a complete sheet  - and then sell it for up to Pounds 30,000. In all, 68m Penny Blacks were issued in the nine months before it was replaced by the Penny Red. The price of a single Penny Black depends on its condition and its margins, but can range between Pounds 40 and Pounds 150, moving up to Pounds 1,000 for a perfect uncancelled stamp. The average price is perhaps Pounds 50  - still below the level of 1979. A pair of Penny Blacks would be at least Pounds 150. One used after they were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1841 would be valued at Pounds 1,000. In stamps, the key factors are always condition and rarity. The Penny Black was for letters weighing less than half an ounce. Anything between that weight and an ounce needed a Twopenny Blue. These are much rarer, and offer an even better investment opportunity. Their scarcity is not yet reflected in their price  - Pounds 150 for a good example. Then came Penny Reds (each worth around Pounds 1 today); the appearance of perforations in 1854 (which eliminated the need to cut out each stamp with scissors); and the later Victorian period which, according to Sotheby's stamp specialist, Richard Ashton, has hidden potential. He is especially interested in the Penny Reds issued over many years from 1858 on over 150 plates. You can buy 10 Penny Reds of this period for Pounds 1 at a stamp fair; but if you succeeded in acquiring a stamp from every plate, your collection could be worth thousands of pounds. A word of caution: some plates are rare and their stamps might cost Pounds 300. In the 20th century, apart from freak oddities, the highest prices are paid for the attractive Sea Horse Pounds 1 stamp of George V's reign, which can sell for upwards of Pounds 800, and the Postal Union Congress stamp of 1929, which sells for up to Pounds 350. Relatively few high-denomination stamps have survived  - even an Edward VII or George V half-crown (12 1/2 p) stamp is worth Pounds 50  - and they are collected. Stamps issued in the Channel Islands during the German occupation in the second world war are much sought after, as are the stamps those used by British consuls abroad, especially those posted in South America. But the really exceptional prices are reserved for aberrations. In 1988, for example, the price of stamps was raised just before the decorative Christmas issue went on sale. A few priced at the old 13p escaped on to the market and are now valued at Pounds 3,500. A genuine error, with the Queen's head printed upside down, can tempt Pounds 1,000 from some collectors, and stamps missing a colour sell for up to Pounds 100. Everything depends on buyers' fanaticism. Stamps have been collected since 1840, and there is no shortage of information, or advice, for the new enthusiast. Stanley Gibbons produces a catalogue listing all the stamp issues of Great Britain. One word of caution, though: the prices listed against stamps by Gibbons are their retail selling price. Many stamps at auction go much more cheaply. Anyone seeking to acquire each stamp variety (Gibbons reckons there are three distinct versions of the Penny Black) is hunting down 1,666 stamps at the last count. This complete representation of the British postage would be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if it ever came on to the market, an unlikely eventuality. In recent years, the government has attempted to raise revenue by issuing numerous sets of colourful commemorative stamps each year. They are worth collecting, especially for, and by, children, if only to give them a feel for the game. Most of the sets issued in the past 30 years are currently priced by dealers at up to 80 per cent of their face value, but over time they might show a modest appreciation. Speculation ruined the stamp market in the 1970s, and no one wants stamps to become again an object of pure investment. They should only be collected by genuine enthusiasts. As knowledge grows, they offer a fascinating, unending hobby. And history, apart from the few rogue years, suggests that intelligent and discriminating collecting will, over time, prove a sound investment. In the next issue of the Review, Antony Thorncroft will look at the area of collecting that has provided most price excitement in recent years: the stamps of Hong Kong, China and the Far East.</p>

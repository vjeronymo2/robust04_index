			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): The climate is changing - Stephen Joseph asks:  How secure is the motor car's future? THE CAR industry, and all the industries that feed it, from tyres to oil, dominate Western economies. Hence the adage 'what's good for General Motors is good for the USA'. More appropriate, perhaps, is Shelley's verse about the words found on an ancient tablet in the sands of the desert: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings. Look on my works ye mighty and despair. The mighty car industry may not be about to follow Ozymandias into oblivion, but it certainly faces some tough challenges, starting with environmental pressures of pollution (local and global), noise and resource use. The car industry applauds itself for responding to them by fitting catalytic converters, promoting recycling of components, accepting progressively tougher exhaust emission standards. But limits on these may have been reached. The German car industry has told politicians that proposed new pollution standards are unachievable. California, the most motorised country on earth, is demanding 'zero emission vehicles', making the motor industry move towards alternative fuels such as gas, electricity or plant-based bio-fuels. Such options are not available for all countries, and in any case may conflict with other energy demands or other land uses. Electric cars simply shift pollution from street to power station, which means extra coal or nuclear stations, neither of which are environmentally attractive. So the environmental challenge is shifting towards restricting car use, or even ownership. Governments extrapolating past trends in travel have produced forecasts of traffic growth which are environmentally frightening and, in cities and densely populated European countries, are clearly going to produce 'gridlock'. Old road lobby arguments that building roads will free traffic and therefore cut pollution from stop-start driving are being squashed by the sheer weight of projected traffic. Policy options to address these forecasts vary, and depend on cultural and political factors in each country. Few Westerners realise that in Japan, home of the fastest growing motor industry, urban dwellers cannot own a car unless they can prove they have an off-street parking space for it. Such options are less likely to be acceptable in the US or Europe, but increasing controls on car use seem likely. Road pricing, charging people to drive into congested cities, seems in tune with free market economics and is actively under consideration in many countries, though politicians are treading warily after angry motorists burned an Oslo toll booth. 'Sticks' such as pricing, area bans or increased parking controls are therefore likely to be packaged with 'carrots' such as improved public transport, park and ride and better pedestrian and cycle facilities. But congestion is no longer just an urban problem; popular rural areas like National Parks suffer it too, and Governments are looking at restraint or even bans on cars in key 'honeypot areas' such as Yosemite valley or Britain's Peak District. On their own, policies that restrain cars in some congested areas pose no real threat to the car industry. Indeed, European car makers have accepted it and are even in places promoting park and ride themselves (the British industry, depressingly, does not yet seem to see the problem with traffic growth). But the evidence is that such area restraint will not be enough to meet the environmental challenge; policy-makers trying to control greenhouse gases or improve local air quality simply cannot accept indefinite traffic growth. So policies that restrain traffic in certain areas may be joined by others. One approach, adopted in principle by the European Commission, is that 'transport is too cheap'. The road lobby case, that motorists pay more in taxes than they get in road spending, is being undermined by economists calculating the environmental and other costs caused by road transport and demanding that these costs be 'internalised' in taxing road vehicles. Environmentalists have seized on this; the European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&amp;E), which brings together environmental groups across Europe (not just the EC), is carrying out a study on the extent of external costs and ways to internalise them. The first target may be freight traffic, which policy makers generally accept is under-taxed, but cars may follow. One transport academic has suggested it be part of 'ecological tax reform', shifting taxation from labour and capital on to motoring and other environmentally damaging activities. There is a means and ends argument here, whether internalising costs is an end in itself or just one means (allied with regulation and public spending) to meet environmental targets, but the effect would still be huge. Complementing this are moves to change land use planning so as to reduce car dependence. Australia has already opted for 'urban consolidation'; the British Government is already issuing guidance to councils urging them to plan so as to cut car use, and the Dutch planning system now divides locations and activities on the extent of car use. Those are just the environmental challenges. Safety poses another set of questions. Some academics and policy-makers now argue that making cars safer only allows drivers to drive faster and therefore kill more pedestrians and cyclist. There is a broader issue here, of people, especially children, being driven off the street by traffic. This adds to arguments for area restraint and traffic calming but it also poses more fundamental challenges to the car culture of speed and power. The car is not just a means of travel, it is a cultural icon, a symbol of wealth and status, celebrated in song and story. But such icons have come and gone. Climates are changing, in policy as well as in the planet. The medical profession is beginning to target the car as a public health problem. Like that other public health problem, the cigarette, the car industry still has plenty of unexploited third world markets to open up, but the difference is that third world tobacco addiction hurts only the smokers  -China and Africa aspiring to Californian levels of car use will hurt California as well as themselves. The car bears the seeds of its own destruction; its promise of freedom is diluted by jams today, and more tomorrow. Maybe the genie of personal mobility cannot go back in the bottle, maybe the huge lobbying power of the car industry will keep the environmental challenges at bay or under wraps. But the challenges are huge and they will not be solved by technical fixes alone. And if the world can find less transport-dependent forms of economic growth, as it has made growth less energy-intensive, the car's pivotal role in society will diminish and human expressions of status and fashion may transfer to something less damaging.

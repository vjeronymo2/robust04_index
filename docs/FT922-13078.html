			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Officials see Gatt Round running out of steam TRADE officials acknowledged yesterday that the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks has run out of steam. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, told a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) that without shifts in position by the major traders, the Round could not be concluded successfully. After 'a promising start', country-by-country negotiations in Geneva on improving market access for foreign goods and services were losing momentum, he said. Mr Germain Denis, chairman of the market access negotiations, said good prospects existed for a substantial package of trade liberalisation measures, with many countries indicating they would meet or go beyond the one-third target cut in overall tariffs. But a political breakthrough was needed in the main bilateral market access negotiations (by implication, those between the US and the EC), to unblock the talks on both agriculture and industrial goods. In addition, several countries have refused to convert import curbs on certain farm products into tariffs as required by the draft Uruguay Round text on agriculture. This point was amply illustrated yesterday when much of the meeting was taken up with a heated debate over the EC's recent decision on banana imports, which protects high-cost Caribbean and north African bananas at the expense of Central American producers. The EC decision means it will not replace banana import quotas with tariffs, a move which could prop open the door for other countries to exempt from tariffication products they consider especially sensitive, notably rice for Japan and South Korea. In services, Mr Dunkel singled out the widespread exemptions from the non-discriminatory most-favoured-nation principle being sought by the US as a major hurdle. Mr Dunkel said he would hold consultations with negotiators after Easter, to decide how to tackle what he hoped would be the last leg of the negotiating process. Another TNC meeting is likely towards the end of April, after what is seen as a key meeting between President Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, on April 22. See editorial comment</p>

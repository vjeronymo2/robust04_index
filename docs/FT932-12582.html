			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Fed backs dollar against rising yen THE US Federal Reserve intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying dollars for yen, in a clear indication that the Clinton administration is concerned about the recent appreciation of the Japanese currency. The first such Fed intervention this year came after the US currency hit another all-time low of Y109.15 in New York. Dealers said there were four rounds of dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve in New York at levels between Y109.50 and Y110.50. The intervention pushed the dollar up to a New York close of Y111.7. There was no detailed explanation for the intervention from US officials. However, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Secretary, told a senate subcommittee hearing that excessive volatility in exchange rates could be counter-productive. The US intervention also followed Japanese accusations that Washington had been trying to talk up the yen in an effort to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Bentsen said: 'I think there have been some misconceptions about US exchange rate policy. I want to underscore the administration's belief that exchange rates should reflect fundamentals. We are monitoring developments closely.' Mr Bentsen was quoted as saying there would be a communique on exchange rates after a Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting tomorrow. Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said that the Clinton administration might now think that the continuing depreciation of the dollar would have only a limited impact on the trade surplus.

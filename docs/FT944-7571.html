			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Labour tax refund to help the jobless Labour will today unveil proposals to give employers a sizeable tax rebate in return for hiring the long-term unemployed. The party will suggest that employers be offered a rebate of at least Pounds 50 a week for a period of six months. The rebate would apply in cases where those taken on had been unemployed for more than two years. The proposal will form part of an alternative Budget to be presented today by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and other senior shadow cabinet members. The party's package will focus on three areas: investment, getting the unemployed back to work, and taxation. Mr Brown indicated earlier this month that the alternative Budget would be designed to rebuild the economy and ease the impact of tax increases on the less well off. He said it would demonstrate how the government could avoid implementing the second phase of the increase in value added tax on domestic fuel - from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent - which is planned for April. The increase could be replaced by revenue from other sources, including a windfall levy on the 'excess' profits of regional electricity companies. Other measures would include an energy-efficiency programme, intended to create employment for building workers and a training programme for the unemployed.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No taboo on privatisation Sir, In the tale of two east German cities, Judy Dempsey reports that a shortfall of revenue could speed up the privatisation of local services, 'almost taboo in western Germany' ('Reconstructing bankrupt east Germany', November 2). Nonsense. Outside the Free State of Bavaria, there are few German cities the size of Rostock or Halle where local services are not run by private companies. German municipalities may establish joint stock companies as municipal enterprises for their provision. 'Formal privatisation' combines independence of management guaranteed by company law, direct access to the financial markets and courts, and flexibility of private sector options with the rigours of commercial accountancy requirements and strategic political control through municipal ownership. With these benefits, there has been little need for other types of privatisation in Germany. R Andreas Kraemer, IEEP Bonn, Roonstrasse 7, 53175 Bonn, Germany</p>

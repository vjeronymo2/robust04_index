			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Fraud squad warns of loan scam SCOTLAND YARD'S fraud squad is warning businesses about the activities of confidence tricksters who promise to arrange large loans but disappear with the advance fees. The latest twist in a long line of cheap-loan frauds involves bogus forms purporting to show that US Treasury bearer bonds are available as security for loans which will never be advanced. It is estimated that 50 or 60 advance fee fraudsters are operating in London and that perhaps a dozen have switched to the US bearer bond mode of operation. The fraud squad says advance fees for arranging the financial packages may amount to 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the loan involved, or a flat rate of Pounds 250,000 or Pounds 500,000. After the fee has been handed over the loan - which may run into tens of million of pounds - never materialises. The fraudsters have targeted business people who are desperate to raise finance but have failed to do so through more conventional channels such as banks or venture capital institutions. The fraud squad's warning is also directed at professional advisers. The fraudsters have taken in the lawyers and accountants advising their victims with the help of bogus evidence that US bearer bonds are available as security. Bearer bonds are a popular vehicle for this type of fraud because they do not show the owner's name. As evidence that they own or control such bonds the fraudsters have been producing copies of US Treasury PD 1832 forms. Among indications that the forms are bogus are that they would have been used for registered securities, not bearer bonds, and that they have expired. One characteristic of these frauds is that the victim may be led to believe that overseas lenders have been found who charge abnormally low interest rates. Another is that the package involves the fraudster promising to invest the loan overseas, apparently in order to provide a strong income stream. Another inducement offered is that having this secured loan will help the victim obtain other finance. The fraud squad is investigating two cases of fraud using PD 1832 forms. It says these latest variants of advance fee fraud are reminiscent of the ICC 290 and 292 frauds perpetrated in the mid 1980s.</p>

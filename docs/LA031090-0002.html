			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMBAUGH'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> Re Rick Du Brow's "Radio's Limbaugh Brings His Opinions to TV," March 3: Rush  Limbaugh is popular because he says things that really bother people and no one  else in the media says it. For example, the excesses of black politicians who  break laws and are not criticized in the press for fear of being labeled  racist.  </P> <P> Secondly, he speaks out against the lack of criticism when there is blatant  behavior on the part of gays, feminists and liberal Democrats (while  Republicans are fair game for criticism). He decries communism and the fact  that the press has just now got around to thinking it's unworkable.  </P> <P> But Rush is not altogether good. He is a self-aggrandizing adolescent who  spends most of his show telling you how wonderful he is, selling his  videotapes, playing terrible music, pushing his pet causes and telling about  women who try to pick him up on airplanes.  </P> <P> The reason he has an audience is those few moments when he expresses the  majority's real opinion. It's like a voice in the wilderness.  </P> <P> GEOFFREY POST, Santa Maria  </P></p>

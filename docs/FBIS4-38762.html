			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Dushanbe officials want to discuss the return of all  Tajik refugees from Afghanistan and elsewhere and security of  the Tajik-Afghan border during the talks with the opposition  that are scheduled to be held in Tehran in mid-June. First  Deputy Chairman Abdujalil Dostiyev of the country's Supreme  Soviet told INTERFAX that the refugees who had fought for the  opposition in the civil war would not be prosecuted because they  were covered by the amnesty.    Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov said that no final date  had been set for the Tehran talks. He would not mention any  date so as not to harm the negotiating process.    Alimov said that there would be no changes in the Tajik  Government delegation.    INTERFAX Note: In the Moscow round of talks on 5-19 April  the two sides agreed on the agenda which includes now a  ceasefire, return of the refugees and subsequent consultations.  The opposition, notably Akbar Turajonzoda, one of its leaders,  wants the government delegation, now headed by Labor and  Employment Minister Shukurjon Zukhurov, to be upgraded.    Observers in Dushanbe are concerned that the recent killings  of Russian border guards in Tajikistan may have a negative  impact on the talks. Meanwhile, General Anatoliy Kuptsov,  deputy security minister, dismissed the speculation that these  killings were politically motivated. He said that these were  common crimes.</p>

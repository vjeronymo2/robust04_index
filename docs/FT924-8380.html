			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Express sees profit NATIONAL Express, the scheduled coach service operator joining the stock market later this month, is forecasting a sharp turnabout from pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.2m last year to pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m for the 53 weeks ending January 2. The figure emerged yesterday in a pathfinder prospectus for the flotation. It reflects a strong recovery from heavy restructuring costs taken after last year's management buy-in. The full prospectus, due out on November 24, is likely to value National Express at more than Pounds 50m. The flotation will be through a placing and offer for sale, with 25 per cent of shares being offered to the public. One reason for the flotation, expected to raise about Pounds 25m for National Express, is to help the company pay off borrowings and restructure its balance sheet after a period of rapid change. About Pounds 9m will be used to redeem preference shares held by venture capital funds that backed last year's buy-in. The balance will wipe out Pounds 11m deficit on shareholders' funds, most from a goodwill write-off.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch GDP outstrips forecast Dutch gross domestic product rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 against the year-earlier period, outstripping a preliminary estimate of 1.3 per cent made in early June. The central statistical office said the upward revision was largely due to the availability of more accurate foreign trade figures, which showed a 7.1 per cent jump in the volume of goods and services sold abroad in the first three months of the year. The 1.9 per cent increase - the highest quarterly gain since a 3.3 per cent rise in the opening period of 1992 - was also helped by a 2.5 per cent increase in consumer spending. Purchases of new cars were particularly buoyant, rising by about 25 per cent against the weak first quarter of 1993. Spain's jobless total fell by nearly 30,000 in April-June, the first seasonally adjusted quarterly growth in employment since the opening period of 1991. The jobless total now stands at 3.7m, or 24.2 per cent of the working population. Denmark's unemployment rate in June dropped to 12.3 per cent of the workforce, from 12.4 per cent in May, according to figures released yesterday. Poland's industrial output rose 9.9 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with last year's period. Average inflation over the six months fell to 31.3 per cent from 35.3 per cent in the opening half of 1993.</p>

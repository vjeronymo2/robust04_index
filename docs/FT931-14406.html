			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour split over Maastricht tactics AN EMERGING split in Labour ranks over tactics on the Maastricht bill has given a boost to the government's hopes of defeating Tory opponents of the treaty. As government business managers gambled successfully last night on a vote to force debate beyond 10pm, it emerged that prominent Labour pro-Europeans have challenged their leadership's official policy of relentless tactical opposition. Until now, Labour policy has been to join with Tory Euro-rebels to oppose 'closure' motions that limit debate on hundreds of wrecking amendments, in order to maximise disruption to the government's programme of business. But a number of pro-European Labour MPs are now warning that the party's tactics risk undermining its European credentials while offering little prospect of embarrassing the government. The divisions are expected to emerge publicly tomorrow at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. In last night's vote on whether to press on with the debate, Labour again opposed the government motion on the grounds that 'it is up to the government to get its business through'. But the support of all but one Liberal Democrat MP helped to ensure that the government won the day by a margin of 33 votes (304-271). This left it free to continue considering the bill into the night rather than calling a halt to proceedings at 10pm. Having made its point, the government moved just before midnight that the debate on a group of amendments on industrial and commercial issues be brought to a close. It won this 'closure' by a commanding majority of 238 votes (299-61). Since Labour had made clear it would advise its MPs not to support the substance of the first of this group of amendments if it came to a vote, debate then moved to consideration of transport and energy issues into the small hours. Skilful government handling of the bill and the tacit support of smaller parties have now allowed the government to win closure motions on three of the 25 groups of amendments which must be debated in the committee stage - with the transport and energy group representing the fourth. The legislation is due to return to the Commons today for the second of three consecutive days of detailed debate in its committee stage, More than 85 Labour MPs last month signed a motion calling for the 'rapid completion' of the treaty's ratification. Many of them now want the party leadership to quietly abstain on closure motions as long as reasonable parliamentary time is allocated. The pro-European MPs believe that they can rely on the support of less committed colleagues who have become exasperated at being forced to remain constantly in the Commons simply to vote against closure motions.</p>

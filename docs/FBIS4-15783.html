			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenians in Uniform Were </F> Sought All Over the CIS"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Soldiers and officers of Armenia's Armed  Forces have quite a short time left in which to wear out the  uniform of the former Soviet Army -- until next fall. However,  the replacement of one uniform by another is by no means the  hardest stage on the way to creating a national army.  Particularly when it is being formed under conditions of an  undeclared war and a solid transport blockade which is  paralyzing practically all industry in the republic.    "If we could have established a lull on the border with  Azerbaijan, even for about eight months, but still better for a  year, we would already have at our disposal the army that we  need," Major General Mkrtich Abramyan, Armenian deputy minister  of defense, maintains.    The republic's Ministry of Defense maintains that Armenian  officers in the former Soviet Army were surpassed in numbers  only by Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Armenians in  uniform -- from lieutenants to colonels -- were sought  throughout the territory of the former Union, but by no means  all were attracted by service in a republic experiencing the  incredible difficulties of a blockade. No more than 5-7 percent  of Armenian officers responded to the call to continue their  service in Armenia -- which, of course, could not resolve the  cadre problem. Then it was necessary to appeal to officers who  had been transferred to the reserve five, 10 or even 15 years  ago.    Armenia needs its own military school, maybe more than one.  But there are no instructors. Unwise steps in respect of  Armenia's Russian-speaking population have caused a considerable  number of experienced military instructors at Yerevan's higher  educational institutions to leave the republic. Thus, just six  of the 30 officers who were working recently in the military  department of the capital's Polytechnical Institute are left.  The Defense Ministry has sent a certain number of students to  study in Russian and Belarusian military schools, but this is  very costly.    Another equally important problem is being resolved with  considerably more success than the process of forming the  officer corps -- the problem of drafting people for active  service. The last draft, which was completed last fall, was 105  percent fulfilled.    Gen. Abramyan resolutely refuses to regard Azerbaijan as a  possible enemy, since Yerevan has not had and does not have any  territorial claims on Baku. As regards neighboring Turkey, the  warming of the international situation and also the ongoing  process of rapprochement between military blocs provide no  grounds for treating this NATO member country as a military  enemy either, Mkrtich Abramyan believes.    "The skies over Yerevan, as well as Armenia's entire  airspace, incidentally, are reliably protected by air defense  facilities. We can see an aerial enemy from afar and are  capable of hitting him at any altitude," I was told at the  Defense Ministry.    Combat operations have been going on for approximately two  years now all along the perimeter of the land border with  Azerbaijan. Many Armenian officers are amassing knowledge and  experience on company, battalion, and regiment exercises being  conducted by Russian Army subunits stationed in Armenia. Since  all the combat and technical facilities in Armenia's arsenal  were inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian military  specialists are teaching their colleagues how to competently  store, repair, and operate complex combat hardware.    Apart from the arms handed over to the republic by the  command of the former Soviet Army, Armenia does not purchase or  acquire anything else.</p>

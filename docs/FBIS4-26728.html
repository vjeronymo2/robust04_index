			<p>BFN     [Text] The province's state-owned budgetary industrial  enterprises have gradually reduced losses this year.    The province's state-owned enterprises witnessed another 7  percent drop in losses in May this year after seeing a  significant drop in March and April.    In the first quarter of this year, some state-owned  enterprises in the province either suspended operation or  operated below capacity, resulting in a growing amount of  losses. Given such a severe situation, party committees and  government departments at all levels in the province immediately  sent cadres to the grass-roots level and into enterprises to  conduct investigations and study, with the result that they  mapped out a series of countermeasures and turned challenges  into opportunities. In accordance with the state policy of  providing different state-owned enterprises with different  amounts of circulation funds, the provincial departments  concerned made a conscientious analysis of and divided the  province's enterprises into several groups, providing  enterprises capable of generating better economic results and  producing readily marketable products with more circulation  funds with an eye to helping them expand production and upgrade  operation. Furthermore, the provincial departments concerned  stopped supplying circulation funds to enterprises producing  unsalable products; ordered enterprises incapable of turning  losses into profits to suspend operation; and made proper  arrangements for guaranteeing the basic livelihood of staff and  workers of closed enterprises.    The aforementioned measures have succeeded in improving the  province's product mix; raising the output of the province's  large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, including Wuhan  Iron and Steel Company, Zhongqi Company, and so on; and laying a  sound basis for the province's normal industrial operation.    In the January-May period, the province's state-owned  budgetary enterprises registered a 42.59 percent increase in  profits and taxes in comparison with the same period last year,  of which profits rose by 73.1 percent, with the result that  their capital profit rate, sales profit rate, and  production-marketing rate rose by 0.62 percent, 2.86 percent,  and 93 percent respectively over the same period last year and  were also higher than the country's average in the same period  this year.</p>

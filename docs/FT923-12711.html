			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Gefco launches Pounds 100m 15-year Eurobond issue GEFCO, the UK government-backed export finance agency, took advantage of the relieved tone of the sterling bond market yesterday to make an opportunistic Pounds 100m 15-year Eurobond issue. Long-dated UK government bonds rallied in the afternoon as dealers expressed relief that the German Bundesbank had decided not to increase its Lombard interest rate. Such a move could have led to higher UK interest rates. The bonds issued yesterday carry a coupon of 9 1/4 per cent and were re-offered at a fixed price of 99.436. At this level the yield was 30 basis points more than long-dated gilts. The benchmark in the sector, a Pounds 500m European Investment Bank issue, trades at around 32 basis points. The bonds sold almost exclusively to UK institutional investors, although the deal was structured in bearer, Eurosterling form. Turkey continued its international borrowing programme by launching a Dollars 200m five-year issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley International. The issue is Turkey's second visit to the Eurodollar sector, following a Dollars 250m five-year issue, with a put option after three years. The country has also borrowed in the US and Japanese domestic markets. The earlier Eurodollar deal was bid yesterday at 230 basis points over US Treasury bonds. The new bonds will be priced at a lower yield spread, 210-220 basis points, despite the longer maturity of the bonds. The pricing was seen as aggressive by some firms, although the lead manager argued that the new bond would still yield substantially more than the outstanding paper due to the steepness of the US Treasury yield curve. Syndicate officials also grumbled that underwriters' fees of  3/4 per cent were shaved to a level which did not reflect the risk of underwriting the bonds. Morgan Stanley noted that Turkey was an OECD country and now carries an investment grade credit rating. The deal will be priced today. Borrowers from the emerging markets of Latin America look set to launch another wave of international bond issues following several weeks of only light issuance. Yesterday, Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company, launched a Dollars 140m two-year floating rate note issue, lead managed by Chase Investment Bank. The deal is the first substantial floating-rate issue by a Latin American borrower since the debt crisis of the early 1980s. The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance a Dollars 250m fixed-rate issue called by Petrobras earlier this year. The bonds fall due for repayment on August 3. The rest of the call will be refinanced out of cash flow. The paper pays a healthy 425 basis points over the six-month London interbank offered rate. The flow of issues by Brazilian issuers is likely to be staunched by new government regulations which will restrict international borrowings to maturities of three years or more. Today, Argentina Telecom is expected to launch a Dollars 200m five-year fixed-rate issue via J. P. Morgan. Telefonica, another Argentine telecommunications company, is preparing to raise international funding, with bankers expecting a three-year issue via Lehman Brothers. On Monday, Argentina's credit rating was lifted by two notches to B1 - still four notches below investment grade - by Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency. Next week, Banco de Chile, the country's largest private sector bank, is expected to launch a Dollars 75m issue - the first international issue by a Chilean borrower since the debt crisis of the 1970s. Shares in Thermo Electron, the US technology company, stabilised yesterday following the launch of a Dollars 200m five-year convertible bond issue on Wednesday. The shares fell Dollars 2 5/8 on the day of issue, widening the conversion premium on the 4 5/8 per cent bonds from an unusually low 14 per cent to 22 per cent. Lead manager Lehman Brothers yesterday quoted the bonds at 102, from an issue price of par.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Has the Ice Begun To Break?"] </F>   [Text] Several people have been detained on suspicion of  being involved in the murder of Gia Gulua, deputy minister of  internal affairs. We were informed about this in the press  center of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD].    "Although," specified V. Gogolashvili, head of the press  center, "it is still too early to say that the murderers have  been caught and, generally, to make any loud statements."    Less than a week has passed since the murder of Gulua and  two  MVD employees accompanying him. The investigative bodies are  refraining from presenting any specific versions. In the  immediate days and even hours following the barbaric terrorist  act on the Nutsubidze plateau [as published], it became known  only that the police had managed to identify the registration  number of one of the cars that had blocked the deputy minister's  path and from which the first rounds of automatic gun fire came  and also to ascertain the type of weapon used in the killing.  An easy logical calculation suggests that, once the weapon has  been identified from the cartridge case, this means it has been  officially registered; however, some petty criminal scum is not  so decent as to register his weapon. A brief journalistic  survey carried out at the scene of the incident enabled a  curious detail to be added to the picture: Literally 15 minutes  before the murders took place, unknown persons carrying  automatic weapons chased some children into buildings located  near a school and kindergarten. What amazing humaneness,  particularly given what occurred later.    As directly regards the versions of what happened, according  to unofficial information gleaned "in the corridors," the  investigation is leaning toward the view that Gulua was the  victim of mafia structures. He was in charge of the transport  police. Highways and railroads in Georgia have already become  virtually the principal feeding trough for underground business.  It is also nothing new that Georgia is increasingly becoming a  transit country for drugs and this activity comes into direct  conflict with the work of this transport police (along with  specialized structures).    However, one cannot of course exclude other versions as  well.  Gulua, who stood out as a man of principle, was a fairly  well-known figure in the Georgian law enforcement bodies. He  did not play an insignificant role in the events that took place  at the end of 1991 and beginning of 1992 [overthrow of  ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia]; he was later taken prisoner by  the Zviadists in western Georgia and a serious operation was  undertaken by special subunits to secure his release. In  Abkhazia, Gulua was also in the command structures.... He could  "hinder" many people.    A serious investigation is underway. The Procurator's  Office, the security services, and the MVD are involved in it.  These bodies do not forgive when one of their own is killed and  they should not forgive. How often have we written about  various terrorist acts and almost on every occasion we have  concluded with the words: "One would like to hope that, at  least, this time...." Now as well, we would sincerely like to  hope that the guilty persons will be found and punished -- as in  all previous terrorist acts, a list of which we have compiled  from memory below, which are the most notorious cases. We have  added brief comments on the progress made in solving these  cases. To be honest, these comments do not raise one's spirits  particularly.    Attempt on the life of D. Ioseliani [former first deputy  chairman of State Council, leader of "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary  group that has now been incorporated into the Rescue Corps] (13  June 1992); explosion on Chikovani Street [Tbilisi] --  investigation concluded; trial in progress;    Explosion in car of D. Ioseliani on the airport road  [Tbilisi] -- under investigation;    Murder of Tbilisi Procurator General M. Kurdadze -- under  investigation;    Explosion in car of Defense Minister G. Karkarashvili in  western Georgia -- no proceedings instigated;    Armed attack on the headquarters of the Georgian National-  Democratic Party -- under investigation;    Explosion in the headquarters of the Union of Georgian  Traditionalists -- under investigation;    Murder of F. Woodruff, high-ranking employee in the U.S.  Embassy and American special services -- murderer convicted and  sentenced to 15 years imprisonment;    Explosion in the state philharmonic building during the  conference of parties and organizations belonging to the  national- democratic movement -- under investigation;    Armed attack on the 7 DGHE editorial office -- under  investigation;    Murder of G. Zhordaniya, director of the First Tbilisi  Tobacco Factory -- under investigation;    Murder of "Mkhedrioni" leaders Z. Vepkhvadze and G. Svanadze  -- under investigation;    Murder of Deputy Defense Minister N. Kekelidze -- under  investigation;    Explosion in the Rescue Corps building -- under  investigation;    Explosion in the headquarters of the Georgian Popular Front  -- under investigation;    Explosion in the "Ibervizia" independent television company  building -- under investigation;    Explosion in the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial office --  under  investigation;    Bribery and arson committed at the apartment of opera singer  P. Burchuladze -- under investigation;    Murder of G. Gulua, deputy minister of internal affairs,  chief of the transport police -- under investigation....    We have decided to end with ellipses. Our readers certainly  understand why.</p>

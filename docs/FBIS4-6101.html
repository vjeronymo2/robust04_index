			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Kawahito: "Ministry of Finance: The </F> Surprising True Face of Vice Minister Saito; The Kind of Shrewd  Person Who Comes Along Once in a Decade"]    [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit conference on economic  consultation broke down. Hosokawa has a troubled look again. One  difficulty arises after the other, but the Diet and the Prime  Minister's Residence are not the only places where those in  power have trouble. The same is also true of Kasumigaseki, where  elite bureaucrats reign supreme. The uproar over the national  health tax, which vanished with the dew. Such persons as  Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito of the Ministry of  Finance, who ended up being made the "heavy," seem like symbols  of Kasumigaseki in a difficult time.    Vice Minister Saito's nickname within the Ministry of  Finance  is "Densuke." It is said to come from the fact that he says  "den" when he wins at mahjong, but in the tax system reform this  time, he was unable to make that sound.    Ever since Prime Minister Hosokawa set forth the idea of a  national welfare tax at a predawn press conference on 3  February, and it collapsed completely in the twinkling of an  eye, Vice Minister Saito has been hounded at Ministry-of-Finance  press conferences. At a press conference when there was much  discord at meetings of representatives of the governing parties,  it went like this:    [Question] The rate of support for the cabinet has dropped  20  percent, would you care to comment on that?    [Saito] I would like to reserve comment on that because it  is  not something said by the authorities concerned."    [Question] Is it not true that the biggest problem with  Hosokawa's idea is the fact that there was little discussion?  Ought not you, as the authority in charge of government finance,  give an explanation?    [Saito] I shall accept that as advice for future.    [Question] Are you saying that you will not change the way  you have been doing things up till now?    [Saito] We are now in the middle of a meeting of  representatives (of the governing parties), so the position of  the authorities concerned is to reserve comment.    Jiro Saito is 58 years old. Since joining the Ministry of  Finance in 1959, in the Budget Bureau, which is in charge of  compiling the budget, he smoothly ascended the ladder from  assistant division chief to division chief, budget examiner,  vice bureau chief, and bureau chief; and in June 1993, he  assumed the post of vice minister, the ultimate post for a  bureaucrat.  <H5>  Cool Calculation Lurks Behind an Uncompromising Attitude </H5>   "He is said to be the kind of great vice minister who comes  along once in a decade. However, at press conferences and the  like, his favorite statement is `That is why I said that  earlier,' and his blunt responses are conspicuous. One almost  suspects that he is making fools of people, thinking that such  people as politicians and the media do not understand anyhow"  (economic reporter).    Even at the press conference upon his assumption to the  position of vice minister, when asked what he aspired to do, he  said: "At present, it is as the former vice minister said, I  have nothing to add." Such being the case, he is bound to appear  haughty and arrogant.    Although he has awesome ability, or because of his awesome  ability, in any case, he is unpopular. Speaking in terms of  political circles, he is exactly like Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito, who along with him was considered a "war  criminal" because of the welfare-tax idea this time.    He does not like dinner parties nor does he play golf.  According to people, his attitude toward his subordinates is  that "He is a person whose likes and dislikes are very clear;  they are divided into those he treats with great fondness and  those with whom he will have nothing to do."    "He is said to dislike dinner parties. But if he attends a  dinner party after allowing people to say that, he can give  people a strong sense of gratitude, thinking that Saito, who  dislikes dinner parties, has been kind enough to come. People  think that they heard that he is a disagreeable person, but he  talks to them pleasantly with a smile, or some such. I also have  a feeling that Saito is considering such things.    "Even Ichiro Ozawa has something about him that makes one  end  up yielding to him if one is spoken to kindly by him, does he  not" (another reporter)?    He suggests that there may be surprisingly cool calculation  behind the uncompromising attitude.  <H5>  A Lone Struggle Over the "Gulf Tax Increase" </H5>   These two, who are exactly alike, are considered to be the  ones who designed the welfare tax idea this time.    The idea for reform of the tax system set forth by Prime  Minister Hosokawa was put off, and the shortfall in revenue  because of the tax reduction will be covered by the first  deficit-covering bonds in five years. It turned out to be the  result that Vice Minister Saito most detests.    One of Vice Minister Saito's subordinates when he was in the  Budget Bureau says:    "His assessment within the ministry was that of a steady  person. In any case, he was absolutely opposed to  deficit-covering bonds. Even after breaking away in 1990 from  the incontinent issuing of deficit-covering bonds, he has made  that a symbol of legitimacy. In the Budget Bureau, there is a  temperment that likes that kind of steadiness."    At a time when the balance of deficit-covering bonds exceeds  200 trillion yen, it is natural for Finance Ministry bureaucrats  to dislike such bonds; however, Saito's dislike is said to be  utter and complete. A person related to the Ministry of Finance  disclosed a certain "war experience."    "At the time of the Gulf war, you must remember that  beginning in 1991 we made such gulf tax increases as a special  corporation tax in order to fund Japan's contribution. At that  time, the trend of opinion in the Ministry of Finance was  deficit-covering bonds, not a tax increase. The one who worked  hard, alone, for the tax-increase line was Saito."    When a meeting in the Ministry of Finance had begun to agree  on deficit-covering bonds, Saito, who was deputy vice minister,  stood up and addressed the meeting. The content of his speech is  reported within the ministry to have been as follows:    "Deficit-covering bonds, what are you talking about? Even  the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is saying that a tax increase  cannot be avoided. What a shame that the Ministry of Finance,  which is in the position of protecting government finances,  talks about deficit-covering bonds."    It is said that all those Finance Ministry executives  present  at the meeting were argued into silence by Secretariat Director  Saito, who spoke eloquently, so the gulf-tax-increase became a  reality.    "It was the deputy vice minister. It was not a vice minister  nor was it chief of the Tax Bureau, the person in direct charge  of the matter, nor was it chief of the Budget Bureau. The chief  of the Tax Bureau at that time was former Vice Minister Mamoru  Ozaki, and he, too, said that deficit-covering bonds were  unavoidable. It is said that ill will developed between Saito  and Ozaki after that. It seems that when Ozaki got drunk, he  would say things like `That SOB Saito'" (the same Finance  Ministry-related person).    The disposition in the Tax Bureau, which handles taxes, and  in the Budget Bureau, which compiles the budget, is said to be  somewhat different. LDP Diet Member Hakuo Yanagisawa is a former  Finance Ministry bureaucrat. He is two years junior to Vice  Minister Saito, but while admitting that Vice Minister Saito is  "an able person," Yanagisawa, who has experience in the Tax  Bureau, makes some harsh observations in relation to taxes:    "I think that the matter this time also is an uproar caused  by someone who does not know about taxes meddling in them. He  has worked only in the budget field, so he has no `sense of a  reasonable level' concerning taxes. He has no fear of taxes. I  cannot help but say that his career lacks balance."    Therefore, now Diet Member Yanagisawa also says of the  atmosphere in the Tax Bureau:    "There appears to be no sense of a setback because they  followed Saito grudgingly while being dissatisfied with his way  of doing things. I suspect they are thinking: See, we told you  so."    This Vice Minister Saito also has a slight "historical"  connection with Prime Minister Hosokawa.  <H5>  What Ought To Have Been the Strongest Team Came Out the Loser </H5>   It was a half century ago that Prime Minister Hosokawa's  grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, served as prime minister, and a  persen who was commissioned to do work for the Konoe cabinet as  an advisor was the (Hozumi) Ozaki of the Sorge spy affair. In  1939 Ozaki was commissioned to do work for the Manchurian  Railway Inspection Department and went to China. One of his  subordinates was Saito's father.    Saito became a bureaucrat on his father's advice. Then he  happened to cross paths with Prime Minister Hosokawa in this  time of upheaval.    According to a certain person who keeps tabs on  Kasumigaseki,    "Because of the birth of the coalition government, the  Ministry of Finance is trying to seize the initiative. The  situation is such that there is almost the term `Finance  Ministry government.' The Ministry of Finance has shaken up the  Hosokawa government by holding the budget and stimulus measures  hostage. In the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI], which has lost the support of zoku Diet members, Vice  Minister (Hideaki) Kumano has been completely won over to  Saito's way of doing things, so it is called "the second  Ministry of Finance." The underlying cause of that MITI bureau  chief resignation uproar is also found there."    At such a time, Ozawa, who heretofore had no contacts in the  Finance Ministry, and Vice Minister Saito form a team. The two  are said to have found themselves kindred spirits when Ozawa  talked up the concept of an international contribution tax two  years ago. The LDP Research Commission on the Tax System was  angered, saying, "it ignores the discussions of the Research  Commission on the Tax System." It was defeated, but the  previously mentioned person related to the Ministry of Finance  says:    "At that time, the only one who supported Ozawa's idea was  Saito, who was chief of the Budget Bureau. Their relationship  has existed since then. When an uproar occurred over whether  Ozawa would or would not form a new party, he suddenly made  himself vanish from before the media. There is talk that Ozawa  met with Saito for two hours during that time."    This means that the Ozawa-Saito team has now failed for the  second time, but this related person goes on to say:    "In spite of Ozawa's objective being good, he is weak on the  process. Since the Ministry of Finance is the government office  which is most skillful at process, if Ozawa and the Ministry of  Finance team up, there will be nothing as strong. Unfortunately,  Saito is an official whose process is high-handed. Because of  that, they came out on the losing side--both times."    A bureaucrat, who is supposed to be an inconspicuous  stagehand, was taken up by a photo magazine and was even  photographed by television while walking a dog. When  inconspicuous stagehands stand out, it is not a very good time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez today urged NATO to refrain from launching air  strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo,  stressing that a settlement of the crisis could be found through  peaceful means.    "Reconciliation dialogue" was the best way to ensure the  withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons from around Sarajevo in an  effort to end the siege of the city, Gonzalez said after talks  with visiting Hungarian President Arpad Goncz.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened  to launch air strikes against the Serbs' positions around  Sarajevo if they fail to withdraw their heavy weapons from  around the city by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 February].    The Hungarian president shared the view of Gonzalez. He told  reporters upon arrival here that "every effort should be exerted  to defuse the crisis without resorting to air strikes."    Also today, Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  said Spain favored diplomatic efforts to end the siege of  Sarajevo, instead of the use of force as proposed by NATO.    He was speaking after returning from France where he had  consulted with French officials on the Bosnian crisis.    The Bosnian Serbs have been under mounting international  pressure to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo  since a mortar attack killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200  others in the city earlier this month.    The Muslims accused the Serbs of launching the attack, a  charge the Serbs denied.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Volvo profits leap to Pounds 761m in first half Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturing company, yesterday reported a leap in first-half profits, confirming a recovery from recession that is fast banishing the memory of the breakdown last December of its plans to merge with France's Renault. The group announced a pre-tax profit of SKr9.02bn (Pounds 761m) compared with just SKr380m in the same period last year. The figure was inflated by a capital gain of SKr4.08bn, but underlying profits were still far ahead of the same stage last year, thanks to surging sales for Volvo cars and trucks, favourable currency movements and the benefits of restructuring. Operating profits reached SKr4.47bn. This included a SKr849m contribution from BCP, the consumer products group fully taken over this year, but followed an operating profit in the first half of 1993 of SKr166m. Volvo said its second quarter group operating profit of SKr2.5bn, up from SKr355m last time, was the highest in any quarter in Volvo's history. The result will give the board installed after the collapse of the Renault merger confidence to push ahead with its plan to concentrate on motor industry operations and shed some SKr40bn worth of non-core assets built up under Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar who quit in December. The proceeds, combined with renewed profits flow, will help fund Volvo's big product development costs, especially in cars. In a rare interview in a Swedish newspaper at the weekend, Mr Gyllenhammar bitterly criticised the new direction. But Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, yesterday underscored his commitment to the strategy and implied the board believed it had the full backing of the workforce. Group sales in the first six months jumped to SKr75.67bn from SKr48.8bn, partly due to a SKr10.1bn contribution from BCP and currency effects. But Volvo said underlying sales were still 30 per cent higher than last time. Unit car sales were up 20 per cent at 189,000, with sales rising fastest in the US and Nordic countries, but sales were also ahead in Germany and Japan despite falling markets. Car sales rose to SKr36.55bn from SKr27.02bn and the car group swung to an operating profit of SKr1.47bn from a loss of SKr70bn. In the truck division, unit sales were up 37 per cent to 32,400 thanks mainly to higher demand in Europe and Brazil. Sales rose to SKr24.23bn from SKr17.59bn and operating profits jumped to SKr1.77bn from SKr61m. The capital gain stemmed mainly from the SKr2.6bn sale of Volvo's controlling holding in Cardo to Incentive, a Wallenberg family company. Lex, Page 16 Incentive up 45%, Page 22</p>

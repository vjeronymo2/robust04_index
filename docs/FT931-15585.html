			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood agrees refinancing package TRENCHERWOOD, a USM-quoted housebuilder and property company, yesterday announced a refinancing package under which Pounds 35m of bank debts and claims have been swapped to ordinary and preference shares. The proposals will dilute existing shareholdings to 30 per cent of the enlarged capital. They will be further diluted to 15.9 per cent if the conversion of the preference shares takes place in full. The restructuring agreement involved 10 banks and building societies. The main lenders to the parent company were Midland Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Schroders, who have taken the preference shares. The project lenders, which accounted for about Pounds 14m of debts, received ordinary shares. Midland will be issued with 16.25m new preference shares in exchange for releasing the company from its guarantees of Notiondial, a business park subsidiary which will be sold for a nominal sum. The banks also agreed to provide five-year term facilities of Pounds 22.4m, overdraft and engagement facilities of Pounds 7m and a standby facility of Pounds 1m. On November 30, the company had net debts including claims and bonds of Pounds 25m and net assets of Pounds 7m. Mr Richard Brooke, finance director of Trencherwood, said the company had prepared a five year business plan which had won the support of its banks. 'The banks have been very supportive towards the company.' he said. The refinancing arrangements depend on shareholders' approval, which will be sought at an extraordinary meeting. In the half year to April 1992, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.4m after exceptional items compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.3m the previous year. At that date, the group had a deficiency of net assets of Pounds 29m. Losses per share were 65.6p, compared with 9.3p the previous year.</p>

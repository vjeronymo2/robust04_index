			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions (Section 372.4) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the definitions of terms contained in CEQ's implementing regulations, which are incorporated by reference herein, this section would define four terms which are unique to these proposed regulations. As used in these procedures, the term ``APHIS'' means the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; ``Decisionmaker'' means the agency official responsible for executing findings of no significant impact in the environmental assessment process and the record of decision in the environmental impact statement process; ``Department'' means the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); and ``environmental unit'' means Environmental Analysis and Documentation, which is an analytical unit in Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, charged with the responsibility of coordinating APHIS compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Classification of Actions (Section 372.5) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed section, developed in four parts, complies with the directive in CEQ's implementing regulations that agencies classify actions for purposes of the NEPA process (40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2)). The CEQ regulation call for development of ``specific criteria for and identification of those typical classes of action'' that (1) normally require environmental impact statements, (2) normally require environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements, (3) normally require neither environmental impact statements nor environmental assessments and are therefore categorically excluded, and (4) normally are categorically excluded but, because of extraordinary circumstances, may have significant environmental effects and require preparation of environmental documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Actions Normally Requiring Environmental Impact Statements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An environmental impact statement (EIS) will normally be prepared for the following types of actions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Administrative procedures that seek to establish broad-scale, significant, impact-generating strategies, methods, or techniques (e.g., treatment options of individual large-scale aerial application of chemicals) as the means of dealing with pervasive animal and plant health issues within the purview of APHIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This category of action might include (1) contingency or ``emergency'' response strategies (comprehensive in scope)_the design of which is intended to provide solutions, generally on very short notice (thereby severely limiting subsequent consideration of alternatives by planners and decisionmakers)_to widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases or similar exigencies; and (2) strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future application in the context of extensive APHIS programs a preferred course of action having the potential for significant environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;General administrative (programmatic) examination of APHIS strategies and options for dealing with issues that have important implications for the maintenance and enhancement of environmental quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programmatic environmental impact statements are useful not only when dealing with exigencies of substantial proportion, but also for any substantive APHIS program as a means of effectively and efficiently integrating environmental considerations, process, and values into program planning and service delivery efforts. The type of action for which a programmatic EIS might be appropriate could include an administrative proceeding undertaken to rationalize, prioritize, and streamline_particularly from the standpoint of competing policies (e.g., environmental policies and economic development)_essential activities related to program mission and functions. Consider, for example, the scoping notice for the Veterinary Services programmatic document that was published by APHIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 9, 1992 (57 FR 46533&hyph;46534). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Actions Normally Requiring Environmental Assessments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preparation of program EIS's_whether or not exigent circumstances may be involved_does not relieve APHIS from taking a ``hard look'' at refinements to, or site-specific implementation of, program alternatives that have not been ``categorically excluded.'' The following classes of action, which normally do not have the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human environment, will be evaluated for NEPA purposes in the context of environmental assessments (EA's), some of which may be tiered to broader programmatic EIS's: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Policymaking and rulemaking proposals that involve program plans, techniques, methods, or other activities likely to have a consequential effect on the physical or natural environment or that may affect opportunities for the public, nongovernmental organizations, and others to influence environmental planning and decisionmaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Development of program plans or similar nonexperimental approaches that seek to establish in more limited contexts impact-generating strategies, methods, or techniques as the means of dealing with animal and plant health issues within the purview of APHIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Included in this class would be ``action plans'' designed to address proposals to remedy specific problems, including plant pest infestations, animal diseases, depredating animals, and the like. Other planning activities for which EA's normally will be prepared include substantial APHIS involvement in the efforts of USDA's Forest Service, the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management, States, and Indian Tribes to eradicate or control plant pests, animal diseases, or depredating or nuisance species in various districts or regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Site-specific implementation of action plans and approaches mentioned in the previous paragraph of this section, except where isolated activities, introductions, or applications, as developed more fully in the following subsection entitled ``Categorically Excluded Actions,'' are contemplated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are some categories of APHIS action that, while susceptible to consideration in broad programmatic impact statements undertaken pursuant to NEPA, are usually identified with more resource-specific environmental mandates and may be the subject of periodic planning and review requirements. In the process of satisfying those requirements, all operational aspects of APHIS facilities, including storage and disposal of pesticides, chemicals, and laboratory wastes, will normally be thoroughly examined. But compliance with such planning and review requirements does not satisfy NEPA, which is applicable to ``adoption of formal plans *&blank;*&blank;*'' (40 CFR 1508.18(b)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following classes of action may be examined in the context of specific environmental mandates other than NEPA, but will nevertheless be analyzed within an EA in order to facilitate the NEPA decision: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Planning, design, and construction or acquisition of major new facilities or proposals to modify substantially existing facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disposition of laboratory waste and other hazardous or toxic materials, except as provided under subsection 3 of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

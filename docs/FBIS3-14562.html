			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "Al-Hariri: State Not </F> Applying Double Standards"]    [Excerpts] Paris -- [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri has reiterated his accusation of Israeli involvement  in inciting elements from the Lebanese Forces to blow up the  Sayyidat al-Najah Church. However, he said that the Forces  cannot be accused as a party until the outcome of the  investigations is known. The disbandment of the Forces party  was the result of an "administrative-political decision." He  stressed that the authorities are not applying double standards  when dealing with the parties and that the Lebanese resistance  is to continue.    Al-Hariri was speaking to a number of Lebanese journalists  in  Paris following his meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe. [passage omitted]    Al-Hariri said that "all the measures we are taking are  aimed  at strengthening the situation. Lebanon is targeted. It is no  secret.... Lebanon represents a challenge to Israel after peace  [is achieved], because the stage ahead will witness an economic  challenge."    Asked about the Lebanese Forces' responsibility for the  church blast, he said: "We are not accusing the Forces, but,  rather, elements [from them]. As for the party's disbandment,  it was the result of an administrative-political decision based  on a number of pieces of information available to the judiciary  and security services. The issue was raised with the Council of  Ministers and a decision was taken." [passage omitted]    Asked whether the decision to disband the Forces is a  prelude  to hitting Hizballah, he said: "Until an agreement is reached  with Israel on its withdrawal from Lebanon, the resistance issue  remains a red line which cannot be touched. We, the country,  and the government have paid heavy prices for the sake of  safeguarding the Lebanese' right to resist, and we will not stop  it. This is settled. As for actions outside the resistance,  they are unacceptable and will not be overlooked. Their  perpetrators will be judged like anyone else. The resistance is  limited to a certain area. Any actions outside this area will  certainly not be overlooked."    Asked about Christians' fears that the resistance might  contribute to reinforcing sectarian sentiments, he said: "If  Samir Ja'ja' comes and decides to resist Israel and the state  treats him differently from Hizballah, then the talk (about  fears) is true." He pointed out that he has not made any  contacts with Ja'ja' since the Lebanese Forces' arrest and the  party's disbandment. [passage omitted]</p>

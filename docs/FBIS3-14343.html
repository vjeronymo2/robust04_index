			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jean-Luc Renaudie] </F>   [Text] Jericho, Occupied West Bank, March 25 (AFP) --  Palestinian officials Friday [25 March] denied Israeli reports  that autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo Tuesday,  insisting that full agreement must first be reached on  protection for Palestinians in the massacre town of Hebron.    Sa'ib 'Urayqat, a senior peace negotiator, said the two  sides  must press on with talks held this week in Tunis and Cairo, "to  agree on measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, faced with  settler violence."    "No date has been set for resuming the negotiations on  (Palestinian) self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho" in the  West Bank, 'Urayqat told AFP here.    Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told  AFP that the autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo  Tuesday, one month after the PLO suspended the talks over the  massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in a  Hebron mosque.    Israeli state radio said both sides had agreed that "several  dozen" Palestinian police would be deployed in Hebron at the  beginning of April, notably outside municipal buildings and the  university.    The Palestinian police would also patrol jointly with  Israeli  soldiers, under overall army command, the radio said.    'Urayqat said the Israeli government was presenting the  security issue the wrong way.    "It is not a question of knowing whether Palestinian police  or foreign observers should be deployed in Hebron, but of first  carrying out an evacuation of settlers from Hebron."    He said that if the 450 Jewish settlers remained in the  town,  the presence of Palestinian police or foreign observers "will  change nothing and the population will continue to live under  the threat of a new massacre."    After the February 25 massacre the PLO called for an armed  international protection force to be deployed in the  territories, the disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of  certain flashpoint settlements.    In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two  sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of  international observers and a Palestinian police force for  Hebron.    But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume,  saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the  Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for  the Palestinians of the West Bank town.    "There are certain points to clear up," Sha'th cautioned.    Israeli negotiators agreed on Thursday after two days of  talks to the deployment of armed Norwegian observers in Hebron.    Marwan Kanafani, a close aide to PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat,  said in Tunis that the PLO was keeping in contact with all  parties involved, including the United States, Russia and  Norway, to obtain answers to the PLO's demands following the  massacre.    Norway brokered the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord signed in  Washington last September, according to which Israeli troops  were due to start pulling out of the occupied Gaza Strip and  Jericho on December 13.    Implementation of the deal has been set back by the Hebron  massacre and disagreements over security issues.    The occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank were paralysed by a  general strike Friday to mark the first month since the massacre.    Meanwhile, a Palestinian truck driver from Hebron died after  being shot by a Jewish settler near Beit Jibrin in southern  Israel, police announced.    The 42-year-old gunman fired shots from a car at the truck  and then fled the scene, but he was later arrested by police in  the southern Israeli town of Kyriat Gat.</p>

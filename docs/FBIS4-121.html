			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lebowa Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike in </F> Pietersburg and TEC Task Group Member Philip Dexter and Regional  and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie in the Johannesburg  studio with announcer Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program  -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mashokwe] The TEC's  [Transitional Executive Council] task group comprising Mr.  Philip Dexter and Minister Sam de Beer were assigned to look  into the alleged corruption in Lebowa. I was supposed to be  joined by Mr. Sam de Beer, who I'm told is locked in meetings,  but I have with me here Philip Dexter. Good evening and welcome  to you, Sir.    [Dexter] Good evening, Leslie.    [Mashokwe] The task group of the TEC, what did it find in  Lebowa?    [Dexter] Well I think the most striking feature of what we  saw in Lebowa was that there was a complete and total collapse  of all services. And I think that the extent to which that has  happened has now become a crisis.    [Mashokwe] Is that despite the fact that Fourie's men are in  the area, trained to sort out the mess?    [Dexter] Well I think one of the things that we certainly  uncovered was that despite the intervention of the minister's  department, none of the problems have actually been able to be  solved. Now I'm not trying to imply that that's the minister's  fault, all I'm saying is that the intervention doesn't seem to  have achieved any of the objectives that we would have thought  it was supposed to.    [Mashokwe] I want an objective view here: What did you find  out about the views of the people there with regard to  Ramodike's governance?    [Dexter] Well we consulted, firstly, with the striking  workers, who were the only people there when we arrived, myself  and Minister de Beer. After that, we went back to Johannesburg  and arranged a meeting with the heads of departments and came  back to Lebowa to meet them. Thereafter, we spoke to the  cabinet and to the chief minister himself, and I think what we  discovered in talking to all these various groups was that it  was clear that none of them were going to be able to solve the  problem. I don't think the workers who are on strike have the  ability to solve the problem. The heads of departments clearly  can't, and it seems to me that the cabinet has also been  rendered ineffective by the situation that is currently  prevailing.    [Mashokwe] I want you to tell me what exactly the problem is  in the area?    [Dexter] Well, if I were to be honest I would have to say  that it's difficult to actually find out what is the problem,  because there are so many claims by different parties, people  accusing one another of various things. And I think, in all  fairness, what has happened is that you have a situation that is  now simply a huge political dispute, and it's quite clear that,  as I said before, none of the parties involved in the dispute  would be able to solve it.    [Mashokwe] Having listened to the debate that preceded this  discussion that we're having now, Mr. Ramodike conceded that he  gets paid for not working, or he gets paid for working in exile  -- if you didn't find him in his offices?    [Dexter] Well, we did actually find the minister, the chief  minister, in his offices, but I think the point is that nobody  is able to do any work because everybody is on strike. But I  think that's not really the issue. The issue is that we can all  dance around technicalities, but what we need is a solution to  the problem because there are patients in the hospitals who are  not being cared for, there are government vehicles which have  been liberated by people, and in one case...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Liberated?    [Dexter] Well we saw -- in one case, we witnessed children  driving a government vehicle.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, let me come back to you. You said  to me you're still the chief minister of that area -- children  driving cars, government has collapsed, you called to the TEC to  come and take over financial control. Why did you not resign if  you thought that the government was not worth being there?    [Ramodike] Well, if I had to comment Leslie -- you are aware  of the fact the political authority, power and functions, were  removed from my administration since September last year.    [Mashokwe] You're shaking your head.    [Fourie] Well its simply not true. I mean, the chief  minister admitted that he is the chief minister. He's got a  government. He's being paid for the job. He is the government.  All I did was -- we took over the control of the finances. We  took the checkbook and the order book in simple terms, and we  are checking that whatever decisions are being taken, that it is  properly tended for -- if there is services required that there  is money budgeted for in terms of any decisions being taken, and  then we ensure that the right payments are made. Just a last  remark ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you are saying he  is not -- he was spending money without proper budgeting.    [Fourie] Just a last remark. To resolve this problem of the  police -- he took this absolutely incredible decision to take 2  million rand from Legislative Assembly pension fund to transfer  it to the Police Benefit Fund and to give every policeman a  check. Now that is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Who is going to  repay the pension money?    [Ramodike] To come in Leslie, that is irreconcilable of the  minister. You will recall that, a few months ago, he said that  funds accruing from own resources of the self-governing  territory, like the 3 million rand that was used to purchase a  jet in kwaZulu, these he said he doesn't have control -- a say  over this, but when it comes to Lebowa, because we are his  political opponents and they came down here for a political ploy  and political posturing, then he would like to control  everything. The decisions he is referring to -- there is no  decision that we can take and it doesn't interfere with our  decisions. For an example, the items of expenditure -- very  important, essential services that are to be rendered to our  people, he stopped everything and that is not only a question of  financial control. If he goes out there to stop the project  like the erection of (Mankueng) Nursing College, like the  tarring of roads, like stopping the old age pensions because all  our old age pensioners, as I'm speaking now, have not as yet  received their pensions. Now is that my fault? How can you  give a man administrative accountability and remove political  accountability, political authority, political power, and  political functions.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, I am running out of time. Why did  you remove 2 million rands from the Legislative Assembly's  pension fund to the police.    [Ramodike] Those monies and three other accounts are  directly  under our control in spite of the fact that the minister took  over the financial control. He doesn't have a right to tamper  with money accruing from our resources.    [Fourie] Just two remarks. He just now accused us of a  blatant lie. I want to say that it is a blatant lie if anybody  says we stopped the pension monies. I want to say  categorically, especially to the pensioners in Lebowa, the money  is lying in the bank. The reason why the pensioners are not  getting their money is because the civil servants do not pay it  out to them. The last remark I want to make is, just for an  example, if President de Klerk would take 2 million rand from  the parliamentary pension fund and hand it out to the police in  South Africa, do you not think that would be a banana republic  decision.    [Mashokwe] Ramodike?    [Ramodike] Well, I think that could be said by an  inexperienced minister. It does happen that if you have got a  crisis in one department, then you could always shift funds from  one department to the other department and when the next year's  financial year comes, then that other department would make  provision on its budget to refund the amount taken from other  departments. It happens. On several occasions, since the days  of the late Dr. (Pathudi), and the minister then accepted that  bona fides and we resolved such problems amicably. What is the  point of keeping money in the bank when people are dying out  there in the hospitals when there is a lot of looting, when our  poor old mothers are suffering, and you just say I cannot  rearrange my plans, and I don't see any wisdom in such type of  leadership.    [Mashokwe] OK, I want Mr. Dexter to come in to this  discussion.    [Dexter] You want me to comment? Well, obviously I think  that this is precisely the problem that we have. It seems that  there's no way the parties involved will be able to resolve the  problems. That's why the TEC council met today and has actually  taken a resolution on this matter and we believe that that will  actually assist in solving the problem.    [Mashokwe] We will talk to you about that, but I want Mr.  Ramodike to explain one thing to me very quickly: Why don't you  resign if you think that the TEC must take over the governance  of your area?    [Ramodike] Yes, that's very simple. In fact I think first  and foremost you should know that the Legislative Assembly is  placed...[pauses] the cabinet, I mean, is placed in power by the  Legislative Assembly, and in order for the cabinet to be  dissolved then the state president should be requested by either  my cabinet or the whole Legislative Assembly to dissolve it. We  have long requested, after we got fed up -- with all humility --  with the takeover by Minister Fourie. We made a submission  requesting the state president that he should dissolve the  Lebowa Legislative Assembly....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why don't you resign? Why don't you  resign? Oupa Gqozo did it without a Legislative Assembly.    [Ramodike] I'm not going to resign, Leslie, because I'm  aware  that once I resign now together with my cabinet and the other  members of Legislative Assembly remain in place, then Minister  Fourie may convene a special session of the Legislative Assembly  and place his own puppets or surrogates in our position.    [Fourie] May I reply to that please?    [Mashokwe] Minister, why don't you let Ramodike...    [Fourie, interrupting] I want to be given...    [Mashokwe, continuing] Wait a minute. Let me ask a question.  Why don't you let Ramodike run his cabinet? Why do you meddle  in his affairs? Is it political mileage that you are trying to  make for the National Party?    [Fourie] I've got to meddle in his affairs because they  made a total mess of the financial administration. They haven't  got money left. I want to give a guarantee tonight to Mr.  Ramodike. I will not use the act to appoint anybody else into  the position if he resigns. I will support him if he resigns,  and we ask the TEC to appoint co-administrators to administer  that territory from now until the election. I give him that  guarantee then he must just resign so then we can get order back  into that place.    [Ramodike] Well my response to that, Mr. Minister, is that  you have been a stumbling block towards my way of resignation  all the time. Set an example because you are the first  stumbling block in terms of this monster called apartheid, then  once you resign, let me give also a guarantee -- resign tomorrow  and I will follow suit.    [Fourie] I must resign for what? I challenge Mr. Ramodike to  appoint any commission, to appoint the TEC -- I am prepared to  appear before the TEC on every single decision and  administration that we have taken, and if anybody can fault me I  will resign.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Fourie, I made mention earlier on of the fact  that you are making political mileage out of this -- it's almost  like saying the Nats [National Party members] are the good boys.  They are coming to sort out the mess. Would you care to comment  on that?    [Fourie] You see Leslie we happen to be the government in  South Africa, and there is an act in terms of which the  self-governing territories are operated, and the act says quite  deliberately: If in the opinion of the state president, any  decisions are taken in a self-governing territory that places an  unfair burden on the taxpayer of South Africa, or there is not  proper administration, we've got the right to go in there and to  rectify things. So if I wanted to act why didn't I act against  Samuel Khumalo of Gazankulu, or Mr. Zitha in Kangwane, or Mr.  James Mahlangu from Kwandebele. They...[pauses] at least I've  got a good relationship with them, but when we tried to help Mr.  Ramodike ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] So you don't have a good  relationship with Mr. Ramodike?    [Fourie] No, no. When we tried to help him he didn't want to  give his cooperation.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, you are laughing there.    [Ramodike] Yes, well if the reason for taking over the  administration really is because he doesn't have good  relationships with him [as heard], I wanted to remind Mr.  Minister, with all humility, that it is common cause that  politicians should at times cross political swords, and for that  matter we should not make enemies.    [Mashokwe] Tell me, are you being singled out because of  your  connections with the ANC, do you think?    [Ramodike] Repeat that.    [Mashokwe] Do you think the government is singling you out  because of your connections with the ANC?    [Ramodike] Yes, well I've got evidence. For an example,  Minister Fourie held secret meetings in (Leisdorp), Harmony  Plot, (Mokhetse), (Leisitele), where he attacked on me and the  African National Congress.    [Mashokwe] What's wrong with that. He's a politician. You  are a politician.    [Ramodike] I'm a politician, and I could not begrudge him  for  that. I mean, the people -- confidentially, from (Sikororo)  area, (Mujaje) -- into the bushes, because they were afraid to  face us as ANC -- in the (Sikororo) area, (Mujaje), and up to  now I mean, we are still making a call ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] OK, let him respond to that  quickly.  I want to bring in Philip Dexter here. Let him come in.  Respond quickly to that.    [Fourie] Can I just make a remark in lighter vain. Mr.  Ramodike at one stage challenged me to oppose him as the  governor of the north. I am now the number one on the National  Party list, and he is somewhere number 78 on the ANC list. I am  not worried about him. I am campaigning in the northern  Transvaal yes, and I am holding meetings all over, right through  Lebowa, and not Mr. Ramodike or anybody will stop me from that.    [Mashokwe] The political section of this debate is over.  Let's go over to the TEC. The people out there are in need of  services. Are you going to step in?    [Dexter] Well, absolutely. The decision of the TEC today was  that it's become -- well, due to the crisis -- it's become clear  that something would have to be done and the TEC has decided  that the management committee should take immediate steps to  ensure that there is an effective administration in Lebowa.    [Mashokwe] What does that mean?    [Dexter] Well, I think that that gives the management  committee the right to look into the matter and make a decision  as to what part they would follow. That could include the  appointment of administrators.    [Mashokwe] What are you saying to us? Are you going to  appoint administrators?    [Dexter] Well, as I said, it's the management committee of  the TEC that will take that decision, but clearly they have been  empowered to do so by the council itself. But could I just add  another point? I think that part of the problem that we've  identified is that there are all these deep-seated grievances in  the region, you know. And I would submit that one of the things  that I've certainly learnt myself from watching this dispute is  that it's very difficult to understand how people could allow a  crisis like this to continue and not actually do something  constructive about it. And I think that in that respect, you  know, that I think we'll have to all accept some kind of  accountability for that situation.    [Mashokwe] OK, your reaction to the TEC's position.    [Fourie] I would gladly support the TEC, but 100 percent. I  must tell you Leslie....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Will you move out?    [Fourie] No, what do I move out? I say that if they appoint  administrators, somebody must do the financial administration.  I don't think the TEC has got the capabilities to do that.  They haven't got the staff to do that. But if they appoint two  administrators and the civil servants go back to work and I'm  satisfied that the money will be in good hands, I will most  definitely move out.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Ramodike, your reaction.    [Ramodike] Well, first and foremost, it would be (?wrong)  for  the minister to prescribe to the TEC. I've got full confidence  in the TEC and it has got experts in the Subcouncil on Finance  and as a matter of fact I have already made a request, that the  TEC Subcouncil on Finance should take over the financial  administration in Lebowa, and hamba kahle [goodbye] Mr. Fourie.  And I will further welcome that the administrators be appointed.    [Mashokwe] And you resign?    [Ramodike] They should be appointed by the management  committee....    [Fourie, interrupting] No, he must resign then.    [Ramodike] If I've got to resign, I am saying again, Mr.  Fourie you are equally...you have equally failed in  administering Lebowa. In fact, you have made things worse. I  think you should be bold, you should have audacity to quit your  cabinet, and then I will follow.    [Mashokwe] Thank you, Mr. Ramodike, Mr. Fourie, Mr. Dexter.  Thanks for talking to us.</p>

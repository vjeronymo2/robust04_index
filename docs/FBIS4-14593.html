			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Russia does not pose any potential threat to Poland.  On the contrary, it would like "to give a hand of friendship  and cooperation to Warsaw," a high ranking Russian diplomat in  charge for relations with Poland declared in his interview with  Interfax.    He expressed regret due to the fact that over the last  period  of time the Polish press "depicts modern Russia and its future  in rather dark shades." "This places its own imprint on the  perception of our country on the part of rank-and-file Poles and  of many political functionaries. There is practically no  reliable information from Russian in Poland," said the diplomat.    In his words, there "are several actual but not imaginary  problems in the Russian-Polish relations." We must bring order  into the system of mutual accounts between two countries, to  solve the problem of debts, and to coordinate everything what  concerns the joint project providing for the construction of  Russian gas pipelines on Poland's territory. This would help to  increase Russian natural gas shipments both to Poland and to the  Western European countries," said the diplomat.    In his opinion, "the visit of a parliamentary delegation  headed by Marshall (the lower chamber speaker -- Interfax) of  the Polish Seimas Yosef Oleksa to Moscow will greatly promote to  "the warming of Russian-Polish relations."    On Wednesday Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  received the Polish parliamentarians at their request. On  Thursday they are to hold "intensive contacts" in the State  Duma's committees and commissions. They are supposed to meet  with the speakers of the Federal Assembly's chambers, Ivan  Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko.    It is not ruled out that on Friday Russian President Boris  Yeltsin will receive the Polish delegation.</p>

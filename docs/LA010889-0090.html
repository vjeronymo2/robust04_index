			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Police arrested anti-abortion activists in Worcester, Mass., and Wichita, Kan.  In Worcester, 92 abortion protesters who blocked doorways and jammed elevators  at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts clinic were charged with  trespassing and released on their own recognizance, officials said. Another 50  to 75 protesters, also members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue,  picketed peacefully outside the building, police said. The clinic opened three  hours late, and all but one of 15 patients who had abortion appointments in the  morning went ahead with the procedure, rather than reschedule, clinic officials  said in Wichita, 55 adults and three juveniles were charged with loitering by  blocking the entrance to the Womens Health Care Services clinic and refusing to  let a doctor drive through the gate, police said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Randy Keser was growing weary of all the media attention that resulted from  Only in L.A.'s mention of the "Wife Wanted" sign on his car. He yearns to be a  spouse, not a sound bite.  </P> <P> Then he was phoned by a talk-show host in Roanoke, Va. "After we went off the  air, she said she was interested in me herself," said Keser, a 40-year-old  aspiring actor. "We're going to talk some more."  </P> <P> The national attention that he's received has inspired him to acquire an agent  and write a screenplay, "The Man With the Sign." Keser feels that when he does  find Ms. Right, the nuptials could be a media event.  </P> <P> "I'm wondering if I could get someone like Budweiser to sponsor the wedding,"  he said.  </P> <P> Spuds McKenzie could be best man.  </P> <P> What was KNBC's lead story on its 11 p.m. newscast following NBC's "The Big One  -- the Great L.A. Earthquake"? Why, viewer reaction to the movie, of course.  </P> <P> The report was supplemented by the authoritative-sounding narration, which  began off-camera, of a woman who confirmed how very realistic the movie was.  </P> <P> Was the speaker a seismologist? No, it was Joanna Kerns, the actress who  portrayed the seismologist.  </P> <P> Scientifidrama.  </P> <P> No way that Only in L.A. would have been so provincial as to watch the movie  itself -- not when the stakes were so much higher on Channel 5's "Masters of  the Universe" ("a mighty struggle to save the galaxy!"). We did listen to the  Channel 5 news afterward, wondering whether there might be a segment on viewers  worried about planets going to war.  </P> <P> L.A. magazine named "Ballerina Clown," the bearded funny guy in the tutu above  the entrance of a Venice restaurant, as L.A.'s "Worst Public Sculpture."  </P> <P> More from L.A.'s melting (if not, bubbling) pot:  </P> <P> Santa Monica College's Chili Cookoff was won by the Korean Students Club.  </P> <P> No word on whether they'll try to market their Tex-Korean.  </P> <P> Auto accessories you don't expect to see:  </P> <P> Spotted waiting impatiently at a red light in Glendale, a flashy red Porsche  Targa -- with a Domino's Pizza sign on top.  </P> <P> "Look up at the sky Wednesday Nov. 14 between 12-1:30 p.m.," says the cryptic  ad in the Hollywood Reporter.  </P> <P> It's not a publicity stunt, for a change, but a tribute. Anne Davison hired a  plane to fly over Hollywood, carrying a banner that said, "I Love You Wild Bill  Davison," this afternoon, on the first anniversary of the great clarinetist's  death.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle was back in high school recently -- Beverly Hills  High, where he took a couple of early morning jogs during a stopover in Century  City. We learned this from the saucy new column of Carly Eiseman and Alex  Karasik in the school newspaper.  </P> <P> The feature's called "Only in Beverly Hills." Stay on your side of the border,  kids.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City) is one of two congressmen who have ship  channels named after them. The Anderson Channel serves the port of L.A. The  other one is down in Texas somewhere, outside our jurisdiction.  </P></p>

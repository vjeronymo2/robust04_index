In a few weeks, U.S. federal agencies including the Commerce  Department will complete the drafting of U.S. trade and  investment regulations in Vietnam. Related tax codes are  expected to come out too.    Among the existing U.S. laws banning U.S. trade with Vietnam  are the 1993 Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill and amendment laws  to the U.S. Export-Import Bank.    Officials from Treasury and State Departments will head for  Vietnam for talks on U.S. Government and private property claims  stemming from the war, estimated at between 140 and 200 million  U.S. dollars.    Washington said its share of Vietnamese market will worth  six  billion U.S. dollars a year. Before 1996, trade in aviation,  telecommunications, heavy equipment and construction will be  four billion dollars.    According to the 110-member U.S.-ASEAN council, the lifting  of embargo will generate more than eight billion dollars in new  export opportunities for U.S. firms in five years.    Since 1975, the embargo has costed U.S. firms 1.5 billion  dollars in annual sales, according to the papers released by the  council on competitiveness.    Observers here said U.S. investment chances in Vietnam are  mainly in power generation, medical equipment, transportation  equipment, construction, engineering, telephones and commercial  aircraft.    Vietnam also represents a vast market for U.S. information  technology, banking services, oil and gas exploration  technologies, accounting and legal services.    On the other hand, the lifting of trade embargo will boost  Vietnam's exports of garments, textiles, shoes, toys and others  to the U.S..    The JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, a major trade newspaper, reported  today that as many as 300 U.S. companies stand ready to trade  with Vietnam, like Boeing, Digital Equipment and Motorola.    Already, three dozen U.S. firms have set up representative  offices in Hanoi since U.S. dropped its opposition to loans to  Vietnam by international financial institutions last July.    Among the U.S. companies catching up quickly in trade with  Vietnam are Pepsi-Cola International, Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak  Co., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp. and Citibank.    American Express will sign an agreement with Vietnam's Bank  of Foreign Trade that permits the use of its credit cards in  Vietnam. United Airlines is seeking permission to start flights  between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KOHL TO VISIT MOSCOW, WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS GERMAN REUNIFICATION  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will travel to Moscow on Saturday and to  Washington later this month to confer on the prospects for German unification  in the face of the dramatic changes unfolding in Eastern Europe, officials in  both capitals announced today.  </P> <P> President Bush and Kohl will meet at Camp David, Md., White House aides  traveling with Bush in San Francisco said.  </P> <P> Bush is also conferring this weekend at Camp David with NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner, the aides said.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III is now in Moscow, reportedly carrying the  outline of an allied plan on German reunification.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced the surprise visit by  Kohl and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, while speaking to  reporters at the start of Shevardnadze's meeting with Baker in Moscow.  </P> <P> "This is a very important process," Shevardnadze said.  </P> <P> East German Premier Hans Modrow was recently in Moscow for talks that also  covered reunification.  </P> <P> One of the major stumbling blocks to union of the two Germanys is Western  insistence that Germany stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the  alliance forged after World War II to defend against attack from the Communist  East Bloc. The Soviet Union and its allied states formed the Warsaw Pact in  response, but now that military pact appears to be disintegrating.  </P></p>

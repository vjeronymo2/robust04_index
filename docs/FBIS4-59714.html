			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister said Pakistan will continue  supporting the Kashmiris until they realize their right to  self-determination. Speaking to newsmen in Islamabad yesterday  evening, Benazir Bhutto said the Kashmir dispute is a vital  element of Pakistan's foreign policy. She said Pakistan  strongly believes that the struggle of the Kashmiris is  legitimate and hence Pakistan should continue to support them  diplomatically and politically. The prime minister said the  basic objective of raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human  Rights Commission in Geneva was to highlight it at the  international level. She said its effects can be judged from  the fact that during the Commission's session, there was some  respite in Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir. India was  constrained to discourage its 600,000 soldiers from committing  human rights violations and to grant permission to the  international human rights organizations and diplomats of  Islamic Conference Organization.    Turning to the nuclear issue, Benazir Bhutto stated in  clearcut terms that Pakistan will not sacrifice its peaceful  nuclear program at any cost. She categorically stated that  Pakistan is pursuing this policy after thinking about it fully,  as it cannot sacrifice its knowledge and expertise in this vital  field. She said it was India who violated the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty by exploding a nuclear devise.    Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister  said  talks are being held in Washington on ways to strengthen the  friendly ties between the two countries. Describing the  Pressler Amendment as a hindrance to ties, she said her  government's policy is to see that Pakistan does not come under  any pressure due to this amendment. She said pressure should be  exerted on India, who has violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ruth de Aquino] </F>   [Text] London -- Great Britain and Brazil are studying a  bilateral agreement for the confiscation of goods, aimed at  punishing those involved in drug trafficking and financial  crimes. It will be an unprecedented treaty, the likes of which  Brazil has never before signed with any country. This is one of  the results of the hectic visit that British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd paid from 5 to 8 April to Sao Paulo, Rio de  Janeiro, and Brasilia. Preparations for the extradition treaty,  which was prompted by the busy presence of entrepreneur Paulo  Cesar Farias in London, are on their final stage. There are  only a few details to be adjusted over the next few days by  Brazilian Ambassador Rubens Barbosa and the British Foreign  Office.    According to Barbosa, Hurd, who visited Brazil accompanied  by  representatives of six British enterprises, was -- upon his  return -- enthusiastic about the prospects for cooperating with  the Brazilian privatization program. In Sao Paulo, Hurd had a  productive meeting with Sabesp [expansion unknown], which is a  state-run water supply enterprise that is being opened to  private capital. There was also a promise for possible British  contribution to the Tiete-Parana waterway.    During his stopover in Rio de Janeiro, Hurd heard a proposal  to create a Brazilian-British entrepreneurial council, following  the model of a council that the Brazilian Government has with  Germany. "We are at the final examination phase here with the  Department of Commerce and Industry. We also talked about the  transfer of technology from British to Brazilian enterprises,"  the ambassador explained.    In Brasilia, in addition to an unscheduled meeting at the UK  Embassy with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Hurd was surprised at  the Ministry of Mines and Energy when he learned that the  privatization program for the Brazilian electric power sector is  based on the British model that was implemented four years ago.  "The model is being examined for use in Brazil," the ambassador  said. He added: "The point is the transmission, how the private  sector will engage in power transmission. We agreed to send  more information from here for the final phase of the Brazilian  privatization program in the electric power sector."    Hurd's visit gave new momentum to some bilateral agreements.  The double taxation and investment protection agreements are  very close to being concluded and signed. Next week, from 20 to  22 April, a Brazilian delegation will come to London to talk  about the guarantees for pound sterling investments. "It is an  agreement that we are negotiating with six or seven countries,  like Chile, Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and France," Rubens  Barbosa explained. The agreement was prompted by the lack of  formal protection, which has prevented major investments. This  is what Brazil is trying to avoid.</p>

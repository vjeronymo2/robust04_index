			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 8 (MTI) -- The Miskolc County Hospital  received hundreds of telephone calls on Sunday [8 May],  inquiring after the condition of the chairman of the Hungarian  Socialist Party (HSP), Gyula Horn, who was injured in a car  accident. There were rumours that Horn's health had  deteriorated and he was in critical condition. To prevent other  rumours, the physician-director of the hospital, Zoltan Katona,  told MTI's correspondent in Miskolc that the HSP chairman  continues to be in good condition compared to the injuries  suffered.    In order to speed up his recovery, a minor operation was  carried out on Horn's right wrist on Sunday morning. This means  that the traditional cast used for broken bones was replaced  with a plate fixing procedure, so that the HSP chairman will be  able to use his hand much earlier.    Dr. Katona also said the party chairman will be allowed to  leave his bed on Monday, and is expected to leave the Miskolc  hospital in the second half of the week. Many patients in the  largest hospital of Miskolc County exercised their voting rights  through the mobile ballot boxes. According to MTI's  information, Gyula Horn declined to use this opportunity, as  that would mean he would have to vote in Miskolc in the second  round of the elections, but he does not wish to be a resident of  the hospital at that time.</p>

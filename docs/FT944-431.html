			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Sex trial reprieve for Clinton President Bill Clinton yesterday won partial relief from one of his non-political problems when an Arkansas federal judge ruled that the case alleging sexual harassment by him could not go to trial until he left office. However, Judge Susan Wright ordered that sworn statements and other activities related to the case go ahead in the meanwhile. She also found no constitutional justification for arguments by Mr Clinton's lawyers that a sitting president should be immune from lawsuits alleging wrongdoing before he took office. But she also noted that the damages suit - by Ms Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee - had only been brought two days before the statute of limitations expired and thus clearly had no urgency. Ms Jones is seeking Dollars 750,000 in damages over what she charges were unwanted sexual overtures from the then Arkansas governor in 1991.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (10): Latecomer to the party - John Ridding notes that trade with Asia has become important Free trade and France are not always mentioned in the same breath. But while successive French governments have often betrayed protectionist instincts, the corporate sector has been busily extending its tentacles into foreign markets. Last year, the growth in overseas trade and investment was slowed by the impact of recession, the financial burden facing French industry and the effects of currency depreciations in Italy, Spain and Britain. But the competitive edge of French industry in international markets remained sharp. Exports declined by just 5 per cent to FFr1,180bn, contributing (along with depressed imports) to a record trade surplus of FFr87.3bn. Such a performance will be hard to match, particularly as imports revive along with the French economy. But Insee, the national statistics office, claims a strong increase in foreign orders for French industrial goods in the first six months of 1994, and predicts another substantial surplus for the full year. The pattern of trade has remained relatively stable. Germany, France's principal economic partner, continues to account for about 17 per cent of total French exports. Italy, the UK, Belgium each account for between 9 per cent and 11 per cent of shipments from France. In search of more rapid growth, however, and in an attempt to increase an historic weakness, the French government and much of the corporate sector are setting their sights to the east. 'More than at any time in our history, Asia represents a vital part of our future,' says Mr Gerard Longuet, minister for trade and industry. Citing demographic projections, which suggest that by the year 2010 the Asia Pacific region will have a population more than 11 times greater than the 12 current members of the European Union, and pointing to the rapid economic growth rates of east Asian economies, the French industry ministry has launched a policy of encouraging trade and investment with the region. There is much work to do. 'The role of France in the Asia-Pacific region remains too small,' admits Mr Longuet. With the exception of Vietnam, a former French colony, exports from France account for between 1 per cent and 4 per cent of the total shipments to Asian economies - much less than the US and Japan, and, in most cases, behind Germany, Italy and the UK. The objective, says Mr Longuet, to be supported by increased trade credits, funding for commercial fairs and other measures, is to raise the proportion of French exports to Asian economies to 10 per cent within the next five years. In urging a greater emphasis on the Asian region, Mr Longuet is often preaching to the converted. Many French industrial groups are already targetting Asia for both increased trade and investment projects. The award of a Dollars 2.2bn high speed railway contract in South Korea to GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, Lafarge Coppee's joint venture project in China for the production of cement, and BSN's acquisition of a New Zealand food group, are just some of the most recent examples. Peugeot-Citroen, the vehicle group, was one of the earliest investors in the sector in China, while France's powerful utility groups, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux, have been busily responding to demand for infrastructural projects, from water treatment to highways. Mr Franck Riboud, director for corporate development at Danone, formerly BSN, expresses a common sentiment in describing the company's expansion plans for the region. 'There is much greater potential for growth in Asia than there is in Europe,' he says. 'In Indonesia, for example, there is a population of almost 200m people and a birth rate of about 4 per cent per year. That means an increase equivalent to the population of some European countries.' Financial companies are also at the forefront of the Asian assault. AXA, the insurance group, last month became the first French company to receive a green light to set up a life assurance business in Japan and promptly announced plans to invest Dollars 200m over the next seven years to develop its business there. The recently privatised Union des Assurances de Paris has also set its sights on the Japanese market. In most cases, however, the push towards Asia remains at an early stage. 'We are late-comers to the party and it is a long and difficult process to establish a presence in these markets,' says the finance director of one manufacturing company. 'It is not like doing deals in our traditional markets. Acquisitions are often impossible, and there are often restrictive regulations with which you have to contend.' For him, as for many industrialists, the largest industrial investments will continue to be made in Europe and the US. Elf Aquitaine's participation in the Leuna oil refinery in eastern Germany, the largest foreign investment in the region, is one example. Another is provided by its pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Sanofi, which last month bought the prescription drugs business of Kodak of the US. 'No one questions that Asia is an area of rapid trade and investment growth for French industry,' says one French merchant banker involved in mergers and acquisitions. 'But the growth will come from a very low base. In my view, the lion's share of corporate activity and of most trade will be done with traditional partners for the foreseeable future.'</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Billy Kranz: Moorpark  </P> <P> Soccer: Midfielder  </P> <P> Sophomore: 5-foot-7, 145  </P> <P> There is no shortage of players who excel on the undefeated Moorpark College  soccer team, but Coach Frank Parodi says that Billy Kranz stands out from the  rest.  </P> <P> "I feel he's really the spark plug and the mainstay," Parodi said.  </P> <P> "On the field, he's magic. He's not quick, but he's explosive."  </P> <P> The team's leading scorer, Kranz had a goal nine days ago in a 3-0 win over  Bakersfield, a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win Friday against Oxnard and two  assists Tuesday in a 9-2 trouncing of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Moorpark (10-0-0, 5-0-0 in Western State Conference play) has allowed only  seven goals all season, but the Raiders had to play about 20 minutes without a  banged-up Kranz in a match against Glendale.  </P> <P> "Then, when he went in, boom, things just changed," Parodi said.  </P></p>

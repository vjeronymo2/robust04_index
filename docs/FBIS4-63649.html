			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 May, Ukrainian Ambassador to Moldova Vitaliy  Boyko met Moldova's Deputy Foreign Minister (Osmochescu) and  handed him a letter from the Ukrainian foreign minister on  Ukraine's stance regarding the Crimean issue. The minister  pointed out that Moldova, which has suffered from the policy of  separatism, fully realizes the threat posed by the actions of  Crimean power structures; entirely supports the Ukrainian  leadership, denounces separatism, and supports Ukraine's  unconditional territorial integrity. Mr. (Osmochescu) assured  the ambassador that the Moldovan leadership would support  Ukraine's position with regard to denouncing separatism at all  levels, both within the CIS borders and in the international  arena.</p>

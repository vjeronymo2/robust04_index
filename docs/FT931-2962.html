			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Algerian ex-minister murdered A FORMER minister was shot dead as he left his home in suburban Algiers yesterday, AP reports. The official Algerian news agency APS said Mr Djilali Liabes, 45, was shot at his home in Ben Omar by three gunmen who fled. The gunmen shot him three times in the head, witnesses said. Ben Omar is in south-east Algiers near Kouba, a stronghold of Moslem militants, who have faced a tough government crackdown for more than a year. Mr Liabes left government last July to head the National Institute of Strategic Global Studies. He was numbered among intellectuals known to be sympathetic with the army-backed committee running the country and against the Islamic extremists. He was a former professor of sociology and had directed several political research studies before joining the government in June 1991. Mr Liabes was recently named head of the 'Group of Experts 2015', to draw up a study on Algeria's future. The murder was the second attack on a politically prominent intellectual in three days. On Sunday Mr Hafid Senhadri, chief of staff at the Ministry of Vocational Training, was seriously wounded by gunmen in a stairwell of the building where he lived. He remains in a coma.</p>

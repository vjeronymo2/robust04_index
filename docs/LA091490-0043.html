			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAR-POOL GROUP REACHES OUT TO ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> A first-of-its-kind campaign is being mounted to increase ride-sharing by  commuters from the housing-rich but job-poor Antelope and Santa Clarita  valleys.  </P> <P> Commuter Computer, a nonprofit agency that is Los Angeles County's major  ride-sharing proponent, said Thursday that it will open a branch office in the  area, post signs along the Antelope Valley Freeway and urge residents and local  employers to cooperate. The campaign will include a new telephone number for  Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley residents to obtain ride-sharing information,  (805) 255-RIDE.  </P> <P> "We felt that the north Los Angeles County area is unique in the county. You've  got a very large residential population, many of whom have very long commutes  to work," said Carol Redfern, regional manager for the private agency that is  supported by state and county funds.  </P> <P> The purpose of the localized campaign is to encourage residents to use  van-pools, car-pools and express bus service.  </P> <P> For the first time, a Commuter Computer executive, Al Rangel, has been assigned  to work exclusively in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, Redfern said.  Rangel will work out of city offices in Palmdale, which will become Commuter  Computer's first satellite operation in the county.  </P> <P> This is the first time in Los Angeles County that Commuter Computer has mounted  such an effort with the financial backing of local cities, Redfern said.  </P> <P> The Palmdale City Council agreed Thursday night to provide office space and to  contribute $15,650 toward the program. Santa Clarita officials last month  agreed to provide the same amount, Redfern said. Similar funding requests will  soon be considered by Lancaster and county officials.  </P> <P> Redfern said Commuter Computer chose to focus on the Antelope and Santa Clarita  valleys because of their large commuter populations. Both have far more  residents than job opportunities, forcing an estimated 44% of their work force  to commute elsewhere.  </P> <P> Commuter Computer laid the groundwork for its Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley  campaign in May with a monthlong ride-sharing promotion that included newspaper  and radio ads, 10 billboards, and ride-sharing brochures mailed to 25,000 area  residents with follow-up phone calls made to about 11,000 residents.  </P></p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Life stirs again for the ghost of property past - London remains in the vanguard but there's plenty elsewhere for the multi-millionaire with liquidity THE PROPERTY market is returning from the dead and good houses are selling fast. Within a week of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (KFR) marketing Leckhampstead House - a handsome Georgian village property well-placed for the M4 near Newbury, Berkshire - with a guide price of Pounds 625,000, it had gone. Similarly, the buying service of Lane Fox snapped up Chisenbury Priory, a Georgian house near Pewsey, Wiltshire, at a price in line with the suggested Pounds 1.5m. Its client was the first person to view and bidding started at once. Last autumn, the market was a ghost. It took time to see that Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and its aftermath - a lower pound and lower interest rates - could be a blessing in disguise. The two groups to grasp the opportunities first were foreigners buying in London and British farmers, who have had a windfall gain in the green pounds they receive under the EC's Common Agricultural Policy. London is still in the vanguard and expensive houses like 5 Holland Park (KFR, guide price Pounds 6.75m) are selling, as are flats that buyers from Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysian acquire as investments. Aylesford reports that half the flats it has sold this year are in this category, many of them bought without viewing. And once the price for 11 Yeoman's Row in South Kensington had been reduced from its November 1992 figure of more than Pounds 700,000 to around Pounds 695,000, the house went in a few days - for Pounds 640,000. The best guide to how the market is turning is the Corporate Estate Agents index. Based on data from the agents owned by banks, building societies and insurance companies or quoted on the stock exchange, and equalling about half the UK agency market, it shows that net sales (excluding those that fell through) in April were up 26.3 per cent on April 1992, and contracts exchanged were up 8.3 per cent. Small (4-5 per cent) declines as against March reveal the impact on business of the Easter holidays. 'Is now the time to buy?' I asked Charles Ellingworth of Property Vision, an up-market buying agent in west London. 'I am not a seer,' he replied, 'but the market turned last autumn. There has been a 5 per cent bounce since then. How far it will go is unclear. My view is that it will move up at the rate of inflation, which is not much.' While this is hardly a bullish view, it is probably healthier for being realistic. A bearish outlook is out of the question. The main problem now is that too many buyers are chasing too few properties, a lament heard throughout the UK where agents are desperate for new instructions from vendors. 'It is a tricky market,' says Ellingworth. 'Discrimination is the name of the game.' In other words, the quality of the individual property matters far more in figuring the price than the pundits' generalisations. WHAT DOES the market have for the multi-millionaire with cash? Leading candidate as the most expensive house on sale is 9 Tregunter Road, SW10, at a guide price of Pounds 9m from De Groot Collis and Savills. The outside of this town house gives little clue to the riches inside. Property developer Northacre has rebuilt it with no expense spared, linking it by rooms running under the garden to 10 Cathcart Road to make an urban mansion with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. The Cathcart Road end functions as the spare rooms and staff quarters. The heart of the underground section is a 32ft swimming pool lined with columns. Next door is a billiards room. Columns and marble are equally important in Quinlan Terry's Gothick Villa in Regent's Park, which the Crown Estate is selling through Savills and Lassmans for Pounds 6.5m (Weekend FT, May 15/16). At a similar price - offers over Pounds 6.5m - is Halkin Gate House off Belgrave Square, where two town cottages have been transformed into another urban mansion with basement swimming pool. The rich need exercise. Agents De Groot Collis can arrange it. Is there a better address in London than 5 Belgrave Square? This house, built by Thomas Cubitt, used to be the home of Sir Henry Channon, a Chicagoan who married Lady Honor Guinness and was for a long time an MP for Southend. Known as 'Chips,' his published diaries are a splendid, gossipy guide to the years from 1934 to 1958 when he knew everybody. Aylesford asks Pounds 3.25m for a 40-year lease, to include a newly renovated mews house. IN THE country, the honours go to the Pickenham Hall estate in Norfolk between Norwich and Cambridge, a rare chance to buy a large Edwardian house with plenty of land (3,627 acres) including a shoot, farmhouses, cottages and almost all South Pickenham village. KFR offers it at the intriguing guide price of Pounds 6m-Pounds 10m, demanding all the estate agent's skills to achieve the right figure for the vendor. For Pounds 4.5m in adjacent Suffolk, and still unsold despite much publicity last year, is Heveningham Hall (Weekend FT, May 15/16). Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian, called it 'the grandest Georgian mansion' in the county. KFR and Savills are the agents. Another estate on the KFR books is Great Hundridge Manor in Buckinghamshire, a Grade II, late-17th century house with a 13th century chapel that is now the billiard room and a stud with 24 loose boxes. To breed your Derby winner here costs around Pounds 3.5m. With an offer over Pounds 3m, Strutt &amp; Parker will sell you Thorncombe Park estate, placed conveniently near Guildford in Surrey. The house, in which the vendors have lived for 56 years, started in the 18th century, and comes with the appropriate panoply of cottages, lakes, parkland and woods. In the same price range is Grove Farm, a large fruit farm at Harwell in south Oxfordshire offered by John D. Wood for Pounds 3.7m as a whole, or in lots. The sale includes 500 acres of orchards, cold storage for 2,200 tonnes, a farm shop, a pick-your-own business, cottages, managers' houses and an irrigation lake. Clive and Alison Hartwight - a local family - have built Grove into an impressive operation specialising in plums, cherries and apples. It has a turnover of Pounds 2.42m, 20 full-time staff and up to 120 part-time pickers. KFR is selling a Victorian Gothic extravaganza near Newbury called Stargroves - once owned by rock singer Mick Jagger - for around Pounds 2m. Its grey cement rendering and slate roof remind you of Scotland. For half the price, KFR also offers author Evelyn Waugh's old house, Piers Court at Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire. It was a wedding present from his (second) wife's grandmother in 1937; they moved later to Somerset. IN SWEDEN, Stikkan Anderson, former manager of the pop group Abba, is selling the Villa Ekarne on the island of Djurgarden, a Royal National Reserve Park owned by the King of Sweden near the middle of Stockholm. The house, from the early 1900s, is of wood on granite foundations and was designed by Ragnar Ostberg, of Stockholm town hall fame. Included in the sale is a painting of My Family by Carl Larsson which has hung at the end of the entrance hall and foot of the stairs since being commissioned by the first owner. The agents are Sotheby's with Wrede in Sweden, and the price for a leasehold (known as an arrende in Swedish) is around SKr20m (Dollars 2.72m). For the rich who hanker after owning a hotel in warmer climes, there is the Club Aldiana in Senegal, a Club Med type of operation with 600 beds in thatched bungalows, superb food and, of course, marvellous beaches. Hotel broker Michael Pegg is offering it for a much-reduced DM9m (Dollars 5.57m). Another paradise on Pegg's books is the Royal Sunset Island resort hotel in Tonga, with 26 four-bedded bungalows in eight acres of tropical gardens. At Dollars 1.6m, it would be easy for an hotelier to sell up in the UK and move to the life of the lotus eaters - or for a millionaire to buy the ultimate venue for house parties.

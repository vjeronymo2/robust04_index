			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  has completed recruiting a "board of executives" for a council  that will take charge of the economic aspects of Palestinian  self-rule in the occupied territories, PLO officials said Friday  [15 April].    Once formally installed in office, the "board of executives"  will meet one of the key demands of international donors and the  World Bank which have been pressing the PLO for "credible"  Palestinian institutions to channel aid to support the  Palestinian self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 accord  between Israel and the PLO.    The executives will take direct charge of the nitty-gritty  details of economy, such as customs and tariffs, taxation,  social security, currency and monetary affairs as well as other  aspects of financial administration of the occupied territories  under the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction (PECDAR).    In essence, PECDAR is expected to be the Palestinian  ministry  of finance in the occupied territories pending final-status  negotiations with Israel after the interim period as stipulated  in the September accord.    The PLO officials said a PECDAR committee selected the  executives, who will in effect be heads of departments, who had  responded to advertisements in Jordan, Tunisia and the occupied  territories.    Many of the interviews were conducted in Amman early this  month, they said.    "The names of the successful candidates have been forwarded  to the PLO leadership, and we are now awaiting approval from  Tunis," where the PLO is headquartered, said a senior PLO  official. But the official declined to characterise the  recruits.    But other PLO sources said most of those recommended by the  interview committee were of Palestinian origin who have had  extensive experience in financial administration in the Gulf  states and elsewhere.    "They more than meet the basic requirements and  qualifications that enable them to be the key figures in the  executive side of Palestinian nation-building," said one source.  "Many of them have done [work] in the Gulf states, contributing  to setting financial administrative structures there and made a  success of it."    The list of recruits has to be approved by PLO Chairman  Yasir  'Arafat, PLO officials said.    The World Bank, which is directly in charge of channelling  pledged international aid of up to $2.4 billion to help support  Palestinian self-rule has been insisting that expertise, rather  than political loyalties, guide the selection of key officials  in the autonomy structure.    Mr. 'Arafat chairs PECDAR. His immediate deputies are Faruq  Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department and the de facto  foreign minister of Palestine and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi,  head of the Economic Department of the PLO.    Ahmad Quray' a PLO economic strategist and one of the key  figures in the secret Oslo negotiations that led the autonomy  accord, and Sari Nusaybah, a university professor from the  occupied West Bank, are the senior-most executives of the  13-member council.    Several other members who are professional economists have  complained that 'Arafat loyalists rather than people with  expertise dominate the council. Some of the critics have  announced their suspension of membership in the council, but PLO  officials said they had not submitted formal resignations.    Among them are Dr. Yusuf Sayigh, a Beirut-based Palestinian  economist who led the Palestinian side to multilateral talks on  economic cooperation.    Samir 'Abdallah, a noted professor of economics from a West  Bank university and member of the multilateral group, has also  been critical of the way the PLO leadership was handling its  economic approach and the overall peace negotiations with Israel.    The council is expected to meet soon in Tunisia to discuss  practical measures to coordinate with the World Bank to channel  aid to the self-rule areas, the PLO officials said.    That meeting will be followed by the first meeting of the  "board of executives" of PECDAR. The board will work under the  direct supervision of PECDAR in implementing the decisions and  policies of the council," said the PLO official.    Jawad Naji, a member of the council and head of the PLO's  economic department in Amman, said in a recent interview that  the council estimates that it needs up to $400 million in the  first year.    The donors and the World Bank, in a meeting held in Paris in  January, decided to allocate up to $160 million to the council.    Dr. Naji noted that the allocation falls short of PLO  estimates, but said the organisation hoped to secure further  funds once self-rule is in place.    "We have to start from scratch in the occupied territories,"  Dr. Naji said, referring to the almost total absence of  self-supporting economic structure in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merged Krupp-Hoesch group suffers heavy loss KRUPP-HOESCH, the merged German steel and engineering group, continued its downward slide in the first six months of the year, recording a DM320m (Dollars 189.3m) loss. The company's poor results are mainly attributable to high operating losses and extraordinary expenditures in its steel divisions. These are the first consolidated figure for the new company created when Krupp and Hoesch, the second and third-largest steel producers in Germany, merged in the middle of last year. The merger was formally approved by the groups' shareholders in May. The loss in the six months compares with an aggregate loss for the two groups of DM250m for the whole of 1992, down DM682m from 1991 results. In the steel divisions alone, the two groups recorded an aggregate loss of DM450m in 1992. Orders for the first six months fell by 10 to 15 per cent. Beside the steel divisions, the mechanical engineering side was particularly affected, with orders falling by more than 25 per cent. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said the six months' losses came mainly from the steel divisions. Taken together, the company's other divisions had broken even. These included machinery, buildings, automotive parts and trading services. He said Krupp-Hoesch would continue to record heavy losses in the second half - although lighter than those of the first six months - as drastic restructuring measures took effect. An estimated 11,000 workers are expected to be made redundant this year, bringing total employment to 'under 80,000' from its current 91,411, Mr Cromme said. In 1992, the two groups together cut 6,000 jobs. Restructuring measures also include the closure of its Rheinhausen steel mill in the Ruhr Valley, where 2,200 are employed. The plant is due to close on August 15. Mr Cromme said such measures and economies of scale associated with the merger would save Krupp-Hoesch up to DM500m over the next few years. More than 70 per cent of the business areas of the two companies are related or comparable. In the steel divisions alone, the merger will save an estimated DM300m. Mr Gerhard Jooss, financial director, said the company's total debt could rise to 'over DM5bn' by the end of the year, from its current DM4.7bn. In 1992, aggregate sales for the two groups fell by around 9 per cent, from DM25.5bn to DM23.2bn. Steel products and trading services together accounted for 50 per cent of turnover. Spare parts for the automotive industry represented 25 per cent of total sales.</p>

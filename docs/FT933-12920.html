			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Meanwhile in Belgrade, only the mint works: Sanctions-wracked economy sees inflation nearing 700% a month THE SIGNS in Belgrade's supermarkets warn: 'Caution, prices are one thousand times higher than marked.' After more than two years of footing the bill for wars in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia and 13 months of United Nations sanctions, the Serbian economy has reached a new low. 'Even God almighty could not help turn the economy around,' says Mr Ljubomir Madjar, a Belgrade University economics professor. It will get worse. However, analysts are divided over whether the Serbian people are close to the point where they will turn against their government and demand an end to its support for what the rest of the world regards as Serb aggression in Bosnia. The dinar, the Yugoslav national currency, is collapsing by the hour. The 5m dinar note, the highest denomination, is worth about 50 German pfennings. New denominations of 10m and 50m dinars will be issued on Monday. The D-mark yesterday was valued at about 21m dinars for bank giro transactions. In a speech recently to government officials, Mr Vojislav Tomic, director of the state treasury, said: 'The country is in the most difficult situation in its history . . . the mint is working on three shifts printing bills non-stop, but there is still not enough cash.' Cashiers and accountants throw up their hands in despair, hard-pressed to keep track of the astronomical figures, often in the thousands of millions: Inflation in June was 366.7 per cent. Economists this month estimate that prices are rising at about 12 per cent a day, a monthly rate of 690 per cent. Industrial output fell by 41.9 per cent in the first five months of this year. This followed a 21.4 per cent drop in 1992. Gross national product per head has shrunk from Dollars 3,060 in 1989 to Dollars 350. Serbia currently allocates 20 per cent of its shrinking GNP in aid to Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, although economists believe the real figure is closer to 40 per cent. Some 60 to 70 per cent of Serbs live below the poverty level. A typical basket of consumer goods costs Dollars 60, but the average monthly salary is half that, says Mr Miroljub Labus, a Belgrade University economics professor and opposition deputy in the federal parliament. Electricity prices have been raised 512 per cent this month alone. More than half of Serbia's factories have temporarily closed; some economists say the rest may shut this autumn. The government of what remains of Yugoslavia this month minted an estimated 400,000bn dinars to purchase summer wheat. But farmers, most of whom immediately converted sackloads of dinars into hard currency on the black market, still lost on the transaction. Many have refused to sell their crops as a result and there will be shortages this winter. In Serbia's fertile northern province of Vojvodina, private bakers say they are going on 'holiday' rather than accept the miserable government price controls for bread. Government-imposed controls, rather than the sanctions, appear to have given rise to chronic shortages of flour, milk and cooking oil. As bad as it looks, however, Serbs tend to compare themselves with their neighbours who, in a state of war, are even worse off. 'The scenes on television of destruction and death acts as a warning not to react in protest against the situation,' Mr Tomislav Popovic, a Belgrade economist has said. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, blames the mess on the sanctions, channelling popular anger towards the west. In the state-controlled press, sanctions are mentioned only in concert with the word 'unjust'. Most Serbs see the sanctions, including an oil embargo, as incomprehensible. They believe Serbs are fighting a war of self-defence. For example, western newspapers yesterday reported how Serb forces had launched an offensive on Mount Igman near Sarajevo, while Serbian state-controlled newspapers reported that the Moslems were continuing their fierce offensive. Meanwhile, smuggling and speculation have to some extent made up for the emptying store shelves. Most city dwellers appear to survive by living off their country cousins. 'People at the market simply hang around waiting for their relatives to finish the work day. They know that their cousins, no matter how distant, will give them what's left,' says one pensioner. In the last few weeks, discontent has led to employees staging widespread industrial action, including rail workers from Montenegro, air traffic controllers from Belgrade and car workers from the giant Zastava car plant in Kragujevac and its small arms division. Mr Madjar says: 'The sanctions are like a time bomb. The reserves will run out. Then the factories will stop one by one. . . .'</p>

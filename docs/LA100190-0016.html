			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> THE MIRROR OF TELEVISION IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Until I read Allen's article, I was afraid I was in a class with only rednecks  and Bible thumpers, but I'm sure nobody would classify Steve with those yahoos.  </P> <P> I don't think that every dabbler with an unusual or esoteric creation is  necessarily an artist.  </P> <P> For instance, a few years ago, it was reported that the State Legislature had  funded a proposal of an "artist" to sail somewhere off the coast and serenade  the whales with a wind instrument. It would seem that the solons in Sacramento  did not do their homework on that one.  </P> <P> For did they consider the possibility that some whales are tone deaf, or have  no feeling for rhythm? Or suppose his audience consisted of killer whales, who,  because of their life style, surely have no taste for the aesthetic?  </P> <P> GERARD BOSS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japanese consumers are now looking for value - Emiko Terazono finds spending patterns changing MR Higuchi, president of Kawachiya, one of Japan's first liquor discount retailers, says his warehouse-like stores get so crowded at weekends that he has to close the shutters. Kawachiya's success is an example of the change in consumer attitudes as the downturn in the Japanese economy has hit the purses of ordinary Japanese. The burst of the asset bubble of the late 1980s and the spate of corporate restructurings have sobered consumers, who are going back to basics. Boxes of beers and bottles of whisky at a 30 per cent discount to the normal retail price have an obvious attraction. Department store sales have dropped sharply as consumers' spending has turned towards value-orientated products. Department store sales fell a record 8.9 per cent in June, slipping for the 16th consecutive month. On the other hand, sales and profits at discount retailers have surged. Kawachiya, which is unlisted, says its sales have grown by about 30 per cent for the past three years, and expects annual sales to double this year to Y15bn (Dollars 143m) due to the launch of new stores. Analysts predict that such changes in consumer spending patterns are here to stay. Mr Paul Heaton at Baring Securities in Tokyo says: 'Even if the economy recovers, consumers won't be going back to department stores.' Until the mid-1980s, cheap prices meant poor quality while buying expensive goods at department stores has been a guarantee for quality and service. Japanese consumers are given choice of buying quality goods at discount prices without the frills. Aoyama Trading, which offers office workers' uniform blue suits at one-third of the price of department stores, has seen profits surge, posting a 11.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y30.2bn for the year to last March on a 29.3 per cent increase in sales to Y150.9bn. For the year to next March, it predicts a 15.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and a 29.2 per cent sales increase. A recent survey by the Nikkei business daily indicated that 80 per cent of 115 consumers surveyed bought electric appliances at special-ty discount retailers and none went to department stores. The country's discount retailers have also received a boost from stricter enforcement of the anti-monopoly law by the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly watchdog. Japanese manufacturers have traditionally had a tight grip on retail prices, often threatening to stop shipments if the retailer failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set by the manufacturer. However, in 1990 the FTC set strict guidelines against price control and discount retailers have since acquired the mainstream image. 'I received death threats and was boycotted by distributors when I started discounting liquor,' recalls Mr Higuchi. Japanese beer companies announced that retailers were free to set their own prices in 1990. Earlier this year, sales subsidiaries of leading electronics companies, including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, were warned to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply contracts. Last year, last year took a pharmaceutical company, which cut shipments after Kawachiya started discounting its pep drink, to the FTC. Last week, he filed a complaint with the commission that Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company, had cancelled its contract after he had rejected Shiseido's pleas to stop discounting its luxury brands. The cosmetics maker says shipments to Kawachiya were cancelled because the retailer had been wholesaling Shiseido products. Mr Higuchi reckons there is further scope for discount retailers to grow as an increasing number of Japanese consumers become value orientated. But he adds consumers need to be given choice, and the country's distribution system has to adapt to changing values. 'Where else are consumers made to pay extra to support distributors and small retailers?' he asks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- YEAR-ON-YEAR RETAIL SALES GROWTH  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Discount &amp;                    Department              specialty                   store sales            store sales                           (%)                    (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987                      4.8                   12.3 1988                      6.9                   24.8 1989                      7.1                   21.8 1990                      7.7                   13.8 1991                      3.6                   28.6 1992                     -3.3                   17.2 1993                     -6.1                   17.2*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Discount store sales figures are a total of six listed discount and specialty stores *First six months only  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

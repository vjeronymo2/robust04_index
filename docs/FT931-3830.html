			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Top annuity rates THOSE WHO feel they need not worry about inflation now it has fallen to 1.7 per cent should take a look at the annuity table. All the annuities are 'compulsory purchase' - the kind bought with a pension fund on retirement. You can buy an annuity which grows by 3 per cent annually, or one which increases by the rise in the retail price index each year. Note that the amounts paid out initially for the 3 per cent annuity are much higher than for the RPI-linked annuity. That means actuaries expect average inflation to be considerably higher than 3 per cent over the lifetime of their annuitants. RNPF Nurses, which appears in several lists, offers annuities only to members of the medical professions. All figures were supplied by The Annuity Bureau, 11-12 Hanover Square, London, W1R 9HD, tel. 071-495 1495.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    COMPULSORY PURCHASE ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Index-linked compulsory purchase annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 65              Annuity     Female age 60             Annuity Sun Alliance       pounds8840.04     Equitable Life      pounds6404.00 Equitable Life     pounds8789.04     Sun Alliance        pounds6296.04 Abbey Life         pounds8308.08     Sun Life            pounds6083.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating by 3 per cent annually  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 65              Annuity     Female age 60             Annuity RNPF Nurses       pounds10419.00     RNPF Nurses         pounds7949.00 Equitable Life    pounds10274.04     Equitable Life      pounds7857.96 Canada Life       pounds10179.96     Canada Life         pounds7647.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory purchase level annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 65                  Annuity     Female 60                 Annuity Equitable Life    pounds12615.00     Equitable Life     pounds10205.04 RNPF Nurses       pounds12608.00     RNPF Nurses        pounds10202.00 Canada Life       pounds12370.92     Canada Life         pounds9961.20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint life annuity (male age 65/female age 60)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Escalating by 3%         Annuity     Remaining level           Annuity Equitable Life     pounds7347.96     Equitable Life      pounds9632.04 RNPF Nurses        pounds7333.00     RNPF Nurses         pounds9592.00 Canada Life        pounds7186.44     Canada Life         pounds9392.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are gross, monthly in advance, and without guarantee.

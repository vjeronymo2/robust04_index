			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOG SLOWS 9,400-ACRE BLAZE;  </P> <P> THREE-COUNTY FIRE 60% CONTAINED  </P> <P> A thick layer of fog rolled to the aid of firefighters Friday, helping them get  an upper hand on a blaze that has ravaged 9,400 acres of brushland in Orange,  San Diego and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> By nightfall, firefighters had contained 60% of the blaze. Full containment was  not expected until early Monday, a fire official said.  </P> <P> "It was real slow this morning," U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Delores  Fremter said of the fire. "The fog came in and it didn't do much. The wind  kicked in about noon and the fog lifted and it started to be more active."  </P> <P> Until Friday, the fire had burned largely unchecked. It was accidently started  Wednesday during a military exercise at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in San  Diego County. It raced through the remote canyons and hills of southern Orange  County before turning northeast and heading into Riverside County.  </P> <P> While belching smoke and ash that has dusted cars and homes in much of Orange  County, the fire had not destroyed any structures. The Riverside County town of  Rancho Carrillo was briefly threatened Thursday, but the fire stayed away and  more than 50 fire engines pulled out.  </P> <P> Bulldozers cut a mile-long, 35-foot-wide fire break around the village Friday,  which some residents said they had sought for years.  </P> <P> While the fog turned the flames to smoldering embers, it also grounded six air  tankers and four water-dropping helicopters until mid-morning. They were needed  to assist the more than 1,000 firefighters manning the lines.  </P> <P> Fremter said that despite quelling the fire on its southern and western flanks,  it was driving northeast into the inaccessible San Mateo Canyon Wilderness of  Cleveland National Forest. Late Friday it was headed toward the remote  Fisherman's Camp area.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PATRICK WINS NEW CAR WITH ACE AT VALENCIA  </P> <P> Tom Patrick of Granada Hills scored a hole-in-one Saturday on the 185-yard  seventh hole at Valencia Country Club in the club's third annual member-guest  tournament and drove away with a new imported sports car.  </P> <P> Patrick, 44, used a six-iron to notch his first ace in 20 years of golf. The  ball landed in the hole on the fly, clearing the all-water approach.  </P> <P> "I thought it flew the green," Patrick said. "And then we looked in the hole  and there it was."  </P></p>

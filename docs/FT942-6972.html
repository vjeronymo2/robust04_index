			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Putting their house in order: Plans to solve east German property disputes After three years of bitter wrangling and court actions, Germany's Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, has agreed measures to compensate former property owners in east Germany. Approval by the Bundesrat, the upper house, could pave the way for speedier investment in the east, which has been held up by unresolved questions over property rights. Under the terms of the unification treaty of 1990, those whose property was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by the communists between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to restitution or compensation. The law caused havoc. Many east Germans who thought they had legally acquired their homes after the establishment of the former German Democratic Republic in 1949 were faced with former owners returning and, in some cases, evicting them. Those claimants who did not want their property back could seek compensation. Yet for more than three years, the government has been unable to agree on the levels of payment. Under the new measures, individuals would be entitled to compensation based on the value of the property (including houses, shops, farmland) in 1935. The figure would be multiplied several times, depending on whether the property in question is simply land, or includes housing or a business. In addition, compensation would be issued in the form of government bonds, not redeemable until 2004. 'Dispossessed' property owners may complain that the level of payment neither reflects the current market value of the property, nor compensates for the amount of income lost over the past 55 years. But their complaints pale when compared with those of the ' '45-49ers'. The ' '45-49ers' comprise property owners whose land was expropriated by the Soviet authorities which, between 1945 and 1949, administered east Germany. Many belonged to the Prussian aristocracy and supported Hitler during the second world war. Others, however, joined the German resistance movement. As the Russians consolidated their grip on the east, many were either sent to prison camps, given two days to leave their homes, or banned from within 14 miles of their property. Most of the 14,000 families which were forced to flee settled in west Germany. Their land was divided and parcelled out to Germans escaping from Poland and other east European countries. In a reunited Germany several hundred families now want to come back. But under the terms of the unification treaty, they have neither the right to compensation nor restitution. The West German government, along with Mr Hans Modrow, east Germany's last Communist party leader, and Mr Lothar de Maiziere, its last prime minister, refused any right of return or compensation for those dispossessed between 1945 and 1949. They claimed in the Constitutional Court in April 1991 that the price of Soviet agreement to German unification was Bonn's unquestioning acceptance of Moscow's 1945-49 administration of east Germany, including its expropriation policy. This claim is challenged by former east German property owners. 'There is simply no evidence of these preconditions (to unification),' said Mr Albrecht Wendenberg, who is trying to regain his property in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. The land his family owned is being sold by the Treuhand privatisation agency. He is not alone in criticising the government's stance. There is growing opposition from former landowners in east Germany, many of whom support Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union. The proposed measures may go some way towards meeting their objectives because they may win the right to buy back a small percentage of their property. But they will only be allowed to buy back 12 acres out of every 40, for example, or 60 acres out of every 500. As the acreage rises, the percentage of land for purchase shrinks. Mr Mortimer von Maltzahn, whose family had owned estates in Mecklenburg, the northern state of east Germany, since the 14th century, has spent DM4.3m (Pounds 1.72m) buying back 100 acres of his 7,000-acre estate and repairing his Schloss, or manor. He had to promise the local council that, in return for getting back the family's private church, he would repair the delapidated building at his own expense. Some have formed limited companies, enabling them to buy back some of their own land from the Treuhand, provided they invest in the region. Others have obtained 12-year leases from the Treuhand in the hope they will have the option to buy after the lease expires. Some families say the compensation proposals continue to treat property owners unequally before the law. Ms Anna-Tatiana Bauer said her family did not even have the right to reclaim the family church, or the graveyard. 'It is truly a disgrace,' she said. But the ' '45-49ers' cannot count on public support. The government cannot afford to compensate them for the loss of their property. Critics oppose the return of the 'Junker' landowners, as they are pejoratively known. They argue that their passivity allowed the rise of Hitler. East Germans generally want nothing to do with them because ideological indoctrination has taught them that every Junker is a feudal aristocrat or a Nazi supporter. Ironically, it is the far-right Republican party in east Germany which is playing the 'Junker card' in the run-up to the local, state and federal elections. Mr Lothar Bisky, the head of the social-democratic Party of Democratic Socialists, the successor to the former east German Communist party, says it would be dangerous to ignore their actions. In towns throughout Mecklenburg and Brandenburg, and in Berlin, the Republicans are dropping leaflets. Their message is clear. They tell east Germans that their property is threatened and could fall into the hands of west Germans. The Republicans are opposed to any restitution and the return of former property owners, blaming unification for this trend. A recent leaflet proclaimed: 'The Republicans are patriotic. We are the only patriotic and social German party which stands for full solidarity of the east Germans and the protection of their property.' 'We don't know how big their support is,' said Mr Bisky. 'But property rights is one of the planks of their platform. I am afraid of them, because I feel we have completely messed up the whole question of compensation and restitution. But it is too late to redress the mistakes of unification.'</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Peeled in the pink with pride - The Lancashire producer of a British seafood delicacy WHEN YOUR product has been made by the family business since 1799, bears the name of your home town on its label, and has earned two Royal Warrants as purveyors to Their Majesties The Queen and The Queen Mother, pride in the product is justified. Bob Baxter, proprietor of James Baxter and Son, Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, hopes he has pride in his product sufficient to see off the two new threats to his speciality food business (and to many similar businesses throughout Europe): EC interference from Brussels, and the wave of new food legislation which seems to make no distinction between small, independent food producers and industrial giants. His family - thanks to the combination of a fishing grandfather and a grandmother on the commercial side - monopolised the Morecambe Bay fish trade. Until the early 1950s Morecambe was an important seaside location: weekend trains in the summer season disgorged 800 visitors every 15 minutes at Morecambe station. The Baxters ran wet fish shops, five large restaurants, fishing boats and a famous potted shrimp business. As a lad, Bob Baxter used to look on to a bay filled with more than 100 small fishing boats; on my visit there were just six. He has spent 45 years in the family business, selling the retail outlets ahead of Morecambe's decline as a seaside resort; he now runs a business with a Pounds 500,000 turnover which includes more modern frozen foods, but it still produces the traditional potted shrimps. The shrimps live in the sandy estuaries of the rivers between north Wales and the Solway Firth. Baxter only buys those trawled by professional fishermen in the traditional 25 ft boats. Twenty stone of shrimp is a good catch for the eight-hour voyage. Once on board, the shrimps are cleaned and cooked in boiling sea water. Later they are hand peeled by the fishermen and their wives in approved premises, then delivered to Baxter. Kathleen and Doreen, with more than 35 years' experience between them, take over. In a small room, no bigger than a domestic kitchen, the shrimps are re-cooked in small batches in spiced butter - the recipe is a trade secret - and allowed to cool. Then 2oz cartons are filled with 1 3/4 oz shrimps each, and  1/4 oz butter lovingly spooned across the top to seal and protect the contents. The process is swift: out of the sea and into the pot in a maximum of 36 hours. It is simple, too: there is only one quality standard. Asked by a potentially important customer to produce potted shrimps to a slightly lower specification, Bob Baxter refused. On a busy day Kathleen and Doreen fill 750 pots; in a good year, 150,000. In the past, the weather was the biggest obstacle - not merely storms, but changes on the sea bed occurring every eight years. In 1991 the shrimp catch was reduced by 40 per cent. Baxter now feels that the obstacles are multiplying, and that they are increasingly man-made. Like most professional food handlers he cares about hygiene and safety: the shrimps are regularly analysed by an independent laboratory, and his formica-topped tables were replaced by stainless steel long before any directives appeared. But he has no truck with the sentiment expressed by a government health official, that the main drive for quality should be fear of prosecution. For Baxter, the priorities are a good product and a satisfied customer. Last year, as recession was also affecting sales, two new obstacles materialised. First, the EC decided to classify the one-man 25ft trawling boats as 'factory ships.' Although not yet passed into law, this directive could lead to the end of the immediate boiling of the shrimps in sea water, an important part of the traditional process. Instead, the small fishing vessels would be required to carry huge quantities of fresh water and ice on board. Then the new Food Safety Act, by initially proscribing mail order business and stipulating that all deliveries to wholesalers be made by refrigerated transport, threatened to break the contact between Baxter and his customers. The second stipulation means that he can no longer supply his retail or restaurant customers with fresh potted shrimps; they now have to make do with frozen shrimps. (There is, though, no significant difference in taste: at certain times of the year the shrimps are frozen to ensure a constant supply.) Fortunately for all small-scale UK food producers, the ban on mail order business was lifted, allowing it to continue to the 'end-user': the private customer. For Baxter this was critical: local trade now accounts for only 5 per cent of his entire production. In late 1991 he placed an advertisement in a national newspaper, offering ten 2oz pots at Pounds 19.90 inclusive of packing and postage. Pounds 4,000 worth of new business was the result. There has been speedy repeat business from grateful customers. If he can maintain momentum, Baxter plans a small modern unit to handle mail orders.

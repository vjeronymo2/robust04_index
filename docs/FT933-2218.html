			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / BAe space sale talks face early restart TALKS AIMED at selling British Aerospace's satellite-making division to Matra-Marconi Space, the Anglo-French joint venture, are set to restart next month. The sale to Matra-Marconi Space, which is Europe's biggest manufacturer of satellites, could help secure the future of BAe's remaining space operations at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and Filton, near Bristol. Matra-Marconi would integrate design and manufacturing at the two BAe sites into its own two centres at Portsmouth, Hampshire, and Toulouse, in south-west France. A sale would be part of BAe's strategy to dispose of non-core businesses in an attempt to improve its profitability. An attempt last year to sell the division, which has a turnover of about Pounds 120m a year, fell through when Matra-Marconi Space declined to take on all the businesses on offer. Since then, BAe's space division has roughly halved its workforce to 1,100. It spun off its communications services operation last November. The restructuring had cleared the way for a reopening of talks, said Mr Claude Goumy, chairman of Matra-Marconi Space. He said any deal could be completed quickly because last year's talks got as far as a due diligence study by Matra-Marconi Space. 'We are hoping that talks will start next month and that an outcome will be clear by the end of the year.' Matra-Marconi Space is 51 per cent owned by Matra-Hachette of France and 49 per cent by GEC. BAe acknowledged that the division was still up for sale but said talks had not yet started. The group was likely to argue that restructuring has put a higher price tag on the business. Mr Goumy, by contrast, said the operation was 'not worth much. It's a question of negotiating goodwill.' BAe's activities in the commercial space industry have been shrinking for several years. Last October, it failed to win a Pounds 150m contract to build a telecommunications satellite for the Arabsat consortium. It is working on two main contracts: Envisat, part of a Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) European Space Agency (ESA) programme due for launch in 1998; and Skynet 4 for the UK Ministry of Defence for which it has a Pounds 10m project development programme.</p>

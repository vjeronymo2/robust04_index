			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Beverley Pounds 4m sale to Villiers Beverley Group, the engineer, has entered an agreement to sell its Gall Thomson Marine offshoot to Villiers, the USM-traded company formerly known as Caspen Oil, for up to Pounds 4m in cash and shares. In October, Beverley agreed to sell the subsidiary to Sealand Industries, a wholly owned offshoot of VSEL, for Pounds 3.5m. That agreement was rescinded yesterday with Beverley contributing Pounds 40,000 to Sealand's costs. In addition to the increased consideration, Beverley, formerly known as Petrocon, will benefit from the profits generated by Gall Thomson in November and December which Beverley estimates at about Pounds 125,000. The sale proceeds represent a surplus over net book value of some Pounds 3.93m and will be used repay borrowings, reduce creditors and improve gearing. Beverley is also disposing of Engineering Surveys, a lossmaking surveying business, a freehold property in Suffolk and its head office building. Beverley's shares added 3 1/2 p to 8p.</p>

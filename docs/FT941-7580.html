			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Recruitment: Duty to report may not put the heat on fraudsters - The debate on the role of auditors in detecting and acting on corporate crime To listen to Mr Martyn Jones speak, you might think he was arguing from the Conservative benches in the House of Commons for the motion on hanging on Tuesday, rather than commenting from the solitude of his office on the debate a week earlier about auditors' duties to regulators. 'In some countries they take fraudsters out and shoot them,' he says. 'Here what do we do with them? They live the life of Riley, their charges are reduced before trial, their expenses are paid, they go on bail, their sentences are ludicrously short, their wives live well while they're inside, you can't find the money they've stolen, and they do an advanced accounting course to pass the time in jail. 'Meanwhile the accountancy profession sets up another committee, and adds to the Byzantine structure of standards. Every time there's a scandal, the auditor becomes the whipping boy. The fraudsters must be laughing their heads off. People forget their names, they get another job and start over again. What a fantastic way of life.' Behind the rhetoric, Mr Jones, auditing technical partner with Touche Ross, is raising some important questions about current approaches to corporate fraud detection and prevention in the UK. His outburst has been triggered by the debate in parliament last week that has led to new statutory instruments requiring auditors to report any fraud they detect to the regulators of banks, building societies, insurance companies and the financial service sector. The legislation was introduced in the wake of the 1992 Bingham report into the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It suggested that the auditor's existing right in law to report fraud should be enhanced into a formal duty. Jones and other observers of the debate are sceptical of the new amendments. They argue that auditors do currently alert regulators to fraud, either directly or more commonly through the more discreet route of putting pressure on their client to do so themselves. The problem is not in communicating with regulators once fraud has been discovered, but in identifying it in the first place. In other words, Jones argues that auditors are very often unable to detect fraud. 'We can't put people under oath, demand powers of search, examine third parties records or premises, insist on auditing related parties, or get behind bank records to see money flows,' he says. 'In reality, auditors' powers are very limited.' He believes that most frauds require the use of a number of 'bit players' to falsify documents or misrepresent facts which can mislead the auditors, and yet who are rarely prosecuted. His solution is to increase the punishments for those who engage in deceit. There are currently provisions for these offences, most notably section 389A of the 1985 Companies Act, which makes it a criminal offence to deceive the auditor. But Jones calls the clause 'pathetic', arguing that it is rarely used by prosecutors. The only instance to date has been against Anthony Cole of Bestwood, who was convicted last year of making a false statement to an auditor. Charges of providing false information to auditors are also made in the current trials of Mr Nazmu Virani of Control Securities and Mr Mohammed Baqi of BCCI. Mr Muhammed Naviede faces a similar charge in the Arrows case scheduled to begin in September. It seems that the Serious Fraud Office tends to go for 'six of the best', concentrating on a few more wide-ranging charges that encapsulate the criminality of a fraud and which carry longer penalties. The risk is that these are harder to prove, and do little to deter the bit players. Jones would like to see extra barbs added to the clause by increasing the existing maximum sentence of two years up to five, and making those found guilty personally liable for any losses caused by the fraud. He says the legislation should also be extended. The law on pension funds carries only a Pounds 400 fine for not providing information to auditors, for example. The regulations on deceiving auditors in flotation documents and for other industry sectors are weak or non-existent. He would also like to see the professional bodies take a tougher line. These views have apparently been received with some sympathy by government. Mr Robert Hughes, head of litigation support at Ernst &amp; Young, supports the idea of the 'Nuremburg principles', by which minor players in a fraud would be unable to excuse themselves by saying that they were only obeying orders. Mr Julian Osborne, secretary to the professional ethics committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is less convinced. He says the institute receives at least two substantive cases a week to its anonymous ethical hotline from accountants concerned about what they have come across. He says that accountants convicted of fraud will always be subject to professional discipline, but that sometimes no trial takes place because the police and revenue authorities may reach a settlement and decide not to prosecute. But he argues that when the institute investigates, the responsibility should generally fall on the more senior accountants at board level. 'That is more equitable,' he says. 'The others are not in a position of power, and it may not be evidence from the orders they are given that something is deceitful. They may just be told 'this is the way we're going to value stock and don't question it.'' He would prefer new regulations to protect employees in companies, who currently have none of the guarantees or privileges of auditors such as confidentiality if they attempt to warn their superiors of suspected fraud. A more sceptical view on Jones' case is that it throws up a smokescreen to conceal the responsibilities of auditors. Perhaps, as Mr Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, suggested in the Commons debate last week, auditors should be under an obligation to detect fraud: a requirement already in place for auditors to local authorities. Certainly the larger accountancy firms all offer fraud detection services. For example, Mr Ian Huntingdon from the forensic accounting team at KPMG Peat Marwick says his staff would be likely to detect more fraud than auditors examining a company. But he stresses that they are employed for a very different purpose, usually after fraud has been detected, and that the time and costs involved are considerably greater. Others argue that this more antagonistic approach to auditing would jeopardise client trust and openness. Mr Hughes adds that there are many warning signs in every audit. 'In 99 cases out of 100 they are not frauds, and the explanation is honest,' he says. Yet Mitchell's views are not isolated. Mr John Knox, deputy director of the Serious Fraud Office, argued in a speech last year that auditors very often fail to detect fraud. While one reason was the deceptions practised on them, there were many others. These included reliance on uncorroborated representations from management; failure to identify related-party transactions; failure to understand the nature of the business; and inadequate audit testing. Auditors were all too often too trusting. Ultimately, it is the fraudsters who deserve most attention and criticism. But in many cases, auditors have spotted the rudiments of the fraud but not drawn the right conclusions. That does not necessarily mean they have deliberately conspired to withhold knowledge of fraud from regulators. But it does mean they still need to think harder about whether they are doing enough to meet the expectations placed upon them.</p>

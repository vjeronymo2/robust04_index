			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent Grigoriy </F> Bazhutin, Perm, under rubric "Boondocks": "The Blizzard of  Passion Has Not Abated"]    [Text] People in Perm are depressed, fearful, and  hungry. At least many of them are. A few days ago a blizzard  played tricks over the city, pressing down on it with large  snowdrifts and converting the sidewalks into narrow paths and  the roads in narrow ruts. The city administration does not have  any funds to put them in order.    Ordinary citizens are being "squeezed" by the prices in the  stores, in transportation, and in the day care centers and  hospitals. The defense enterprises that constitute the basis of  the city's industry are "squeezing" people by their violations  of the conversion law. Motorostroitel, the city's largest AO  [joint-stock company] received for the current year a state  production order that is capable of giving a workload to only  five percent of the production capacities.    The Christmas vacation at some enterprises has not yet  ended.  According to the administration's estimates, during the next few  weeks the conversion plants will have to lay off at least  approximately 15,000 workers. Who will be included in that  figure? Where will those people go? What will their families  live on? These are questions to which no one in Perm can give an  intelligible answer.    It is only in the headquarters of the local parties and  public associations that life is in full swing. The people there  are preparing for the election to the oblast Representative  Assembly. According to preliminary estimates, from 500 to 600  candidates will contend for 40 places. Who, then, has the best  chances of success?    Perhaps one of the leaders of the local section of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]--19-year-old Aleksandr  Chulkov, who identified himself as a student but who, it  transpired, is not carried on the rolls of any higher  educational institution? He has already announced that the  Zhirinovskiy followers have been guaranteed the majority in the  assembly. In addition, he has called himself the "shadow  governor," and has recruited a shadowy "cabinet of ministers."  Another local leader of the same party sent to the Perm section  of the SDP [Social Democratic Party], which is organizing an  antifascist front, a letter in which he promised that, in  payment for the criticism leveled against his party (when the  LDPR comes to power), everyone will be subjected to repressions,  up to and including death by firing squad.    But if one speaks seriously, in Perm the LDPR scarcely has  any chances of success. But the Communists have substantial  ones. This is attested to if only by the results of the election  to the State Duma. V. Zelenin, agricultural institute professor,  and V. Putilov, chairman of the Rossiya [Russia] Kolkhoz, the  largest one in the oblast, both of whom got through the election  with unambiguously Communist programs, garnered considerably  more votes than the other pretenders.    It is also interesting that today more and more Communist  Party sections are being supported by young people and students.  They have begun, by the way, to issue a newspaper under the  somewhat pretentious name NASH PAROVOZ [Our Locomotive].    The trade unions are also counting on a majority in the  Representative Assembly. People in the Perm Oblast Council of  Trade Unions regret that they did not take part in the election  to the State Duma. Now they have decided to fight actively for  places in the oblast representative authority.    Yet another previously unknown force arose unexpectedly on  the local political scene -- the force consisting of the united  managers of banks and other financial structures. And it can be  assumed that a definite amount of success has been guaranteed to  them --if only at the expense of the money that they have at  their disposal.    Those Perm residents who still preserve some kind of  political aggressiveness are, of course, worried most about what  kind of succession will occur between the present Council that  is living its last days and the future Representative Assembly.  M. Bystryantsev, chairman of the oblast Council, feels that  there is no doubt about it. First, in his opinion, at least half  the members of the small Council can become part of the  Representative Assembly and be beneficial there. But he himself  is also planning to run for election.    One should have no doubts about Mikhail Ivanovich's success.  Several districts and public associations are already arguing  today about the right to nominate him as their candidate.  Immediately the question arises: does this mean that he will  also head the assembly? That would really be too much! There are  two real leaders. One of them is, yes, M. Bystryantsev. However,  the oblast administration has decided to oppose him with Doctor  of Economic Sciences Ye. Sapiro, first deputy governor.    To tell the truth, the collision between the two leaders  seems to be a bad thing. But, really, there are those who wanted  very much to organize it. Why? Apparently the administration  wants to put under its control the new representative authority  that has not even been born yet! We can see that the process  that is gathering force on the federal level has also seized the  provinces. Until the snowdrifts are cleared away here... to the  politicians!</p>

Eleven shells fell on the eastern part of the city late  Saturday and two explosions were heard early Sunday in the same  area, Colonel Antonio Castro of the UN Protection Force's  (UNPROFOR) Spanish battalion said.    "It's the first time the ceasefire has really been  violated,"  the spokesman said. The truce went into effect on Friday [25  February] at 1200 GMT.    Castro said an investigation would have to be held to  determine who is responsible for the shelling. The Spanish  battalion has its headquarters in Medjugorje, around 20  kilometres (12 miles) from Mostar.    The city is divided between the Croat troops who hold the  western part and have besieged for the past six month the  Moslem-held eastern part where some 50,000 people are trapped.    During the two weeks preceeding the ceasefire agreement, an  average of the 10 shells fell daily on the eastern part.</p>

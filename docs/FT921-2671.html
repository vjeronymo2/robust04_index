			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Friendly societies widen their scope FRIENDLY societies, the institutions born out of the co-operative movement to sell products such as insurance and investment schemes, have won the right to extend the scope of their financial services. Under the Friendly Societies Bill, which has passed through parliament, they can opt for corporate status and form incorporated subsidiaries offering new services. The Act will establish a new regulatory framework, including a Friendly Societies Commission. Friendly societies will also be brought within the scope of the Policyholders Protection Act 1975. The Registry of Friendly societies will have to change its regulations before friendly societies can take advantage of the new legislation. That process could take another year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (YONHAP) -- Adding to its worries of  extreme food shortages, North Korea is reportedly having trouble  importing and exporting industrial goods since Russia banned  barter trade with the communist country early last month.    To make up for their loss in Russia, North Korean trading  companies run by the defense and public security ministries are  scurrying about Beijing seeking partners from Japan and  Southeast Asia as well as South Korea, trading sources based  here said Friday.    Moscow banned barter trade with North Korea on April 1 and  raised import tariffs more than 30 percent, in effect blocking  trade with the Stalinist country, a Russian trader said. The  action was designed to protect Russian companies from incurring  damages due to slow payment and delays in dealing with North  Korean smugglers, he said.    Many North Korean companies, too, are said to have been  cheated by bogus Russian traders, another source said. For  example, a North Korean trading firm lost 3 million U.S.  dollars while trying to import a truck from Russia last year.    The trade friction between North Korea and Russia is  reflected in Pyongyang's efforts to diversify its trading  sources, South Korean traders here observed.    North Korean traders belonging to defense or security  agencies have approached South Korean companies in Beijing, they  said. A trader here said North Koreans were proposing to trade  almost anything -- from fisheries to antiques -- these days.</p>

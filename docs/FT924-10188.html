			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Collor scheme 'turned over Dollars 200m' THE corruption scheme allegedly involving Brazil's suspended President Fernando Collor reached into most areas of government and had a yearly turnover in excess of Dollars 200m (Pounds 123m), according to computer records published in the Brazilian press yesterday. The records show the existence of a big corruption network, a 'parallel government', with contacts in almost all ministries. It extorted kickbacks on everything from road construction contracts to importation of food and health items for charity programmes. Veja magazine published extracts from the 251 pages so far transcribed by police from secret files stored in the computer seized from the office of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's friend and former campaign treasurer who allegedly ran the scheme, and on whom Mr Collor blames the scandal. Mr Collor is referred to throughout as 'Big Boss' and Mr Farias as 'chief lobbyist'. Accounts and objectives are clearly presented, with finances rigorously controlled. Targets include forming 'joint ventures' with big companies and 'the strengthening of new economic groups'. It also explains how participants should behave in public, adding that the scheme would run until December 1994 - the end of Mr Collor's mandate. Accessed using the password 'Collor', one secret file labelled 'Cash' lists 128 government projects between September 1990 and February 1991. Another file lists contacts in 862 companies and government departments.</p>

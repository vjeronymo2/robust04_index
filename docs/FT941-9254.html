			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / US output grows 1/2%: Storms and earthquake constrain January figures US industrial production rose 0.5 per cent last month, roughly in line with analysts' projections, but distortions caused by very cold weather and the Los Angeles earthquake made the figures hard to interpret. Production was up 4.7 per cent in the year to January, following robust increases in the final quarter of last year. The Federal Reserve said adverse weather and the earthquake constrained manufacturing output which rose 0.2 per cent, against an average monthly gain of 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter. Steel, appliances and motor vehicles were among the industries most badly affected. However, the arctic weather conditions sharply boosted production at utilities and mines as demand for electricity and gas surged. Output of utilities rose 3.5 per cent from December to January, following gains of 0.9 per cent in the two preceding months. The Fed said the overall rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to 83.1 per cent against 82.9 per cent in December, well above the long-term average of 81.9 per cent. Consumer spending last month was also affected by adverse weather and the earthquake. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent in January, the first fall in 10 months, but already strong figures for December were revised up.</p>

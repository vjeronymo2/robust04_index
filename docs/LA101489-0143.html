			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> LAID-OFF WORKERS TO GET COUNSELING HELP  </P> <P> The city will be managing a new federal program to help local workers who have  been notified they will be laid off because of work-force reductions or plant  closures.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously this week to approve a list of agencies that  will counsel workers about to be laid off on how to write resumes, handle  interview techniques and search for new jobs. The program is part of the  federal Plant Closure Act approved by Congress last year.  </P> <P> "We want to get these people out of the doldrums and into gainful employment as  quickly as possible," said Al McCord, Anaheim's director of economic  development.  </P> <P> The program will be offered to Anaheim workers who are laid off in groups of 50  or more. The last layoff of that size in Anaheim was at Laura Scudder last  year, McCord said.  </P> <P> Among the local service agencies handling the program are the North Orange  County Community College District and the UAW-Labor Employment and Training  Corp. The agencies were selected by the Anaheim Private Industry Council.  </P></p>

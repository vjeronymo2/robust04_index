			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KATELLA SETS RECORDS, BUT ESPERANZA WINS  </P> <P> For a half, the Katella High School football team looked as if it might spoil  Esperanza's unblemished regular-season record. But in the second half, it was  clearly a matchup of two teams going in opposite directions.  </P> <P> Esperanza, buoyed by its dominating running game, defeated Katella, 42-21, to  complete its first unbeaten regular season since 1980. The Aztecs (10-0, 5-0 in  league), rushed for 431 yards, highlighted by Jarod Smith's 233 yards and two  touchdowns.  </P> <P> It offset a stellar performance by Katella quarterback Chris Reed.  </P> <P> Reed passed for 296 yards and teamed with receiver Art Vance to produce four  school records.  </P> <P> Vance, who caught seven passes for 188 yards and three touchdowns, now holds  records for most touchdowns caught in a season (eight) and most touchdowns  caught in a game by a receiver (three). Reed finished the season with 1,634  yards passing, surpassing Dave Wilson's 1976 single-season and one-game marks  of 1,358 and 278 yards, respectively. DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

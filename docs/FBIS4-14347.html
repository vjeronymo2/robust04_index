			<p>BFN     [Text] In a meeting with Malian President Alpha Oumar  Konare, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani placed emphasis on the  Islamic Republic of Iran's foreign policy which stresses  cooperation with African countries in general and Muslim  countries in particular.    During this morning's meeting, the president of Mali  expressed pleasure about visiting Iran. He pointed out that  unity among Muslim and other nations plays an effective role in  the resolution of world problems, and called for the expansion  of relations with Iran. He added: Your excellency is well aware  of the situation in African countries and particularly in Mali,  as well as the problems of that continent, and I feel that I am  able to hold discussions with your excellency in all fields.    In response, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thanked Mr. Konare for his  sincere remarks and referred to Iran's foreign policy, giving  priority to cooperation with Muslim countries and said: We are  ready for extensive cooperation with the Muslim and friendly  country of Mali in all fields of interest to the two countries.  He added: Your country can be a powerful country in  agriculture and animal husbandry, and your plentiful natural  resources can play a decisive role in solving your country's  problems. Underdevelopment there should be seen as an outcome  of the colonialism which dominated your country for years. The  president said: We hope that you succeed in overcoming your  problems through your work and through solidarity now that you  are independent. We in Iran had some good experiences and are  ready to cooperate with you, and Islam, which is the common bond  between the two countries, can play a significant role in ever  expanding cooperation.    Also during the meeting, the problems of the Islamic world,  particularly problems of Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, were  discussed and the two sides stressed the need for further  solidarity among Islamic countries in order to solve problems of  the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

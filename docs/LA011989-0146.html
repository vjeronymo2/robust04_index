			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> UNIONS BARRED FROM FIRING DISSENTING LOCAL LEADERS  </P> <P> In a major decision regarding the free speech rights of union members, the  Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that labor unions may not fire elected local  officials who disagree with policies of the parent union.  </P> <P> The 8-0 decision, written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said that firing an  elected official because he opposed a dues increase violated the 1959  Landrum-Griffin Act. The act, he wrote, is designed "to ensure that unions are  democratically governed and responsive to the will of the union membership as  expressed in open, periodic elections."  </P> <P> Marshall said that permitting an official to be fired for expressing dissenting  opinions would lead union members to conclude "that one challenged the union  hierarchy, if at all, at one's peril. That is precisely what Congress sought to  prevent when it passed" the 1959 law.  </P> <P> Wednesday's decision affirmed a 1986 ruling of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals. The AFL-CIO was sufficiently concerned about the case that it filed a  brief on behalf of the Sheet Metal Workers International Assn., the union  directly involved in the case. The AFL-CIO feared that an adverse ruling would  restrict national unions' abilities to operate as freely as they choose.  Lawyers for the AFL-CIO and the Sheet Metal Workers International did not  return calls asking for comment.  </P> <P> Herman Benson, president of the nonprofit Assn. for Union Democracy, called the  decision "extremely important." He said that ever since a 1982 decision of the  high court upholding the rights of a newly elected local union president to  fire officials appointed by his predecessor, the job security of elected  officials had also been in question.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1982 Dispute Over Dues  </P> <P> Wednesday's decision arose out of a 1982 dispute in a Los Angeles local of the  Sheet Metal Workers International over whether to impose a dues increase to  help remedy the local's financial problems. Edward Lynn, an elected business  agent of the local, opposed the dues increase. He and other members of Local 75  asserted that officials of their local were paid considerably more than  officials of comparable locals and contended that a salary reduction for them,  rather than a dues increase, was the appropriate solution to the union's  difficulties.  </P> <P> Five days after the dues increase was voted down at a union meeting, Richard  Hawkins, a trustee appointed by the Sheet Metal Workers International who  favored the increase, told Lynn that he was being removed "indefinitely" from  his position as business agent because of his outspoken opposition to the dues  increase.  </P> <P> After exhausting his intra-union remedies, Lynn sued the union in federal  District Court in Los Angeles in 1983. The District Court granted a summary  judgment for the union, citing Finnegan vs. Leu, the 1982 decision that gave  unions broad rights in firing appointed officials. Lynn appealed to the 9th  Circuit and prevailed. Since there was a conflict among federal circuit courts  on the issue, the Supreme Court took the case.  </P> <P> Wednesday's decision means that Lynn, now working as a sheet metal worker for  Los Angeles County, can now sue the union for wrongful discharge and damages.  </P> <P> Lynn, 54, said he was "happy for the rest of the union members in this  country." However, he said, he had to endure 18 months without work after the  dues dispute because union officials refused to send him out on jobs. He still  has a complaint pending at the National Labor Relations Board on allegations  that the union illegally failed to dispatch him to jobs.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine getting a decision from the Supreme Court before the NLRB  acts?" he asked. "Slow justice is no justice."  </P> <P> Lynn's lawyers said they were elated at the decision. Both Bruce Stark, a Los  Angeles attorney who handled the case in the lower federal courts, and Paul  Levy of the Public Citizen Litigation group in Washington, who argued the case  before the Supreme Court, called the ruling "a great victory for union  democracy."  </P> <P> Levy added: "If union leaders could deprive their opponents of elected office,  no member would feel safe in speaking out about union affairs, and dissent  would be silenced."  </P> <P> Marshall referred to the purposes of the 1959 law, whose first section is  called a "Bill of Rights" for union members, in distinguishing the Lynn case  from the 1982 Finnegan case. He said the goal of that section of the 1959 law  was to ensure democratic union governance. Marshall said that allowing a newly  elected local president to fire officials appointed by his predecessor did not  frustrate that objective. "Rather, it ensured a union's 'responsiveness to the  mandate of the union election,' " he said. He said the facts of the Lynn case  presented just the opposite situation.  </P></p>

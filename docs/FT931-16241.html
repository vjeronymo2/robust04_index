			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / EC commissioners in territorial wrangle THE European Commission's effort to beef up the EC's foreign affairs portfolio has run into difficulties, with commissioners and civil servants jockeying for power. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner responsible for trade relations, tried to clear up the confusion during a lunch yesterday with Mr Hans van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister who holds the external political portfolio. EC officials described the talks as amicable, but predicted that Commission president Jacques Delors would have to step in to settle differences between Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek, both political heavyweights. The turf battle was caused by the Commission's decision to split the external affairs portfolio previously held by Mr Frans Andriessen, the long-serving senior Dutch Commissioner who departed last month. Mr van den Broek inherited external political relations and the lead role in 'enlargement' talks with applicants for EC membership - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Sir Leon, previously responsible for competition, is to handle trade relations with industrial nations, including the Gatt multilateral trade talks, anti-dumping policy and aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Last month, both men stressed their common liberal and 'Atlanticist' views, but difficulties have arisen over the allocation of duties. One model is to divide the civil service according to geographic regions. Others prefer a split between politics and economics, with Mr van den Broek effectively the EC's 'political supremo' - an ambition he clearly outlined at the first full meeting of the Commission on Wednesday when he spoke at length about the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and the plight of Palestinian refugees stranded in southern Lebanon. But EC officials admit that the world is not carved up so easily. For example, Sir Leon is expected to lead the EC side when a high-level Japanese delegation arrives in Brussels on January 15 for talks on trade, investment and the global economy. Moreover, some countries such as Korea and Mexico resist being classed as developing countries, which are the responsibility of a third commissioner, Mr Manuel Marin of Spain. The result is that no one in Brussels is sure which commissioner is directly responsible for relations. To add to confusion, a new recruit to the Commission is Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the highly regarded former Portuguese foreign minister who is expected to pitch in on foreign affairs. 'At this rate, we will have to organise a peace conference in Brussels to settle the differences,' quipped one observer.</p>

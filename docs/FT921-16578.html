			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Moscow awaits backlash as price controls end EXTRA police are being deployed in Moscow to guard against a possible explosion of popular anger against price rises introduced today by President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Arkady Murashov, the capital's police chief, said 1,000 more police would be on the streets in case of disturbances or attacks on shops or traders. There are usually 6,000 police on duty at any one time in this city of 9m people. He said: 'We are preparing for the worst although I do not believe there will be attacks as rumours have it.' The long-feared liberalisation will end decades of artificially-low fixed prices. Six basic commodities are exempt. The amount paid for bread, milk, matches, salt, vodka and energy will remain fixed but at three to five times higher than the present level. Russia was to have gone it alone today, but reports from Ukraine yesterday suggested that the second largest state in the new commonwealth would emulate Russia on the same day. Other newly-independent states plan a mixture of price reforms and trade barriers in coming days to limit the flight of goods from their territory. A telling sign of changes ahead are new producer-prices published in St Petersburg which show meat rising from Rbs7 a kilo more than twelve-fold to Rbs90. Beer, which is virtually unobtainable in state shops, will be sold to retailers for Rbs20-30, up from the present official price of Rbs3-5. The minimum wage only recently went up to Rbs200 a month. Price liberalisation is being presented by the Russian government as the keystone to market reform. But a senior Western financial official said today's rises were primarily a political measure since there was no real monetary, budgetary or privatisation policy in place. The main merit would be to start irreversible change, paving the way for a comprehensive economic reform programme to be agreed with the International Monetary Fund and other experts. The reform was also an attempt to break the power of local mafias, which had thrived on seven decades of fixed low prices, and to 'show other republics who is the boss'. Like many shops, the doors of Gastronom No 45 were closed yesterday, with New Year's Day still the country's most cherished public holiday. Inside, Mr Alexander Sokolov, the supermarket's director, was beavering away with his book-keepers to prepare for the new prices. He said after 74 years of communist rule, it would take a few weeks for supplies to begin to improve. While he was sure of receiving his supplies of bread in time for today, he was still hoping some milk would arrive overnight after a week of having none at all on his shelves.

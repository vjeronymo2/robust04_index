			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Samir Sa'd-al-Din from "occupied </F> Jerusalem"]    [Text] Mazin 'Izz-al-Din, official in charge of political  guidance for the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, has said  that the Palestinian military has taken over police duties  because it was capable and was ready to take over that authority  from the political apparatus and that the military would  continue to exercise that right until the political and civilian  institutions were prepared to assume that responsibility.  Therefore, the fear of some brothers in the opposition that the  military will continue to assume authority and that the role of  the members of the authority would be confined to administrative  duties is unfounded.    He also said: We are planning to build political and  civilian institutions and to hold elections for the authority's  legislative council.    He added: Dialogue between the Fatah Movement and Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] has been going on for a long time,  and it began even before the arrival of the police in the  National Authority's area. We are willing to continue that  dialogue until we reach common ground because we believe that  the Palestinian police do not belong to one faction but to all  the Palestinian people's segments and factions. It is true that  we fought Israel, but this is not allowed among our political  forces. Now, we are holding a dialogue with Israel, but it is  more appropriate that we should argue with each other in a  democratic way.    He asserted that we have achieved positive results in our  dialogue with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.    Referring to the existence of a dialogue with the other  organizations, he said: We argued with them in Beirut, the  jungle of rifles; we all reached common ground; we all  participated in formulating our legislative councils and our  political frameworks; and we conducted joint patrols. He then  urged the leftist and pan- Arab forces to exercise their right  under the warm wings of the Palestinian people and democracy to  which we all belong.    Regarding the alertness of the Palestinian police,  'Izz-al-Din said that the police forces, which were originally  Palestinian forces, were properly trained in various countries,  including West European and East European countries and some  Arab countries. Several months ago, we sent personnel to the  United States, Europe, and France, and we will send others to  Japan and some Arab countries to take courses on administration,  typography, map drawing, and computer usage. The problem is  that we do not have the necessary institutions and departments  for police missions. For example, the policemen do not have  telecommunications devices to organize work between patrols,  branches, and centers.    Mazin 'Izz-al-Din also said that the Palestinian police have  actually begun to exercise police missions. For example, they  asked drivers to keep proper papers for themselves and their  cars, they have organized visits to beaches in Gaza, and they  have removed tents and huts on the beaches.    The policemen also cleaned the Strip's cities and camps.  Senior officers and soldiers took part in that work. He said:  We want opposition factions and organizations to participate  with us in removing the slogans they have written on walls in  Gaza. Everyone took part in removing similar slogans in Jericho.    Colonel Khalid Mismar, official in charge of information in  Jordan, who was appointed official in charge of political  guidance for the Palestinian police in the West Bank, is  expected to arrive within the next few days.</p>

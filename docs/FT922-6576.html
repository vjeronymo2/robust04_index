			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons writes Pounds 47m off assets DRAYTON Consolidated Trust, the investment trust company specialising in unquoted assets, said yesterday that it had written off more than half the value of its unlisted assets to Pounds 40.1m at the end of March from Pounds 87m just six months earlier. The company, which is managed by Invesco MIM, also said that its advisers, County NatWest Wood Mackenzie and Cazenove, had recommended proposals for the remaining assets which would allow shareholders to receive cash as assets were sold. The advisers were appointed in February following the announcement that receivers had been appointed to Alma Holdings, the unquoted confectionery company in which Drayton was the main shareholder. In its statement yesterday, Drayton said the sharp drop in valuation of the unquoted portfolio over the past six months largely reflected the write-off in Alma Holdings as well as write-offs against the value of property occupied by City Merchants Bank and by further provisions against other unspecified investments. Drayton said its advisers were suggesting the formation of a new quoted investment company which would hold the unquoted investments until they could be sold in an orderly manner. The new company would also own several quoted, but illiquid, investments. Meanwhile, as the remaining assets are sold, shareholders will receive cash. At end-March the trust's current assets were valued at Pounds 86.3m, down from Pounds 162m at the end of September 1991. Gross income for the half year to March 31 fell to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 5.05m). The interim dividend is maintained at 4.25p.</p>

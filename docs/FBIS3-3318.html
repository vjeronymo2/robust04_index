The agreement was signed by Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman  and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic at a ceremony presided  over by President Bill Clinton.    "The agreement signed today offer one of the first clear  signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the  violence and begin a process of reconstruction," said Clinton.    But the accord was signed with the absence of the Serbs, who  control 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Clinton said that he hoped "the Serbs will join in this  process toward peace as well."    Earlier, the two sides signed a proposed constitution of the  federation and initiated the principles of confederation between  the two republics.</p>

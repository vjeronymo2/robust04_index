			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Program of the Government of Moscow for 1994"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  I. </H5>   The government of Moscow notes that as a whole the tasks  defined by the program for 1993 were resolved successfully.    The main systems of the city administration worked in a  stable manner (power industry, transport, water supply, and  housing and municipal services).    Sufficiently high investment activity and volume of housing  and social-cultural construction were continued in the city.  Housing area input totaled 3 million square meters, and 25  schools, two elementary class units, 27 kindergartens, 15  polyclinics, and five hospital buildings were put into  operation, 68 stores and 218 public catering establishments were  built and have started to function, 12 hothouses were put into  operation in the sovkhoz of the Moscow Soviet, the Palace of  Justice building was built, and the crackers plant was put into  operation.    Moscow celebrated Victory Day on Poklonnaya Hill, where the  first section of the memorial complex was built.    The Kazanskiy Cathedral was reconstructed on Red Square in  1993.    Construction began on the center of the city, where more  than  800,000 square meters of buildings were put into operation.    The volume of capital repair of roads, which totaled 18.5  million square meters, was overfulfilled by 23.3 percent.    Major repairs were accomplished on 2.0 million square meters  of living space, and the volume of construction and  reconstruction of engineering networks increased.    Social protection of Muscovites was a subject of special  attention on the part of the Government of Moscow. In accordance  with a special purpose program, various types of social  assistance were provided to 3,614,500 persons. This is every  third Muscovite.    On the whole in the last year more than 92 billion rubles  [R]  was expended for these purposes (of this amount, R62 billion  came from the budgetary resources of the city).    The largest sums were directed to differential supplementary  pension payments to nonworking pensioners--R25 billion, and to  food subsidies for pupils of grades 1-11 at Moscow schools--R15  billion.    During the year, expenditures on the conduct of sanitary  measures with children increased substantially in comparison  with the initial proposals, totaling more than R7 billion.    Assistance unprecedented in scale was rendered in 1993 to  organs of internal affairs. More than R45 billion and $8 million  were expended on reinforcing the material base of the militia  and fitting it out with modern equipment. Thirty-seven  facilities were built, including 21 militia offices, which makes  it possible to require that personnel of the GUVD [Main  Administration of Internal Affairs] make qualitative changes  regarding the fight against crime and control over public order.    Economic reforms were conducted more actively than in 1992.  The share of nonstate enterprises at present totals more than 85  percent in trade turnover and motor vehicle freight shipments,  in construction--more than 90 percent, and in industrial  production--50 percent.    With all the complexities of the budgetary-financial  situation, the Government of Moscow financed all the measures  planned in the 1993 program.  <H5>  II. </H5>   The conditions for the development of the economy of the  city  and the functioning of city services will be more complicated in  1994. The economic crisis and drop in production continue, and  inflation is being maintained at a high rate. However, the  Government of Moscow believes that the city has a stable system  of administration, resources, and reserves for continuing and  developing positive trends, stabilizing the city's economy, and  resolving worthwhile socioeconomic tasks.    The measures outlined by the program of the government of  Moscow for 1994 are directed to this end.  <H5>  III. </H5>   In the social sphere, the government intends:    --to develop the system existing in the city for social  support of the low income strata of the population by indexing,  in accordance with inflation, the scales of allowances for  pensioners, students, and children, and subsidies for food and  medicine in schools, preschool institutions, and hospitals. It  is planned to increase the share of the budget allocated for  these purposes by a factor of 1.5;    --to assign 1.3 million square meters of housing area in new  home construction sites for the free improvement of housing  conditions for those on waiting lists in prefectures and the  city administration;    --starting 1 January 1994, to begin the conversion of city  health services to the principles of budgetary-insurance  medicine on the basis of the medical insurance fund established  in 1993. At the same time, to increase expenditures on the  maintenance of medical institutions.    --to develop the projected trend in reducing the gap in the  wages of workers in public education, health services, and other  branches of the city economy;    --to continue the policy on rendering financial support to  cultural institutions and also implement a program for the  restoration and reconstruction of the Bolshoy Theater, the State  Fine Arts Museum, the Russian State Library, the Tretyakovskaya  Gallery, and the Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Hill;    --to render every kind of support to law enforcement organs  in the fight against crime and continue implementation of the  program for the development of their material base and technical  equipping;    --despite the significant increase in expenditures and  reductions in budget capabilities, to continue subsidizing a  large part of the costs of the operation of the housing fund,  passenger transport, and municipal services.  <H5>  IV. </H5>   In the investment complex, provision is made to  ensure continuation of the scope of housing construction and  also social facilities and engineering infrastructure associated  with it. Three million square meters of housing area, 20  schools, 25 kindergartens, 11 polyclinics, and three hospital  buildings will be built.    Work will be continued on reconstruction of the center of  the  city, where it is planned to erect a building with a total area  of 1.5 million square meters, including 200,000 square meters of  residences.    It is planned to continue reconstruction of the buildings of  the Moscow Kremlin, construction of a business center on  Stankevich Street, reconstruction of Manezhe Square and  buildings of the Manege with the organization of an underground  space, a multifunctional business center on Tverskaya-Yamskaya  Street, and reconstruction of Stoleshnik Lane and zoo facilities.    Construction will be continued on new subway lines.    In the first half of the year, the Bibirevo-Altufyevskaya  line will be put into operation, and construction of the  Lublinskaya and Mitinskaya lines will be accelerated.    For the purpose of increasing the amount of telephone  numbers  and improving the quality of telephone communications, it is  planned to build four ATS [automatic telephone exchange]  buildings in the Central, Southeastern, Western, and  Southwestern administrative districts.    To finance the investment program under conditions of an  acute shortage of budgetary resources the government intends to  expand the use of nonbudgetary sources. For these purposes there  will be continuation of the practice of selling at investment  auctions parts of newly built housing areas, "unfinished" sites,  and also trade and everyday service facilities whose  construction has been completed.    For the purpose of reducing the periods and lowering the  cost  of housing construction, competitions will be conducted between  contracting organizations for the right to perform the work.    The government is actively starting to implement the  concepts  of the administrative districts to replace obsolete housing  assets at the expense of investor resources, first of all  five-story buildings.  <H5>  V. </H5>   The government believes that an increase in the reliability  of the life support systems of the city is the paramount task of  municipal services.    For this purpose, it is planned:    --to increase the volume of major housing repairs and  complete up to 2.5 million square meters (including 0.5 at the  expense of investor resources);    --to increase the volume of major and routine road repairs,  and to complete up to 20 million square meters;    --to conduct repair, reorganization, and reconstruction of  engineering networks:    heating system--350 kilometers    central heating centers--300 units    waterline system--89 kilometers    sewer system--93 kilometers    gas system--100 kilometers    streetcar lines--70 kilometers    --to acquire not less than 680 units of rolling stock for  the  system of overland passenger service.    In the consumer market sphere the government plans to  support  the ongoing system of providing incentives for delivery of basic  food products to the city, to strengthen direct ties with  regional producers of agricultural products, and to switch to a  system of contracts with wholesale suppliers of foodstuffs.    Through its tax, credit, and investment policy, the  government intends to promote stabilization and a reduction in  Moscow's industrial slump. The food industry, the production of  building materials and building structures, and the production  of consumer goods will remain priorities. Economic incentives  will be implemented to attract nonstate investors to these  branches.    The fund for support of small business will be used to  stimulate small business, first and foremost that which produces  goods and services for the population.    It is planned to continue implementation of the city program  "Conversion," shifting emphasis to financing the preparation of  production of machines and instruments developed in the defense  complex of the city of Moscow for municipal services.  <H5>  VI. </H5>   The government will strive in 1994 to make changes in the  conditions of privatization of state enterprises so that  privatization will promote an increase in the efficiency of  production, improvement in the efficiency of services to the  population, and attraction of additional resources for  stabilization of the economy and the reconstruction of  production.    The Government of Moscow also intends to actively use its  right to retain for itself part of the package of shares of  stock (including "gold" shares) of enterprises being privatized  that are most important to the city.    In the sphere of lease relations and land payments, a  complex  of measures has been outlined to increase the profitability of  these budget articles.    In the sphere of tax policy and the budget process, it is  planned to prepare a number of legislative initiatives aimed at  reducing taxes on profits and increasing taxes on real estate  and resources, and also at achieving more just proportions of  distribution of city and federal incomes and expenditures.    In the sphere of improving administration, it is planned to  continue the policy for further optimization of the distribution  of functions between city and territorial organs of  administration for the purpose of reducing the share of  administrative decisions on the part of the government.    It is planned to develop and conduct measures for the  development of local public self-government.  <H5>  VII. </H5>   In adopting this program, the Government of Moscow believes  that in the course of its implementation there must be a  continuous search for reserves to improve city development  indicators, first and foremost in the resolution of social tasks.    The Government of Moscow, realizing that successful  implementation of the program in many ways depends on the  formation of the income part of the city budget, calls on the  Government of Russia to make decisions within its power on  immediate support of the economy of Moscow through deductions  from taxes being paid by administrative systems on the territory  of the city and also payment in full of subventions for the  performance of capital functions.    Taking into account the preparations for the celebration of  the 850th anniversary of Moscow, a special program has been  adopted as a supplement to the government's annual program.    In the interests of the prosperity of the capital of  Russia--Moscow--and the well-being of its residents, and in the  interests of social peace, the Government of Moscow calls on  trade union organizations and social movements, political  parties and blocs, entrepreneurs--everyone who holds a position  of creativity and stability in society--to cooperate.</p>

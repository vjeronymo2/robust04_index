			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> XII. Guidance to Applicants for Treatability Variances for As-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generated Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency's existing regulations provide for variances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from treatment standards if a waste cannot be treated to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified treatment standard or if the treatment technology on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the standard is based is inappropriate for the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 268.44 (a). For guidance on treatability variances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soil, including site-specific, non-rulemaking variances, see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.E. ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Soil'' in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. To be granted a treatability variance, a petitioner must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show that ``because the physical or chemical properties of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste differs significantly from wastes analyzed in developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels or by the specified methods.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A demonstration that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste cannot be successfully treated can be made ``by showing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that attempts to treat the waste by available technologies were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not successful, or through appropriate analyses of the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which demonstrate that the waste cannot be treated to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified levels.'' 51 FR at 40606 (Nov. 7, 1986). EPA evaluates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatability variance requests by ``first look[ing] at the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and operation of the treatment system being used. If EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the technology and operation are consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BDAT, the Agency will evaluate the waste to determine if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste matrix and/or physical parameters are such [that] the BDAT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly reflects treatment of the waste.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The guidance set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out below applies exclusively to treatability variances (for as-generated wastes) evaluated by EPA headquarters and processed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to rulemaking procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to settle a lawsuit challenging the Agency's grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of treatability variances to two particular facilities, 56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12351 (March 25, 1991), the Agency has agreed to provide some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying guidance regarding treatability variances, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essentially restates existing Agency practice and does not call  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into question the validity of any treatability variance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has issued. First, as stated in 1986, to support an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a treatability variance pursuant to &sect;268.44(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for process waste, the applicant should collect and analyze a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient number of samples of the untreated waste to accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize it. 51 FR at 40606 (Nov. 7, 1986). In general, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency would expect the applicant to collect and analyze four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples of its untreated and treated waste. (This corresponds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum number of samples applicants for delisting pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 260.20 must submit.) However, the exact number of samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be determined by EPA as part of the Agency's evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each treatability variance application (and so could be less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four samples in a particular case).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the applicant should normally investigate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report on demonstrated and reasonably available pretreatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps that could significantly improve the effectiveness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment the applicant is conducting. 51 FR at 40606. What the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has in mind is that applicants not overlook potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple types of pretreatment to remove an interfering parameter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for example, settling to reduce excess total dissolved solids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not intend that applicants perform an extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or expansive engineering analysis. Nor does the Agency intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that applicants be required to utilize treatment systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly different from those the Agency evaluated when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating the treatment standard. Rather, the Agency wishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure that applicants not overlook some relatively obvious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of removing interferences. Again, in particular cases, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not make sense to conduct this type of analysis, in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case no such evaluation would be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the applicant should make a good faith effort to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explain why the treatment standard is not achievable for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste. 51 FR at 40606. This good faith effort is to be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant's knowledge of its process, and is not to entail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional expense (such as a consultant's engineering analysis).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a general matter, the Agency simply believes that some thought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be given (and documented) as to what might be causing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA's general policy has been and will be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish a notice of its proposed decision on applications for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatability variances in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , &sect;261.44 (e), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow a minimum of 30 days for the public to comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. 51 FR 40607. All applicants will have the opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comment on the reasonableness of applying one or more of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foregoing statements of guidance to their applications, and, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, EPA may decide not to apply them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

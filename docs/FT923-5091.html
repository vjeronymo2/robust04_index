			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Police urge arrests in Collor scandal THE HEAD of the police inquiry into the corruption scandal currently rocking Brazil yesterday called for the arrests of some of the key figures. Mr Paulo Lacerda last night recommended to a federal judge in Brasilia the preventative imprisonment of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the friend and former campaign treasurer of President Fernando Collor, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr Collor's former private secretary. Mr Lacerda said the arrests were necessary because they were obstructing his inquiries. Mr Farias was the subject of a three-month congressional investigation, which concluded last week, accusing him of running a multi-million dollar kickback scheme. The report directly implicated Mr Collor, leading to the initiation this week of the country's first ever impeachment proceedings. Last night, Mr Farias denied that he was not co-operating with police inquiries and said that he was 'absolutely tranquil'. Earlier in the day, the last pillar of support for Mr Collor collapsed with the decision by the main pro-government party to free their congressmen to vote in favour of Mr Collor's impeachment. The announcement by the Liberal Front (PFL) coincided with the publication of a poll showing that more than half the population thinks Mr Collor should quit over the corruption charges. The poll, by Ibope, the official government polling agency, found that 69 per cent of respondents no longer trust Mr Collor and 59 per cent think that he should resign. The PFL decision was taken early yesterday after a meeting attended by four government ministers. Only one minister spoke in Mr Collor's favour, and Mr Marco Maciel, leader of the government in the Senate, announced that he was quitting, compounding the president's isolation. Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, announced he would offer his resignation immediately after an impeachment vote by the lower house of congress, whatever its outcome. But the resignation offer by Mr Moreira and the rest of the cabinet was seen as a formality. Mr Collor now seems unlikely to withstand the impeachment process set in motion on Tuesday. To survive he will need the support of one-third of Congress, or 168 deputies, in a vote expected to be held later this month. He has been counting on the 120 votes of the PFL. His own party has only 23 members. His justice minister was quoted by Brazilian press as saying: 'To resign would not be a cowardly act.' The PFL leadership has been under increasing pressure from members to drop its pro-Collor stance because of fears that its candidates will suffer in October's municipal elections. However, the party is a fierce opponent of Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president, who would take office in the event of Mr Collor's ousting. Mr Hugo Napoleao, president of the PFL, said yesterday: 'In the end we decided we had to allow people to vote according to their conscience.' Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, the president of Congress, met political leaders yesterday to create a 30-40 member commission which will sit for 10 days to discuss whether to approve the impeachment request. If it does, Mr Collor will then have 20 days to defend himself before a congressional vote. However, the president's legal team plans to contest the process, capitalising on confusion created by the fact that the part of the 1988 constitution referring to impeachment has not yet been ratified.</p>

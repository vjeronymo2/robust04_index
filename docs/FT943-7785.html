			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Sport: The Foxes show some sharp teeth - Cricket / Teresa McLean visits Leicester to investigate the year's surprise county Funny county, Leicestershire. I have never had much sense of its cricketing character, except perhaps as a bit of the Midlands enlivened for a while by David Gower, but basically quiet. This season their cricket, especially their batting, has been more successful than in recent years. Their captain, Nigel Briers, reached his 1,000 runs for the season last weekend, whereas neither he nor anyone else in the county got 1,000 runs last season. Though fragile in one-day matches, Leicestershire are a close second in the county championship. I am always reluctant to mention such things to county executives. Their eyes light up and they release floods of favourable statistics about their team. But Leicestershire have had a fine season which no one expected and I did not blame their chief executive, Tony Norman, for his delight in it. He attributed it above all to Phil Simmons, their West Indian opening batsman, a clever replacement for fast bowler Winston Benjamin. 'He has charisma; a great team man,' said Norman happily from his balcony at Grace Road last Saturday, as we watched Simmons dismissed for nought in his second innings against Worcestershire. His batting has been variable since its sensational start with a double century against neighbours and rivals, Northamptonshire. Last weekend his loose, impatient shots did nothing to improve his county average of 42, but he batted, bowled and fielded whole-heartedly. He is a tall, muscular man and a powerful presence on the field. He ia also a good-humoured presence off the field, signing autographs, chatting and joining in the club's many social events, everything from barn dances to barbecues. It will be interesting to see how Leicestershire fare with Hansie Cronje instead of Simmons next year. By then Cronje will be used to English conditions. At Leicester he has a brother-in-law, all-rounder Gordon Parsons, who is enjoying an exceptionally good season. It was Leicestershire's cricket manager, Jack Birkenshaw, who spotted Cronje's talent while coaching Orange Free State in South Africa during the winter. After Mike Turner, who ran the club, resigned amid great turmoil, Birkenshaw was given what Norman described as 'a totally free hand in dealing with the cricket side of things' and wasted no time in bringing his experience to bear on the county's problems of mediocrity. Last Saturday was 'former players' day at Grace Road. During breaks in play, former players were introduced to the crowd one by one from an upper balcony. The strongest applause went to recent wicket-keeper Roger Tolchard and, above all, to Birkenshaw, who is a local hero. Such are the recruiting and coaching skills of Birkenshaw and Russell Cobbs, who runs the new Grace Road indoor cricket school, that this year Leicestershire have excelled the exotic elements of other counties and boast a young Afghani player, Alangir Sheriyar, in their second eleven. He is a 21-year-old bowler, born in Birmingham, of Afghani stock. In last Sunday's Axa and Equity Law League game against Worcestershire, which Leicestershire lost by two runs, their best innings was the 53 scored by 20-year-old Darren Maddy, with some strong, straight strokes. There was quite a corps of young players; it looked as if Leicestershire were taking the chance of the Sunday League to give them a taste of the big time. I have never thought of Grace Road as a big-time ground. I have always found it slightly forlorn and too spread out, with low rows of empty seats. Now the smart new stand, which has hospitality boxes upstairs and the new indoor cricket school below, fills in most of the open side opposite the pavilion. New stand, new paint, new flowers dotted about - the only casualty is the stretch of ground once free for childrens' cricket, which is much smaller these days. Grace Road is now Leicestershire's only home ground, because the county found it made more money from its matches there than at other grounds, and because, as Norman put it, 'no one in the county lives more than 45 minutes away from Leicester, so we do not need another one'. Closing outlying grounds is always a pity and though the reasons are understandable they are bleak. The club have awarded groundsman Sol Spence a benefit year this year, shared with Parsons - a thoughtful show of appreciation by Leicestershire. The wicket last weekend was dry and its high, flighty bounce helped the bowlers to take 13 wickets on Saturday. On Monday, David Millns took six for 84, demolishing Worcestershire's second innings and bringing his season's total to nearly 60, the product of determined, accurate work. Alan Mullally, his opening partner, has done less well but Vince Wells, like Parsons, has come into his own with both bat and ball. Spin looks like Leicestershire's weak spot, but their mood is confident and they told me they have great hopes of their young off-spinner Tim Mason, a good England under-19 player, recovering from injury in time to spin them to success next year. What about this year? Wells smiled when I asked him. 'Obviously everyone hopes for the number one spot. That is the aim you go out with. I still believe you make your own luck, but you need a bit of luck on the way as well.' Before this season no one would have given Leicestershire a hope of challenging for the County Championship, but they have worked hard at making luck for themselves, throughout the club. Their sandwiches are grim. The stuffed foxes looking down on the cafes and bars from glass cases are an acquired taste. But the staff are friendly. The county has cut the cost of membership and launched lots of events throughout the year for members. Membership is larger and jollier and the cricket has prospered. Wells, an import from Kent, gave me an inside view of the club: 'Here the team are very much friends outside of cricket as well. Everybody sticks closely together. Apart from Phil we have not got any star players and I think perhaps when the going does get tough it is nice that we can get back to that unit and put things in order. And anyway Phil is brilliant. He fits into the side superbly. We are very lucky.'</p>

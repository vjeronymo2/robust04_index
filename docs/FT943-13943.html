			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Sport: Faldo struggles to assert his rights - Golf / Can the old guard be seen handing over to the new at the Open championship at Turnberry? It was all so simple a few years ago. If the Open was held in Scotland then the winner would be Nick Faldo. It happened in 1987 at Muirfield, at St Andrews in 1990, and again at Muirfield two years ago. Faldo's right to be considered the dominant player of the age was made in Scotland. It was to Scotland he came last week to assert that right once more. He faced the most onerous task. The imperious aura with which he surrounded himself at the start of the decade has evaporated and the lesson of the past is that once gone, it rarely returns. Think of Tom Watson, winner of five Opens between 1977 and 1984, but none since. Think of Arnold Palmer, who won all his eight major championships in a similarly bountiful six-year period. Faldo also won two Masters in his five-year span of mastery that began in 1987 but what was also significant was the number of other opportunities that he gave himself to win. From 1989 to 1992, Faldo never finished outside the top 20 in any major championship. Last year, he challenged Greg Norman every step of the way at Sandwich, before eventually settling for runner's up spot, and again at the USPGA championship, where he finished third. But the old consistency was missing for the first time, with poor performances at the Masters where he finished 39th, and the US Open, where he tied for 72nd place. This year, it is that trend that has continued. Last month, Faldo missed the cut in the US Open, the first time he had suffered such ignominy in 28 major championships. He had gone to the event a week before it had been due to start - for this is the event, above all others, that he would most like to win. That rude awakening, though, was as nothing to what happened to Faldo on the first day here at Turnberry. We all know Faldo's characteristics: examine every detail; leave nothing to chance. Faldo's first task for his caddie, Fanny Sunesson, after appointing her, was to send her to Florida for a fortnight to learn about his swing from his coach, David Leadbetter. Faldo would be the last player, then, who you would expect to play a wrong ball, yet that is what he did on the 17th hole in the first round. After hitting his drive into the rough, he did not even check the ball's markings; he just went up to it, and hit it. It was the sort of error that would make a beginner blush, let alone the man whose philosophy towards the game is dictated by its meticulousness. His 75 was the worst he has scored in an Open in relation to par since the last time the championship was played here in 1986. Faldo's playing partner in the first two rounds was Ernie Els, and it was hard not to think of this as a meeting between the old guard and the new. It was the first time they had played together since the young South African's win in the US Open. Els is just 24; Faldo will be 37 on Monday. Faldo is strong but Els stronger. At times at Turnberry on Thursday the latter was out-driving the former by 40 yards. While Faldo went through all his fidgety routines, Els just stood up to the ball and hit it. Where Faldo was plagued by hesitancy and self-doubt on the greens, Els suffered no such problems. Faldo believes his swing is better now than when he was lapping the field, but the results sheet betrays his remarks. At least it did until yesterday, when a second-round 66 deflected some of the anguish and was three shots better than his partner Els could manage. For such a proud, intense man, the frustration of such inconsistency must be horrific and fully explains why he looks so miserable these days. His expression hardly changed at Turnberry - just this side of manic depression. It was hard not to come to the conclusion that the only thing Faldo has left on Els is experience and increasingly that it would prove no protection at all. The mechanical nature of Faldo's swing contrasted sharply with Els's natural rhythm. Many believe that Faldo would be better off if he had six months away from the man he calls 'Lead', his coach Leadbetter, whom he seems to consult about everything. A time to be Lead-free perhaps? Faldo was left to battle against missing the cut for the first time in an Open, which was hardly the contest he had in mind at the start of the event. With yesterday's 66, Faldo at least has a platform. But what a critical weekend this is for him, and the odds are against the restoration of his pre-eminence. Indeed, as he and Els shook hands on the 18th yesterday it was hard not to see the symbolism in this gesture. A handshake to signal the exchange of power?</p>

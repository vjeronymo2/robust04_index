Vlasov under </F> the rubric "Space Science for the National Economy": "The  Gonets of 'SmalSat'"]    [Text] The development and adoption of satellite  communications systems using geostationary orbits and small  ground receiving stations is underway in many of the developed  countries. Even the smallest stations, however, have antennas  that are one to three meters in diameter, weigh several dozen  kilograms and cost 20,000--50,000 dollars, as well as requiring  skilled servicing and being inaccessible to the mass user.  Further improvements in the characteristics of the ground  terminals and provision for their widespread accessibility are  possible only by making the satellites substantially more  complicated, giving them antennas on the order of 30 meters in  diameter, power consumption of several kilowatts, mass of four  to six tonnes and expensive means of launch.    Broad research has been launched of late to create space  communications systems using low-orbital satellites located much  closer to the Earth than geostationary ones, requiring smaller  power expenditures for the transmission of messages on the part  of both the spacecraft and the ground stations. This would make  it possible to provide communications between personal terminals  that are close in complexity, dimension and weight  characteristics to police mobile communications sets.    All of the low-orbit space communications systems that are  now being developed can be divided into systems for the packet  transmission of data and radio-telephone communications. They  are distinguished by the services offered and the complexity of  technical realization.    The former group includes such systems as the Gonets  project,  developed by the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] of Thermal  Processes (Moscow) and the NPO [Scientific-Production  Association] of Applied Mechanics (Krasnoyarsk). The customer is  the SmalSat Intersector Business Association. The system should  unfold in stages, will enter service in 1994-96 and will make it  possible to transmit any messages in digital form (telex, text  or image), exchange information between databases and computers  and gather information from environmental monitoring systems or  personal queries of subscribers, as well as determine the  location of a mobile terminal and transmit that information to  the center.    Some waiting time for a communications session could be  permitted when offering services through this system, and strict  demands will not be posed for the promptness of information  transmission. An orbital group of satellites without a complex  system for orientation and stabilization is thus not used when  it is deployed. This makes it possible to refrain from using  engine installations on the spacecraft, and to employ the  simplest (gravitational) single-axis orientation system. The  number of craft in the system is determined by the parameters of  the orbit and the time for the waiting and delivery of  information. The satellites are distributed on six orbital  planes that are spread equally across the longitudes of the  ascending node. The group could be controlled from a single  point.    The 312--315 MHz and 387--390 MHz low-frequency bands  allotted for the Gonets system, and the circular orbits at  altitudes of 1,300--1,500 km that were selected, make it  possible to employ wide-beam antennas with a gain of up to three  decibels and transmitters with a power of 2--10 watts on the  spacecraft.    The packet mode of data transmission, first of all, makes it  possible to conserve power for the satellite and the receiving  station and, second and most importantly, to conduct the  communications sessions over brief time intervals using one  satellite, without coordinating the operations of regional  stations for session times. This simplifies considerably the  organization of communications.    The adoption of these principles for structuring the  low-orbital system of data transmission had the following  results. The Gonets is indeed small and inexpensive. The low  weight of the satellite (220 kg) and low orbits make it possible  to arrange the orbital group by means of the simultaneous launch  of six craft by a single Tsiklon launch vehicle. This determined  the low cost of creating the space segment. The ground terminals  make it possible to allow untrained support, and are oriented  toward the user, cheap and do not require a far-flung  infrastructure of ground communications lines.    Communications are conducted in close to real time within a  region whose diameter is less than 5,000 km (the radio  visibility footprint of one satellite). This occurs as follows.  The spacecraft periodically emits a marker signal that contains  the technological information necessary for a subscriber to  establish communications (Fig. 1). During a time interval when  the whole region is in the zone of radio visibility of the  satellite, an address flag of the given region appears in the  marker signal and the stationary (AT-S) and mobile (AT)  terminals exchange information between themselves (the waiting  time for a communications session is no more than 20 minutes,  with a probability of 0.8). The address flag can be formed by  computer gear on the spacecraft or a regional station (RS). The  latter method is simpler, and has been adopted in the Gonets  system.          If the subscribers are in different regions, the information  is transmitted in the "space mail" mode. The message transmitted  to the satellite is recorded and transmitted to the recipient  when he appears in the zone of radio visibility of the  spacecraft. The average time to deliver information in that case  does not exceed three to six hours.    The Gonets system provides for determination of the position  of mobile subscribers, and the transmission of that information  to the centers of the corresponding services. Two variations are  possible. The use of terminals from the Glonass or GPS  navigational systems is necessary for mobile targets that  require determination of the geographical coordinates with a  precision of a few meters. The terminals are hooked up using the  standard RS-232 interface. If a precision of just 1--7  kilometers is required, the Gonets terminal is employed  directly; it performs calculations based on measurements of the  Doppler frequencies at several points in the satellite orbit and  the current parameters of its movement.    The launch of two experimental Gonets-D satellites was made  on 13 July 1992 in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the  Gonets system and to try out the principles of its operation.  The experimental system can currently function successfully in  the mode of regional communications between the cities of  Cheboksary--Izhevsk--Moscow, as well as in the "space mail" mode  between Melbourne and Moscow. The launch of six Gonets-D1   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-10A>           Fig. 1. </FIG>  experimental satellites in 1993 is being proposed to offer  services to actual users.    The class of low-orbital systems for radio-telephone  communications includes the Gonets-R project, which in addition  to the indicated services provides for the exchange of voice  messages with the use of personal radio-telephones.    The specific nature of the structure of the low-orbital  systems of radio-telephone communications is determined by the  requirement for uninterrupted support for users in real time.  The orbital group should provide a constant scan of a service  zone of the Earth's surface with a probability of no worse than  0.995 accordingly.    These features require the use of an orbital group of  controllable satellites, the realization of a three-axis  orientation system on the spacecraft and equipping them with  engines. These craft turn out to be complex and expensive, and  weigh no less than 400 kg. The group has to be controlled from  several points, while the assurance of uninterrupted  communications would require a large quantity of regional  stations with expensive switching equipment. The cost of the  system, according to some estimates, would exceed the cost of  the packet data transmission system by 10--100 times.    Great interest is being displayed in low-orbital  radio-telephone communications systems around the world. This is  caused by the fact that cellular telephony systems using  personal radio telephones, by and large, function in regions  with medium or high population density and cannot offer their  services in other regions, as well as to means of transport that  are traveling across enormous territories.    The number of users of a low-orbital radio-telephone  communications system, according to the estimates of experts,  could reach several millions by the year 2000. This is roughly  100 times less than the number of users of cellular telephone  systems. They will thus not be competing with the cellular  telephone systems, but rather supplementing them.    Taking this into account, it is essential that the technical  gear be compatible with cellular telephony and voice  communications that are accomplished through personal or  portable radio telephones. The maximum utilization of the proven   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-11A>           Fig. 2. </FIG>  technologies of cellular systems will reduce the cost of  creating the system as a whole, and will provide additional  conveniences for the users.    The requirement for global servicing of users in real time  could be met with the use of intersatellite communications  channels in the system, or the means of other systems without  them. The choice of method is made proceeding from the traffic  (intensity) of user operations. Up to 90 percent of the traffic,  as a rule, lies in a service zone of the Earth's surface of  4,000--5,000 km in diameter, and the variation for arranging the  communications system without intersatellite channels is  preferable.    The placement of a regional station in each such region is  required, in that case, to support communications (Fig. 2); it  maintains communications with all of the satellites covering the  given region with their antenna patterns. The regional station  links the subscribers of the system with each other through  satellite channels within the given region, as well as provides  connections with the subscribers of other regions or with  subscribers of general-use networks by involving the means of  other systems.          This organization of communications assumes that all of the  subscriber connections are made through the regional station.  The relay on the satellite should be without signal demodulation  and decoding therein. The spacecraft is simplified, and various  regions can operate with various coordinating devices (network  protocols), providing an opportunity to utilize all existing  switching equipment and simplify the creation of the system.    The SmalSat Association is currently studying questions of  creating the low-orbital Gonets-R radio-telephone communications  system using the indicated principles. The following preliminary  results have been obtained. The space segment should consist of  an adjustable orbital group of 45 satellites located on five  planes of nine spacecraft each. The planes are 36 apart in  ascending node longitude, and are polar circular orbits at an  altitude of 1,500 km. The orbital group selected will provide  for continuous coverage of a global service zone with an  elevation of 10 with a probability of no less than 0.995.  The satellites will have a mass of no more than 950 kg, an  average energy consumption of 640 watts per orbit and an active  existence of five years. A thirteen-beam antenna system with a  gain of 8--13.5 decibels will be used on the spacecraft with  subscriber radio lines (15--16 GHz band), while those with trunk  radio lines (11--14 GHz band) will have a wide-beam antenna  system with a gain of up to six decibels.    The parameters of the orbital group and the satellite will  support the operation of 24,500--28,080 digital voice channels  (546-624 per craft) with an information speed of 6.5 kB/sec in a  frequency band of 5.5--11.7 MHz for subscriber radio lines and  38.5--81.9 MHz for trunk lines. The system will employ  multiple-station access with time (MDRR) and frequency (MDChR)  channel separation. The number of carrier frequencies on all  radio lines is 39.    The Gonets-R system could go into service in 1997-2000, but  additional study aimed at confirming its economic expediency is  required before a final decision is made.

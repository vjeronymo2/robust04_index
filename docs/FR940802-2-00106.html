These devices test for the presence of alcohol, and may use breath or other bodily fluids, such as saliva, to do so. NHTSA is establishing these specifications to support State laws that target youthful offenders (i.e., ``zero tolerance'' laws) and the Department of Transportation's regulations on Alcohol Misuse Prevention, and in recognition of industry efforts to develop new technologies (e.g., non-breath devices) that measure alcohol content from bodily fluids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Conforming Products List (CPL) will be published identifying the devices that meet NHTSA's Model Specifications. The CPL can serve as a guide for those interested in purchasing devices that screen for the presence of alcohol. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Model Specifications established by this notice become effective August 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Lori A. Miller, Office of Alcohol and State Programs, NTS&hyph;21, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone (202) 366&hyph;9835. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On December 15, 1992 (57 FR 59382), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to implement the ``Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991,'' which requires alcohol testing programs in the aviation, motor carrier, rail, and mass transit industries. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) proposed similar regulations for the pipeline industry. In general, the NPRM proposed to prohibit covered employees from performing safety-sensitive functions when test results indicate alcohol concentration levels of 0.04 or greater. The NPRM proposed to apply slightly different consequences to employees having alcohol concentration levels of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine alcohol concentration, the NPRM proposed to use breath as measured by those evidential breath testing devices (EBTs) listed on NHTSA's Conforming Products List (CPL) which are capable of providing a printed result, sequentially numbering the tests conducted, and distinguishing alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 BAC level. EBT's listed on NHTSA's CPL have been tested and determined to meet the agency's Model Specifications for EBTs, which were last amended on September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48705). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a final rule published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7340), DOT amended its regulations and added procedures for conducting alcohol testing in transportation workplaces (49 CFR Part 40). This final rule differed from the NPRM in a number of respects. The final rule required the use of breath testing devices listed on the CPL for EBTs. For screening devices, it permitted the use of EBTs on the CPL that do not print the result, but only if confirmation tests are conducted using EBTs listed on the CPL which are capable of providing a printed result. (These devices must also be capable of distinguishing alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 BAC level and sequentially numbering the tests conducted.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA published a separate notice in the same issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 7372) proposing to adopt Model Specifications and a CPL that would permit additional alcohol testing devices to be used for screening purposes. In its notice, NHTSA proposed to establish Model Specifications for alcohol screening devices, which differ from the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing devices in a number of important respects. It stated that the proposed Model Specifications are designed to test whether devices are suitable for screening, not evidential, purposes and that they are designed to test the performance of devices that may use bodily fluids other than breath (such as saliva) to determine the presence of alcohol. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA requested comments on these proposed Model Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

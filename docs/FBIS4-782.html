			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   ANC's Economic Plan -- The financing of the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) "is certainly in  the realm of the possible," says a page-12 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 15 April. Higher economic  growth could provide "at least R(rand)3 billion," and cutting  the defense budget "may yield R2 billion -- though many wonder  just how much more can be pared from that bone that is needed  for policing." However, "hard-nosed local and foreign  businessmen may still find the lack of financial detail  puzzling; likewise the promises of no tax increases and a tight  reign on the deficit. True, overall taxation may not increase  but that doesn't exclude juggling around with an increased tax  burden on the wealthy while lifting that on the poor." "The  ANC's admission that it doesn't yet have all the answers and  won't be prescriptive is heartening. So is the softening of the  populist rhetoric of the first few RDP drafts. Still, there  remains too much emphasis on the role of the State and  insufficient recognition of how the market economy works. But  much of this could change after the election."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Irresponsible To Boycott Elections, Encourage War Talk --  "The dangers facing the holding of elections increase by the  day," begins a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 15 April. "No mediation in our view will now solve  the problem. What the country needs at this late hour are low  profile attempts at bringing the contending parties closer. It  is difficult even at individual level to think that one of the  option is to sit the whole thing out and do nothing. It is even  more irresponsible to encourage war talk." The "black  population" is paying for the mistakes of the past "in lives  lost every day, a situation that is likely to increase  dramatically in the next two weeks. It is for this reason that  we are forced to continue trying in whatever way possible to  bring about peace."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Election `Issues' -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp;  GUARDIAN in  English for 15-21 April says in a page-14 editorial "it is worth  trying to cut through the agency-created images and slip-off-the  tongue slogans and focus attention on the real issues of the  election. Among them are: "Who can deliver on the promises of  socio-economic reform," peace, human rights, good governance,  and gender issues? However, "there are some `issues' one can  readily dismiss. The National Party [NP] is trying to make an  issue of the ANC's alliance with the SA Communist Party -- old  Reds in the bed campaigning that is peripheral to this election.  The NP is also trying to make much of its own experience and  skills, in contrast to the ANC's lack; but to take this  seriously you have to forget that most of the NP's experience is  in segregating, repressing, removing houses, destroying  education and facilitating corruption. You also have to swallow  the fact that if the NP's opposition lacks experience, its  because the NP ruthlessly prevented anyone from getting that  experience."</p>

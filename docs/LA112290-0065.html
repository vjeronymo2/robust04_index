			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN IS CONVICTED OF HELPING TO KILL GIRL  </P> <P> Jurors on Wednesday convicted a woman of second-degree murder for her part in  helping a drifter kill a Chatsworth girl and shoot and sexually assault her  companion.  </P> <P> But the San Fernando Superior Court jury acquitted Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, of  first-degree murder, sparing her from possible death in the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Ramos sat expressionless as the clerk read the eight verdicts, reached after  eight days of deliberations.  </P> <P> The kidnaping took place as the girls were walking in their Chatsworth  neighborhood to meet several friends at the corner of Devonshire Street and  Lurline Avenue. Ramos emerged from the camper and asked them to help her start  it. After they entered the vehicle, Ramos' companion, Raymond Comtois, abducted  them at gunpoint, the surviving victim, who was 13 at the time, testified.  </P> <P> Comtois shot both girls. One died instantly, but the other survived because her  upraised hand deflected the bullet. Comtois, 61, was sentenced in July to die  in the gas chamber.  </P></p>

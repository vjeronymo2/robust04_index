			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The recent package of  presidential economic decrees was caused by the government's  inability to achieve the quick adoption of economic bills at the  State Duma, Russian Vice-Premier and Minister of Economy  Aleksandr Shokhin told a news conference here today.    The government had to ask the president to approve measures  necessary for further economic reforms by his decrees, said  Shokhin.    "We plan to use presidential decrees and government  resolutions for swift reaction to Russian economic processes,"  stressed the vice-premier. "Another package of presidential  decrees will soon be signed". The package will include the  prepared draft presidential decrees on sales of  enterprises-debtors and regulation of the consumption fund of  enterprises, as well as the decrees under elaboration on legal  basis of foreign economic activities (to eliminate personal  benefits in this sphere) and regulation of banking activities.    The president is ready for joint and quick solution of major  economic problems, stressed Shokhin.</p>

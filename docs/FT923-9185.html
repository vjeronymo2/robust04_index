			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Courts urged to speed up recovery of bad debts PLANS AIMED at halving the time courts take to deal with bad debt cases are to be presented to the government next week by the Confederation of British Industry. The proposals would mean the establishment of special debt recovery tribunals under the aegis of the High Court. County courts would be bypassed, except for the very smallest claims. The CBI is highly critical of the time taken to process bad debt cases - undefended cases take about 60 days in the High Court and 114 days in the county court. These figures could be cut to about 38 days, the CBI says. For defended cases, the time taken could be cut to 66 days from 100 days in the High Court and 128 in the county court. A CBI survey last year found that nearly 60 per cent of small businesses were finding late payment of bills and bad debts a significant hindrance. Nearly 20 per cent said they were at risk of failing because of the problem. Court procedures for recovery of debts are so cumbersome that some businesses are deliberately delaying payment, says the CBI, and 'feeling they can get away with it'. Payments to one in five businesses regularly exceed 75 days according to the CBI research. The latest proposals for speeding court procedures are due to be submitted by the CBI's smaller firms council to the lord chancellor's department and to Baroness Denton, small firms minister, early next week. The plans have been drawn up in conjunction with Davies Arnold Cooper, the City firm of solicitors. The CBI is also proposing the greater use of incentives for court officials to recover debts. Mr Richard Brucciani, CBI smaller firms council chairman, said yesterday that, under the present system, High Court sheriffs who were paid according to results 'are far more effective than county court bailiffs who are paid a fixed salary'. A Pounds 500 ceiling for county court bad debt claims should be set, says the CBI, with larger claims pushed into the High Court 'where better results can be achieved'. It should also be possible to start legal action without first sending a solicitor's letter, argues the CBI.</p>

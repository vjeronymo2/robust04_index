			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur says that  there are doubts about the implementation of autonomy. There  have been shooting incidents with casualties, and there is a  feeling that the situation is unclear and that working patterns  have as yet to be established. The deputy defense minister made  these observations during a visit to the Qatif Bloc on the first  day of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment.    Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  referring to 'Arafat's remarks in South Africa, Deputy Minister  Gur said the PLO chief's conduct was beyond any political or  human ethics, and was inexcusable. He did not believe, however,  that the agreement was in any danger.    Tzvi Handel, head of the Hof 'Aza Regional Council, told the  deputy minister that a car stolen yesterday from the Eley Sinai  settlement was today found in the possession of a Palestinian  policeman.</p>

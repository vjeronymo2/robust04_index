			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOSEMITE DEAL DESCRIBED AS MCA 'LOOTING';  </P> <P> PARKS: THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY PAID THE U.S. $635,000 IN CONCESSIONS FEES LAST  YEAR, AN AMOUNT ENVIRONMENTALISTS TERM INADEQUATE.  </P> <P> Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. paid the government a $635,000 fee last year for  the exclusive right to provide lodging, food and other services in the popular  Sierra Nevada park, a virtual monopoly that brought in record proceeds of at  least $84.7 million.  </P> <P> The National Park Service revealed the fee Monday in response to media  inquiries. In January, when the Park Service for the first time disclosed  previous annual fees, the information led to charges that Yosemite was being  milked for profits at a time when the park's staff was being cut back.  </P> <P> The figure for sales was not provided by the Park Service but was calculated  based on the contract that governs concessions at Yosemite. The fee is 0.75% of  annual sales from hotel rooms, meals, souvenirs and other guest services  provided by Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., a subsidiary of entertainment giant  MCA Inc.  </P> <P> Based on the formula, environmental groups estimated Monday that the company's  Yosemite Valley operations took in at least $84.7 million in 1989. In the past  three years, the company has paid $1.7 million in fees and -- based on the  formula for setting the fee -- taken in at least $236.8 million  </P> <P> "What it shows is that the public is getting the bad end of the deal," said  Patricia Schifferle, western regional director of the Wilderness Society. "The  concessionaire is basically looting the treasury."  </P> <P> Daniel Jensen, executive vice president of Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co.,  declined Monday to confirm the figures. But he said, "We think we're a pretty  darn good company."  </P> <P> The Wilderness Society, joined by other environmental groups, is trying to form  a nonprofit corporation to bid against Yosemite Park &amp; Curry when the park  contract expires in 1993.  </P> <P> Schifferle said Monday that federal law makes it difficult for a competitor to  wrest the contract away from existing concessionaires. But she said the  Wilderness Society and other groups believe that the exclusive contract has  given too much power to the company, which has been owned by MCA since 1973.  </P> <P> "It's basically a question of who's in charge of the park, the Park Service or  MCA?" Schifferle said.  </P> <P> The yearly fee was set in a 30-year contract signed in 1963 that was intended  to ensure the survival of the park's longtime family-owned concessionaire, the  Curry Co. The terms were inherited by MCA when it took over the contract, and  the company has resisted National Park Service efforts to renegotiate.  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Yosemite Park Supt. Michael Finley have  called the fee absurdly low and said it should be raised in the next  concessions contract. But Finley said an increase would not necessarily relieve  budget woes at Yosemite since by law the fees are paid into the general U.S.  treasury. Congress would have to allocate any additional money to the national  parks.  </P> <P> Some critics have suggested, however, that the Park Service negotiate specific  contributions to Yosemite as a condition of any new contract.  </P> <P> Most Park Service officials rate the concessions company highly. The main  source of controversy is objections by environmental groups and some park  employees that its services have helped commercialize Yosemite Valley, which is  visited by most of the 3 million annual guests to the park.  </P> <P> Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. operates the Ahwahnee Hotel, guest lodges and a  variety of shops and restaurants that range from the Ahwahnhee's formal dining  room to a pizza parlor. The company also runs wilderness camps and collects  revenue from sources as varied as the tour buses that visit Yosemite to bicycle  rentals.  </P></p>

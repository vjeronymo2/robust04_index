			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Observer: DC-tender If the British are a nation of shopkeepers, the Swiss must be a nation of used aircraft salesmen. With 1,000 commercial aircraft, some brand new, parked in the deserts of Nevada and Arizona awaiting buyers, Swissair has still managed to raise nearly Pounds 54m by selling off its unwanted machines - a coup which enabled it to report a net profit in spite of a dismal year. The three aircraft accounting for most of the income were DC-10s - not the world's most popular jetliners. Predictably, Swissair officials attributed their success to the TLC lavished on their charges and the fact that they are sold before they get too old. Otto Loepfe, Swissair's president, says that demand in the second-hand market is stronger for the DC-10 these days than for any other model. 'None are available now,' he says.</p>

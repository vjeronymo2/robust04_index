			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Rostock (DPA) -- After their definitive vote to  continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU], the Free Democratic Party  [FDP] clearly dissociated itself from the CDU/CSU on important  political questions at its Rostock party congress. On Saturday  [4 June], the approximately 660 delegates adopted large parts of  an election program in which they advocate the strengthening of  the rights of foreigners, oppose the electronic bugging of  apartments, and support the abolition of the church tax.  Against the resistance of the party leadership, the delegates  also called for the division of parliamentary mandates and  government offices.    On the sidelines of the deliberations, FDP Chairman Klaus  Kinkel announced that, irrespective of the statement in favor of  a coalition, the FDP will conduct an independent election  campaign. He stressed that, for the FDP, the election program  will be the basis for negotiations on a coalition with the  CDU/CSU. Referring to opinion polls, according to which it is  uncertain that the liberals will return to the European  Parliament and the Bundestag, Kinkel said that he is convinced  the FDP will achieve good results. [passage omitted]    The party congress advocated the development of peacekeeping  and peacemaking UN missions. Germany's unrestricted  participation in these missions will be made possible by a Basic  Law amendment. The adherence to compulsory military service was  affirmed.</p>

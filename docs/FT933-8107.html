			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Australia expects record ADollars 16bn budget deficit THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday forecast a record ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7.4bn) budget deficit, moderate economic growth and higher inflation in the first budget since it won re-election in March. Measures in the budget for the 1993-94 fiscal year contained few surprises because most, including cuts in personal tax rates from November, had been foreshadowed during the election campaign. A cut in the company tax rate from 39 to 33 per cent from July 1 had also been signalled. However Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, announced an immediate increase of one percentage point in all wholesale sales tax rates, and a further one point increase from July 1995. He increased taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco and broadened fringe benefits subject to tax to include entertainment spending, club fees and travel expenses. The government plans to cut defence spending and to tighten up social security payments and health rebates. Mr Dawkins said the budget would provide a ADollars 2bn stimulus to the economy in order to create jobs. However, he forecast no significant fall over the next year in the 10.7 per cent unemployment rate. 'The fiscal challenge is to continue the stimulus to activity over the next year to encourage economic recovery and job growth, while setting in train medium-term adjustments to significantly increase public-sector saving,' he said. The budget deficit was forecast to rise to ADollars 16bn in the coming financial year from ADollars 14.5bn in the year ending June 30, 1993. This will force the government to find new funding of ADollars 21.9bn compared with ADollars 20.3bn. Mr Dawkins said the budget deficit would be reduced to ADollars 5.8bn in 1996-97, partly by deferring a second round of personal tax cuts. He forecast the economy would grow at an average rate of 2.75 per cent during in the next financial year - only a slight increase from 2.5 per cent in the year nearly ended - but that the rate would accelerate to more than 3 per cent in the second half of the year. Consumer price inflation would rise to 3.5 per cent from this year's 1 per cent, partly as a result of the indirect tax increases and of the fall of the Australian dollar, which dropped to a record low on a trade-weighted basis in June. The current account deficit was expected to grow to ADollars 18bn from ADollars 15.4bn. Mr Dawkins said the budget established a four-year framework which would enable interest rates and inflation to remain low. On Australian credit markets, however, bond prices weakened because of fears the higher than expected inflation forecast could lead to interest rate rises. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

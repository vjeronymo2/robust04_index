			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETRENCHMENT AT SECURITY PACIFIC;  </P> <P> MORE BANKS, S&amp;LS EXPECTED TO BOOST LOSS RESERVES  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp. is not the first banking firm to announce that 1990  earnings will be badly hurt by souring loans and additional loan-loss reserves.  And it's not likely to be the last.  </P> <P> Dozens of other big banks and thrifts -- already resigned to a year of  disappointing earnings and lackluster stock performance -- are likely to make  similar announcements in coming weeks, analysts said. Up to one-fifth of the  nation's large and mid-sized banks are primed to add significant amounts to  reserves -- a cushion for loan losses -- which is likely to decimate  fourth-quarter earnings, several bank analysts said. And virtually all of the  nation's biggest thrifts will do the same, savings and loan experts said.  </P> <P> "We are assuming that nearly everyone is going to add to reserves," said Jim  Wilson, an S&amp;L analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "We  expect all the major (thrifts) to show a loss for the quarter because of it,  and they'll probably bring year-end earnings right down to zero."  </P> <P> Savers and most borrowers will generally not be affected by the losses and poor  earnings, analysts noted. However, real estate developers and corporate  takeover artists may find it harder to borrow money as banks restrict credit to  riskier ventures.  </P> <P> Even with the writeoffs, most of the big banks and thrifts as of now are far  from being in danger of insolvency or failure. But a severe, prolonged  recession could result in even more writeoffs that could damage industry  health.  </P> <P> The companies most likely to announce writeoffs within the next few weeks  include Los Angeles-based H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of  America; it is expected to take a $147-million addition to reserves, causing it  to post about an $80-million quarterly loss, Wilson said.  </P> <P> Montgomery Securities is also projecting that Los Angeles-based CalFed, parent  of California Federal Bank, will add $64 million to reserves and post a  $112-million quarterly loss. GlenFed, Great Western Financial and Golden West  Financial -- all among the nation's biggest thrift companies -- will set aside  a total of $300 million during the quarter, according to an analysis by the San  Francisco-based investment house. GlenFed is parent of Glendale Federal Bank,  while Great Western Financial is parent of Great Western Bank and Golden West  is parent of World Savings.  </P> <P> Although some of the nation's biggest banks -- including Chase Manhattan --  have already announced plans to boost loan-loss reserves and reduce profits,  more such announcements are on the horizon, analysts said.  </P> <P> New York-based Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking company, is widely  expected to announce a substantial writeoff within the next several weeks,  analysts said. And a wide variety of smaller banks headquartered in the  Northeast and South could also follow suit, said Thaddeus Paluszek, bank  analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> However, the other big California banking firms -- Wells Fargo &amp; Co.,  BankAmerica and First Interstate Bancorp -- probably do not need to boost  reserves, several analysts said. These companies already have more than enough  cash set aside to handle all foreseeable loan problems, according to Paluszek.  </P> <P> Although the rush to add to reserves seems to be sweeping the financial  services industry, the problems these banks and thrifts are trying to address  vary widely. Some banks, such as Security Pacific, are grappling with  diversification efforts gone awry. Some have souring commercial real estate  loans, while others have been hit hard by bad business credits.  </P> <P> But the reason for the rush to put the money away now instead of later is  standard, analysts said.  </P> <P> This year has simply been bad for financial company earnings and for financial  stocks. Consequently, many institutions believe that it is in their best  interests to push all their bad news into this already rotten year, Wilson  said.  </P> <P> After its announcement, Security Pacific's stock price shot up $1 per share to  close at $23 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.  </P> <P> Other bank and thrift stocks also rose. Citicorp's stock climbed 25 cents per  share to finish at $15, while Wells Fargo's stock rose $1.25 per share to end  at $56.50 and BankAmerica gained 50 cents per share to close at $24.50. Stocks  of H. F. Ahmanson and Golden West both rose 37.5 cents per share, to $13.875  and $24.375, respectively.  </P></p>

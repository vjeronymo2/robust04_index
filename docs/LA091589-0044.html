			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE DISPUTE PERILS ARMS TALKS, NUNN SAYS  </P> <P> Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) warned Thursday that  the success of U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks is in jeopardy unless the  House, Senate and President Bush quickly agree on a plan for modernizing  America's strategic nuclear arsenal.  </P> <P> It was the first time that the powerful Senate chairman has spoken out since  House and Senate members began meeting to discuss their differences on a  $305.5-billion defense spending bill for fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Nunn's remarks clearly reflected a decision on his part to blame the House for  failure of arms control talks if it does not yield to the position of the  Senate and Bush.  </P> <P> The defense stalemate looms as the biggest obstacle between the President and  Congress in resolving how the federal government will be funded in the fiscal  year beginning Oct. 1. Unlike the Senate-passed defense bill, which the  President generally supports, the House version sharply cuts funding for  strategic weapons.  </P> <P> But, even while siding with Bush on the spending issue, Nunn faulted the  President for failing to develop a coherent strategy for arms control talks  with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> He noted that the President's current proposal for a ban on all mobile missiles  is inconsistent with his request to Congress for funds to deploy two mobile  missiles -- the 10-warhead MX transported on railroad cars and the  single-warhead Midgetman missile carried on truck beds. He called on Bush to  revise his arms control proposal promptly.  </P> <P> But Nunn seemed most disturbed about the impact on the strategic arms talks of  the current stalemate in Congress.  </P> <P> "I think the START talks are at stake in the next 30 days," he told members of  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "If we do not come out with a sensible strategic  nuclear program that the President himself has confidence in (and) the Joint  Chiefs have confidence in, START talks are going to be a long, long time  coming. So we have a lot at stake."  </P> <P> Negotiations between the House and Senate began last Friday, and congressional  sources reported that the two houses are nowhere near an agreement.  </P> <P> The House passed-bill trimmed $1.7 billion from the amount sought by Bush for  deployment of the MX missile on rail cars and eliminated funding for Midgetman.  It also cut $1.8 billion from Bush's $4.9-billion funding request for research  on the "Star Wars" missile defense system and put severe restrictions on  funding for the B-2 bomber beyond fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Nunn asserted that, by slashing funding for four major strategic programs, the  House-passed bill eliminates much of the incentive that the Soviets now have  for reaching an arms control agreement with the United States.  </P> <P> "I believe we have to give President Bush the tools to do the job," he said.  </P> <P> He noted also that the House and Senate still fundamentally disagree on a  number of conventional weapons programs. House members restored funding for  virtually every conventional weapon that the Bush Administration sought to  eliminate for cost-cutting reasons, including the V-22 Osprey helicopter and  the F-14D fighter plane.  </P> <P> Moreover, as Nunn told reporters earlier this week, the President's new  anti-drug proposal has made it even more difficult to resolve these differences  because the Administration and the Democrats have agreed that some of the money  for the drug war must come from the Pentagon budget. Democrats are proposing to  cut more from defense than Bush, however.  </P> <P> Many members of both chambers have expressed support for proposals to fund the  drug war by cutting money almost exclusively from the major strategic weapons  that Bush wants to preserve -- particularly the super-expensive "Star Wars" and  B-2 programs.  </P></p>

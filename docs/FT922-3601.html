			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over job opportunities for minorities ATTEMPTS to compel companies to provide jobs for a specified proportion of the ethnic minority communities in their area might 'backfire,' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, warned in the Commons last night. Reaffirming the government's determination to combat racial discrimination, he said, however, that subjecting employers to a legal requirement to achieve target numbers would be a difficult and dangerous course to follow. Mr Clarke emphasised that it would be damaging to race relations if white members of the workforce believed that their black colleagues were there only because the law required them to be admitted, regardless of their suitability for the job. He said the Commission on Racial Equality (CRE) would have to produce 'a strong argument' if it wished to move the government in such a direction. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, who opened a debate on the ethnic minorities in British society, argued that a disproportionate number of British black and Asian people were unemployed, and that they suffered from a lack of equality in job opportunities. He rejected the imposition of quotas or 'positive discrimination' but called for the CRE to monitor the results of employers' efforts to ensure that their workforce was 'fundamentally representative' of the local population. Mr Hattersley urged that the monitoring process should be reinforced by the government refusing to award contracts to companies that could not demonstrate that they operated 'fair employment policies'. The home secretary reaffirmed his commitment to monitoring as part of a positive employment policy which good employers should follow. But he insisted that the government could not accept the kind of compliance which some Labour-controlled local authorities had sought to impose. Mr Bernie Grant, the black Labour MP for Tottenham, gave a warning that high unemployment and youth service cuts meant young people had nowhere to go and were turning to drug trafficking. He said: 'Youth workers tell me there is tension on the streets, that youths are planning Los Angeles-style riots or disturbances in my area, and that unless something is done, especially in the summer, we can expect trouble'. A Labour motion calling on the government to introduce and implement policies which would eventually eliminate the disadvantages suffered by ethnic minorities was defeated by a majority of 47 (311-264).</p>

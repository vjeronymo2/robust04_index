			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein delivers stinging blow to hopes for peace Hopes of an early end to the IRA's 25-year campaign of violence in Ulster suffered a fresh blow last night as Sinn Fein responded scathingly to new efforts by London and Dublin to breathe life into their peace initiative. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the only positive aspect about an attempt by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to reassure nationalists about last month's Downing Street declaration was the recognition that clarification could be appropriate in future. Mr Adams described the declaration as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity'. He said it was absurd that the UK government would not 'supply the request for clarification that has been put to them in quite reasonable terms by me'. His remarks reawakened fears that a prolonged stand-off between the two camps was in prospect. Mr Adams insisted, however, that the political wing of the IRA was not 'searching for a 'no''. Sinn Fein was 'not going to allow the British government to squander this opportunity for peace'. He told Channel 4 News: 'It's not exactly the best government the British people have had to rule them. It's a very dismal government on many domestic counts and no different in terms of its dealing with the question of Ireland.' His remarks followed the delivery of a firm rebuff from Downing Street to Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue on the declaration. Downing Street accused Mr Adams of seeking to 'reopen issues for renegotiation' in a letter sent to the prime minister earlier this month. Publishing both this original letter and a terse response signed by a senior government official, Downing Street told Mr Adams that there was 'no question' of the joint declaration being renegotiated. 'That text, and only that text, is what is at issue,' it said. Mr Adams reacted angrily, accusing Mr John Major of 'a patently obvious attempt to frustrate a genuine effort to end the stand-off'. The release of the letters coincided with a Commons debate in which Sir Patrick said Sinn Fein had given no 'particulars' of what it wanted clarified. Talk of clarification was 'but a smokescreen to distract attention' from whether 'all those now engaged in violence' would renounce it. Drawing on an earlier speech seeking to reassure nationalists and unionists, Sir Patrick said the aspiration of a united Ireland by peaceful means was 'fully legitimate'. He hinted that Britain's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein would be lifted only if republican leaders renounced terrorism. Sinn Fein has said it will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration until at least the end of next month.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cargill earnings fall 20% to Dollars 348m CARGILL, the Minneapolis-based international commodities merchandising firm, reported a 20 per cent slide in fiscal year 1993 earnings, to Dollars 348m. Sales for the year rose slightly to Dollars 47bn, while cash flow, at Dollars 1.01bn, dropped slightly. The secretive and closely-held company only began reporting results last year, when it initiated a employee stock ownership programme. Cargill said despite the earnings decline, fiscal 1993 was its third-best year in its 130-year history. Mr Robert Lumpkins, Cargill senior vice-president and chief financial officer, said operations within the US recorded their strongest-ever performance. However, activity outside North America was adversely affected by reduced acreage in the EC, currency fluctuations, political instability within parts of South America, and continuing credit problems confronting Cargill's leading customers, including the former Soviet Union. 'Many of the economic and other factors negatively influencing the global busi-ness environment had been anticipated,' Mr Lumpkins said. 'We expected to see pressure on margins, and we did. We weren't surprised by our inability to match what was clearly an exceptional year in 1992,' he added.</p>

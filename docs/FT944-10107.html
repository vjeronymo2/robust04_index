			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The APEC Summit: Indonesia pledge on labour rights Indonesia yesterday bowed to strong US pressure to improve its labour rights record by announcing a comprehensive programme of reforms and inviting western trade unions and the International Labour Organisation to help it develop new industrial relations policies. After a meeting between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Mr Abdul Latief, Indonesia's manpower minister, Mr Kantor said the changes were 'a step in the right direction'. However, he said the reforms did not answer all US concerns and would not comment on whether they went far enough for the US to restore tariff-free treatment of Indonesian imports under the generalised system of preferences, which Washington suspended in March in protest at Indonesia's labour record. The suspension is of greater political than economic significance since it affects only about Dollars 600m (Pounds 366m) of Indonesian exports to the US annually and is estimated to have reduced the total by only about Dollars 60m. The reforms announced yesterday include an annual review of regional minimum wages, stronger enforcement of pay, health and safety regulations and a more effective disputes settlement mechanism. The government plans to allow the All Indonesian Workers' Union greater independence and to review existing labour legislation. It will launch workers' education programmes in collaboration with the Australian government and the ILO and is also ready to work with the AFL/CIO, the largest US trades union organisation.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Hard issues at non-aligned talks LEADERS of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) today begin a six-day summit in Jakarta which, following the end of the cold war, finds the founding principle of the organisation to be in question. Moreover, the delegates - including about 60 heads of state - will also find themselves caught between the movement's traditional determination to achieve consensus and the increasing difficulty of disregarding sensitive issues of concern to its 108 members. As pressing and dividing as any issue is the former Yugoslavia, which chaired the movement until Indonesia assumed the post last Friday. While a delegation from Serbia and Montenegro will attend claiming to represent Yugoslavia, there will also be seats for separate delegations from Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Some NAM members, led by Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Iran have condemned Belgrade for the plight of the Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina while Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, said that since the NAM was founded to 'defend and help weak countries' then: 'if it doesn't punish Yugoslavia. . .it has deviated from its original goal'. However, Mr Farouk Khadoumi, Palestine's foreign minister, argued that 'The debate about the Yugoslav issue is a waste of time. Let the United Nations decide on the issues.' Foreign minsters discussed the issue acrimoniously over the weekend, but agreed only to postpone a decision on Yugoslavia's status until a further meeting in New York on September 15. For critics of the NAM, originally founded by countries determined to promote foreign policies independent of the superpowers, such a decision was typical of the movement's weaknesses. 'The movement strives to reach consensus on foreign policy, but to do so it often fails to address major world issues', said one western diplomat. Where consensus is reached, moreover, the movement sometimes invites the charge of hypocrisy. For example, a proposed declaration on the protection of basic human rights is likely to be supported by the Yugoslav delegation and other unlikely proponents such as President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. One issue likely to attract consensus is the proposal to restructure the UN  -of which NAM countries account for about two-thirds of the membership - and an expansion of the Security Council to limit the influence of the US. Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is also pushing for a new approach to the economic relationship between developing and industrialised nations. Many delegates have arrived warning that the marginalisation of developing countries has bred a feeling of humiliation which lies behind much of the world's armed conflict and terrorism. President Suharto said recently the relationship between developing and industrialising nations 'should not be haunted by an atmosphere of confrontation'. He has stressed Indonesia's record - two decades of 6 per cent annual GDP growth - has been achieved with an open economic policy, even while arguing for the structure of international trade to be reformed.

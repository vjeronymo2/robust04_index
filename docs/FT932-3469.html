			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Telephone broker to float next month SHARELINK Investment Services, the telephone-based stockbroker, is to float at the end of next month. The group is expected to be valued at more than Pounds 30m. Around Pounds 5m of new money is to be raised which will be invested in new services. Sharelink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is looking at expand-ing into insurance and bank-ing. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said: 'The retail financial services market is full of opportunities; after pioneering the use of the telephone in selling shares we are now looking at moving into other areas.' He confirmed that this includes the rapidly growing telephone insurance business. Direct Line, the company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland which specialises in telephone insurance, recently trebled first-half profits to Pounds 15m. Sharelink's two biggest shareholders, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and the British Coal pension fund, both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are expected to sell around half their shareholding. Mr Jones, who started the business in 1987, is expected to sell 25 per cent of his 20 per cent holding making him a millionaire just six years after he invested Pounds 4,000 in the business. He increased his shareholding after a management buyout from the original institutional backers, BT and Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based stockbroker. The company's other shareholders are the employees with 10 per cent and Eagle Trust with 6 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31, 1993 have jumped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.5m on sales of Pounds 14m. The company is based in Birmingham with more than 300 employees. In the past it has thrived on privatisations but during the last year it has mainly concentrated on equities. A number of new issues have been brought forward before the government sale of its remaining 21.9 per cent stake in BT which is to take place in the middle of July. However, Mr Jones believes the BT sale will not affect his float. 'There is plenty of money in the new issue markets,' he said.</p>

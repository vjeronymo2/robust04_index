			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An American Priority"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared that  establishing peace in the Middle East is one of the highest  priorities of U.S. policy. He promised to exert everything in  his power to establish an honorable and permanent peace that is  acceptable to all parties.    President Clinton said in the interview he gave to CNN that  his meeting in Geneva with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was  great and serious. He added that he is convinced that the  Syrian president is honest when confirming Syria's interest in  establishing peace and is committed to finding an agreement for  a settlement with Israel on the basis of peace prevailing on  both the Lebanese and Jordanian fronts, in addition to the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    The statements by the U.S. President came after he met twice  with Jordanian monarch King Husayn and before a series of  meetings that were held in Oslo between U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    The preparatory meetings start in Washington today between  the Arab delegations taking part in the bilateral peace talks  with Israel in preparation for resuming these negotiations at  the beginning of the next month, after they have been stopped  and stalled for a long time.    Since the United States gives priority to peace efforts in  the Middle East, we hope that the U.S. capital will soon witness  concurrent agreements between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and  Jordan respectively along the lines of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement, which will bring about a historic reconciliation and  an honorable and permanent peace through which cooperation and  good neighborliness can replace bloodshed and fighting.</p>

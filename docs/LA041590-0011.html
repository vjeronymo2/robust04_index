			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SECRETS OF THE OLD GROWTH FOREST BY DAVID KELLY &amp; GARY  BRAASCH (GIBBS-SMITH: $15.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> This handsome, outsized volume combines a paean to the beauties of the forest  with a diatribe against the timber industry. Old-growth forest is characterized  by large conifers at least 250 years old, tall standing snags and big fallen  logs.  </P> <P> The most productive biomass on Earth, it once dominated the Pacific Northwest  ecosystem, stretching from Northern California to Anchorage, Alaska. Barely 10%  of the old growth remains, and much of that is slated for destruction.  </P> <P> David Kelly and Gary Braasch excoriate the policies of the Bureau of Land  Management under the Reagan administration, and accuse the federal government  of propping up a moribund timber industry at the expense of taxpayers, hunters  and commercial salmon fishermen. The destruction of the old growth imperils the  habitats of more than two dozen animals, including the bald eagle, the marbled  murrelet, the Roosevelt elk and the Olympic salamander, as well as the  much-publicized spotted owl. With its handsome nature photographs, "Secrets"  will appeal most strongly to conservationists, reducing this thoughtful polemic  to a sermon to the converted.  </P></p>

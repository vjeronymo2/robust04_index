			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Tax information at the push of a button - Legal briefs Fifty of the UK's top 100 law firms will this week receive on a trial basis a computer-based reference work on tax law. The Books on Screen package is described by Compliance, its creator, as a new approach to information retrieval. While lawyers may have struggled to come to grips with cost-efficient use of standard text retrieval systems such as Lexis, Books on Screen looks like a book and can be accessed and read like a book. But it also offers the added benefits that can be achieved through using technology. Books on Screen is designed for publications that contain a large number of cross-references. These can be called up on screen without the effort involved in checking cross-references on a hard copy. It is therefore ideal for tax legislation. The tax package contains the yellow and orange tax handbooks, the yellow and orange tax guides, Butterworths UK tax guide and Simon's tax case headnotes since January 1973. The system will be updated weekly. Compliance hopes to launch a company and commercial law package in December. Lawyers and accountants buying the system will have to pay Pounds 995 a year for one user and Pounds 395 for each additional user. They will also need a 25MHz 386 PC with 4MB of Ram using Windows to run the system.</p>

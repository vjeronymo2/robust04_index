Robaina spoke to PRENSA LATINA after holding a news  conference here today. He emphasized that his visit to Vietnam  ends what was announced as a diplomatic offensive in several  regions of the world to explain to several governments the truth  about Cuba and to study economic experiences.    Our tours to the Caribbean and several Latin American  countries in the past months and our tour to Asia now have given  our interlocutors a broad vision of the process that is taking  place in Cuba within a climate of respect and understanding, he  explained.    Robaina indicated that in those contacts, Cuba was allowed  to  explain its current situation in its own words and was able to  say things that are generally omitted by the big international  media sources.    We are a country open to dialogue and willing to negotiate  everything except our independence, sovereignty, and basic  revolutionary achievements. We are willing to do so without any  preconditions but based on the respect due to us for the place  we have won in the world, he sentenced.    Cuba is not the hell it is said to be or the paradise it  wants to be and, thus, does not have to be placed on the  defendant's bench. From this moment on, we will coin the phrase  offensive diplomacy as part of our legitimate aspiration to  consolidate and expand our country's international relations, he  added.    Robaina, who is probably the world's youngest foreign  minister (38 years), said 1994 would be a year of very arduous  work that would include a new tour to Latin America. The tour,  which is to start in April, will include visits to Peru,  Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    His project also includes a visit to the Middle East in the  near future. However, before this, he will host an encounter  called "The Nation and Emigration" to which members of the Cuban  community abroad have been invited.    The meeting, scheduled to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April in  Havana, will be attended by Cuban citizens who reside in the  United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the  Caribbean, and other countries.    The Cuban foreign minister remarked the purpose of the  meeting was to normalize ties between Cuba and its community  abroad as all other nations do. "All the Cubans of goodwill who  want to talk to their fatherland are invited. Only  aggressiveness and hysteria have not been called," he added.    Going back to his tour of Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma,  Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which he started on 8  March, Robaina emphasized the importance of exchanging ideas and  of analyzing very valuable economic experiences in one of the  world's most flourishing areas.    He highlighted that Vietnam had been one of the most  important points in his tour due to the traditional bilateral  ties of friendship and cooperation and reiterated that Cuba  applauds and studies with particular attention, the economic  process started by Hanoi eight years ago.    At his farewell, Robaina confessed to Deputy Foreign  Minister  Le Mai that he was impressed with the progress made by this  Indo-Chinese country since he last visited it in 1990. He  reiterated his government's gratitude to the Vietnamese  Government and people for their concrete actions of solidarity  with the Cubans.    Accompanied by Ambassador Tania Maceira and adviser Carlos  Amores, among other officials, Robaina traveled to the southern  Ho Chi Minh city where he will end his tour to Southern and  Southeastern Asia tomorrow.</p>

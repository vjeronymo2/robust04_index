Besides Victor Benoit, present were the  current minister of education and spokesman for the National  Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD], Dunois Eric Cantave,  former Aristide presidential commission member Micha Gaillard,  and BP-FNCD bloc president Jude Marie-Jacinthe Jean-Baptiste.  The following is a report by Varrio Serran.    [Begin recording] [Serran] No to the clean-sweep strategy,  no  to political inertia, but yes to the parliamentarians' realistic  initiative aimed at resolving the country's crisis. These are  the words of CONACOM leader, Victor Benoit. According to him: On  the one hand, this plan meets President Aristide's principal  demands -- his return to power and General Cedras' early  retirement; on the other hand, it meets that of the commander in  chief -- amnesty to the military.    [Benoit] It is a set of proposals in keeping with the  Constitution, the Governors Island agreement, the New York pact,  the Miami conference, and a series of documents to which CONACOM  feels it is linked. It also respects the demands of the entire  political class -- the formation of a government of national  concord, sociopolitical appeasement, and national  reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all strata of  the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so people  can work under proper conditions.    [Serran] To make a long story short, in CONACOM's opinion,  this plan offers the means to extricate the country from its  deadlock through facilitation of, among other things, the  restoration of the head of state, cessation of violence,  reduction in the high cost of living, protection of the  country's institutions, and removal of the sanctions. Asked  about the division that seems to have developed within the FNCD  over this plan, BP-FNCD President Jude Marie- Jacinthe  Jean-Baptiste replied that the divergences are only on the  tactical plane, but that regarding restoration of the head of  state to his post, the front remains united. Does CONACOM's  firm, vital support of this plan include a wild run for the post  of prime minister? Certainly not, said Victor Benoit, who drew  up a profile of those who would run for this post.    [Benoit] The following is a profile of those who would  discreetly run for prime minister. I am going to give you this  profile so you can identify them: They are either in Haiti or  abroad and claim to side with President Aristide. Actually, some  are very close to him. They do not talk or take a stand at all.  They do not take a stand publicly. But they behave as if they  completely agree with anything the president thinks. They have  no personal advice to give. They do not behave as people who  have a personality. They behave as simple opportunists because  they know it is the president who will appoint the prime  minister. As there are political divisions, they agree with the  president up and down the line.    [Serran] Nobody, not President Aristide, not his advisors,  not the international personalities we have met, nobody can say  that Victor has ever tried to run for prime minister, Benoit  said, adding: We are the president's allies, but not his  sycophants. Political inertia can kill. Politics presupposes not  only a stance, but also an initiative. This person in charge of  political affairs for CONACOM added that some people are linked  to President Aristide, the person. But we, he said, are linked  to the cause that President Aristide defends.    Asked finally about the alliance arising from circumstances  in the Chamber of Deputies among the BP-FNCD, the socialist bloc  dominated by the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party  of Haiti, and the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the  CONACOM leader explained that in politics, yesterday's adversary  may today be an ally, and today's ally may be an adversary  tomorrow. What is fundamental is the [common] goal. [end  recording]</p>

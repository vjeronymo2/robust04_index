			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F> the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Maria Rozgics; place and date  not given: "Be Faithful to Yourself -- Interview With Lajos Fur  After His Inaugural Speech as Chairman"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At the threshold of decisive  new elections, juxtaposing Lajos Fur's former thoughts with his  current ones, we would like to give food for thought to all  those who might still be looking to 8 May with doubt and  uncertainty. [passage omitted]    [Rozgics] In one of your interviews for UJ MAGYARORSZAG in  January you referred to your book "I Would Like To Cry Freely"  which had been published earlier. Today, it is no longer a  question whether one is allowed to cry freely, we now are  expecting you to say why it is worth crying?    [Fur] It is worth crying so that we succeed in continuing  the policy that ensures freedom in the future, too, and through  this freedom we can continue to build a real and true European  democracy in Hungary. What we began with much toil and  suffering has finally been completed, and once we have completed  this building, we should utilize it well to live in, we should  furnish it in a way worthy of humans, and fill it with balanced  civic existence. [passage omitted]    [Rozgics] What are your views on the survival of the  Hungarian nation?    [Fur] This issue might be even more difficult than the issue  of the economy. We know the consequences of the long historical  process. It is a very difficult issue. It has two components.  The decline in the number of Hungarians in the country: It is  public knowledge that we are 30-40 thousand fewer every year.  Therefore, the reduction of the number of Hungarians in the  country has to be stopped because this is one of the signs of  decline. It is also known that the Hungarian nation is a nation  torn apart, it constitutes huge minority groups. Stopping the  decline in the size of the national minorities, and establishing  such conditions with the majority country and the mother country  in which they can survive, is a very bitter process. This is a  difficult issue in this part of Europe, and in the West, too,  although certain methods have been learned there.  Unfortunately, we still have much to do before the conditions  for the survival of national minorities can be guaranteed. I  repeat that we also have to halt the country's domestic  biological decline because we are decreasing. Unfortunately,  year after year, we are decreasing. [passage omitted]    [Rozgics] In 1989, the Forum outlined three roads: red  dictatorship, abyss, or democracy. What is the situation now?    [Fur] I also spoke about it at the [Hungarian Democratic  Forum's MDF] National Meeting, that this had been at stake at  the elections: Either the postcommunist dictatorship continues  to vegetate, anarchy breaks out in the country, or we can switch  over to a democracy in a constitutional and legal framework in a  disciplined manner. Today, although the situation is not as  keen, the question is what will happen to the country. Knowing  society's sober attitude, I hope that anarchy is not threatening  the country, but the danger of a left-wing change can certainly  be felt. It is my firm view, that the question continues to be  whether a constitutional, legal, calm, balanced, and secure  democracy will continue to exist in Hungary. Although, this  means hardship for many people and social groups. A left-wing  change could mean an unpredictable and incalculable direction  for democracy and everything that goes with it, namely the  economy, and the change and transformation of society. The  reflexes, thinking, and the political goals of the left wing are  completely different from ours who are the sober political  forces that honestly insist on democracy.    [Rozgics] The MDF announced the triple road of national  liberalism, Christianity, and popular-national ideology. How  are we to interpret these?    [Fur] This is not a road because it only leads to problems  if a road goes in three directions. It is more appropriate to  say that these are the ideological and political source of the  MDF. The term tendency is too strong because tendencies can  easily turn into independent political movements and divisions  which have actually happened. This ideological and political  source whose roots go back to the popular and national  traditions that did not only represent the political activities  of the populist writers of between the two world wars, but it  could actually be taken back to Rakoczi and Bocskai [historical  figures in 17-18th century]. Christian democracy is our other  source which, in addition to modern Christian democracy, also  means the values that Europe accumulated throughout the 2,000  years of Christianity. This is a way of looking at and  understanding the world, and it is not a world view. Naturally,  it also includes the political thinking of the modern Christian  democracy. The third part of our source is national liberalism  that flourished in the 19th century, and since then, it has been  a determining factor of Hungarian history. However, here, I am  talking about nationally committed liberalism, rather than the  supra-national liberalism that reflects a different attitude.  We have been able to see these principles as important  components of the MDF and still see them this way. [passage  omitted]</p>

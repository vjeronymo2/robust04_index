			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under a ``framework'' fishery management plan (FMP). The framework FMP was approved in 1984 and has been amended five times since then (52 FR 4146, February 10, 1987; 53 FR 30285, August 11, 1988; 54 FR 19185, May 4, 1989; 56 FR 26774, June 11, 1991; [Amendment 11 approved  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 4/6/94 final rule is being published within days of these annual management measures]). Regulations at 50 CFR part 661 provide the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments to the management measures, within limits set by the FMP, by notification in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These management measures for the 1994 ocean salmon fisheries were recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) at its April 5&hyph;8, 1994, meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Schedule Used To Establish 1994 Management Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the FMP, the Council's Salmon Technical Team (STT) and staff economist prepared several reports for the Council, its advisors, and the public. The first report, ``Review of 1993 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' summarizes the 1993 ocean salmon fisheries and assesses how well the Council's management objectives were met in 1993. The second report, ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' provides the 1994 salmon stock abundance projections and analyzes the impacts on the stocks and Council management goals if the 1993 regulations or regulatory procedures were applied to the 1994 stock abundance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council met on March 8&hyph;11, 1994, in Portland, OR, to develop proposed management options for 1994. Three commercial and three recreational fishery management options were proposed for analysis and public comment. These options presented various combinations of management measures designed to protect numerous weak stocks of coho and chinook salmon and provide for ocean harvests of more abundant stocks of chinook salmon (primarily Sacramento Fall chinook). All options provided for no directed harvest of coho salmon coastwide and no non-treaty commercial or recreational fishing north of Cape Falcon, OR. After the March Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared a third report, ``Preseason Report II Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Options for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' which analyzes the effects of the proposed 1994 management options. This report also was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public hearings on the proposed options were held March 28&hyph;30, 1994, in Westport, WA; Warrenton and Coos Bay, OR; and Arcata, CA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council met on April 5&hyph;8, 1994, in Burlingame, California, to adopt its final 1994 recommendations. Following the April Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared a fourth report, ``Preseason Report III Analysis of Council-Adopted Management Measures for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' which analyzes the environmental and socio-economic effects of the Council's final recommendations. This report also was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Resource Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many salmon runs returning to Washington, Oregon, and California streams in 1994 are expected to be at record low levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Primary resource concerns are for Klamath River fall chinook; Columbia River hatchery chinook; Oregon Production Index area coho stocks destined for the Columbia River and the California and Oregon coasts, particularly Oregon coastal natural coho; and Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho. Management of all of these stocks is affected by interjurisdictional agreements among tribal, State, Federal, and/or Canadian managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Chinook Salmon Stocks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> California Central Valley stocks are relatively abundant compared to the other chinook stocks of the Pacific coast. The Central Valley Index of abundance of combined Central Valley chinook stocks is estimated to be 503,000 fish for 1994, slightly above the post-season estimate of the index for 1993 and 18 percent below the average of the index from 1970&hyph;1993. The escapement goal range of 122,000 to 180,000 Sacramento River adult fall chinook was not met in 1990, 1991, or 1992, and was near the low end of the goal range in 1993. Preseason modeling predicted that regulations comparable to those of 1993 would result in an escapement of Sacramento River fall chinook within the escapement goal range in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as an endangered species (59 FR 440, January 4, 1994) and are a consideration in establishing ocean fishing regulations. The 1993 spawning run size estimate totaled 341 adults, a substantial decline from the 1992 run-size estimate of 1,180 adults. The abundance of the winter run in the ocean at the beginning of the fishing season is not forecast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel  (Christian Social Union -- CSU) sees neither a "gap of justice"  in the present wage and income tax scale nor in the state  financing of Germany unity through austerity measures and the  solidarity contribution. In a letter to the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group that became known to  DPA on Thursday [17 February], Waigel now provides deputies with  arguments against the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  with comprehensive accounts of burdens.    One "cannot talk" of preferential treatment of higher  incomes  or discrimination of people with small incomes, he stressed. As  of 1995, no solidarity contribution will be collected from a  four-person family with two children and a gross income of  47,197 German marks [DM] per year. The full surcharge to the  wage tax with a rate of 7.5 percent will only become due  starting at DM52,166. According to the income tax scale,  high-income earners are already now considerably more burdened  than regular earners, which has disastrous consequences for  industrial enterprises. Another substantial tax burden,  repeatedly and emphatically demanded by the SPD, would  significantly restrict the financial scope for necessary  investments, it was stated.    At the same time, the finance minister rejected the SPD  reproach that the transfer to eastern Germany via social  insurances is socially unjust. In 1993, funds of DM57.5 billion  flew from the Federal Employment Office (39.5 billion) and the  pension insurance (18 billion) to the new laender; DM33.3  billion of it or just under 58 percent come from federal  subsidies, that is tax proceeds. Insurance contributions from  employers and employees account for the rest, Waigel reported.  However, even regarding the funds from social contributions,  the benefits have always been granted independently of the  regional origin of the funds. "There is obviously no reason to  deviate from this because of the establishment of the unity of  the German state," he said.</p>

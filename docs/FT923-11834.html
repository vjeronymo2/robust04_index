			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC lifted by special item A ONE-TIME gain on the sale of its interests in a German television network helped lift second-quarter net earnings at Capital Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group. The company, which includes the ABC Television network, lifted net profits to Dollars 147.4m, against Dollars 127.8m in the second quarter of 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 8.84, or 16 per cent higher than Dollars 7.60 a year ago. The net gain of Dollars 24.9m was struck on the sale of interests in Tele-5 of Germany - after being partly offset by losses incurred in the disposal of New York property holdings and asset write-downs. Had the one-time net gain been excluded Capital Cities/ABC would have achieved 7 per cent higher earnings per share of Dollars 8.16. Net revenues were 2 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.39bn, while operating income was 8 per cent higher at Dollars 268.7m. Earnings from ABC Television increased modestly, thanks to the absence of staff reduction provisions recorded a year ago. The network's revenues were slightly better, primarily because of the broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony. Capital Cities said its broadcasting operations were still being affected by the recessionary environment, while operating income from broadcasting was 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 236.6m. Video operations saw a significant rise in revenues. This was primarily attributed to the ESPN sports cable network. However, radio revenues were down moderately because of weak demand for radio advertising. Publishing revenues increased by 5.7 per cent to Dollars 273.5m, while operating income from this division, which includes the Fairchild fashion group, was Dollars 40.1m, up sharply from Dollars 28.1m. For the first six months of 1992 net profits were Dollars 189.3m, 2 per cent higher on the first half of 1991. On Wall Street, the Capital Cities/ABC share price was Dollars 5 lower at Dollars 441 in late trading.</p>

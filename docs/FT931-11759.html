			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK trading outlook ominous, says survey THE trading outlook for UK companies remains 'ominous', with under-capacity, cancelled orders and cash flow problems still rife, according to a survey by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group. The survey of nearly 600 companies, conducted during December 1992, contradicts some other recent findings suggesting that industry may be slowly moving out of recession. 'We continue to express fears that the frost may yet get the green shoots,' Trade Indemnity said. 'There is still plenty of gloom out there and the pessimists' views are supported by the damage being done to cash flow by seemingly insurmountable late payments problems.' According to Trade Indemnity, overall activity levels among Britain's businesses are little changed. Thirty per cent of companies say they are working at less than half capacity and most believe that immediate prospects for any improvement are bleak. Nearly half of the survey companies - from all sectors of the economy and with annual turnovers ranging from well under Pounds 1m to more than Pounds 50m - do not expect any upturn in activity in the first three months of 1993. Trade Indemnity also warned that companies remain vulnerable to any economic upturn. Growing numbers of companies, confronted with continuing, high levels of cancelled orders, are still reducing stocks of raw materials, work-in-hand and finished goods, it said. When orders start to pick up, the rate of company failures - already at record levels - could rise further as businesses are unable to respond to the increase in demand. The survey also found that nearly one half of businesses with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 1m are working below half capacity. And no small companies reported in December that they were being paid on time, with average payment nearly one month after the due date. Among all companies, only 3 per cent said they were being promptly paid and a quarter had seen a recent rise in bad debts.</p>

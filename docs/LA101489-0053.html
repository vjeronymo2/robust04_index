			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING;  </P> <P> CUPRESSUS SEMPERVIRENS: ITALIAN CYPRESS. TALL, COLUMNAR EVERGREEN TREE  </P> <P> This is arguably the most misused tree in Southern California. Just one  example: Several years ago, a neighbor in Echo Park built a sturdy new fence  around his modest bungalow, a fence with brick columns connected by cast-iron  grating. Behind the cast iron, the neighbor planted many little Italian  cypresses, two between each brick column.  </P> <P> The little trees were so cute, so skinny, so short -- not even as tall as the  fence. Three years later, the trees were way past the fence and starting to  look distinctly crowded. Five years later, the house seems to be cowering while  the trees loom 40 feet overhead.  </P> <P> Don't even think about planting this tree if you have a standard-size city lot.  It will look ridiculous, and you will look foolish. Italian cypresses were  meant to dot or line those noble Italian Renaissance gardens, the ones that  marched up hill and over dale, with waterfalls and parterres. They look best in  a park-like setting and don't appear too awkward next to tall buildings, but  they were not meant for a tract-home hedge.  </P> <P> If you already have a towering column and want to cut it down to size, go right  ahead; the tree won't die and in most cases it won't sprout unsightly lateral  branches. But think twice before revving up the chain saw, because once topped,  the tree will lose its unique characteristic; that tapering spire, like a  finger impaling the sky, will be amputated.  </P> <P> Italian cypresses are such gorgeous trees, such impressive, 60-foot exclamation  points, that it's a shame we can't all have one at the front door. It's ironic  that a tree that never seems to look right in our yards is so perfectly adapted  to our climate, enduring waterless summers for years on end (although it needs  some attention with the hose in its youth).  </P> <P> In the summer, the inner part of the tree becomes a heavy mess of dead needles  and dust; blasting with a hose helps clear it out, but you can't really tell a  clean tree from a dirty one unless you're very close.  </P> <P> There is a measure of hope: Cupressus sempervirens "Swane's Golden" is a  smaller, gold-tipped version of Italian cypress that reaches a modest 20 feet  in height. While the color wouldn't go with everything (green-and-gold  variegation does best against a dark background), the size might.  </P> <P> For those with Renaissance acreage, the standard Italian cypress is dark green,  but there is also a blue-green version, Cupressus sempervirens "Glauca."  Unfortunately, the tall trees are more readily available than the "Swane's  Golden," but be persistent. After all, who wants to live in a cowering  house?JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

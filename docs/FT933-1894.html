			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Party reprieve for Franco BRAZIL'S largest political party yesterday decided against pulling out of the coalition government although it remained divided about its longer-term links with President Itamar Franco. Leaders of the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) voted to stay with the president when it became clear a small but powerful faction of the party, led by Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, Sao Paulo governor, was losing support in its call for a split with the government. PMDB leaders decided that leaving the government would highlight the party's own divisions and risked strengthening the hand of its main centre-left rivals, the Brazilian Social Democratic party of finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The decision ends the immediate threat of a rupture between the PMDB and President Franco, who angered the party by making appointments without consulting it. But the party remains torn over whether it should remain with an unpopular government, especially with elections next year, or risk being blamed for triggering instability by leaving the government without a congressional majority.</p>

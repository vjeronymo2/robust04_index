			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Friars Club to Fry Zsa Zsa: Zsa Zsa Gabor will be roasted by the Friars Club in  what organizers have promised will be a "no-holds barred" ceremony.  </P> <P> Milton Berle, president of the California Friars Club, said Gabor's roast,  scheduled for May 14 at the Beverly Hilton, would be "the modern version of  Joan of Arc burning at the stake." Berle, who will serve as master for the  roast, said: "For all she has done for our community, it's time the community  finally does something to her." His punch line: "We plan to send a limousine  for her so she doesn't have to drive in Beverly Hills." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Bronshteyn report: "Kamaz and VAZ Discover Common </F> Interests"]    [Text] Naberezhnyye Chelny -- At a meeting of "KamAZ"  stockholders, General Director Nikolay Bekh made an announcement  which many people saw as sensational: "KamAZ" and "VAZ" intend  to set up a holding-type Volga-Kama financial and industrial  group.    "We have signed a memorandum on the creation of the holding  company," Nikolay Bekh said in conversation with this IZVESTIYA  correspondent. "We share many problems with `VAZ.' For  instance, a whole number of associated plants supply their  output to `VAZ' and `KamAZ' simultaneously. And both motor  vehicle plants have an interest in supporting these suppliers.  Or take a common problem such as capacity utilization at our  own enterprises, instrument-making, and machine-tool-building  plants. We will compile a common cyclical timetable for the  preparation of new vehicles -- both trucks and cars -- and will  make sure that these plants are operating to full capacity.    "One other problem is our representation abroad. Both auto  giants maintain their own subunits in many countries to deal  with spares, repairs, and advertising -- and this expenditure  will be reduced if these efforts are combined."    The idea of pooling the motor plants' efforts has been  around  for a long time, but, as Bekh said, when state enterprises  collaborate, ambitions often prevail -- who is more important,  more significant, older.... But when enterprises are floated,  people start primarily counting the money and looking to see  what is more profitable. A vivid example of this is that,  barely having agreed to set up a holding company, "KamAZ" and  "VAZ" adopted an agreement which people had tried unsuccessfully  to achieve for seven years -- it was decided to set up a joint  company to produce "Oka" cars.    "We had each made these cars at our own plans, now assembly  will take place solely at `KamAZ'," Nikolay Bekh explained. "We  have built a new block, the `VAZ' will transfer their welding  equipment to us and increase engine production. We are setting  ourselves the target of producing 75,000 vehicles a year."    In uniting to solve specific problems, "KamAZ" and "VAZ" are  in no way losing their independence. It is merely a question of  coordinating their common financial interests. Having won the  stockholders' support, Nikolay Bekh supposes that the final  signing of the documents setting up the Volga-Kama financial and  industrial group will take place no later than May.</p>

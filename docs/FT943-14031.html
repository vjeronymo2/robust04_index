			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / No sign of comfort in the south: US policy options over Haiti are increasingly pointing down the path of invasion For the Clinton administration, about the only good news to come out of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, this week was reports of bad weather. Rough seas buffeted the coast of the troubled Caribbean nation, slowing the tide of boat people and granting the White House the time it desperately needs to shore up its Haiti policy. The island has nettled President Bill Clinton since he took office in January 1993, forcing on him numerous about-turns. As more than 1,000 Haitians a day take to boats to escape deepening economic hardship and political repression, solutions to the crisis are fast running out. Even as Mr Clinton toured Europe this week, the outlaw nation 700 miles from the US coast was demanding his attention. US backing for the United Nations' trade embargo has so far failed to oust the military regime of Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, which overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991, and to return Mr Aristide as leader. Lt Gen Cedras remains defiant. This week, he ordered 104 UN observers out of the country as they were reporting increasing human rights abuses - including political murders and rape. If sanctions do not force Lt Gen Cedras to step down soon, pressure may mount for the US to do more than commit itself to leading a multilateral force to police Haiti if Mr Aristide is returned to power. Two considerations are propelling the US towards invading the country of 5.5m: first, the swelling numbers of refugees, and second, the deteriorating human rights conditions in Haiti. 'There are not any other politically attractive options short of military intervention,' said Mr Eric Melby, a former National Security Council staff member under President George Bush. Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's chief national security adviser, has said invasion appears inevitable. The US administration has stepped up its rhetoric in recent days, issuing thinly veiled threats of military action. Pentagon officials acknowledge the military has already drawn up and rehearsed detailed contingency plans for military action. With a four-ship amphibious assault group offshore, ostensibly ready to evacuate US citizens or other foreigners, the US could be ready to invade this weekend, when a command and control ship arrives to lead the assault group. But officials have said privately an invasion is more likely in early August, when the US Congress - hesitant, like the American people about the human and financial costs of military intervention - is in recess and thus unlikely to cause political embarrassment for Mr Clinton. The invasion would probably begin in darkness, as special forces move to secure the airport, presidential palace, radio station and port facilities in Port-au-Prince, according to Mr Daniel Goure, deputy director for political-military studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Following these units, the 2,600 Marines now off Haiti's coast would come ashore either by landing craft or helicopter to secure the capital. Mr Goure said they would be reinforced by paratroopers - probably the US 82nd Airborne Division - and units trained in jungle warfare, which would be responsible for controlling the rest of the country. Clinton administration officials have said it would take between 10,000 and 20,000 troops to capture the island. They would be likely to face little organised resistance from Haiti's ill-equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000. It is the prospect of a prolonged presence in Haiti that most worries the Pentagon. Mr Goure predicts the US would have to stay at least eight to 16 weeks, while a multinational peace-keeping force from Latin America and the Caribbean under UN auspices is organised and trained. He said there is significant a risk that Haitians, who harbour strong anti-colonial sentiments, would turn against their US 'liberators', as happened in Somalia. With no Haitian tradition of democracy, the US would have to provide much of the physical and political infrastructure for a new government. Even then, the chances of salvaging the poorest country in the western hemisphere are not good. Given these grim assessments, the US state department has been scrambling for a diplomatic solution. One option would be to build a reconciliation government including both pro-Aristide and pro-military factions. 'There still is the option of trying to support a government of reconciliation,' Mr Ernie Preeg, a former US ambassador to Haiti now with a Washington-based think-tank, said. 'That is the least bad alternative.' However, state department officials said the idea is no longer under discussion and Mr William Gray, Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said the time to negotiate had passed. Mr Clinton's problems with Haiti began during the 1992 presidential campaign. He described the Bush administration's policy of repatriating all Haitian refugees picked up at sea as 'illegal' and 'immoral'. Soon after he took office came the first embarrassment: the repatriation policy was maintained. Administration officials admit they panicked, following faulty intelligence reports which led them to believe a policy change would unleash 150,000 to 200,000 boat people on the US. Mr Rick Swartz, a Washington lawyer who represents several Haitian human rights groups, said Mr Lawton Chiles, governor of Florida - the state that would probably absorb most refugees - also lobbied Mr Clinton strongly to keep out the boat people. In June last year, the White House decided to back the sanctions to help speed the faltering talks with the regime. The tactic worked, and the Cedras government and Mr Aristide met at Governor's Island, New York, one month later. But when the US Navy attempted to bring Mr Aristide to the capital, Port-au-Prince, in October, the military reneged on the agreement. A US warship discovered an angry anti-Aristide mob at the dock and Mr Clinton ordered it to return home. Soon after, Mr Aristide began to criticise US policy toward the refugees. After a coalition of black congressmen took up Mr Aristide's cause, Mr Clinton in May announced the appointment of Mr Gray, a prominent former black congressman, as special adviser on Haiti. He also said the repatriation policy inherited from the Bush administration would change: all Haitian boat people would receive asylum hearings aboard US Navy ships off Jamaica. 'Under Clinton, (Haitian policy) has been driven predominantly by domestic politics,' Mr Preeg said. 'Very narrow interest groups that are pro-Aristide have a lot of influence.' The new policy prompted more Haitians to flee by boat, after reports that 30 per cent of those applying for asylum in ship-board hearings were being granted safe haven in the US - against 5 per cent at land-based processing centres in Haiti. Hoping to discourage the exodus and buy time for sanctions, Mr Gray announced another change: Haitians taking to the sea would no longer be given asylum in the US. They would be processed under a relaxed standard for safe haven in other countries in the region, most notably Panama - which had agreed to accept 10,000 boat people. Less than a day later, on July 7, the new US policy was dealt an apparently fatal blow. Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, facing strong domestic opposition, withdrew his offer to house the refugees. At that moment, the risky invasion which Mr Clinton had sought to avoid came one step closer.</p>

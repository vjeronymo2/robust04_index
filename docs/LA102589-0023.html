			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GARCIA EFFECTIVE BUT UNINSPIRED IN MAIN EVENT  </P> <P> On the excitement scale, Alex Garcia's 10-round unanimous decision over Eddie  Gonzalez at the Country Club in Reseda on Tuesday night ranked somewhere in  that gray area between watching old men get haircuts and spending a weekend  re-upholstering a sofa.  </P> <P> Even Gonzalez, of Houston, appeared bored with the bout. After the sixth round  ended he followed Garcia back to his corner and swore at him.  </P> <P> Garcia, 213, the former national super heavyweight amateur champion, never hurt  Gonzalez, 203. Gonzalez has fought most of his pro bouts as a light  heavyweight.  </P> <P> In a bout that did provide some action, Gabriel Ruelas of Arleta won a tough  but unanimous six-round decision over Freddie Santos of Tijuana in a  featherweight bout. Ruelas hammered Santos in virtually every round, but the  veteran Santos responded to each flurry with combinations of his own, rocking  Ruelas in two different rounds.  </P> <P> Ruelas is 17-0. Santos is 23-11.  </P> <P> Rafael Ruelas, Gabriel's brother, had a slightly easier time in his junior  featherweight bout. He landed a grazing right to the head of Margarito Ruiz of  Tijuana just 20 seconds into their bout, and Ruiz tumbled into a corner. Toward  the end of the round, Ruiz went down again and stayed on the mat for exactly 10  seconds. Referee Lou Moret saw no punch and asked Ruiz if he wanted to continue  fighting. Ruiz said no and was promptly disqualified.  </P> <P> "We'll hold onto his purse," said Don Muse, an official of the state athletic  commission. "We'll give him bus fare back to Tijuana and ask him not to come  back again."  </P> <P> In an earlier bout, heavyweight Rocky Pepeli of Simi Valley stirred up the most  excitement on the night, knocking out former Oklahoma wrestling star J. R. Frye  of Phoenix at 2:15 of the second round. He dropped Frye in the first round with  a left hook, then ended the bout with a crushing right that sent Frye face  first onto the mat, where he was counted out.  </P> <P> Pepeli is 6-2 with six knockouts. Frye is 2-1.  </P> <P> In other bouts, middleweight Jim Tunney, the grand nephew of former heavyweight  champion Gene Tunney, was knocked out in his debut by Fred Thomas (2-1-1) of  Los Angeles. The end came at 2:49 of the fourth round. Lightweight Ben  Contreras of Tucson knocked out George Wally (0-1) of Van Nuys.  </P></p>

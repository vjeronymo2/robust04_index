			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, May 2 KYODO -- Japan's new Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata arrived in Rome on Monday [2 May] night, kicking  off a series of official visits to Italy, France, Germany and  Belgium.    Hata's trip, which comes less than a week after he became  prime minister, is intended to forge personal ties with European  leaders ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group  of Seven (G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    In Rome, Hata will hold talks Tuesday with Italy's outgoing  Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Prime Minister-designate  Silvio Berlusconi. Italy currently chairs the G-7 process.    On a flight from Tokyo, Hata told reporters Japan wants to  strengthen relations with Italy and other members of the  European Union.    A planned meeting with Pope John Paul II was canceled due to  the pope's leg injury.    The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed due to the  volatile domestic political scene.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by </F> Peter Millar in Moscow; date not given, with additional  reporting by Matthew Campbell; from the SUNDAY TIMES News Review]    [Text] Moscow at the fag end of winter is filthy at the  best of times. These are not the best of times.    On the barren earth outside the city's Kiev station -- which  daily disgorges economic refugees from the hyper-inflated  poverty of the Ukraine -- Moscow council' s perennial workforce  of shabby, prematurely aged, thirtysomething women empty rubbish  bins on to dirty plastic sheets, drag the contents to a dusty  patch of dried mud amid bare trees, and set fire to them.    In the background stands the Slavyanskaya, the Russian  flagship of an American hotel chain and host to President Bill  Clinton during his Moscow visit. Only three years old and an  emblem of the new world order in the heart of the old evil  empire, its bathtaps now spit brown water speckled with grit.  An entire floor is undergoing major renovation, as if even the  hotel's concrete casing has fallen victim to Russia's incurable  ailment: attrition of the soul. This has been a long, cold  winter, spring has been late in coming and nobody knows what the  summer may bring.    The furthest east of Europe's great cities,  schizophrenically  straddling the invisible fault line with Asia, Moscow today is  being devoured by its inhabitants: a metropolis in the grip of  gangsters, drug-pushers and pimps. A society where the state  once ruled by fear, and commerce was a crime, has been replaced  by a jungle in which commerce is ruled by fear and anyone who  indicts crime is blown away by a shotgun-wielding hitman on his  doorstep.    Russia today is trapped in a moral miasma, a fin de siecle  social and cultural wasteland; the old idols have fallen, but no  new order has emerged to take the place of the toppled totems;  in the maw of chaos, there is only one fixed point -- demigod or  demagogue -- Boris Yeltsin.    In four years, the big man has slowed down. He may be 63,  but his build is as imposing as ever, his bearing as erect,  though now it hints at stiffness, even arthritic pain. The blue  eyes are no longer as bright or as penetrating, more inclined to  glaze over on a warm afternoon. These have been a world-shaking  four years by anyone's standards.    In the spring of 1990, he was still a wild card on the  fringes of Russian politics: a former Gorbachev ally ousted from  the ruling Communist party politburo and cast into disgrace, but  against the odds he climbed slowly back up the moving ladder of  the crumbling Soviet power structure. He operated from a  nondescript office on a high floor of one of the drab tower  blocks on the broad thoroughfare then called Kalinin Prospect  (after one of Stalin's stooges), but has since been renamed New  Arbat Street. Yeltsin then was a man in the grip of obvious  ambition: for power and for revenge on those who had humiliated  him.    Today, behind a formal gilt desk in the opulent splendour of  the Kremlin palace, with a chess clock in front of him to  dictate his timetable, he shows the stress left by the  intervening years. Years that saw him become Russia's first  democratically elected president, the crucial step in the quiet  internal coup that stole the heartland of the Soviet empire from  under Mikhail Gorbachev's feet. Unexpectedly, he became a global  symbol of freedom and bravery as he stood on top of a tank to  defy plotters who wanted to turn back the clock.    Last October, though, it was Yeltsin who gave the orders to  spill blood on Moscow streets, sending in tanks and reluctant  troops to storm the parliament building he had once defended,  and end a stalemate with the remnants of the old regime. He has  a right to look tired.    He becomes animated only when asked if he might ever be  forced to revisit that dark hour last October when he had to go  cap in hand to the military and beg them to follow his orders,  uncertain how they would reply.    "Today," he suddenly booms, grasping a pair of pencils like  the hilt of a sword and banging on the table, "today, the army,  the security service, the foreign intelligence service, the  ministry of internal affairs are all loyal to the president and  to the nation. They are marching behind him."    He pauses for dramatic effect before adding in a low growl:  "And they will continue to march behind him."    So would he ever again doubt his grip on the forces of law  and order? The answer is a brusque, definitive "Nyet". Then,  with the glimpse of a half-smile that remains part of the man's  charm: "At least I hope not."    The question today is what did he save, and for whom? His  very assertiveness has created a vacuum of reasonable men around  him, an absence of obvious successors. In a quiet, serious  voice, he concedes: "I am very troubled by this. Two or three  years soon fly past. It is a very difficult and complicated  task in this time to bring up a president who would be supported  by the whole people, by all 120 million voters."    He is dismissive of the man the West has demonised, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right. "Zhirinovskiy has no  hopes," he said. "Russians have been suffering for seven  decades with totalitarian regimes, so they are not likely to be  seduced by right-wing dictators. I'm sure of that."    It is not so easy to dismiss the Zhirinovskiy cocktail: a  well- stirred, fervent pan-Slav patriotism that embraces  outspoken nostalgia for the Soviet Union as a Russian empire and  has managed to unite new fascists and old communists marching  together under red banners and orthodox icons.    Yeltsin's dilemma remains his obligation to keep a weather  eye on Western reaction to any crackdown that could be  considered a slip back towards repression, yet still pre-empt  politically organised disturbances that could hide a fresh  attempt at revolution.    "It's high time we made these parties obey the force of the  law," he snarls.    Yet the unexpected success of Zhirinovskiy's faction in the  December elections and the surprisingly solid showing of the  communists have influenced Yeltsin's rhetoric, reintroducing  hints of old cold-war-speak to reassure those who believe the  country has been sold out to the West in exchange for a delivery  note for a mess of pottage.    Yeltsin had implied he would sign Nato's "partnership for  peace" pact by the end of March, but is now dallying: "There are  no political reservations... but some technical problems still  need clarifying."    Despite a personal appeal by William Perry, the US secretary  of defence, Yeltsin has ordered the postponement of the first  joint Russian-American military manoeuvres, which would have  been held on Russian soil, to avoid jeopardising an accord  reached with his opponents in parliament to allow the easy  passage of much-needed economic legislation.    This is a man who cannot be seen to be cowed. The suggestion  that biological warfare research, which The Sunday Times  revealed had been continuing behind his back, might still be  going on, is rejected testily. "I can be sure," he says,  "because my decree set up a very serious commission that checked  all the points and the whole programme has been shut down. We  suggested to the Americans that they join the commission to go  to see any points they like."    Yet the increasingly common public perception that  once-mighty Russia has become an American client state is one  that rankles not just with Yeltsin's concerns about voting  patterns but with his patriotism. In a private meeting with  chiefs of his Foreign Intelligence Service (the overseas  espionage wing of the former KGB) 10 days ago, he called for  increased vigilance against the CIA, accusing the American  intelligence service of continuing to try to recruit agents in  Russia, adding that "certain powers" had an interest in "keeping  Russia paralysed".    There is no doubt that the man who has consistently played  the Western card in Russian politics is bitter that the West has  not yet come up trumps in terms of material support: "Such sums  aren't coming. In Tokyo (at the G7 economic summit) they said  $44 billion. We received $1.5 billion. I don't know what will  happen in Naples. I think they are more interested in their own  difficulties, even though we are all in one boat."    It is with obviously sad pragmatism and no small touch of  self- conscious irony that the first Russian leader since 1917  to see and accept his country's interdependence on the global  economy finds himself forced to criticise the short-sightedness  of others. Of Moscow's Western partners he has words of praise  only for Germany and dismisses Britain's contribution to the  Russian reform process as "one of the last".    Yet he clearly expects little else. "What we want is an end  of discrimination against Russia in terms of trade, economic co-  operation, membership of international organisations and so  on... We don't want special conditions, but we also don't want  to be subject to discriminatory clauses."    External discrimination and insufficient aid are not the  root  of Russia's problems. The transition from dictatorship to  democracy, from sick centralised superpower to healthy, wealthy  market economy remains wrapped in trauma. At the heart, with  tentacles embracing every aspect of the embryonic economy from  small shops to banking, is a home-grown mafia with no conception  even of what the law ought to mean in a society that has been  turned on its head and shaken.    Yeltsin's analysis and prognostications sound glib at best,  at worst over-optimistic and ill-informed, reminiscent of the  most fatuous of old-style Soviet statements, as if his  presidential absolutism gave him the power to halt crime by  making it illegal. "We have passed a decree on reinforcing the  struggle against organised crime in the country and it has  produced positive results. At present the rate of increase in  criminality has been contained. It is down five times compared  to the same time last year."    Thankfully, realism intervenes: "But we cannot say we are  satisfied... We are recruiting more policemen, we are producing  more of our own equipment and importing from abroad to furnish  our police up to the level of other countries."    His grounds for optimism, though, are those of socialist  utopians down the ages: "I think that changes will be seen here.  With the improvement of the economy and the material standard  of living, crime will decline." Maybe, Boris, maybe.    Meanwhile the wages of sin are good enough for the new rich  of Russia; on a late midweek evening in the Teatro grill at the  back of the Metropol Hotel next door to an electronically  protected, used- car lot that clogs the once proletarian  pavements, sharp young men in designer sports jackets  brandishing mobile telephones like the fly whisks of oriental  despots are ordering Canadian lobster and French champagne.  There is something of egalitarianism left: they share their  table with burly minders in leather jackets. The moll is there  too, complete with tumbling Barbie doll peroxide locks and a  crotch-hugging micro skirt.    The cynical view is that not only has Russia's moral and  social switchback ride made the mafia inevitable, but also in  the medium term it may even be necessary. Its single-minded  dedication to the individual profit motive makes it an armed and  lethal third force against those who would restore state  collectivism.    A period of anarchic semi-lawlessness -- like the American  west in the 1880s or Chicago in the 1920s -- may be the  purgatory that Russia will have to go through to emerge with any  semblance of sanity. How long it will last is anyone's guess,  but it will last longer than Yeltsin.    To paraphrase John Reed, the American chronicler of the last  Russian revolution, the wrong-headed one of 1917: I have seen  the future, and it scares me like hell.</p>

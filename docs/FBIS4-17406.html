			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vinogradov and Yuriy </F> Grachev]    [Text] Vladivostok April 25 TASS -- The commander of  Russian border troops, Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev,  completed an inspection tour of Russian Pacific frontiers.  After his visit to Sakhalin, Kamchatka and the maritime  territory, he firmly said that Russian border guards are fully  combat-capable.    Nikolayev held consultations with maritime territory head  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko on strengthening cooperation between border  troops and civil population to guard natural resources.    Nazdratenko stressed at the meeting that it is high time to  put an end to the pillage of the Russian Far East: Chinese  poachers rapaciously pick up jinseng in the Ussurian Taiga,  while Japanese, Polish, Chinese, North and South Korean  fishermen illegally fish in the Russian sea economic zone.    However, the first days of the poach-control dragnet have  shown that, apart from foreigners, Russian fishermen are also  guilty of rapacious attitude to natural resources. The  coastguard service detained several Russian ships which had no  fishing licences.    Nikolayev departed for Khabarovsk on Monday.</p>

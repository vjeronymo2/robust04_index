			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: First Interstate to shed jobs First Interstate, the California-based banking group, announced plans to cut the equivalent of 3,000 full-time jobs as part of a move to raise productivity levels to rival those of the most efficient super-regional banks in the US. The job cuts, out of a total of about 26,000, will come over the next 18 months, the bank said. It has already slashed staff numbers by some 10,000 since the end of the 1980s. The latest move, announced at an analysts' meeting in New York, echoes the growing reliance of other US banks on cost-cutting to maintain earnings growth. At about 66 per cent last year, First Interstate's efficiency ratio (the ratio of non-interest expenses to revenues) was higher than the average for other big US regional banks. However, Mr Edward Carson, chief executive, told analysts yesterday that the ratio had come down to 60 per cent by June and was well on its way to reaching the earlier-announced target of 'at least 58 per cent' next year. The job cuts, and other changes to improve efficiency, will result in a restructuring charge of Dollars 139m in the current quarter, and a further Dollars 26m over the next year. First Interstate has around 40 per cent of its assets in its home state of California and the rest in other western states, which are among the fastest growing in the US. This, and the success with which it has already raised its profitability, has boosted the company's share price at a time when other bank shares have sagged. The bank's shares climbed Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 81 5/8 yesterday.</p>

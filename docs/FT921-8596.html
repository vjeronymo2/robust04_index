			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ciments Francais falls 59% CIMENTS Francais, the French company which is one of the world's largest cement groups, announced profits for 1991 down by 59 per cent to FFr400m (Pounds 40.94m) against FFr980m in 1990. News of the profits fall comes at a turbulent time for the French construction industry, which has been badly affected by the slowdown in the economy. It follows shortly after last week's announcement of an agreed FFr4.6bn takeover bid by the Fougerolle building group for Societe Auxiliare d'Enterprises (SAE). Despite the slowdown Ciments Francais did manage to increase sales by 6.5 per cent to FFr16.5bn in 1991.</p>

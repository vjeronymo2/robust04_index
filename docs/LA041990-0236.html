			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BABY PILLOWS RECALLED AFTER 19 INFANTS SUFFOCATE  </P> <P> Manufacturers are recalling more than 600,000 infant pillows and cushions  linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 infants, the government said today.  </P> <P> "Today we are announcing that nine of the 10 firms that made these cushions  have agreed to recall their products from the public," Jacqueline Jones-Smith,  chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a statement.  </P> <P> One firm whose pillows were involved with "more than several deaths" is  resisting the call and could face legal action, a commission official said.  </P> <P> "Don't buy them. Don't use them," Terry Rogers, compliance officer of the CPSC,  advised parents during a news conference on the recall. The agency staff  "believes these products clearly are dangerous," said David Schmeltzer of the  CPSC.  </P> <P> Nineteen children, age 3 months or younger, have been "found dead, lying  stomach-down on one of these cushions" since September, 1987, according to the  commission..  </P> <P> Commission staffers explained that the pillows are dangerous because they are  so soft they can conform to a baby's face. Because infants often are unable to  roll over by themselves, they can suffocate if they are placed face down.  </P> <P> The recall involves 627,825 small pillows or cushions filled with plastic foam  beads.  </P> <P> Recalled are 467,000 Mothers Helper cushions made by Hollander Home Fashions in  Newark, N.J.; 110,000 Gold Bug Support Sacks made by Gold Inc. of Denver;  35,700 Cozy Cushions made by Pinky Baby Products of Houston; 12,000 Cozy Baby  pillows manufactured by Cozy Baby Products of Mt. Vernon, N.Y.; 3,000 Baby  Minder cushions made by The Fourth Little Pig of San Anselmo, Calif., and 125  Baby Sak pillows made by Baby Sak of Pembroke Pines, Fla.  </P></p>

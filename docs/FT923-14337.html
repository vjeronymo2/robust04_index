			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Russia 'must gain controlof monetary expansion' THE LEADERS of the Group of Seven industrialised democracies will today stress that Russia must gain control over its rapid monetary expansion if it is to avoid hyperinflation and grave social and political instability. According to officials, they agreed at their summit meeting yesterday to be 'friendly but frank' and spell out plainly what the G7 can and cannot do when Russia's President Boris Yeltsin joins the leaders for talks later today. Mr Yeltsin, who arrived in Munich last night, will not leave empty handed, however. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, yesterday underlined that the G7 would provide 'help for the Russians to help themselves.' A senior US official said he would take home 'a very substantial package' comprising Dollars 1bn (Pounds 521m) in credits agreed with the IMF, a pledge that the G7 will back rescheduling of official debts of Dollars 2.5bn and a further Dollars 1bn to be released by other financial institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A Canadian official said the rescheduling would be a 'normal' arrangement of the type that the Paris Club of creditor countries provides for nations with debt problems. It would have a five-year grace period with repayments over the following 10 years. Once rescheduling is agreed, the way would be open for G7 countries to disburse bilateral trade credits to Russia, as part of the Dollars 24bn financial support package announced in April. Altogether, Russia can expect Dollars 11bn in bilateral flows from western industrial countries under the April accord and is thought to have received between Dollars 4bn and Dollars 5bn already. But some promised credits have been held up as a result of growing arrears on existing debts. According to Mr David Mulford, the US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, it is 'possible' that the planned Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund could be activated by the end of the year. However, for that to happen President Yeltsin's government will have to obtain a firm grip on credit growth, inflation and its budget deficit so that the rouble can acquire stability. Russia will also have to regulate financial relations with republics staying in the rouble zone to ensure its monetary policies are not undermined. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is due to start the G7's talks on economic matters with Mr Yeltsin today. In addition to underlining the need for monetary stabilisation, he will stress the importance of structural reforms including privatisation and land reform and provision of a safety net to cope with rising unemployment following closure of uneconomic factories. Russia was pressed yesterday by both the G7 in Munich and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, meeting in Helsinki, to withdraw its 130,000 troops from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, writes our Foreign Staff. A statement issued for the G7 by Germany said Russia's economic difficulties did not justify keeping its troops on the territory of unwilling countries.  A brief CSCE statement called for 'an appropriate bilateral agreement, including timetables, for the early, orderly and complete withdrawal' of the troops. The three Baltic states have demanded that troops should begin withdrawing immediately and complete an internationally supervised pullout by the end of next year. Russia says it has nowhere to house those forces and no money to build accommodation and wants to extend the withdrawal until 1998.</p>

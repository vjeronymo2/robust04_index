			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Wanting it both ways: Europe When the French first elected a conservative majority to parliament, in 1986, to serve alongside their sitting Socialist president, they called it 'cohabitation'. Some said it proved the stability and the democratic maturity of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. But history rarely repeats itself. Next Sunday's election will again bring the right back to power. But this time the swing of the pendulum will be so fierce that cohabitation may test the constitution close to destruction. The Socialists face the prospect of a humiliating defeat. Its severity will certainly shake the Socialist party to its foundations; the lesson may have equally seismic repercussions on the whole of the French political system; but its most immediate constitutional effect may be to undermine the political authority of the president. The conservatives are virtually certain to win an overwhelming majority in parliament. The Gaullist RPR party and the UDF centre-right grouping could between them get over 400 seats; the Socialists could drop to as few as 100. This must lead to frequent tests of will between the government and the president. And they are likely to be more intense than in 1986-88, because the right will have a much bigger majority. Some conservatives talk as if the scale of their prospective majority will give them the power, and even the right, to force President Mitterrand out of office. If so, France would be facing not cohabitation, but a major constitutional crisis. This crisis may not occur. First, the conservative parties are deeply split on policy, and these splits are likely to gape wider as a result of the size of the conservative majority. Second, the leaders of the conservative parties are already locked in near-mortal combat for the presidential election looming two years away, and this struggle will become their top pre-occupation the day after the parliamentary election. So the new government majority may be much weaker than its size would imply. A third factor could precipitate a constitutional struggle, however. In their election campaigns, Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, both included protectionist commitments on agriculture, which could threaten serious conflicts with France's European partners and with the wider world of international trade. They have called for a renegotiation of the European farm policy reform package agreed by the 12 a year ago; both have rejected the farm deal provisionally agreed last year between the European Commission and the previous US administration. President Mitterrand may not be one of nature's free traders; with high and rising unemployment, he may even believe that some reversion to France's atavistic protectionist reflexes would be politically popular; but his commitment to the closer integration of Europe is absolute. If Chirac and Giscard seek a major battle with the Community over the farm policy, this could provoke a fight with the president; and it is not clear, under the constitution, who would win. The fundamental question posed by this election, however, is not whether the constitution can handle a political conflict between the president and the National Assembly; it is whether the political system in general can offer answers to the country's problems. The Socialists will be repudiated on a grand scale: they have been there too long, and they are too contaminated by corruption. But there is no wave of popular enthusiasm for the conservative parties: the prospect is for a large protest vote. The ecologists, the Communists and the extreme right-wing National Front could between them rack up some 35 per cent of the total. The huge conservative majority will be mainly due to the French voting system, which penalises small parties. A second reason is that part of the Gaullist party has shifted sharply to the right; it is eating into the support of the National Front by openly espousing nationalist and anti-European nostrums. Last year the Maastricht treaty votes revealed deep hostility among a majority of Gaullist members; the party is likely to have even more anti-Community members next time round. However, the conservative leaders are trying to have it both ways. They are promising a leap back in history, in the hope of appealing to the farmers and the anti-Europeans; Chirac even promises to boycott the Community, in order to block an EC-US farm deal. On the other hand, they insist on France's continued commitment to the strong franc policy, and they promise new initiatives to strengthen monetary links with Germany, coupled with the independence of the Banque de France. The explanation for this contradiction is simple: the election victory is a poisoned chalice for the conservatives. They do not have an answer to the central political problem, which is unemployment; and they have no alternative economic policy to that of the Socialists. By the time of the 1995 presidential election, they will have been in power long enough to be held responsible, but will not have been able to bring down unemployment. In addition to the scapegoats from the past (the Socialists), therefore, they must set up external enemies, in Brussels and Washington. You may think it rather difficult to combine a protectionist policy on agriculture with an integrationist policy on money; so does Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister. But if you were Bill Clinton, toying with the pros and cons of starting some trade conflicts with the outside world, you would have one reason to hold your hand: the French may take the blame for firing the first shot.</p>

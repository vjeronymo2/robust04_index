			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>   [Text] President Nelson Mandela has decided to take up  permanent residence at Libertas in Pretoria.    This means that Deputy President F.W. de Klerk will have to  find a new residence.    According to information released to BEELD, Deputy President  de Klerk will occupy Overvaal, the former administrator's  residence in Pretoria.    Mr. Joel Netshitenzhe, President Mandela's spokesman,  yesterday confirmed that President Mandela had decided on  Libertas. President Mandela temporarily stayed at the  Presidency on the Bryntirion Estate while he was considering a  house in Pretoria.    Mr. Netshitenzhe said it would depend on discussions between  Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk when Mr. Mandela would move into  Libertas.    It could perhaps happen around the end of the year, after  the  close of the parliamentary session, BEELD was told.    Deputy President Thabo Mbeki still lives in Johannesburg. He  is considering various options in Pretoria. One of them is  Goede Hoop, also on the Bryntirion Estate, a spokesman from his  office said.    The Presidency had earlier been the official residence of  the  state president in the days when South Africa still had a state  president and a prime minister. The prime minister then lived  at Libertas.    When President P.W. Botha became the first executive  president, he stayed on at Libertas.    The Presidency had thereafter been used as a state guest  house and a conference center.    People who have been in both say the Presidency is a  "coldish  place with large rooms," while Libertas is a "warm and  comfortable house."    Mrs. Marike de Klerk, De Klerk's wife, helped to restore  Libertas. Earlier this year the house was declared a national  monument.</p>

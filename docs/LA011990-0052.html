			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH SUES FOR $2 MILLION OVER PIER'S COLLAPSE  </P> <P> The city of Redondo Beach has filed a lawsuit against a San Pedro engineering  firm alleging that it failed to properly design and inspect a pier that  collapsed during a heavy storm nearly two years ago.  </P> <P> In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Torrance Superior Court, the city contends  that Don Hellmers Engineering did not design the pier, which was known as the  Fishing Promenade, to withstand storms.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also alleges an inadequate inspection by the engineering company  three months before the pier's collapse in April, 1988, which prevented the  city from making necessary repairs. The city had asked for the inspection that  January following a vicious, two-day storm that resulted in an estimated $17  million in damage to King Harbor.  </P> <P> Hellmers Engineering, which advertises itself in the telephone book as  specializing in harbor facilities, refused to comment Thursday.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which charges Hellmers with negligence, breach of contract, fraud  and deceit, seeks more than $2 million in damages. City Atty. Gordon Phillips  said the city had no written contract with Hellmers and in pressing the suit  must rely on an oral agreement.  </P> <P> The lawsuit contends that Hellmers, which designed the pier in 1982, failed to  adequately determine how far the pilings should be driven into the harbor  bottom. The suit also contends that the company's design did not call for the  pilings to be cross-braced.  </P> <P> In January, 1988, King Harbor was severely damaged after a combination of heavy  rain, high tides and winds ravaged the popular recreation area. A large hotel  and more than two dozen smaller businesses were damaged, and numerous boats  sank. A dozen people were slightly injured.  </P> <P> About four months later, another storm hit Southern California and the pier  collapsed, causing further damage to several nearby businesses and surrounding  piers.  </P> <P> The pier, built in 1985 to connect the Monstadt and Horseshoe piers, has not  been rebuilt.  </P></p>

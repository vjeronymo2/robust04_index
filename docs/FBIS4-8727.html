			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivo Zaloudek: "According to Deputies, We Should </F> Counter the Potential Threat From Russia by Joining NATO"]    [Text] We should counter the potential military threat in  the event of undemocratic developments in Russia with efforts to  join NATO as speedily as possible. At this time, however, the  danger is not imminent. Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic  Alliance), chairman of the parliamentary Defense and Security  Committee, and deputy chairmen Jan Kasal (Christian and  Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party) and Pavel Tollner  (Christian Democratic Party) agreed on this answer.    "The Czech Republic has satisfied the political conditions  for joining the Alliance," Suman said and added: "I am  convinced that if a real threat arose, our army would defend the  sovereignty of the country. The quality of army morale is a  different matter, and we will have to do a lot of work in that  area. Most of the people in the supreme command are doing their  best in this respect. We do object, however, to some actions of  the defense minister -- one instance is the practical execution  of the special assessment [screening] in the army."    Jan Kasal said: "I am troubled by the idea that in the mind  of some Russian politicians, our republic has not ceased to be a  component of its sphere of influence, but since Ukraine and  Slovakia are located between us and Russia, it is not necessary  to see Russia as the direct potential enemy and aim the training  of the army in this direction. Nevertheless, it would be wrong  if the Defense Ministry published these matters in a completely  open manner, and therefore, as I am not a member of the Defense  and Security Committee, I myself do not have access to any  details."    According to Pavel Tollner, the danger on the part of Russia  is based, above all, on its economic instability -- one example  is the issue of "economic" refugees. "The potential military  threat depends on the development of the political situation in  Russia, which no one can predict," Tollner said.    A deputy of the opposition Czech Social Democratic Party,  Stanislav Gross, also perceives the danger from Russia as  potential, and he believes the entry of the Czech Republic into  NATO is a solution. Left Bloc Chairman Marie Stiborova, on the  other hand, declared: "If any major and broader based conflict  arose, neither armies nor arms would help." According to  Stiborova, we should not join NATO "because if there were  problems coming from Russia, they would be augmented by the  expansion of the Alliance as a counterbalance to something else,  like Russia, for instance."</p>

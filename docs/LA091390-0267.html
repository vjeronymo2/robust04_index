			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS OPPOSE PLANS FOR COMPLEX  </P> <P> Despite the pleas of neighboring residents, the city Planning Commission  approved plans for a Whittier Boulevard auto repair complex on the city's  western side.  </P> <P> "I never thought they'd put in a business that would vomit noise and fumes into  my back yard," said Joseph Gorman, a 27-year resident whose home is near the  auto repair shop.  </P> <P> Plans for the service center call for three one-story buildings containing six  business units and totaling nearly 20,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Syrie Louderman, another resident of West Linda Avenue, told the commission  that she circulated a petition among homeowners and found a "groundswell of  opposition."  </P> <P> The petition, bearing 27 signatures, cites noise, air pollution and aesthetics  as reasons for denying the project.  </P> <P> But proponents of the project said it fits the existing land-use requirements  for the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We are in conformance with the general plan," said Bill Handley, the project's  engineer.  </P> <P> Several commissioners sympathized with the sentiments of neighbors but  suggested there was no legal basis for denying the proposal.  </P> <P> "Since it complies with all city requirements I have to be in favor of this  proposal," Commissioner Charles Taylor said.  </P> <P> Chairman Paul Thornburg agreed. "I have no choice but to approve it, even  though I'd rather not," he said.  </P> <P> Commissioner David Cheverton was the lone dissenting vote. Although he  initially proposed amendments to the list of conditions applied to the project,  Cheverton ultimately voted against approval.  </P> <P> The amendments, which were ultimately included in the approval, restrict  operating hours to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, disallow bay doors  facing the residences and forbid auto body work or spray painting in any of the  businesses.  </P> <P> Thornburg told the residents that they have 10 days to appeal the decision to  the City Council. The neighbors gathered outside City Hall after the hearing to  plan their strategy. Gorman announced that there would be an appeal. DAVID F.  BURKE  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: IBM to create new role for mainframe computers International Business Machines yesterday announced products that it claims will 'fundamentally change the nature of large-scale computing'. The announcement came almost 30 years to the day after the group launched its first mainframe computers. IBM's sales of its flagship mainframes dropped sharply over the past few years as many commercial computing tasks switched from centralised mainframes to distributed networks of lower cost personal computers and servers. Aiming to create a new role for mainframe computers in the era of networked 'client-server' computing, IBM announced two new classes of computers, based on microprocessor technology similar to that used in PCs and workstations. Faster, smaller and cheaper, the new systems bring the low-cost semiconductor chips used in PCs and workstations into the mainframe arena. The products are System/390 parallel servers, based on a new microprocessor version of IBM's traditional mainframe computer 'engine', and POWERparallel systems, based on the reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology that IBM also plans to use in a new generation of PCs. 'These systems deliver what customers tell me they want: lower cost, more power and protection of their existing trillion dollar investment in software,' said Mr Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice-president. The S/390 parallel servers, one designed for transaction processing applications, such as credit card processing, and the other for database query applications, such as customer support, will both run on software written for traditional IBM mainframe computers. IBM announced a 'coupling facility' that links these 'new world' systems to 'old world' mainframes automatically balancing the computing workload across all systems. The new server technology gives IBM 'at least a year's jump on the rest of the field', said Mr Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, an analysis group.</p>

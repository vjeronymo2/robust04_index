The leader of Russia's  Choice parliamentary faction spoke here on Thursday at a  colloquium "the Future of Reform in Russia" organised by the  Konrad Adenauer Foundation.    Gaydar said special anxiety is caused by the fact that under  the decision of the State Duma not only politicians involved in  plots and coups but also such characters as Barkashov, Anpilov,  Terekhov and their associates will be absolved of  responsibility. "I do not have the slightest doubt that upon the  release from custody these people will resort to their former  activity and will exert every effort to destabilise the  situation and unleash bloody clashes in Moscow again on May 1  and 2, 1994", Gaydar said. He believes that chances for calm  democratic development in Russia decreased considerably and  Russian democracy is threatened.</p>

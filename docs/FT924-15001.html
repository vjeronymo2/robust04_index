			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Management: Could do better by most accounts - Andrew Jack has been casting an eye over company annual reports and finds many of them wanting The annual report may be one of the most important forms of communication between a company and its stakeholders, but it is also one of the least understood. In spite of the rapid growth in consultancies to help with production, the standard annual report remains poorly illustrated, unimaginatively laid-out, tedious, and short on information and honesty. There are even some signs that standards are dropping. Each year, the Stock Exchange and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales sponsor an annual reports award; this year the judges took the unusual step of refusing to give out the prize for the best report from a small company, arguing that none was of sufficient quality. A series of studies by design consultancies over the last few months backed up that verdict and extended it to companies of all sizes. The studies may be part of efforts by the consultancies to stoke up business. But among the generalisations and self-promotion are some useful findings. One of the most outspoken studies has been by Peter Prowse Associates, a Leatherhead, Surrey-based marketing and communications consultancy. Its 'Company Report Report' earlier this summer names what are seen as bad, as well as good, examples among the top 50 European quoted companies. Among the worst offenders, according to Prowse, are Associated British Foods for 'an unstylish, old-fashioned look'; GUS for 'skimpy brevity'; Holderbank for being 'deadly dull'; Munich Re and Generali for lack of photographs; and MD Foods for poor translation. Other examples are the reports of BTR, which included the phrase 'at the beginning of 1990, we referred to an apprehension of recession which materialised soon after'; and Ciba-Geigy, which said: 'A process of dynamisation with modern forms of leadership and teamwork was started.' A study by Meridian Design Consultants, based in London, is equally scathing. Among the reports of the top 100 quoted companies, it found 'chairmen's photos apparently shot in railway station photo booths . . . people with phones growing out of their ears . . . and tableaux of terrified-looking factory workers suddenly confronted with the chairman'. Prowse was critical of the 1991 Boots report's picture of chairman Sir Christopher Benson for its poor background. Not all reports are bad. Prowse also highlights good examples among retailers, including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury. These combine clarity, ease of reading, direct personal statements from chairmen and chief executives about objectives and strategy, and graphics illustrating success. Many companies remain sceptical of the role of designers and their advice. But David Clutterbuck, chairman of the Item Group, a communications consultancy, stresses the value of professional help. He says that with poor design and poor text in a document, people retain less than 10 per cent of the important messages. With good design and well-written text, they can retain 50 per cent or more. Prowse Associates says the best reports have at least five elements: Persuasion - to convince readers that the company has been well-managed and is successful, backed up by supporting facts. Promise - with statements about the future and clear objectives. Education - basic information on what the company does. It is estimated that 10 per cent of readers are seeing the report for the first time. Honesty - details of significant events during the year, good or bad, rather than concealment, which irritates. Magazine-standard quality - photos, sub-headings, boxes, charts and general design which makes for easy reading. Clutterbuck argues that, while reports increasingly reflect the importance of design, the concentration is on the 'packaging'; text is often neglected and squeezed in almost as an afterthought. One problem for those preparing annual reports is having to appeal to different audiences, from the analyst well versed in financial issues, to the individual shareholder or employee with very different interests and less specialist knowledge. McBride's Design Consultancy discovered that analysts wanted more information on the value and use of assets, capital expenditure and market detail. Private shareholders, however, wanted greater detail on long-term performance and fewer profiles of key staff. The growing role of professional design may not be entirely positive. Aziz Cami, of The Partners, another consultancy, says that many reports are becoming rather formulaic, with a regular structure of mission statement, financial highlights, a divisional and, increasingly, an environmental statement. The wider use of design consultants may also be bad news for those looking for signs of the true health of the company. An analysis by two academics in City University Business School in London earlier this year showed that the use of certain words and phrases in the chairman's statement - such as 'thanks to our bankers for their support' - can often be used as an indicator of imminent collapse. It is likely that such unguarded comments are likely to become fewer with the increasing use of consultants to prepare polished texts. Before companies go overboard in bringing in expensive consultants, they might also take heed of one US annual report of a rather different kind which breaks all the rules. Mark Lee, of Watermark, a corporate identity consultancy, points to Berkshire Hathaway, the US group controlled by Warren Buffet. There is no graphic on the cover, no photos anywhere, and - apart from the financial statements - nothing inside except the chairman's address, which is written in a very clear style, rich in homespun homily, and runs to 19 closely-printed pages. The lack of design seems to have done little to harm Buffet's company, which grew 40 per cent in net worth to Dollars 6.4bn last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The opposition political parties Republic  Democratic Movement [MDR], Social Democratic Party [PSD],  Liberal Party [PL], and Christian Democratic Party [PDC] have  said that the deployment of the UN force to Rwanda has come too  late, for hundreds of thousands of people have already been  killed. In a letter to the United Nations dated 20 May 1994,  the political parties said that the role of the UN force to  Rwanda is expected to be exclusively humanitarian. The force  should not be used to protect criminals responsible for the  genocide in Rwanda. These should be tried in an international  tribunal. [passage omitted]    The political parties want the deployment of the extra UN  forces to Rwanda to coincide with the setting up of an  international commission of inquiry to investigate the genocide  that has been committed in Rwanda. The political parties MDR,  PSD, PL and PDC, commonly known as the Democratic Forces of  Change, believe that the cease-fire should be negotiated between  the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan Government forces  because the government in Rwanda is illegitimate and has been  responsible for the massacres in the country.

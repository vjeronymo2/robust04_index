			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OKS NEW CURBS ON OFFSHORE DRILLING;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: DESPITE HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT PRE-LEASING RESTRAINTS OFF  CALIFORNIA, BUSH SIGNS THE $11.2-BILLION INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL.  </P> <P> President Bush on Monday signed into law tough restrictions on offshore oil  drilling and pre-lease preparation activities, temporarily settling another  struggle between drilling interests and lawmakers stirred by the Exxon Valdez  oil spill.  </P> <P> Terms of the far-reaching moratorium were worked out by House and Senate  conferees last month as part of the $11.2-billion appropriations bill for the  Department of the Interior. The President signed it in spite of reservations  about pre-leasing restraints off the California coast.  </P> <P> "Notwithstanding these reservations, I have signed the bill because its  benefits -- particularly the treatment of many environmental, conservation and  energy-related issues important to the nation -- outweigh my reservations," the  President declared.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Bush set aside aggressive drilling plans for the outer  continental shelf until a task force he created could complete studies of the  impact of drilling off the coasts of Southern and Northern California.  </P> <P> But the House went even further, extending the moratorium to the huge Lease  Sale 119 off the central California coast. Language inserted into the bill also  suspended pre-lease activity off the central coast.  </P> <P> In addition to the restraints on drilling and drilling preparation off  California, the measure signed by Bush also temporarily prohibits drilling off  the coast of Massachusetts, in an area of the outer shelf stretching along the  Mid-Atlantic states, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the Florida Keys.  </P> <P> The National Research Council is due to make a report to the President's  drilling task force next week, giving its assessment of the impact of offshore  drilling. Task force recommendations are due to be on the President's desk by  Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the task force chairman, has indicated  that the panel may decide to give the President an outline of options in  offshore drilling policy rather than presenting formal recommendations.  </P> <P> When the Senate passed the Interior bill earlier this year, it placed no  restraints upon pre-lease activities -- steps that include studies and paper  work. But when the measure went to conference to work out differences with the  House version of the bill, California congressmen pressed for a ban on any  pre-leasing activity, including the preparation of environmental impact  statements.  </P> <P> A standoff threatened to send the offshore drilling provisions back to the  floor of both houses unresolved. However, Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) struck  a compromise banning pre-lease activity until five months after completion of  the task force report to the President.  </P> <P> Lowery said the compromise will effectively prevent any pre-lease activity off  the central coast for the rest of the current fiscal year. Pre-lease activities  were nearing completion and the preparations were proceeding toward leases off  the northern and southern coasts when Bush's drilling moratorium was declared.  </P> <P> The measure signed Monday also included compromise language attempting to  protect the logging industry in the Pacific Northwest, while at the same time  saving the habitat of the endangered spotted owl.  </P> <P> Both the environmental questions and Congress' addition of more than $952  million to the Administration's Interior budget request were lost in an uproar  over the bill's funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities.  </P> <P> Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) tried to attach an amendment blocking funding for  "obscene or indecent" art, but lawmakers managed to somewhat defuse the  furiously debated issue with a compromise blocking federal funding of such  material if it is without serious "literary artistic, political, or scientific  value."  </P></p>

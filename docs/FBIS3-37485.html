During combat operations Armenians sustained many losses and  lost an armored vehicle, says Baku.    Fighting also continued in the south of the Fizuli Region  near the strategic railway station of Goradiz. The Azerbaijani  Defense Ministry reports that over the past two days Armenians  have lost about 600 men.    Sources in Stepanakert have not confirmed this information.    The headquarters of the Karabakh army told Interfax that  Azerbaijani forces attempted to launch an attack on the village  of Tonashen in the Mardakert Region. The Karabakh formations  rebuffed that attack.</p>

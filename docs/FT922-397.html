			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Bottomley defends 24-hour GP cover MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, delivered determined messages to doctors and dentists yesterday. She told the conference in Harrogate of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts that she regretted a decision by family doctors this week in favour of ending responsibility for 24-hour cover. She was willing to explore with British Medical Association leaders ways of improving the existing cover arrangements, but said she wanted to build on rather than dismantle the tradition of round-the-clock commitment. 'Access to a family doctor 24 hours a day, in cases of urgent need, is one of the hallmarks of British general practice,' she said. 'I do not want to see it put at risk.' Mrs Bottomley also spoke about the dispute over dentists' remuneration. Dentists are balloting on action over a proposed 7 per cent reduction in fees which the government says is necessary because earnings are exceeding those recommended by the dentists' pay review body. Mrs Bottomley said she was determined to safeguard the NHS dental service against any action by dentists, which could include refusal to treat NHS patients. She had written to health service authorities reminding them of their powers to employ salaried dentists directly if necessary. The authorities had a frontline role to play in maintaining an NHS dental service and she expected them to take 'whatever steps they must'. This autumn's public spending round, the health secretary acknowledged, will not be an easy one for ministers bidding for extra resources. She pledged, though, that the proposed community care reforms due to come into effect next April would go ahead on time and be 'fairly resourced'.</p>

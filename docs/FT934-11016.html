			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Croats and Serbs talk in Norway CROAT authorities and Serb separatists have been holding secret talks in Norway on brokering a ceasefire, a Serb official revealed yesterday. Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, Croatian security chief, headed the Croatian delegation, and met Mr Goran Hadzic, 'president' of Krajina, and his 'foreign minister', Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, at the three-day talks, said diplomats. Observers immediately began drawing parallels between the clandestine negotiations and the Palestinian-Israeli talks held in Norwegian farmhouses, which ended in a milestone peace agreement. But Serb officials yesterday said the two sides remained far apart despite leaked reports that Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, would meet Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, in Oslo later this week. 'We can gain absolutely nothing, because at this time neither side is willing to back down,' said Mr Branko Filipovic, 'foreign ministry' official of Krajina, the self-styled Serb state which covers one-third of Croatia, cutting the republic in half and isolating Croatia's Dalmatian coast from the country's heartland. The Bosnian army's chief-of-staff and two other senior officers, including one commanding a district hit by Moslem separatism, were dismissed yesterday, Sarajevo radio said, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The radio said General Sefir Halilovic and the commanders of 4th Corps and 5th Corps, based in Mostar and Bihac were discharged.</p>

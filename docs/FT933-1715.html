			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME's 'despicable' copper intervention criticised THE LONDON Metal Exchange board was strongly criticised yesterday for allowing an hour to go by between the end of a meeting at which directors decided to intervene to stop the 'squeeze' in the exchange's copper market and the announcement of that decision. During that hour the copper price fell 'precipitously,' said Mr John Champagne, a vice-president of Magma Copper, the third-largest US copper producer. In an outspoken condemnation of the LME's actions, he also suggested it was 'despicable' for the board to favour by its decision those who were short of copper (those who had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of buying it later at a lower price) because most of the LME board members were 'short'. Answering questions at a Magma presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in London, Mr Champagne said the LME board had sent out a signal that would encourage those going short of metal to believe that in future their losses on the exchange would be limited. Before he joined Magma in 1988, Mr Champagne was president of Cargill Metals and responsible for the non-ferrous metal trading activities of Cargill, probably the world's biggest commodities trader. From 1978 to 1981 he was based in London and was a member of the LME. Any intervention at all in the market by the LME board was 'regretable', he said yesterday. 'Markets are to be left alone.' He added: 'In the long run if, the LME continues to do things like this it will pay a heavy price.' The LME board took emergency action on September 8 in response to widespread suggestions that its 'flagship' copper market, on which most purchase contracts around the world are based, was being manipulated to boost the price. It limited the daily backwardation (premium over the future price for metal for immediate delivery) to limited to Dollars 5 a tonne saying this was 'in anticipation of the development of an undesirable situation in the copper market'. This intervention eventually resulted in the technical tightness disappearing and the three-month copper price has fallen by nearly 10 per cent, from Dollars 1,947 a tonne to Dollars 1,749.50 and close to the lowest levels for nearly six years. Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, said last night he would not comment on Mr Champagne's remarks until he had full details and, as there was no written text, this might take some time. Mr Champagne said he intended to outline his complaints in a letter to Mr King. Mr Burgess Winter, president, said the joint venture company Magma had set up with BHP of Australia had last Friday bid for the El Abra copper project in Northern Chile put up for sale by Codelco, the state-owned group. He said the fiercest competition from among several other bidders was likely to come from RTZ Corporation of the UK or a joint venture between Cyprus Minerals of the US and Lac Minerals of Canada. Magma's bid, if it was revealed because it was successful, would be judged by some observers to be high, Mr Winter said. However, there would be a good return on the investment and it would pay for itself very quickly. Codelco studies indicate that the project could produce 265m lb of copper a year using low-cost oxide leaching, solvent extraction-electrowinning methods.  -------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------- Aluminium  +14,450  to  2,169,775 Copper      +6,350  to    554,225 Lead        +3,450  to    286,900 Nickel        +984  to    113,322 Zinc        +4,950  to    789,450 Tin            -30  to     21,420  --------------------------------</p>

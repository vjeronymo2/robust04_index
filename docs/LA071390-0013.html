			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> 5,000 ACRES BURN NEAR STATE PARK  </P> <P> A fast-moving brush fire burning out of control near Chino Hills State Park had  blackened about 5,000 acres and forced the evacuation of the park.  </P> <P> Officials said the blaze was burning away from residential areas and no homes  were in its path. A 15-year-old boy admitted to authorities that a bottle  rocket he fired into the air sparked the fire when it landed, Orange County  Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said. "He saw that it started a fire  and he tried to put it out," Sabol said. "He received minor burns to his right  leg. He did admit to starting the fire." The boy was released to his parents.  Three inmate firefighters received minor burns, Sabol said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lindita Karadaku] </F>   [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- "The border point of Hani i  Hotit has not been closed," confirmed the spokesman of the  Albanian Ministry of Public Order, refuting a report from the  Automoto League of Former Yugoslavia according to which  "Albanian bodies do not allow the entry of cars with Yugoslav  number plates to Albania." The spokesman said that there is a  strict border control in Hani i Hotit due to the fuel  trafficking. Several Albanian and Montenegrin citizens involved  in the traffic have been detained. Control is being made mainly  for vehicles but this does not hinder the movement of citizens  from both sides of the border.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F> BOHEMIA magazine with Jose Alejandro Rodriguez of JUVENTUD  REBELDE newspaper; date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [O. Rodriguez] I think that, as has been analyzed on  previous occasions, in a society like ours, money hoarders must  get their resources from state funds and state stores. Compared  to a continental nation, there are no borders through which  contraband could enter here. These money hoarders do not import  anything from abroad, they have no contacts abroad, so they get  everything here, they steal everything, they divert everything  from state resources. I believe this is a very important issue  because if we are trying to fully eradicate the problem and  prevent it from ever occurring again, we must go to the root of  the problem and investigate why these money hoarders emerge as  tycoons, as we have seen in some recently published cases.    [J. Rodriguez] Yes, Osvaldo. Evidently, the money hoarders,  this phenomenon of ill-gotten wealth, as you said, does not come  from abroad, from outside our country. As you said, we are an  island; there are no private suppliers or warehouses here. There  are joint enterprises, but these have obligations to the state  rather than to individuals.    [O. Rodriguez] These enterprises have very little stolen  from  them because they have the best control methods.    [J. Rodriguez] Of course, because they do not want to lose  revenue.    [O. Rodriguez] Not only that, I believe they have very good,  effective control methods, so very little pilferage takes place.    [J. Rodriguez] Yes. Now what happens, this phenomenon that  we  face... [pauses] many times we see only the final result of the  phenomenon. It is true we must counter the phenomenon of  ill-gotten wealth, and it is true that a series of measures have  already been implemented; but we must also investigate how this  happens, what factors allow it, what phenomena in our society  encourage or endorse this behavior and these actions. Osvaldo,  it is also true that the great amount of resources they handle  can come only from our own enterprises' warehouses.    The country has a deficit of raw materials and products in  every sector -- we know that even pins are scarce in our country  -- so we cannot understand how reports on the first results of  the operations indicate that certain products, which are stored  and controlled by the state, end up in these persons' houses.    [O. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel.    [J. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel -- fuel we do not have,  Comrade.    [O. Rodriguez] Yes, of course.    [J. Rodriguez] We do not have it and we are experiencing  great problems in the energy sector. We find that these people  have even stored oil. That oil comes from a base, from a....    [O. Rodriguez interrupting] A state-owned base.    [J. Rodriguez] Certainly. A state-owned base. No one here  gets a tank of oil by mail from another country.    [O. Rodriguez] Certainly, certainly not. They also have soy,  fodder, and cement. They have built large houses. How do you  build a large house? You can build a large house only by  stealing the materials. Everyone knows that. Those who have  built houses on their own know how difficult it is to complete  one. In normal times -- we are not talking about the crisis, we  are talking about normal times when it was easier to get  construction materials -- it takes many comrades three, four, or  five years to build their houses. Sometimes it takes 10 years  because it also depends on the financial resources available.  Well, these people are capable of building three-story houses,  eight-room houses, mansions in six months. These people have  undoubtedly stolen a considerable part of those materials from  the state. Of course, I do not think they have stolen all of the  materials from the state.    [J. Rodriguez] Obviously.    [O. Rodriguez] These people also have other things -- for  example, cars and motorcycles.    [J. Rodriguez] Of course, of course. The main source of  their  riches, meaning the profitable thing -- that which allows a  person to achieve a status that is 15 or 20 times higher than  that of any citizen -- is essentially a result of the products  stolen from the business sector due to the lack of controls.    [O. Rodriguez] I think our reasoning about the lack of  controls should be expounded upon so that we make our listeners  aware of the individual participation that each one can have in  this control. Whenever we think about control, we think about  the enterprise's director or manager, and we forget about the  warehouse employee, the driver, the receptionist, the clerk,  everyone. Those who do not handle the resources at least get to  see them.    [J. Rodriguez] Of course.    [O. Rodriguez] They see the merchandise; they see when it is  removed; and they can remain alert to any developments.    [J. Rodriguez] Look, Osvaldo, there is a specific example of  this phenomenon about the lack of control. It was discussed even  during the previous period of sessions at the National Assembly  of the People's Government. It is one of the cardinal problems  that must be tackled head-on. I am talking about the lack of  discipline in bills and payments between enterprises.    [O. Rodriguez] This helps to hide the pilfering.    [J. Rodriguez] All the pilfering. For example, I am a  supplier of detergent, and you are the dry cleaning enterprise  -- this is a hypothetical example, unrelated to any particular  case. I send you a monthly amount. All this has to be supported  by documentation. This is why accounting was invented; it has no  other purpose. The problem is to make people comply with the  accounting system. At times, we ask ourselves: Why is this not  followed? I am convinced there are people, managers, who have  not attributed the proper importance to economic control, but  there are also people who benefit from the lack of economic  control, shoddy accounting, and a lack of strictness because  otherwise, they would lose their supply line. We mention the  lack of discipline in billing and payments. I send you the  detergent and that has to be accounted for by documents that we  both sign. You buy the detergent and I supply the detergent. If  you never pay me through the bank or by documents for my  shipment however, what guarantee do I have that the shipment  made it to your enterprise? This is how much of the pilfering  has been accomplished. This detergent is later sold to us on a  street corner -- a little can of detergent costs I do not recall  how much.    [O. Rodriguez] Yes. If I did not pay for it, if it did not  make it to my inventory, I do not have to answer for what I did  not pay for. Yet, I received the product.    [J. Rodriguez] There are two possibilities: Either you are a  foolish businessman -- a luxury we cannot afford -- or you are  aware of what you are doing and are promoting the lack of  control, which benefits many individuals. This is also what  happens.    [O. Rodriguez] Yes. I think this example is very  enlightening. I believe it reflects why the billing and payments  problem continues. I believe this example, which is  hypothetical, as you pointed out, takes place over and over at  hundreds of enterprises.    [J. Rodriguez] If it was a foreign company, they would make  sure they were paid what they are owed because it affects their  profits. However, since at times we separate the two -- this is  for the state, not for me -- then we do not worry, and John Doe  is expected to pay.    [O. Rodriguez] Yes, I think your reasoning is logical, but I  would like to slightly disagree with what you said at the end.  You said that if there is a foreign company, they make sure they  get their money. I believe there are many Cuban enterprises and  state enterprises that get paid. We have mentioned negative  examples here of foolish managers or managers who are  voluntarily on the take. There are also many honest, good  managers, however, who have other problems with their  enterprises in achieving control. There are other reasons, such  as structure, guidelines, excessive centralization of the  decision-making process, and other things. There are places that  observe control measures, however. In Cuba, we have places that  are exemplary in terms of controls, not only in the civilian  sector, but also in the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. The  industrial enterprises of the FAR are a good example of  controls. I believe that you have written in JUVENTUD REBELDE,  and earlier in TRABAJADORES, about control and how there are  places, warehouses etc., where even the smallest screw is  controlled, and nothing gets lost.    [J. Rodriguez] I believe this is, above all, a problem about  political willingness. As you say, there are many enterprises  that have always displayed a great zeal for strict controls.  This also depends on the combined willingness of the people  involved and their awareness of its importance.    Before, we used to say: Yes, we must meet the plan at any  cost. That was a standard cliche. At this juncture, however, in  terms of the economic endeavor, and above all, because of the  way we are pressured and affected by the national economic  situation, we cannot afford to lose even a pin. This is one of  the essential problems. We have conducted campaigns for  trustworthiness in accounting, and plans to control rotations  and essential resources. We have done all kinds of things. Many  more things can be developed, however. But what is decisive is  the human and political will to protect the resources.    [O. Rodriguez] I believe that individual responsibility is  needed even more, a commitment to watch over those resources.    Returning to the initial subject: What has been seized from  money hoarders demonstrates that there is a lack of control in  many places. They have great amounts of spare parts, cars, fuel,  and resources. Therefore, I believe those are the cracks in the  state economy that permit the emergence of money hoarders, their  wealth, and their continued abuse of the rest of the population.</p>

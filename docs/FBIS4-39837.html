			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- Dniester mass media  announced a possible withdrawal of the Moldovan police from  Tighina (Bender.) Victor Catana, the co-chairman of the Join  Control Commission, told BASAPRESS that this is untrue. "Bender  is an inseparable part of Moldova and thus the city police is a  constitutional organ," he said. According to the [1992] Snegur-  Yeltsin agreement, the city is declared a zone of high security  and, hence, the Moldovan police's presence in Tighina is  established by the same agreement, said Catana. According to  him, the local administration subordinated to the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic exerts pressure on the police  and this results in increased crime. "Regardless of these  actions the police will stay in Bender to perform its duty of  protecting public order and the rights and interests of the  people," concluded Catana.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Toyota Motor Corp. has begun assembly production of  the passenger car "Camry" (Japanese name "Scepter") in Malaysia  with parts supplied from Japan and Australia. Previously, all  parts were procured from Japan for passenger car production in  Malaysia. This is the first time for overseas assembly  production that parts circulate between three countries.    It is the Assembly Service Company of Malaysia that has  begun  assembly production. The company is an assembly company  100-percent financed by the local agency of Toyota, and it  produces Toyota passenger cars and commercial vehicles. It had  produced the passenger cars "Corolla" and "Corona," but because  the Corona did not suit the local market and sales were  dropping, it was switched to the "Camry." It produces 100 to 200  cars a month.    In production of the "Camry," undercarriage parts such as  the  transmission are supplied from Japan, and body parts and  interior items from Australia. Some minor parts are procured  locally in Malaysia. The parts procurement rate is 65 percent  from Japan, 25 percent from Australia, and the remaining 10  percent locally.    As an export promotion policy, Australia considers import  portions corresponding to the amount of exports to be duty-free.  Toyota is producing the "Camry" in Australia and if it supplies  parts to Malaysia, it can receive preferential tax treatment in  procurement of parts from Japan. Toyota has decided to aim at  creating an optimum parts procurement system by this mutual  circulating of parts.</p>

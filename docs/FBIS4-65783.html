			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Erik Bjorn Moller report: "Government Expects Only Minor </F> Delays"]    [Text] Even though the Swedish environment minister is  jubilant and is predicting a new round of consultations in  Sweden, the Danish Government tried to play down the Water  Rights Court's surprising finding. "A minor problem," was the  transport minister's comment.    The Water Rights Court's call for new calculations of the  water through flow in the Oresund will not lead to much delay  for the Oresund project. It is simply a case of a "minor  problem" that will shortly be dispatched.    That was the optimistic comment from the government  yesterday  after the Swedish Water Rights Court's surprising call for new  calculations of the Oresund project's environmental impact.    While Olof Johansson, the Swedish environment minister and  an  opponent of the bridge, was jubilant and was talking about a new  round of consultations in Sweden, Danish Transport Minister Jan  Trojborg (Social Democratic Party) hurried at record speed from  a meeting of Nordic ministers in Nyborg to an emergency meeting  of the cabinet. And later in the day he had to brief the group  following the progress of the Oresund project on developments  that for the time being at least have in reality deprived the  Danish political parties that are in favor of the bridge of any  influence over the future of the bridge.    Once again Danish supporters of the bridge were able to note  that it is now "up to the Swedes," and that "we naturally expect  them to keep their side of the bargain."    Trojborg even went as far as to call the Water Rights  Court's  ruling "a step in the right direction." However, when asked, he  admitted that he had been hoping for a clearer pronouncement  from the court.    The transport minister is convinced that the two governments  will be able to produce the calculations that have been  requested as early as next week: "And it is my hope that the  Swedish Government will be able to reach a decision in the space  of a relatively short period of time. I am expecting only  minimal delays. Today the Swedish Government has confirmed the  existing agreement between Denmark and Sweden. There is no  reason to dramatize the situation."    According to Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell  "there ought to be no suggestion of significant delays." "But  in fact we will not know anything until we find out about the  decisionmaking process that the Swedes are contemplating. And  we will not find this out until next week. But now we must  apply pressure for them to keep their side of the bargain."    Hans Engell called the decision "surprising, because the  experts' material was so well documented and comprehensive." He  also dissociated himself unambiguously from Olof Johansson's  remarks about a new round of consultation in Sweden.    "This would be a very unfriendly act toward Denmark," Engell  said.    Not unexpectedly, the Socialist People's Party, the Radical  Liberals, the Progress Party, and the Christian People's Party  exploited the court's pronouncement to underline once again the  hostile view they take of the bridge. "Halt all construction  activity now. We now have the court's word that the project is  far from being as well founded or as environmentally neutral as  the parties in favor of the bridge have claimed hitherto," the  Socialist People's Party's Steen Gade said.    The Christian People's Party's Ole M. Nielsen said that a  new  investigation into the impact of the bridge will be one of the  party's new demands in any negotiations to reach agreement on a  possible future government base. He is considering a proposal  that all the parties opposed to a bridge should enter into a  sort of musketeer agreement -- all for one and one for all -- so  that regardless of which party is involved in the negotiations  to produce a government platform, it will demand a new  investigation of the bridge.</p>

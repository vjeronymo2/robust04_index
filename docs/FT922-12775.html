			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / IBM lifts revenues 3.3% in quarter INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has reported a rise in revenue and earnings for the first quarter, reversing a year-long decline. The computer group said US revenues rose almost 10 per cent in the quarter. However, sales outside the US remained flat. Worldwide revenue for the first quarter of 1992 was Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8bn), up 3.3 per cent from Dollars 13.6bn a year ago. Net earnings from operations for the three months were Dollars 595m, or Dollars 1.04 per share. This compared with Dollars 556m, or 97 cents, a year earlier when IBM took a Dollars 2.26bn charge against earnings reflecting a change in accounting for health benefits. Net losses were Dollars 2.99 a share. Comparisons with 1991 first quarter results were further complicated by the restatement of earnings to reflect a new accounting method for software revenue which increased earnings from operations by 4 cents a share. 'Overall, we're pleased with these results and believe we're on track toward achieving our financial objectives for the year,' said Mr John Akers, chairman. IBM's results cheered Wall Street which had predicted earnings of between 90 cents and 95 cents for the quarter. IBM shares rose to Dollars 88 3/8 at close of trade from a Monday close of Dollars 87 1/2 . Analysts said the first-quarter results were a significant step toward IBM's recovery. Last year IBM reported its worst-ever financial results including its first-ever annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after charges and its first revenue decline in 45 years. IBM announced plans in December to eliminate up to 20,000 jobs worldwide this year. The company also launched a reorganisation of its operations to give business units greater autonomy. Details of IBM's first-quarter earnings show that revenue from hardware sales slipped 2.7 per cent to Dollars 7.12bn from Dollars 7.31bn in the first quarter of 1991. However, IBM said its 'almost double-digit' growth in US revenues was led by hardware sales and services. Total revenue in Europe declined in the quarter, IBM said. However, Asia Pacific revenue rose, helped by IBM Japan's acquisition of the remaining interest in Computer Systems Leasing, a finance company that leases IBM equipment to users.</p>

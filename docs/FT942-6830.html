			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Japanese household spending falls 4.3% Household spending in Japan slipped by 4.3 per cent in March, the worst year-on-year decline since 1981, the government's management and co-ordination agency announced yesterday. This is the second month of spending decline, a worrying reversal of a four-month run of increases in household spending to the end of January and a sign of the continuing economic challenges facing the government of Mr Tsutomu Hata. The spending figures cast doubt on Japan's chances of an imminent, consumer-led recovery and increase pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce its official discount rate (ODR) to give the flagging economy a psychological lift, economic analysts said. The official rate, at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, has stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September. Yesterday, it stood a mere 0.3 percentage points below the overnight money market rate, at which commercial banks lend to each other. That leaves the Bank of Japan little room to intervene to cut short-term money market rates, which are already at a record low, unless there is another reduction in the ODR. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, warned this week that corporate balance sheet adjustment and the pace of labour-shedding were amongfactors that might impede growth. However, the bank has so far used the money markets to influence interest rates. Management and co-ordination agency officials argued that part of the March spending decline was caused by delays in car purchases, ahead of a fall in car sales tax in April. Its survey also shows a 0.4 per cent decline in wage earners' real incomes in the year to the end of March, the first such drop for 13 years. Bonuses (a large part of annual wages) and wives' income from part-time work both declined, the agency said. The survey showed that spending on food, furniture and clothing fell, while households spent more on housing, utility charges and medical care.</p>

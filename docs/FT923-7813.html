			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Airs in the castle SUMMER chamber-music festivals proliferate. Leading musicians, whether singly or in groups, long to step off the international concert circuit of one-night stands in far-flung cities; and when the weather improves, the craving to come to roost among like-minded spirits for music-making in reposeful, artistically refreshing circumstances grows in parallel. The inauguration of the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont in 1950 was Rudolf Serkin's method of satisfying just such a desire; other methods have been found by - to name only a handful - Richter at the Granges de Meslay, Hermann Prey at Hohenems, the Sibelius Quartet cellist Seppo Kimanen at Kuhmo, and most recently Andras Schiff at Mondsee. Indeed, the number of lively variations on the theme prove that the combination of special place, programme rationale and performers can, when successfully judged, hold a precious appeal for artists and audiences alike. A new Swiss festival can be added to the list. It is the Kyburgiade, which owes its name to the castle (8 miles south of the city of Winterthur) in whose courtyard most of the events are held. It has been devised by Stephan Goerner, cellist of the Zurich-based Carmina Quartet, and consisted of a Thursday-to-Sunday succession of five concerts with a tight thematic binding to their programmes (music of the 1824-29 period). The cast of players was limited: the Carmina, the Hagen from Salzburg and the Vogler from Berlin - three of the most celebrated young string quartets of today; the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair (who sang the 'Schwanengesang', admirably, in the acoustically mushy Winterthur town hall); the cellist Heinrich Schiff and the clarinettist Paul Meyer to add voices to quintets; and the piano trio of Hans-Heinz Schneeberger, Thomas Demenga and Jorg Ewald Dahler (who gave a Sunday matinee in the town hall). Small beginnings. If the pleasures and, not least important, the box-office results of last weekend's first Kyburg outing are any thing to go by, the prospects for the festival seem alluring. The road to the castle, gently rising through the wooded hills outside Winterthur, is the first of those pleasures; the arrival in the 10th-century Schloss Kyburg itself is the second - up a winding cobblestone pathway, across the fortified entrance, and into a superb enclosed courtyard resting beneath fortress towers, bright-painted half-timbered walls and geranium-filled window boxes. The mixture of imposing and inviting physical features is exactly balanced, as it generally proves to be in all the best festival locations; one feels exhilarated merely by being there. But the make-or-break issue is, of course, acoustics. The courtyard offers warmth, surprising intimacy. As a youth, Goerner, a Winterthur native, attended summer-serenade concerts there and dreamed of making the place his own musical home. The Carmina has now joined the elect among the world's quartets, and the dream has been made flesh - with the assistance of (it appears) every living Goerner relative and friend, and with a liberal dash of the Swiss genius for organisation that is efficient without being overbearing. A wooden platform, resting over the courtyard fountain, serves as centrepoint for the 900-or-so seats spread in a round. The exposure to the skies gives delight as evening fell; it also made for unscripted dramas during all three Kyburg evening concerts. During the first, given by the Hagen and Schiff, sudden breezes impishly turned score-pages of the Beethoven B flat quartet, Op. 130. Insects stung bowing hands during the Schubert Quintet (for the rest of the festival the entire platform was rubbed down with insect repellent). During the second, given by the Vogler, distant lightning began to flash, and after the interval a fierce wind brought a magnificently concentrated account of the Schubert G major quartet to a midpoint close: the Swiss Radio microphones - all the concerts were being broadcast live - had been insufficiently weighted, and were about to crash down upon the players. Winds, again, blew and clouds gathered during Sunday evening's Carmina finale; the threat of storm (though realised only next morning) lent urgency to the proceedings. In spite of every such hazard the spirit of chamber music flourished in this outdoor 'chamber'. The programme provided a continual source of stimulation in forging links between the carefully juxtaposed programmes. Similarly, there was continual interest and illumination in contrasting the technical styles and interpretative modes of address of the three quartets: the Hagen, lyrically relaxed (sometimes to a fault; and the first violinist's intonation wavered far too often); the Vogler, athletic in the very best sense, building up an energy in their Beethoven Op. 135 that was at once vigorously intellectual and thrillingly physical; and the Carmina, whose breadth of phrase, close-blended ensemble and unforced corporate musicianship joined to communicate interpretative maturity of the richest and deepest kind. Above all, the four days offered cumulative testimony that the festival ethic, when treated as an ideal rather than merely a tourist attraction, retains imperishable cultural value. Future Kyburgiades will surely expand their programmatic range and length, will no doubt deal with the incursions of the elements hardened by this year's alarms and excursions. The basis of the enterprise is already firmly founded, and the future looks bright. The Zurich Kantonalbank was principal sponsor</p>

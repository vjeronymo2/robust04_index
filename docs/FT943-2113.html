			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Motion to scrap monarchy rejected Liberal Democrats yesterday voted by an overwhelming majority against a policy of abolition of the monarchy, but called for 'a radical trimming' of the royal family's budget. In the first debate at a political party conference on the issue, several speakers argued that the monarchy should be discontinued after the reign of the present Queen because hereditary rule was unacceptable in a modern democracy. But delegates were strongly swayed by the argument that the party's standing with the public would be badly damaged if it backed abolition. Several party MPs had privately expressed concern that, after voting to decriminalise cannabis, Liberal Democrats risked antagonising public opinion by passing another unprecedented resolution. Opening one of the best-attended debates of the conference, Mr Alex Wilcock of Liberal Democratic Youth and Students said all government posts in a democracy must be open to everyone, elected by the public and subject to regular scrutiny. 'The monarchy fails on all these counts,' he said. Another speaker, Mr Norman Baker, said he could not understand why a member of the royal family like the Duke of Gloucester should receive an annual salary of Pounds 100,000. 'You can tell a lot about a country that has a Royal Mint, but a national debt,' he said. However, Mr Archie Kirkwood, the party's chief whip in the Commons, appeared to win over many of the delegates by arguing that they needed to attack the abuse of power by government ministers rather than royalty. Deciding not to call for the abolition of the monarchy 'subject to a referendum', the conference instead called for a cut in the size of the Civil List and 'the redefining of the roles of members of the royal family apart from the monarch'.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / BA to oppose French curbs British Airways is planning to challenge the French government in the European Commission in Brussels as well as through the French courts if it goes ahead with proposals to limit the size of aircraft and flight frequencies on services from London to Orly airport in Paris. Although BA will start operating services from London Heathrow to Orly on Monday, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, yesterday said that the proposed restrictions at Orly were 'illegal' and would be challenged by BA. France bowed to European Commission and British government pressure last month to open Orly to UK airline competition. But Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said UK airlines would be restricted to four flights a day and that only larger aircraft with more than 200 seats could use Orly at peak morning and evening hours. He also said that BA and its French affiliate, TAT, would be regarded as one airline in terms of frequencies. Although BA intends to fly only four daily services to Orly this summer, it plans to operate extra flights this winter in defiance of the French proposal to limit frequencies from London. Sir Colin also said BA would soon file an objection with the European Commission to French government plans to inject FFr20bn (Pounds 2.33bn) in additional state aid to Air France.</p>

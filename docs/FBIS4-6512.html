			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea will soon  have access to enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear  bombs once it removes spent fuel from one of its nuclear  reactors, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Thursday.    The communist country will have to remove fuel from its  5-megawatt reactor "within weeks," Perry said at a news  conference here. "The fuel will provide sufficient plutonium to  make four to five nuclear bombs."    "We believe it's critical that this operation is supervised  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he said.    Emphasizing that Patriot missiles are purely a defensive  system against conventional weapons, Perry made clear the  anti-missile missiles will not be withdrawn from South Korea  even if the tension over North Korea's nuclear program subsides.    The IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, first estimated that  North  Korea would have to change the nuclear fuel rods at its reactor  last summer.    It is believed that North Korea has yet to change the rods,  and the IAEA says it must be present when the procedure takes  place to verify whether the Stalinist state extracted more  plutonium from the fuel than it reported to the agency in the  past.    While Pyongyang's secretive nature rules out an exact  assessment of its nuclear status, Washington can say "with  confidence" that "North Korea has a major nuclear weapons  program under way," Perry said when asked to comment on how  advanced the program is.    Pyongyang has the 25-megawatt reactor, a 200-megawatt  reactor  under construction, a radiochemical laboratory and a  high-explosives testing facility, according to the secretary.    "The only possible explanation for these facilities is a  major nuclear weapons program," said Perry.    The United States can only guess how much nuclear fuel was  diverted in the past, he said. "We estimate that there was  enough plutonium in that fuel to make one or two bombs. We  estimate they probably have the capability to convert that  plutonium into bombs. We estimate they have had enough time by  now to succeed in doing that."    Perry flew into Seoul Tuesday for a visit centering on  analyzing, planning and preparing for future developments  following North Korea's refusal to allow full IAEA inspections  last month.    Just a day earlier, Perry and his South Korean counterpart  Yi  Pyong-tae announced they would go ahead with the annual "Team  Spirit" military exercise in November unless the inspections  were concluded successfully.    Calling the joint maneuvers a defensive exercise, Perry said  the two countries still hope that diplomatic persuasion can  bring North Korea to comply with the inspections.    "We plan to pursue diplomacy firmly and patiently unless  there is no hope for success in diplomacy anymore," he said. "If  that happens, we go together to the UN to impose sanctions on  North Korea."    Perry also defended the Patriot deployment, describing the  system as purely defensive which "has no offensive capability at  all."    "... It is part of a regular modernization program that has  been planned actually for several years, and there is no reason  to withdraw," he said.    "It's not here because of the nuclear weapons program. It is  designed to defend against conventional Scud attacks."</p>

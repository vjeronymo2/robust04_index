			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Oil group sees Sch1bn deficit OMV, the Austrian oil and chemicals group, has reported heavier nine-month operating losses and forecast an operating deficit of around Sch1bn (Dollars 83m) for 1993 as a whole. Nine-month turnover was Sch59.44bn, down from Sch60.73bn in the same period of 1992. Operating losses for the nine months were Sch735m compared with Sch383m. Restructuring, including plant closures and drastic cost-cutting measures in the plastics and chemicals divisions, will cause extraordinary losses of about Sch3.7bn and bring the full-year net loss to Sch4.7bn. Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said the losses were due to the severe recession in the chemicals business and low crude oil prices. The gas business was the group's most profitable activity and there was a small profit from refining. However, the results will not affect OMV's privatisation and foreign expansion plans. Mr Schenz said 'privatisation will not really be affected because large investors know we have a restructuring programme'. Almost 30 per cent of OMV is in private hands with more than half held by foreign investors. The government plans to sell a further 20 - 25 per cent stake to a strategic foreign partner next year before full privatisation of the company in 1995. The group is negotiating to buy 35 per cent of Slovnaft, the Slovak petrochemicals company, and wants to take a stake in Magyar Olaj, the Hungarian energy group which is being privatised.</p>

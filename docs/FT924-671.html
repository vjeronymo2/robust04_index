			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Damages for rig fire witness A MAN who witnessed the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster from a rescue vessel is entitled to claim damages for psychiatric injury, the High Court ruled in a test case yesterday. Mr Francis McFarlane, 44, from Alloa, near Stirling, has not worked since the disaster in which 164 died in 1988. Mrs Justice Smith ruled that Mr McFarlane was a 'primary victim' of the 'horrifying calamity' because of his closeness to it.</p>

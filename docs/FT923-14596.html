			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (34): Still a new market - Groupware Products ALTHOUGH there are increasing numbers of software packages which are claimed to be groupware products, this is still a relatively new market. Two of the most innovative products in the UK are Lotus Notes and FCMC's Staffware, writes Philip Manchester. Lotus Notes has attracted significant support from large consultants such as Arthur Andersen, Touche Ross and Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, all of which are developing systems based on Lotus Notes. Customers include BP, General Motors and Lloyds Bank. Lotus Notes provides a groupware application environment for use in personal computer networks. It contains the bones of groupware applications and programming features which can be used to create customised applications. It can be used for applications such as customer tracking, status reporting, project management and what Lotus calls 'collaborative free-form discussion.' Although the roles of many corporate head offices are being devolved and modified, more controls are nevertheless needed to ensure that decisions which are made at various levels - ie closer to the customers - are not eventually detrimental to other parts of the organisation, explains Winston Muktarsingh of Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte. 'This requires controls on information-flows in very quick time. Lotus Notes helps to facilitate this,' he adds. Like most groupware products, Notes uses the client/server model of computing which separates the 'front end' of an application from the 'back end.' The user or 'client' sees a screen with a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to any other personal computer application. Under the covers, Notes links to services such as database management systems and electronic mail which are powered by other computers known as servers. These servers can be located in the same office or across the network. Lotus Notes can handle different data formats which are produced by other software packages - processing documents and tagged image format files (TIFF). Notes works with both of the main PC networking systems - Novell's Netware and OS/2 LAN manager. Price: from Pounds 395. Further enquiries: Lotus Development (UK), Lotus Park, The Causeway, Staines, Middlesex, TW18 3AG. Tel. 0784 455445. Staffware: this system can be used to set up 'workflow' procedures with rules which can be applied to the flow of data. This can be something as mundane as the procedures in an accounts department to complex quality control procedures manufacturing. Like Lotus Notes, Staffware can be used with existing software such as databases and wordprocessing programs or complete office automation systems. The Staffware rule structure accommodates deadlines to ensure that procedures are completed by staff using the system. Staffware will send reminders if deadlines are missed. The system also keeps track of progress, giving management an up-to-date 'audit' of the system and the current status of specific procedures. Staffware runs under the Unix and Xenix operating systems. British Telecom uses Staffware to automate its buying procedures, and also as an electronic suggestion box. The US Veterans' Administration uses Staffware for document tracking. Staffware is also sold by ICL under the name Powerflow, and by Unisys under the name Office Procedures. Last September, FCMC signed up IBM UK to combine Staffware with the Uniplex office automation system which is sold under the name Application Pack (AP) 6000, an office automation package for IBM's RS/6000 workstation. Price: from Pounds 750 per workstation. Further enquiries: FCMC, 46 Chagford Street, London NW1 6EB. Telephone: 071 262 1021.

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST COVINA REMAINS IN LIMBO ON PUBLIC WORKS BACKLOG  </P> <P> Despite pleas to "bite the bullet" and stop waffling, the City Council  postponed a decision on how to fund a $34-million backlog in public works  improvements.  </P> <P> At a special meeting on Monday, the City Council backed away from deciding on  any action, which could include imposing new taxes. The council's only decisive  action was to direct city staff to avoid any decrease in existing services.  </P> <P> Since September, the city has been considering a proposal to institute a  politically unpleasant utility tax or a special assessment district to foot the  bill for improvements ranging from street repairs to storm drain work. The  proposal was made by a 25-member citizens committee, which assessed the city's  capital needs and the means of meeting them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Little Shocked'  </P> <P> "I'm a little shocked by the shortsightedness," committee member Tom Lorincz  told the council in criticizing its discussion.  </P> <P> "Why did the committee sit there for 18 months?" he asked in an interview. The  council is "not going to find anything we didn't look at."  </P> <P> Either of the committee's funding alteratives would have to be approved by  residents. The utility tax would need a majority vote, and the assessment  district would require two-thirds approval.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert L. Bacon said he agrees with the committee's conclusion, but added  that the prospect of a new tax or assessment district succeeding at the polls  is nil without strong support from council members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unanimous Support Needed  </P> <P> "The other council members were apparently afraid of proceeding," Bacon said.  "Without unanimous council support, it will divide the vote so much it won't  pass."  </P> <P> Bacon predicted that the council will continue to grapple with the issue until  a majority comes to the same conclusion.  </P> <P> Councilman William Tarozzi, who advocated cutting the city budget to pay for a  reduced amount of capital repairs, predicted that a utility tax would never be  approved by voters.  </P> <P> In a voluminous report, the citizens committee recommended levying a 3 1/4% tax  on the estimated $97 million in annual sales of electricity, natural gas,  telephone service and cable television subscriptions. At that rate, the tax  would raise $3.17 million annually over its proposed 15-year life, according to  the committee report. The estimated weekly household cost would be $5.  </P> <P> The assessment district was the committee's secondary recommendation because of  limits on its use and the two-thirds approval needed at the polls.  </P> <P> In a presentation to the council, City Manager Herman R. Fast compared the  city's financial situation to that of several surrounding communities of  similar size. The conclusion, according to Fast's staff, was that West Covina  is an efficient city, saddled with a small tax base and a large proportion of  residential development.  </P> <P> For example, West Covina has 43.9 staff members per 10,000 residents; Covina, a  city half the size, has 44.9 and Pomona, which is slightly larger, has 61.9,  Fast said.  </P> <P> Fast recommended that the council pursue either the utility tax or the  assessment district, and that the city resist making budgetary cuts, which he  said would erode the quality of life for West Covina residents.  </P> <P> Bacon said it was unrealistic to think that the city can accomplish the repairs  without finding a new revenue source. "I don't think there's a lot of fat in  the budget; we're a well-run city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lean and Mean' Budget  </P> <P> Although saying that the city budget was already "lean and mean," Councilwoman  Nancy Manners advocated cutting back on council stipends and other minor  expenditures before "we ask (the public) to approve something that we don't  even agree on."  </P> <P> Councilman Richard Lewis proposed that service not be cut to fund the capital  improvements. Tarozzi was the only council member to vote against the motion.  </P> <P> Tarozzi suggested paring back or postponing some of the capital repairs and  instituting either a one-year salary freeze or laying off 5% of the 430  municipal employees. Tarozzi's proposal would have spared the Police and Fire  departments and included a 10% cut in operating materials and services.  </P> <P> A wage freeze, however, would violate a three-year agreement the city recently  entered with most of its staff and could not happen immediately or without an  unlikely concession from employees.  </P> <P> Bacon criticized "Tarozzi's voodoo economics," but said "until he either backs  off or comes to the realization that we cannot possibly fund these items  without some new source of revenues, we're not going to get (a new tax) passed,  and there's no need to put it on the ballot."  </P> <P> Councilman Brad McFadden proposed that each department's budget be cut by 10%,  which he said could be implemented through layoffs or operational decreases. He  also demanded that developers of the proposed expansion of the Fashion Plaza  shopping center give the city $23 million in expected profits to help pay for  the improvements.  </P></p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Boost for regional powers in S Africa THE African National Congress and the South African government have agreed to devolve more power to regions in post-apartheid South Africa, in an attempt to persuade right wing parties to accept a new constitution, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. The move follows nearly a year of negotiations on power-sharing between regional and central government. They must obtain agreement on this issue from the so-called Freedom Alliance grouping Inkatha and white right-wing parties if the new constitution is to have broad legitimacy. The proposals, which would deny regions the right to levy their own taxes, and which would guarantee central government a veto over matters such as regional policing and education, may not satisfy the Freedom Alliance whose members demand either a federal or a confederal constitution. The proposals emerge at a crucial phase of the negotiations, with participants aiming to finalise a new constitution within a fortnight.</p>

He said  that in the future Cuba will implement a diplomatic offensive  policy because we are tired of being on the stand as a defendant.    Robaina said that in Vietnam he is concluding what has been  announced as a diplomatic offensive through several regions in  the world with the purpose of explaining to several governments  the truth about our country and studying our economic  experiences.    Our tours of the Caribbean, some Latin American nations,  Africa, and now Asia, have conveyed to our interlocutors a broad  vision of the process Cuba is experiencing, within a climate of  respect and understanding, Robaina said.    He added that in these contacts Cuba has found elbow room to  personally explain the current Cuban situation and to say what  the great news media fail to say.    Our country is not the hell it is said to be nor the heaven  we would like it to be, and for this reason it should not be on  the stand as a defendant, Robaina said. From this moment on we  are going to begin a diplomatic offensive in an effort to  consolidate our legitimate aspirations and to expand our  international relations.    During a news conference held in Vietnam, Robaina said that  we are a country open for dialogue, willing to negotiate  everything, except our independence, sovereignty, and  revolutionary achievements.    The Cuban foreign minister said that 1994 will be a year of  intensive work which includes a new tour of some Latin American  nations in the beginning of April.    On concluding his visit to Vietnam, Robaina added that his  project includes a visit to the Middle East in the near future,  but before that his country will host the conference between the  nation and the emigre community, a meeting with the Cuban  community abroad.    Robaina said that the conference will be held in Havana  between 22 and 24 April with the participation of Cuban citizen  who reside in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela,  Argentina, the Caribbean, and other countries.    Robaina went on to say that the objective of the meeting is  to normalize ties between Cuba and its community abroad as all  nations do. All Cubans of goodwill are invited to participate.  Only the hysterical and agressive ones are not invited, he said.    On analyzing his current tour of Asian countries, the Cuban  foreign minister stressed the importance of exchanging ideas and  analyzing economic experiences. He said that Vietnam was the  most relevant point of his tour due to the traditional bilateral  ties of friendship and cooperation, and he concluded by saying  that he was surprised at the achievements of this Asian country.</p>

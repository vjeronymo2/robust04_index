			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Turkey aids SFO in Nadir probe THE TURKISH authorities have granted the Serious Fraud Office access to information to help with its investigations of Mr Asil Nadir. Turkish officials yesterday accepted a letter rogatory, under which a court in one country can seek the co-operation of a court under another jurisdiction. The move marks an important breakthrough for investigators, and follows representations earlier this month from Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer leading the inquiry, who was in Ankara last week. Some responses to specific requests are believed to have been passed on to the police already. The SFO has requested details on transactions related to at least two banks connected with Mr Nadir, Impexbank and Turkiye Yatirim ve Turizm Bankasi (TYTB). Meanwhile, the identity of one of the Turkish businessmen who is connected to loans made last year to Mr Asil Nadir during his bankruptcy emerged yesterday. Mr Iskender Tarsuslugil, a Leeds-based garment manufacturer, travelled to Cyprus last month. It is believed he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim several hundred thousand pounds from Mr Nadir. Mr Tarsuslugil was not available for comment last night. TYTB confirmed yesterday that Mr Tarsuslugil was the ultimate owner of an offshore company which borrowed money secured against the house of Ms Leslie Ellwood, a girlfriend of Mr Nadir. Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy has taken legal action against Ms Ellwood - who is now in northern Cyprus - over a transfer of money used to purchase the house for her. Documents at the Land Registry show TYTB secured a loan against the house on July 13 last year. The High Court issued an order last November preventing further transactions related to the property. TYTB said the loan to Mr Tarsuslugil had been approved by the board and was disbursed in a number of different foreign currencies. Bank officials said their client had indicated the one-year pre-export finance loan, which matures next month, would be repaid on time.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Swiss banks castigated for Omni 'carelessness' SWITZERLAND'S Federal Banking Commission has castigated the 50 or so mostly regional Swiss banks involved in lending to Omni Holding, the financial empire of Mr Werner Rey, which collapsed a year ago. In its annual report for 1991 published yesterday, the regulatory body says the 'carelessness' with which some loans to Omni and Rey were granted was not 'compatible with the diligence of a serious banker'. The Commission notes that more than half of loans to Omni were made on an unsecured basis, and many were granted without adequate documentation or adherence to proper procedures. At the end of 1990, lending to Omni amounted to SFr1.4bn, (Pounds 530m) including Mr Rey's private debt to Swiss banks of SFr306m. He filed for personal bankruptcy last September. Including debts to foreign banks, Mr Rey and Omni owe more than SFr2bn, the Commission estimates. The Commission says it believes the banks have learned their lesson from the Omni collapse, Switzerland's biggest corporate failure. In six banks, including Swiss Bank Corporation, the country's second largest bank, those responsible have resigned or been dismissed, and proceedings are pending in two others. It is not yet clear how much creditors will recoup of their Omni loans, but many small regional banks have been obliged to make big provisions for bad debt. This has added to financial pressures from the downturn in Switzerland's property market, which led to failure of a small regional bank in Thun last October. The Banking Commission warns that the position of regional banks, which are heavily dependent on property lending, could worsen further this year.</p>

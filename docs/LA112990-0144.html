			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INJURED GIRL DENIES SHE ASKED FRIEND TO LIE ABOUT FIGHT  </P> <P> Testifying in court for the first time since her face was slashed in a brawl  last August, Amber Jefferson on Wednesday angrily denied that she told a friend  he could make $1,000 if he told police the attack was racially motivated.  </P> <P> In testimony that saw her fight to control her emotions, Amber disputed  testimony given earlier by 17-year-old Matt Stewart, who was with the  15-year-old Garden Grove girl at a Stanton apartment complex on Aug. 6 -- the  night she was cut by a shard of glass during a fight between two groups of  young people.  </P> <P> Stewart had testified Tuesday that Amber had told him he would receive $1,000  if he claimed the attack was racially inspired.  </P> <P> But in court Wednesday, Amber offered a different picture of what happened. She  said it was Stewart who brought up the idea of filing a lawsuit during a  conversation with her mother at the Jefferson home shortly after the fight.  </P> <P> "Matt said, 'I got beat up pretty bad, is it possible that I could sue?' "  Amber said. "My mother said, 'I don't think so.' "  </P> <P> Amber said there were no further conversations between Stewart and any members  of her family about the possibility of pursuing a lawsuit and that they never  offered him $1,000 to lie on their behalf.  </P> <P> "I don't even know where he came up with $1,000," Amber testified. "To tell you  the truth, if I had $1,000, I would be out shopping; I wouldn't give it to  him."  </P> <P> Amber's testimony came in the third day of a preliminary hearing for Kurt David  Wimberly, 18, who is charged with mayhem for allegedly throwing the glass that  slashed the left side of her face from her temple to her neck.  </P> <P> Clad in an orange jail jumpsuit and flanked by his attorneys, Wimblerly stared  intently at Amber during her testimony. She is scheduled to take the stand  again today.  </P> <P> Amber and her parents -- her mother is white and her father is black -- have  alleged that the attack was racially motivated. The incident became a rallying  point for civil rights activists who maintained that it was proof that racism  is prevalent in Orange County.  </P> <P> However, while bringing charges against several people involved in the fight,  the district attorney's office declined to file hate-crime charges in the case,  saying the brawl stemmed from a dispute between two girls over Wimberly and was  not motivated by racial hatred.  </P> <P> Yet on Wednesday, Amber maintained that the attack was racial.  </P> <P> "I think it's because of my color," she said when Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi  Harper asked her if she knew what had caused the incident that left her face  disfigured.  </P> <P> Facing television cameras and a packed courtroom, Amber broke down in tears  several times during her testimony as she recounted the events that led to the  near-fatal injury that left her hospitalized with a deep gash down her face and  a broken jaw.  </P> <P> In graphic detail, she described the cut that caused paralysis on one side of  her face along with a reddish-colored scar.  </P> <P> "I had 10 1/2 hours of surgery. They had to sew each nerve and each gland and  the muscle back together again," she said. "My mouth was wired shut and they  had to put metal bars in my face to keep the bones in place."  </P> <P> Under questioning from Harper, the former Santiago High School cheerleader told  the court that her life has changed dramatically since the attack.  </P> <P> "It gets me really sick when I have muscle spasms," she said. "I throw up a  lot. It came to the point where I can't even cheer because if I jump up and  down I get a headache, so I just decided to avoid all that and quit  cheerleading."  </P> <P> Amber said that she has difficulty remembering the details of the attack itself  and that she never saw who threw the object that wounded her.  </P> <P> The night she was hurt, she said, she was with four other teen-agers whom she  had known for a couple of days. They had piled into Stewart's car and gone to  the Disneyland Hotel for about an hour, then gone to another hotel for a party  that never materialized.  </P> <P> There, she said, she drank about six ounces of vodka and orange juice that  someone had mixed together in an orange juice container. After a short while,  she said, the group headed back to the Stanton apartment complex where Amber  was spending the weekend with another friend.  </P> <P> Amber said she and some of her friends got out of the car near the Wimberlys'  house to walk back to her friend's apartment when they came upon a group of  people, some of whom were armed with bats.  </P> <P> "I got hit in the back of the legs," she said. "I fell to the ground, and when  I turned my head around, that's when I saw Kurt directly behind me with a bat."  </P> <P> Amber said Stewart carried her back to his car and sat her down in the  passenger seat, closed the door, then walked around the back of the car to get  in on the driver's side. A few seconds later, she said, she saw a bat raised  above Stewart and he said he had been hit.  </P> <P> "I got out of the car to get away. I was trying to get away as fast as I could,  but my legs were hurting," she said. "I saw something very shiny in Kurt's  hand. . . ."  </P> <P> It was moments later that Amber apparently was hit with the glass shard. Amber  said she heard one of her friends, Lewis Jones, 19, yelling, "You killed my  home girl."  </P> <P> Amber said her next memories are of being in the hospital. "All I knew was my  face was very, very swollen and it was bandaged," she said. "I didn't know it  was all sewn up until one day when I looked in the mirror."  </P></p>

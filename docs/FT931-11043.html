			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Defence companies in France link arms - The first restructuring of the military industry for 20 years FRANCE'S powerful defence companies are closing ranks, as their quartermaster - the French state - has told them to. The most visible sign of what is the first restructuring of the French military industry for some 20 years is the recent accord between Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation. The government has used its financial holdings in the country's two aircraft makers to force them into more industrial co-operation. There have been recent shifts in other areas. SAGEM, a space and aeronautics company, has taken an 8 per cent stake in Dassault Electronique. CAP Sesa, the computer services company, has a co-operation agreement with the Matra defence arm of the new Matra - Hachette group. Aerospatiale has set up with the state-owned SNPE a common subsidiary to work on missile propulsion. Potentially more far-reaching are the talks which Aerospatiale is holding with Matra and Thomson-CSF to mesh its missile division with one or other of them. The squeeze on the French defence industry can be measured by the relief with which Dassault has greeted Taiwan's confirmation of its FFr4bn (Dollars 740m) order for 60 Mirage jets, and by the considerable risk which the French government is ready to run that China will retaliate by cancelling other business with France. The Taiwan contract is Dassault Aviation's first military export order in more than four years. In spite of this order, France's arms exports, which totalled FFr29bn in 1991, are well down on their mid-1980s level, without any compensating increase in orders from the French state. The government is trying to give the industry a soft landing by keeping the equipment budget steady in nominal terms (FFr102.9bn last year). 'But we will have to be more selective in the future; we can't have any more doubling up of research,' says a senior adviser to Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister. It was precisely to avoid research duplication that Mr Joxe decided that the state should at last exploit its 46 per cent overall stake in Dassault. He revived a state holding called Sogepa, set up in 1967 to hold the 20 per cent stake which the state then took in Dassault. To that original Sogepa holding in Dassault Mr Joxe has added 16 per cent of the state's further acquisitions of Dassault in 1981. However, the government has kept a direct 10 per cent stake in Dassault, with the right to one direct nomination to its board. At the same time, the government has put into Sogepa 25 per cent of state-owned Aerospatiale's equity. The financial web has been completed by making Mr Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's head, president of Sogepa with its decisive voice in Dassault, and by making Mr Serge Dassault vice-president of Sogepa and a board member of Aerospatiale. The point of creating this incestuous relationship is, says the defence ministry, that the two companies should conduct more of their research and commercial activities in common. They certainly have large research departments. Dassault, for example, employs 3,200 engineers, a quarter of its total payroll. Aerospatiale's larger commercial network could benefit Dassault, whose sales force has receded in line with its export orders. France is still an important maker of missiles - about FFr20bn to FFr25bn a year. But it is not so important, says Mr Henri Conze, a former senior defence official who advises France's conservative opposition, that it warrants maintaining three producers - Aerospatiale, Thomson-CSF, Matra. 'There are now seven missile companies in Europe, but there will only be two eventually,' he forecasts. At the centre of the manoeuvring is Aerospatiale, whose long-standing missile co-operation with Deutsche Aerospace is undergoing one of its cyclical drops, and which is thus seeking a domestic partnership, even partial merger, with either Thomson or Matra. Each has its merits. Thomson makes radar/command and control systems into which Aerospatiale missiles could be integrated; Matra makes missiles, but of ranges that complement Aerospatiale's. Just for that reason, Matra is nervous that Thomson may be planning to buy, from Bombardier of Canada, Short Brothers of Belfast. The latter makes short-range missiles that could compete with Matra's. With elections two months away, French defence companies could become a political football again, as in 1981 when the state took control of, or stakes in, Thomson, Dassault and Matra, and in 1986 when Matra was privatised. A new conservative government would probably find Thomson relatively easy to make private because it once was so. Aerospatiale would be much harder to float. However, Mr Conze believes privatisation is largely irrelevant. Whatever their ownership, defence companies are effectively controlled by their customer - the state. The socialist government agrees. The crucial issue is forging international as well as domestic alliances. 'The real question is not whether French defence companies are privatised or nationalised,' says one of Mr Joxe's officials. 'It is whether they should have their capital opened up to foreign partners.'  ----------------------------------- FRENCH ARMS EQUIPMENT SPENDING  -----------------------------------         FFr (bn)   % GDP  ----------------------------------- 1987      85.8     1.92 1988      90.8     1.99 1989      98.0     1.98 1990     102.1     1.91 1991     103.2     1.79 1992     102.9     1.72  ----------------------------------- Source: French defence ministry  -----------------------------------</p>

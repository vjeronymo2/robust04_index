			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Brokerage side lifts Primerica to Dollars 179.3m in first quarter PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in first-quarter operating earnings to Dollars 179.3m after another record performance by its Smith Barney brokerage subsidiary. Net income for the three months totalled Dollars 190.3m, following a charge of Dollars 16.7m related to changes in the accounting for post-retirement benefits and a one-off addition to earnings of Dollars 27.7m. The latter came from investment portfolio gains, the sale of the group's remaining interest in the consumer catalogue company Fingerhut, and a contribution from portfolio gains earned by Travelers, the insurance company part-owned by Primerica. Net income in the first quarter last year was Dollars 192.1m, which also included special charges and gains. Smith Barney was once again the star of the Primerica show. The Wall Street brokerage house posted record profits of Dollars 57.5m, earned on record revenues of Dollars 411.1m. Earnings from broking commissions, investment banking, and asset management were all buoyant. They helped offset a decline in principal trading revenues, which were hit by poor returns from mortgage-backed securities trading. First-quarter results were not affected by the acquisition of the Shearson retail broking and asset management business. Mr Sanford Weill, chairman of Primerica, said the purchase of Shearson would be completed by early July. Earnings from Primerica's consumer finance services division rose 8 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 48.3m, due primarily to a decline in loan losses. The insurance services business contributed earnings of Dollars 47.2m, up slightly on the same quarter a year ago. Primerica's results had little impact on the group's share price, which has more than doubled over the past year. Yesterday, the stock eased Dollars 7/8 to close at Dollars 46 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

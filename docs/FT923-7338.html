			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Council's video system cuts crime A VIDEO surveillance system set up by King's Lynn Borough Council in Norfolk has cut car crime in the town centre and may be extended to include local businesses. The system was installed in February after the success of a pilot scheme on a council-owned industrial estate where crime had been discouraging businesses from moving in. There are 36 cameras in car parks, housing estates and leisure and shopping centres, linked by fibre-optic cables to a control room which is staffed 24 hours a day and has a direct link to the police. Running the system costs Pounds 200,000 a year in staff, maintenance and leasing costs. This is partly funded by a 5p surcharge on car-park tickets and service charges for businesses covered by the scheme. The system has cut vandalism and reduced car thefts from three a fortnight to three in the six months since it was introduced. Police attribute 53 arrests directly to the cameras.</p>

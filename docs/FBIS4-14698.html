			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchogoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi April 4 TASS -- The Georgian-Abkhaz agreement  signed today "contains an unequivocal and clear recognition of  Georgia's territorial integrity with guarantees of a broad  autonomy for Abkhazia", State Duma Committee Chairman Konstantin  Zatulin said in Sochi today.    He explained that for this reason, the agreement suits both  sides.    Zatulin recalled that the agreement signed between Georgia  and Abkhazia with the participation of the Russian Federation  and the United Nations contains two documents: "One is related  to the refugee problems, and the other concerns political  settlement of the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia".    Zatulin described accords reached in Moscow as "very  positive, because any other solution would have threatened war".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's plan to extend a  one- year tax reduction for fiscal 1994 is not an international  commitment, a government source said Monday.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told Treasury Secretary  Lloyd  Bentsen at their meeting near Frankfurt, Germany, that the  planned income and residential tax cut is but a first step  toward a more full-fledged tax reduction in the future.    The source said Fujii made the remarks "on an assumption  that  the ongoing debate over tax reforms will produce conclusion in  one year."    "They're not an international pledge," the source said.    The government has been discussing a dramatic overhaul of  the  country's taxation system, with a more perpetual tax reduction  on the agenda. The tax debate is scheduled to come up with some  conclusions by the end of the year.</p>

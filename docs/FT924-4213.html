			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Temple Bar to raise Pounds 25m via debenture placing TEMPLE BAR Investment Trust, a UK general trust managed by Guinness Flight, is raising Pounds 25m via a placing of debenture stock. The trust previously had a 6 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock 2002 which was redeemed, at the holders' option, in August. The directors 'consider that the recent fall in the level of interest rates in the UK now offers a favourable climate in which to restore the long-term gearing in the company's capital structure.' The stock, which will mature in 2017, will have a gross redemption yield of 9.8 per cent, based on an issue price of 99.746 and a coupon of 9 7/8 per cent. SG Warburg Securities is acting as agent for the company in relation to the issue.</p>

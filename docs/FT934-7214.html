			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (1): Dedicated borrower of fashion . . . - Lucia van der Post goes to Paris in search of the elite, elusive haute couture customer IT MUST be delightful to be Eleonore de Rohan-Chabot. In the lottery that we call life, Eleonore seems to have drawn only winning tickets. The pretty 21-year-old, married to handsome 31-year-old Comte de Rohan-Chabot, already has her own TV show, dresses in the finest clothes that money can buy and yet does not have to pay a penny for them. For Eleonore is one of an elite group of young French women who have only to lift the telephone to borrow a dress for a special occasion. 'All my friends,' she tells me breezily, 'borrow couture. Les Maisons de Couture like their clothes to be seen out and about on young people.' Not all young people, bien sur - only those who are attractive to look at, well-connected and can take their borrowed clothes to the sort of places and parties where the houses would like them to be seen. For every couture house in Paris needs more customers, and they need young customers most of all. As the numbers of genuine couture customers diminish, as the life-styles that required couture dresses disappear, all the houses are chasing the same 200 women in the world, all that is left, calculates Catherine Riviere, Directrice de Haute Couture at Chanel, of that privileged band that once patronised the grand couturiers. It is a cut-throat business, finding new clients. It cannot be left to chance. Houses peruse the business pages of the serious journals, scour lists of the richest people in the world and issue flattering invitations to those that are known to have the wherewithal, and could possibly be persuaded to have the inclination, to buy. And, it seems, they send their clothes out and about on the social scene on free loans hoping to catch the eye of the rich and well-connected. The nature of the haute couture customer has changed over the years. There are, of course, fewer of them. Just a few years ago there were, according to the houses, some 3,000-4,000 customers shared between 20 houses. Where once the grand society woman would probably patronise a single house, buying from it all her serious sartorial needs, today she shops around. Riviere says that couture customers no longer buy for special events. 'Unless it is for a wedding.' Couture has had to adapt to suit the changing lives of customers. 'Today they travel so much, they need easy pieces. There are not so many grand parties. Our faithful customers buy between one or two garments a season, an average of five a year, probably three suits and two dresses. Once they get used to haute couture it is like a drug - nothing else will do.' A suit will cost around FFr100,000 (Pounds 11,600) a dress 'without embroideries' around FFr80,000, an evening dress anything between FFr150,000 and FFr300,000. If all that sounds expensive remember that something like 130 hours will go into the making of a jacket, 40 into a skirt and personal fittings are on offer until perfection is achieved. Catherine Riviere. says: 'When we get to know them very well and have their mannequin then we can do much of the fitting on that.' The couture customer today not only buys from more than one house but she has plenty of pret-a-porter labels in her wardrobe as well. So who exactly are they - these few hundred women in the world privileged enough to be able to buy the most luxurious clothes in the world? 'Please Chanel,' I had said to their London office, 'find me a haute couture customer to talk to, a real live example of this vanishing breed.' They found me Eleonore. Exquisitely pretty, blonde, flawless skin, tall, fine-boned. Papa is the Marquis de Galard Terraube which meant that when it came to her recent marriage she was able to offer the sort of impeccable lineage that makes Almanac de Gotha families feel at home. Then, of course, the chateau with its parc, which has been part of the family fiefdom since the Middle Ages, provided a perfect setting for the celebrations of nuptials which were generally agreed to have constituted the wedding of the year in France. A wedding, which as Point de Vue put it, was 'forcement grand.' Paris-Match, Point de Vue, Gala, (the Hello] set of the French press) all went to town, breathless at the deliciousness of it all. Once a week on her own television show, Eleonore interviews celebrities. And in the time left over from being a TV celebrity, and a fashionable wife, she studies law at Assas university. In due course she intends to become a lawyer. She is also very, very nice. Not an immodest word passes her lips. 'Tell me Eleonore,' I beg, 'tell me about these grand parties that these clothes you borrow go to.' Not a whisper. 'We mostly go out to restaurants and then I would probably wear something black. I hate mini-skirts as I never know where to put my legs. I like a long dress or pants though I love to bare my neck and shoulders.' 'What about the entertaining you do?' I venture. 'Surely you have to dress up for that?' 'Well, we live in a very small flat - just two small rooms so we don't entertain very much. I only dress in couture for special occasions. My clothes come from all over the place. I often buy vetements d'occasion (secondhand clothing) in Guerrisold in the Barbes (an immigrant district renowned for its markets). I often buy coats there though this winter Dior has given me a coat so I don't have to buy one.' Today, for instance, she is wearing black leggings from she can't remember where, her husband's white shirt, a little black waistcoat, 'very important to me, waistcoats', a long black cardigan and high heeled boots. 'I mix in three different worlds - one is the world of students, the other is my husband's world (he is a financier 10 years older than she is) and the other is the world of tv. I need different wardrobes for each of them. For my student life I wear leggings and jeans, cardigans and waistcoats. Now that I am married I can't dress like a little girl. I have to dress more soberly. My husband loves me in haute couture. I have never worked before and now that I have to develop a professional working relationship with my colleagues I have to dress accordingly. For my shows I usually wear designer-label pret-a-porter.' 'So,' I press her, 'would you like to buy haute couture, can you imagine doing it?' 'Oh, yes, it is a dream for me. I like very simple things and la simplicite ne supporte pas la mediocrite. The quality of the materials is so beautiful, the work is all done by hand and it makes me feel more beautiful. It is like wearing another skin. I dream one day of buying a very special dress but for the moment I must keep my feet on the ground.' The habit of couture, the addiction if you like, runs in families. Eleonore's mother was a Dior model who was able to buy Dior clothes at a discount so Eleonore, of course, grew up knowing all about couture (and its discount possibilities). Eleonore loves Chanel and Dior in particular and always goes to their shows. 'There are many imitations of Chanel but they don't compare with the real thing. Chanel has the simple style I love. Givenchy, too, is beautiful but I think it is a little older.' Today in the haute couture salon at Chanel's Paris headquarters in the Rue Cambon, Eleonore is trying on the dress of her dreams. She has a big charity ball to attend at Versailles, at which the Queen of Denmark will be present, and it will be a glittering opportunity to show off the talents of the House of Chanel. Exquisitely simple, as is her taste, it is a feather-light drift of navy-blue chiffon. She will wear it very simply. 'I think I am too young to wear huge jewellery and because this dress is very simple and fluid it should look very natural. I will wear it with high heels, my hair very lache and very little make-up.' She does indeed look a picture. Papa, the Marquis de Galard Terraube, thinks she looks so lovely in it that he decides to buy the dress for her and it is now her very own. No longer will she have to rely on borrowing from the couture houses. Eleonore de Rohan-Chabot finally has become a real haute couture customer.</p>

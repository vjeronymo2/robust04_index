			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / What was right with the 1980s One of the ironies of contemporary politics is that British Conservatives are almost as eager to denigrate the 1980s as US Democrats. According to revisionists, Lady Thatcher's principal mistake was to promote an 'obsessive individualism' that owed more to the modern American libertarian tradition than to conventional Tory values. In his pamphlet Right Ahead, Mr David Hunt, the UK employment secretary, worries that young people are becoming 'atomised' - anti-social and isolated from society. He reminds us that Tories have traditionally regarded human beings as social beings: 'ours is a communitarian philosophy'. Wrinkling his nose at such dated concepts as the 'laisser faire economy', he urges a return to - wait for it - 'One Nation Toryism'. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is equally futuristic. In his recent speech 'What is a Conservative?' he argues that the touchstone of Toryism is 'respect for inherited institutions and traditions' and quotes approvingly from Edmund Burke's tirade against 'solitary, unconnected, individual, selfish Liberty'. Far from seeking an atomised, 'minimalist state', he believes Tories should be proclaiming their faith in government action. The political pressure for more 'caring' policies is considerable. Archbishop George Carey's protest about widening social divisions in his Easter message was typical of countless onslaughts from opposition leaders and other opinion formers. By elevating commercial profit to God-like status and by destroying the morale of groups such as teachers, the argument runs, Thatcherism undermined civic and moral values. From these poisonous seeds a bitter harvest of crime, cynicism and inequality is now being reaped. The populist power of such arguments is undeniable. Yet from a US perspective the Thatcher government did little that was either radical or liable to undermine moral or civic values. There was, for example, nothing immoral in reducing top tax rates from a ridiculous 98 per cent to a still-high 40 per cent. Leftwingers who inveigh against these tax cuts are at liberty to give 98 per cent of their incomes to charity. Those who decline to give voluntarily do not become moral paragons by demanding higher rates of compulsory taxation - usually on others. The heinous 'cuts' in public expenditure are an equally blind alley because spending never was cut in real terms. Even as a share of gross domestic product, public spending only fell slightly - from 40.9 per cent in 1979 to 37.6 per cent in 1989, and that mainly reflected soaring economic growth in the late 1980s. The public sector's share of GDP has since risen by about five percentage points. But suppose public spending really had been cut? Why should a shift of resources into the private and voluntary sectors be regarded as unethical? The rest of the agenda is as easily defended. It was not sinful to remove from trade unions legal privileges that no other groups have ever possessed. It was not wrong to privatise businesses, most of which should never have been in the public sector. It was not immoral to liberalise prices, wages, dividends and exchange rates - this was simple economic common sense. Nor was it unethical to introduce a hint of competition in the delivery (but not financing) of public services such as education and healthcare. Looking back, Thatcherism was no more than a mild - and beneficial - reaction to what had become an excessively powerful and intrusive state. The shift towards greater personal choice and responsibility ought to have won praise from clergy and other arbiters of the nation's morals, even if it did result in slightly greater inequality. So why are 'moderate' Tories now so anxious to rethink Conservative doctrines? Why are the policies of the 1980s so often regarded as uncaring or extreme? I think the answer lies partly in continuing ignorance of the philosophy - classical liberalism - that underlay the positive aspects of Thatcherism. Messrs Hunt and Dorrell worry about the 'atomisation' of society. Well, the fact is we are atomised. Evolution might have created a vast jelly-like creature with numerous centres of consciousness. But it did not: we have separate minds and bodies. If somebody clobbers Mr Hunt, I feel no pain. If Mr Dorrell loses money on the stock exchange, my bank balance does not suffer. The public policy shifts of the 1980s were merely a recognition of our status as distinct individuals with varying abilities, experiences and desires. Classical liberalism's guiding principle is that individuals know best what is in their own interest. It thus advocates freedom in all spheres of life. What critics construe as crass commercialism is simply a demand that people enjoy economic freedoms comparable with the political and personal freedoms so vigorously championed by leftwingers. Classical liberals regard private enterprise as generally superior to the public sector because the pattern of activity is determined by voluntary exchanges between individuals. Public services are allocated by bureaucrats and made possible only by coercion - the forcible extraction of taxes. Yet to favour free exchange is not to put any special value on profits: a society of classical liberals could well opt to work only a few hours a day, devoting the rest of its time to meditation and gardening. The Tory critics of market liberalism have nothing to put in its place. Fearful of change, they want to freeze social and economic development. Yet had Thatcherism never existed, they would now be defending a far more collectivist status quo. With such passive thinking in the ascendancy, nobody should be surprised by the Major government's lack of momentum.</p>

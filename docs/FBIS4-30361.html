			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Group of Seven (G-7)  summit in Naples next month is likely to discuss ways of  stopping the U.S. dollar's decline on foreign exchange markets,  government sources said Monday [27 June].    The sources said the G-7 nations are likely to hold a  meeting  of finance ministers' deputies before the summit to coordinate  their views on the issue.    On the Tokyo market, the U.S. dollar closed at a record  postwar closing low of 99.93 yen on Monday after falling to a  global low of 99.50 yen at one stage.    An economic declaration to be issued at the summit is now  expected to call for coordinated intervention by the  participating nations to stabilize the volatile foreign exchange  market, the sources said.    They also said Japan is likely to face intense pressure at  the summit to ease its monetary policy and expand its fiscal  measures in order to promote an economic recovery.    A joint statement issued at a ministerial meeting of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in  early June called for continued cooperation among member  countries in the foreign exchange market.</p>

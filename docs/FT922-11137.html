			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Management: The Growing Business - Golf clubs where the grass is greener The length of golf club waiting lists, the distance from the chairman's home and the presence of swans on a river have all been used by companies to help choose a new location, according to a guide to company relocation, writes Charles Batchelor. These real examples demonstrate how not to come to a decision on a new address, The Director's Guide to Relocation Management* points out. One company selected a site for commercial reasons and then changed its mind in favour of a location five minutes' from the chairman's home while another briefed its advisers to find 'a town with character on a river with swans'. 'Miscalculations during the relocation process can lead to the loss of key employees, plummeting morale and escalating costs,' the guide notes. More serious reasons for companies deciding to move include high property prices, the end of a lease, the redevelopment of the current premises and deteriorating accommodation and facilities. The guide calculates that a company moving from London to the Midlands could save Pounds 9,000 a year per employee on running costs, rent, rates and labour costs. But companies should set against these savings the one-off costs of the move which average Pounds 14,500 per employee, including visits to the new area, temporary accommodation and removal costs. If a company advances a bridging loan to an employee, this may increase the cost to between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 50,000 in the present, difficult housing market. The decision to move is a trade-off between future cost savings and the one-off relocation costs but there can be other important benefits to a company, the guide says. It can allow a business to project a new image, make organisational changes and improve its working environment and the performance of staff. The guide covers finding the right location; how to help employees and keep them in touch with developments; and how to organise the physical move. Even otherwise well planned moves can run into last minute difficulties. One company arrived at its new site only to find it had forgotten to have keys cut for the new building; a second found access to its new building cut off by roadworks; while a third forgot to arrange for its telephones to be connected. *Institute of Directors and Black Horse Relocation.

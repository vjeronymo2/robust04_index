			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: ASB proposals for minimum of 'fudging' in company accounts should be welcomed Sir, Mr David Damant's circulars 'Earnings' and 'Unfudgeability' described in your article,'Fudge-free accounting plans incompatible with reality' (September 29), provide an interesting counter-argument to the general tendency of accounting standard-setters to impose greater comparability in financial reporting. His thesis should not, however, be too readily accepted. The reduction of differences in the accounting treatment of events and transactions arising in the same circumstances must surely remain as the standards-setters' prime objective. The current concern of investment analysts at the prospective loss of a 'fudged' earnings per share figure as a result of the virtual elimination of extraordinary items planned by the Accounting Standards Board seems perverse. Mr Damant explains this concern by saying that the new earnings figure will not be a true measure of the company's ongoing earning power. Is ever such a thing available, however? The current measurement of earnings, by permitting too loose an interpretation for events and transactions outside the ordinary activities of the business, thereby allowing the figure for earnings from those ordinary activities to be 'fudged', cannot surely be the true measure that he seeks. Are not the results of accidental happenings, which he suggests should be excluded from the company's measure of performance, in fact the very stuff of everyday business life? The ASB's proposals for the minimum of 'fudging' in profit and loss accounts should allow analysts a better insight into company results and should be welcomed.

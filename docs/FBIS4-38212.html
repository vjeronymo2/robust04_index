			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with military commanders by unidentified </F> radio/television correspondent at locations around Kabul on 28  June; passages in italics in Pashto -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers of television and  dear listeners of Radio Afghanistan; may the peace and blessing  of God be upon you. I hope that you are in a good health and  are being successful. As you can see, we are now in Seya Sang  Neqleya [near Kabul]. Not only the members of the armed forces'  various units, but mojahedin of the various provinces also took  part in this victorious operation. The mojahedin of Kapisa also  took active part in this operation. I will interview one of the  most famous commanders of this province -- commander Habib  Afghan. May we draw your attention to this interview:    Esteemed commander, would you please tell me about the  role of your mojahedin in the recent victories?    [Habib Afghan] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. We -- the mojahedin of Kapisa -- have been  taking part in the operation since the beginning of the  revolution but most actively since the coup launched by the  Dostam and Golboddin. Recently we took part in the operation  carried out in Seya Sang. Here we seized six tanks [word  indistinct] rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition in these  depots. We seized an enormous amount of ammunition in other  depots for example: in Kasa Borj and Tapa-e Nader Khan we seized  a countless amount of ammunition. All the enemy's supplies were  seized by the mojahedin. [passage indistinct] The enemy have  lost their morale and we should not put our guns down until  their final defeat. We must work hard for the victory of our  jihad.    [Correspondent] Esteemed commander, please tell us  where your forces are stationed, and how long will you continue  your operation?    [Habib Afghan] My own forces are stationed in the Seya  Sang region. This region was under the control of  Dostam/Golboddin forces. We are not going to put down our guns  while Dostam is in this land and Golboddin does not repent from  his evil actions. We are not going to make any more  concessions. We have given many concessions in the past. They  fought sometimes in the name of Islam and sometimes under the  pretext of militia. In every name they have been fighting  against Muslims. Look at these houses yourself? Who were  living in these houses -- Muslims or non-Muslims? They have  looted all these houses and set them on fire. We cannot put  down our guns until we (?expose) all their evils. As long as  our nation is on our side -- Almighty God is with us -- we are  on the right side. They are not prepared to compromise; they  are not prepared for peace; they are not prepared for Loya  Jerga. [passage indistinct] They are foreign agents. I have  captured three Pakistani men here -- in Seya Sang -- myself.  They are now under arrest; if you want I will show them to you.  If disputes are going on in our country, what are Pakistani men  doing here? What are the Americans are doing here [as heard]?  What are the Arabs doing here? We are Muslims and we are not  infidels. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] As you can see, we are now in Tapa-e Naqleya  Seya Sang. We want to interview a commander in this unit.  Esteemed commander, please introduce yourself to the viewers of  television and esteemed listeners of Radio Afghanistan.    [Safiollah] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. My name is Safiollah, commander of Battalion 40,  Bagram Division.    [Correspondent] Please tell us about the duties you are  going  to accomplish after the operation?    [Safiollah] On 25 June, we received an order from the  Islamic  State of Afghanistan and the Ministry of Defense. Our mojahedin  captured localities from Jada-e Maywand [in Kabul] to Chaman and  up to Tapa-e Maranjan. And now we are here; as you can see, we  are stationed in Tapa-e Seya Sang. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] We are continuing our interview, as you can  see we are now in Chaman. A number of our brethren of the first  district are stationed in here. I am going to interview the  esteemed commander of District 1 [as heard]. Esteemed commander,  above all tell us something about the clearing up operation  carried out by the army of the Islamic State of Afghanistan?    [Unidentified commander] In the name of God, the merciful,  the compassionate, [passage indistinct] the Islamic State  attacked the area held by the Dostam-Golboddin militia. In  stationing our forces in Chaman, our groups began to advance  toward Seya Sang region. With the help of God these people were  wiped out from Bala Hesar region and now we can safely advance  toward Charasiab. [passage omitted]    Our brethren of the Islamic State are planning to advance  toward Charasiab. This place must be cleared of enemies so that  the poor and persecuted people of Kabul can be relieved from the  fighting and difficulties. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Dear listeners, as you know the army of the  Islamic State of Afghanistan have been carrying out clearing up  operations during the past two or three days in the direction of  Tapa-e Maranjan, Bala Hesar, Pol-e Charkhi, and Arzan Qemat, and  the units and companies of the Islamic State's Army achieved  enormous gains. One of these units who took active part in this  military operation and achieved enormous gain is Unit 622 or  Regiment 622 of the national guard of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan. We are now conducting an interview with esteemed  Gol Hayder, the commander of Regiment 622 of the National Guard  of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. May we draw your attention  to this interview. Esteemed commander, please give us  information regarding the recent mopping up operation, and could  you also tell us about the duties of your regiment, their  location, and what have their gains been?    [Gol Hayder] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. The enemy had a plan to attack our unit on 23  June at 0500 in the vicinity of Pol-e Mahmud Khan. We had  advance information regarding this plan. Our units saw duty in  various locations. The enemy intended to attack, but with the  blessing of God, before they attacked we took the initiative.  We attacked first Darwaza-ye Lahori and Dahan-e Jada. There  the enemy could not resist even for one or two hours. The  positions that they held for the last two years, we seized them  the first day -- places like Darwaza-e Lahori and Dahan-e Jada.  Over the hill, there were other units who captured Bala Hesar.  The next morning at 0600 we attacked Ghazi Stadium. The enemy  could not resist even for five minutes. After five minutes, we  entered Kabul Theater. Then, jointly with our brethren from  Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union of Afghanistan], we quickly  seized Tapa-ye Maranjan from the enemy who put the Kabul  citizens in pain and difficulties for the last two years, but  now with the help and blessing of God were defeated, and they  could not resist in these regions even for two hours. We have  taken these places from them.    [Correspondent] How do you assess the enemy morale, in  particular the militia morale in comparison to the early days of  the fighting, when you launched a clearing up operation?    [Gol Hayder] God is with us. Hekmatyar did not seek refuge  from the God but he sought refuge from Dostam. As you know, a  few days ago he gave a warning to the people in Kabul of his  large scale fighting and his intention to capture Kabul. When  we took action we found that he is nothing. He sought refuge to  Dostam whereas he did not resist even for five minutes; his  forces will be nothing to us -- with the help of God.    [Correspondent] Have you any information from the Pol-e  Charkhi direction? Are the units of the Islamic army advancing  in this direction?    [Gol Hayder] Earlier I was in Tapa-ye Maranjan; the area of  Dehkhodaydad and the hill of Dehkhodaydad, this large area was  cleared up on the first day. Now our mojahedin are advancing  toward Arzanqimat and over the hill of Bagrami.    [Correspondent] What is the enemy doing? Are they resisting  or fleeing?    [Gol Hayder] We see no resistance from the enemy. The fact  that Dostam lost his two-year-long held position in a few  minutes and could not resist, they could not resist even for  three minutes in Dahan-e Jada, in Daramsal-e Kohna and in Shah-e  Shahid held by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan].  They could not resist, but have escaped.    [Correspondent] Thank you, esteemed commander. I wish you  and all mojahed brethren success and victory.</p>

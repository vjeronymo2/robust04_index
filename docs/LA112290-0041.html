			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Cook's Corner, 19122 El Toro Road, El Toro. Open daily 8 a.m. (bar opens at  9:30 a.m.) to 2 a.m. (714) 858-0266.  </P> <P> If you're looking for ferns and mineral water, don't come here. It's strictly  beer, wine and pool at this, one of the few remaining country bars in O.C.,  suitably rough around the edges but with an endearing simplicity. Just don't be  frightened off by the swarm of Harley-Davidsons parked near the patio.  GUILLERMO TORRES  </P></p>

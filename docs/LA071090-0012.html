			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR CHARGED WITH SELLING NARCOTICS PRESCRIPTIONS  </P> <P> A Clairemont physician will face a preliminary hearing Aug. 7 on charges that  he sold customers prescriptions for an assortment of narcotic drugs, including  some as potent as heroin, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Dosumu-Johnson, 43, pleaded innocent Monday in Municipal Court to  charges he used his medical practice as a front to sell prescriptions for  powerful narcotic drugs to patients who did not need such medication, said  Deputy Dist. Atty. George Bennett.  </P> <P> Dosumu-Johnson was arrested last Friday after a 2 1/2-month investigation by  the state's Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement and other agencies, said Philip  Donohue, a special agent in the bureau's San Diego office.  </P> <P> "We have encountered this kind of thing before," Donohue said. "There are  members of the medical profession who don't play by the rules. . . . But his  crimes were as blatant as any that we've uncovered."  </P> <P> Dosumu-Johnson is charged with 12 counts of improperly prescribing narcotics  and could face five years in prison for each count, Donohue said.  </P> <P> Investigators said Dosumu-Johnson was born in Liberia and earned his medical  degree in Guadalajara, Mexico. He had been practicing in Southern California  for about seven years, Donohue added.  </P> <P> Undercover agents allegedly visited Dosumu-Johnson six times, and during those  visits the doctor offered to sell them prescriptions for several types of  painkillers and stimulant drugs, Bennett said.  </P> <P> Among the drugs Dosumu-Johnson reportedly prescribed were Valium, amphetamines,  methadone and Dilaudid, Donohue said.  </P> <P> Methadone is a drug commonly used to treat heroin addicts, and Dilaudid is a  painkiller known colloquially as "drugstore heroin," Donohue said.  </P> <P> "If given a choice, a heroin addict would take Dilaudid over heroin," Donohue  said. "It's just as potent, and it's purer."  </P> <P> A single tablet of Dilaudid sells on the street for $20 to $25, Bennett said,  saying that Dosumu-Johnson allegedly offered to sell prescriptions for more  than 4,200 pills to the undercover agents.  </P> <P> Besides being accused of prescribing specific drugs, Dosumu-Johnson also sold  blank prescriptions for as much as $200, Donohue said. Such blank  prescriptions, which must be filled out in triplicate for more powerful drugs,  can fetch a street value of up to $350, Donohue said.  </P> <P> In addition to the criminal charges, Dosumu-Johnson could also lose his medical  license. Linda McCerady, a spokeswoman for the state medical board, said  Dosumu-Johnson would probably face a disciplinary hearing if convicted.  </P> <P> "We can take the license away for a criminal conviction," McCerady said. "If  he's convicted, his chances of keeping his license are pretty slim."  </P></p>

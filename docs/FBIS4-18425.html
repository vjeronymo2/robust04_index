			<p>BFN     [Text] The Americans believe that there is a possibe  compromise formula on access to the fenced area of Famagusta  that will be handed over to the United Nations. The CyBC  [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent in New York  reports that the Americans are promoting a plan to provide safe  access to the fenced area of Famagusta in exchange for the  removal of the area north of Dhimokratias Avenue from the  package of confidence-building measures or an amendment to the  timeframe for return of the area. The CyBC correspondent also  reports that it cannot be ruled out that the UN secretary  general and the Security Council's five permanent members will  invite President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot Leader]  Rauf Denktas to New York. It is also not ruled out that  President Kliridhis will go to the United States by the end of  this week for consultations with the leadership of the U.S.  State Department and the Security Council permanent members.

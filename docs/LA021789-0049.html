			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAKISTAN FACING NEW FLOOD OF REFUGEES FROM AFGHANISTAN  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are continuing to flee their country  despite Wednesday's final Soviet troop withdrawal, and Pakistan is bracing for  yet another human wave from its western neighbor in the near future, senior  Pakistani government officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> What is worse, Pakistan's chief commissioner for Afghan refugees said, few if  any of the 3.2 million Afghans who have been living in the squalid mud huts of  the refugee camps here for the past nine years are likely to go home until  Afghan President Najibullah's regime falls. Many experts here believe that  could take months.  </P> <P> "We simply do not expect them to start moving out tomorrow morning," declared  refugee commissioner Rustam Shah Mohmand. "There is the fear of conflict, the  fear of bombardment, the fear of shelling, the fear of prosecution, the fear of  hostilities. And as long as there are those fears and the fears of famine and  starvation, no refugee will leave Pakistan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Be Forced to Go  </P> <P> Speaking at a Thursday press conference to mark the completion of the Soviet  troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mohammad Hanif Khan, Pakistan's Cabinet  minister in charge of refugee affairs, stressed that Pakistan will not force  any refugees to go or to stay. But he stressed that any hopes that the Soviet  withdrawal would signal a large-scale return of refugees to their homeland are  unfounded.  </P> <P> In fact, commissioner Shah Mohmand said, recent fighting near the eastern  Afghan city of Jalalabad has forced more than 30,000 new refugees to cross the  border in the past three months. An expected rebel rocket offensive on that  city is likely to bring tens of thousands more, he said.  </P> <P> For the millions of refugees who have been here for nearly a decade, peace and  security are the principal issues in considering repatriation, he said.  </P> <P> "The basic reason that compelled the refugees to leave Afghanistan was  security," he said. "As long as there is no security, they will not go back."  </P> <P> Shah Mohmand conceded that not enough has been done to repair the damage inside  Afghanistan to meet the refugees' other basic requirements.  </P> <P> "The refugees will not go back unless they see some infrastructure, unless they  see they aren't going to starve, and unless they have houses to live in," he  said.  </P> <P> Independent aid officials who have been working with the Afghan rebels and  refugees for years agreed.  </P> <P> "They're brave and strong and courageous all right, but they can't eat dirt,"  said Steve Segal, director of the International Relief Committee, which has  been working with the Afghan refugees for nearly a decade. "If there is nothing  done about infrastructure, we don't think they're going to go back."  </P> <P> Shah Mohmand and other refugee officials say that now that the Soviet troops  have left Afghanistan, the fate of the world's largest refugee population  remains the biggest international problem of the Afghan war.  </P> <P> Billions of dollars already have been spent by the United States, Pakistan and  Western European nations in supporting the Afghan rebels in their war against  the regular Afghan army and their Soviet supporters. Now that the Soviets are  no longer a factor, refugee experts say they worry that much of that  international financial support, both for the fighting guerrillas and the  refugees -- groups that often overlap -- may begin to dry up.  </P> <P> "Our calculations originally were that by April or May we would see large  numbers of refugees start to return," said one official of the United Nations,  which has been charged with overseeing the Afghans' repatriation. "But . . . if  conditions are not stable and if fighting continues, you will see more refugees  coming out."  </P> <P> The U.N. official conceded that the overwhelming majority of the refugees fled  during 1980 and 1981 as a direct result of the Soviet's 1979 invasion.  </P> <P> "It had to do with the escalation in fighting and the use of new weapons  systems and air force, which made everybody vulnerable," he said.  </P> <P> But he and Shah Mohmand said the massive destruction that has been done to  Afghanistan during the past nine years -- 3,000 villages totally destroyed and  5,000 others badly damaged, Mohmand said -- has made the refugees return  impossible.  </P> <P> The United Nations already has begun limited reconstruction projects inside  Afghanistan in border regions where the fighting has stopped, principally the  rebuilding of irrigation canals and houses.  </P> <P> But it remains unclear whether enough can be done to persuade the refugees to  go home before Pakistani public opinion begins to turn against the people who  have been harbored and fed as Islamic brothers for nearly a decade.  </P> <P> "Any government that is faced with a refugee population the size of this one is  anxious to see an end to the conflict that caused these people to flee," the  U.N. official said.  </P> <P> An independent aid worker who has spent several years in border refugee camps  agreed that reconstruction is the principal refugee concern, but he, too, added  that "the other big issue is what will the Pakistani government do. Will they  begin to cut off ration cards to send signals to the refugees?"  </P> <P> Already, Shah Mohmand said, the 30,000 new refugees have been denied the  registration that would get them ration cards and access to U.N.-provided food.  He said they are surviving by staying with relatives in the camps or selling  off their few possessions.  </P> <P> He stressed that life in the camps, although free of epidemics and other  critical problems often associated with refugee life, is not such that the  Afghans would want to stay any longer than they must.  </P> <P> "The refugees' life in Pakistan is absolutely substandard," he said. "It is  miserable. All they are getting is wheat and edible oil. The absolute majority  of them are living in wretched conditions. There is no electricity. Fifty  percent are living without clean drinking water.  </P> <P> "We are convinced that each and every refugee will repatriate -- some will go  sooner, some will go later."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pedro Garcia] </F>   [Text] In the current situation of power generation,  efficiency in maintaining thermoelectric plants is essential.  Therefore, it is appropriate to stress the efforts of workers at  the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant. Victor Veiga, head  mechanic, will explain the work they are doing and will refer  also to past experience and future prospects.    [Begin recording] [Veiga] Before beginning the maintenance  work, we held a meeting of all the workers -- 72 in all,  counting mechanics, operators, electricians, and other support  workers -- and we agreed to work longer shifts in order to have  the engine ready by Sunday and not by Monday, so as to guarantee  the peak consumption time on 1 May. We hope to complete our work  by then. This is the main objective of our repairs.    So far, the maintenance work has not been fully successful  because we have had problems with the water supply from the  Santa Cruz del Norte aqueduct. Nevertheless, we have overcome  other difficult situations and we are trying to overcome these  problems. We were to do the cracking [craqueo] in boiler No. 1  to eliminate dirt and smut from the boiler. We must first remove  the dirt to make the cleaning job easier. We were unable to do  so because we did not have enough water. The pipes had  experienced some damage and we needed more water.    [Garcia] Veiga also explained that they are already  beginning  to clean the water pipe system.    [Veiga] We have located all the problems and are now in the  process of washing the [words indistinct] and superheaters so as  to begin the repair work and to finish it by Saturday night, at  the latest, so the engine will be ready for Sunday.    We believe that if the water supply is normalized; we should  have no problem in resuming full operation on Sunday to meet  peak consumption hours. But if we have the same problem, if the  water pressure is not increased and we are short of water, we  cannot guarantee operation either on Sunday or on Monday.    This plant has three units: No. 1, which is now under light  maintenance but is operational; No. 2, under full maintenance  that is expected to conclude in approximately 110 or 115 days;  and No. 3, which is in a stage of investment. We hope to begin  the first stages of operation by the end of the year.    We also have boiler No. 4 in the back yard; but after the  suspension of trade and commercial relations with the Soviet  Union, we decided that we could fix up only to unit No. 3. As  the minister [not further specified] has explained, this year we  intend to put at least up to unit No. 3 into operation.    [Garcia] Some of the workers who are really busy with these  repair activities will also give their impressions.    [First worker] I am Gilberto Azardena and I am in charge of  maintenance here. I am the head of the maintenance team, in  charge of repairing turbogenerator No. 1. Right now we are in  the process of repairing a number of failures in the engine.    [Second worker] My name is Jose Luis Vargas Ramirez and I am  trying to recover a valve that was in poor condition. So far, we  are facing the problems on a rather average level -- not too  well, I would say.    [Garcia] But are you resolving them?    [Second worker] Yes, of course. We are making progress.    [Garcia] Maintenance on unit No. 1 of the Santa Cruz plant  is  one of many being carried out in the country, and the efficiency  and expeditiousness with which this work is done depends to a  great extent on the possibilities for improving the current  capacity of the national energy system.

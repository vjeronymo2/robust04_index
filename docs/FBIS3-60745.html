			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Dec 19 (AFP)--Russia is determined to help  Iran build a nuclear power plant in the southern port city of  Bushehr, but financial problems have delayed the project, the  Russian ambassador said here.    In an interview with the weekly KAYHAN HAVAI, Sergey  Tretyakov said an agreement had been reached with Iran ``in  principle'' to set up the plant in Bushehr on the Gulf, and to  complete another left unfinished by a German company.    ``Despite opposition from Washington, we are determined to  go  ahead with the project,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We have an  independent policy with respect to Iran.''    Tretyakov said negotiations were underway and the project  would be implemented only if ``financial problems are sorted  out,'' but he did not clarify what the problems were.    Diplomats here said Iran, faced with a serious cash crisis,  had asked Moscow to finance the project, but Russia had refused,  due to its own economic problems.    Discussions between Iran and Russia have been going on for  more than a year over the purchase of two 440-megawatt  VVER-440-213 nuclear reactors for the new plant.    The German corporation Siemens launched the project when the  late shah was in power, but broke off work during the Islamic  revolution and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.    The cost of the project has been put at 3.7 billion dollars.    Iran has repeatedly called for work to resume but the German  government has refused, amid concerns that it could be accused  of aiding nuclear proliferation in a country suspected by the  West of aiming to build nuclear weapons.    The possibility of Russian involvement in finishing the  plant, which is 80 percent complete, was discussed during a trip  to Moscow by an Iranian delegation in the summer, Tretyakov said  in an interview with the daily ABRAR in August.    Iran and Russia signed an accord on civil nuclear  cooperation  earlier this year, but did not disclose details of the agreement.    During a visit here in March, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey  Kozyrev said such cooperation would take place within the  regulations set by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and  under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    Tehran has repeatedly accused Western countries, notably the  United States, of preventing it from obtaining nuclear  technology for civilian purposes.    In February, Iran also signed an accord with China for the  purchase of two 300-megawatt nuclear reactors for non-military  use. The project with Beijing has also been delayed because of  financial problems, according to Chinese diplomats in Tehran.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Loopholes let pirates through legal net particularly subscription movie and sports channels - are turning into billion-pound businesses in Europe, but there is little specific legislation to protect them against increasingly sophisticated pirates. The Motion Picture Export Association of America, the Hollywood trade association, said that only the UK, Sweden and France had passed laws to ban unauthorised decoders and smart cards which 'unlock' the scrambled signal. Mr George Eriksson, deputy director of the association in Europe, said he planned to lobby the European Commission to get a ban on unauthorised decoders throughout the community. BSkyB has only bought the pay-television rights for the UK. Making sure that the signal is secure is part of BSkyB's contractual obligations under agreements with the studios. The UK government has dealt with the issue by inserting a section in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This created a criminal offence with a fine of up to Pounds 5,000. The new section says that 'a person who makes, imports, sells or lets for hire any un-authorised decoder shall be guilty of an offence'. It is apparently not an offence to use a pirate decoder. The legislation adds that it would be a defence for the defendant to prove 'that he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for knowing that the decoder was an unauthorised decoder'.</p>

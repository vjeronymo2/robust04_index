			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATOR FOUND SWARMS OF CON MEN OPERATING IN COUNTY  </P> <P> California can thank John B. Hiatt, director of the New Mexico's state  Securities Division, for pushing precious metals into the Leviticus Project  fold and giving the Golden State another weapon with which to fight fraud.  </P> <P> Around 1987, Hiatt began noticing so-called "gold-in-the-ground" schemes  popping up in his home state. In gold-in-the-ground operations, also known as  dirt-pile schemes, swindlers use official-looking mineral assay tests to  convince investors that the ore they have laid claim to contains guaranteed  levels of gold.  </P> <P> For an initial investment of about $5,000, investors are told they hold title  to 100 tons of unprocessed dirt. The con men then tell the investors that the  gold found in that dirt will be sold to them at as low as one-third of the  world spot market price. In reality, there is no mine, no ore, no gold.  </P> <P> Investor complaints and a serious warning from New Mexico's state geologist  about the abundance of gold-mine fraud led Hiatt to talk to colleagues in other  Western mining states, California chief among them. Hiatt got a $32,000,  18-month grant from the North American Securities Administrators Assn. and went  to work on Operation Goldbrick.  </P> <P> "I thought there were four to six (gold mine schemes) in New Mexico and perhaps  another eight to 10 in neighboring states for a total of 15 to 20," Hiatt said.  "There are currently 80 to 100. . . . The promoters operating the boiler rooms  are primarily located in California, Orange County, Newport Beach. And they're  calling all over the country."  </P> <P> Among the con men unearthed in Operation Goldbrick was Gordon MacManus, a  persistent man from Casper, Wyo. MacManus was sentenced in 1987 to 2 1/2 years  in a Wyoming prison after pleading guilty to bilking at least 40 persons out of  $6,250 each for worthless dirt from an inactive mine.  </P> <P> According to NAASA officials, MacManus was moved to solitary confinement in the  state penitentiary last fall, after he was accused of promoting yet another  gold-in-the-ground scheme -- this time from inside prison walls.  </P> <P> NAASA figures that in 1988, tens of thousands of American investors lost an  estimated $250 million to gold-in-the-ground schemes alone. That number doesn't  even begin to factor in the other precious metals scams: rare coins, strategic  metals, gold and silver futures, bullion.  </P> <P> It was these Western precious metals problems, highlighted by the rapid growth  of Operation Goldbrick, that led Leviticus to add precious metals fraud to its  list of targets.  </P></p>

Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his  visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk  said that "when ukraine gets rid of the last nuclear missile,  its economy will be freed from the heavy burden and the republic  will be able to step up the process of reform."    "We realise that the West links nuclear weapons with  assistance to reform programmes. But I would like to say that  the process of freeing oneself from nuclear weapons is not  directly connected with the process of reform. When discussing  this question, we proceed from the possibility of providing us  with security guarantees. If the economic situation continues  to worsen, it will be harder for us to carry out the processes  which we have pledged to carry out. This is true not only of  nuclear weapons, but also of the country's debt," Kravchuk said.    "It should be understood that in conditions of economic  chaos  it is extremely hard to fulfil one's obligations. Ukraine is  not trying to play a `nuclear card.' We are speaking about  absolutely logical facts which should be taken into  consideration. The first trainload of nuclear warheads has  already arrived in Russia. Ukraine is adherent to the  three-party accords signed in Moscow. But it must be helped in  carrying out the process of nuclear disarmament, not hampered,"  the Ukrainian leader said.</p>

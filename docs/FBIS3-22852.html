Das: "Indian Nuclear Establishments </F> Get Clean Chit From IAEA"]    [Text] The recent statement of Vienna-based International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that nuclear establishments in India  are safe is a rebuff to Columbia Broadcasting Service Network.  In a 60-Minutes report a few days back, CBS had charged that  India's nuclear plants are safety hazards. The CBS charge seems  to be a planted story by the vested interests in the U.S.  Administration to create anti-India opinion in international  community to put pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty]. Dr. R. Chidambaram, chairman of  Atomic Energy Commission, has described the American TV story as  malicious, mischievous, and a deliberate attempt to misrepresent  the facts.    Dr. (Maurice Russel), assistant director general for nuclear  safety of IAEA, on Tuesday rightly said that safety or the lack  of it cannot be judged merely by televising or publishing a few  of the good or bad points. According to IAEA, Atomic Energy  Regulatory Board of India is making substantial progress in  implementing the required safety standards, which are comparable  to internationally acceptable norms and levels. According to  international regulation, the same ultimate safety goods can be  achieved by different countries in different ways through  systems or procedures differently adopted to suit the specific  national conditions. Safety is based on an overall safety  consciousness and safety culture, which have their roots not  only in technical capability but also in the sociocultural  makeup of a country and the openness with which safety-related  issues are discussed with the media as well as national  specialists and international counterparts. Dr. (Maurice), who  visited various Indian nuclear installations last week, was  greatly impressed by the team spirit of Indian qualified  personnel in manning the activities of the plants, which  contribute as essential elements toward building a healthy  safety culture. Dr. (Maurice) has offered to cooperate with  India in emergency safety regulations at its nuclear power  plants.    In fact, the Clinton administration has of late shifted from  its earlier policy and undertones of its policy are biased  against India. Various officials of U.S. Administration have  been issuing irresponsible statements on various aspects of  Indian life, be it trade, human rights, environment, management,  defense, or India's national integration. Based on half-baked  truths, they have been issuing statements on India and have been  trying to pose as if they are the best world preachers. Despite  the vows of interest in participating in India's economic  resurgence, America has been misleading the world community  about India's nuclear policy. By its report on the safety  conditions in the Indian nuclear installations, CBS was trying  to frighten the world when it said that India's nuclear  installations pose safety hazards.    The U.S. Administration has also been insisting on pursuing  the proposal of keeping South Asia a nuclear-free zone in the  face of India's discernible reluctance. The USA is least  bothered with the existence of nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles in Central Asia. It is also not bothered by the  continuing transfer of missile- related technology from China to  Pakistan, including the shipment of Chinese M-11 missile parts  to Islamabad. The USA deliberately kept its eyes and ears  closed when nuclear technology was being clandestinely stolen  from USA by Pakistan. The double standard of the USA on Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty has prevented India from signing the NPT  so far. On the part of India, it is prudent to ignore pinpricks  and statements from the U.S. officials and should not materially  change its nuclear policy of utilizing atomic energy for  peaceful purposes only, necessary for development requirements  of the nation. [sentence as heard] The USA must realize that  preventing others from acquiring nuclear capability will prove  ineffective as long as it perpetuates retention of its own and  others' nuclear arsenals. If the U.S. is really interested in  South Asia to pull back from nuclear threshold, it should  promote such a dialogue rather than exacerbate tensions by  encouraging Kashmiri militancy. India's perseverance and  firmness on the nuclear issue could bring this home.</p>

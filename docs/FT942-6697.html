			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Cornhill fined Pounds 150,000 fornot controlling sales firms: Lautro investigation finds insurance group neglected its role as overseer Cornhill, the composite insurance group, has been fined Pounds 150,000 by Lautro, the life industry's regulator, and ordered to pay Pounds 45,000 costs for failing to control two firms which acted as appointed sales representatives. The announcement was made yesterday after a disciplinary hearing on Thursday night. Cornhill is said to have wanted to resolve the issue before the start of the first Test match between England and New Zealand on Thursday. Cornhill is sponsoring the series. The two charges, admitted by the company, relate to the activities of Cornhill Financial Management (Northern Ireland), formerly known as Castle Insurance Group, and Challenge Financial Management, between 1990 and 1993. Lautro carried out special investigations into both firms last year. In cases where Cornhill failed to ensure that its policies were sold by authorised sales agents, it has offered to return money, together with appropriate interest, to investors who might have suffered a loss. Cornhill refused to give any indication of the scale of the compensation, but Lautro noted the payments were 'a significant cost to the company'. Cornhill was also charged with failing to take steps to ensure that the two appointed firms met regulators' requirements in areas such as recording investor information and taking remedial action where problems had been identified. Cornhill failed, for example, to react to concerns, raised even by some of its own staff, about the possibility of unauthorised selling. While the Pounds 150,000 penalty is only half those levied recently on Norwich Union and Premium Life, the charges relate to concerns raised during the first round of routine inspection visits in December 1990. The other most recent fines have related to misconduct from the second round of routine visits, for which Lautro has increased significantly the penalties it was ready to impose. Cornhill said the fine would be paid from shareholders' rather than policyholders' funds. It has ended its relationship with one of the appointed representative firms. Management at the other firm involved has been changed since the period covered by the charges. Life and pensions policies represent the smaller part of Cornhill's business. In 1993, Cornhill's premium income from life and pensions policies was Pounds 103.8m, while its general insurance premium income totalled Pounds 605.2m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To establish the limit for existing sources the Agency is required to select a limitation no less stringent (floor) than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of sources. To support setting the floor for existing sources the Agency collected information on the number of facilities under each control requirement and the results of the measured emission rates achieved during performance tests of vapor processors at over 100 bulk gasoline terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is estimated that 70 percent of the approximately 1,000 terminals nationwide are required to meet one of the three levels of control requirements, 10, 35, and 80 mg TOC per liter of gasoline loaded. Performance test data were collected for terminals subject to each of those three levels. Performance test data collected from vapor processors at terminals regulated by the 10 mg standard all met the 10 mg limit, but less than 3 percent of terminals are subject to a 10 mg emission limitation. The majority (about 70 percent) of performance test data collected from terminals under the 35 mg NSPS standard achieved less than 10 mg TOC per liter. This indicates that the 10 mg standard is achievable by processors designed to achieve the 35 mg standard. About 40 percent of the terminals are subject to the 35 mg standard. Therefore, the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources is a 10 mg standard, thus 10 mg limit is the floor control level for existing bulk gasoline terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tank truck and railcar vapor leakage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CTG detailing control of fugitive emissions from tank trucks recommends that cargo tanks be tested for vapor leakage on an annual basis, and repaired as necessary. Also, the bulk terminal tank truck loading NSPS (subpart XX of 40 CFR part 60) requires that tank trucks that load gasoline at bulk gasoline terminals be ``vapor-tight;'' that is, they must pass an annual vapor tightness test in accordance with Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A second form of leak testing is carried out by the Department of Transportation (DOT), whose required annual leak tightness testing specifies pressurization of the cargo tank to 80 percent of its maximum allowable working pressure. The DOT considers Method 27 to be an acceptable alternative to its own pressure test. However, since the relief vents on each fuel compartment (which have been found to be the major sources of vapor leakage) are capped off during the DOT test, this test is considered less stringent than Method 27 pressure test. Also, the DOT test does not include a vacuum test as specified in Method 27. The Agency estimates that over 70 percent of existing tank trucks are required to pass the annual vapor tightness testing using Method 27. It has also been determined that the same test can be applied to railcars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

During the assembly of the motor of  one of the main cooling pumps, which was taken apart for  examination purposes, the instrument was probably left between  the casing and the winding, the director of the power plant,  Klaus Distler, announced today. "We believe that the matter has  now been settled," he stated. Preparations for a startup of the  plant, which has been idle for about three months, will  continue. Currently, a spare motor is being prepared for  installation.    For the assembly, however, the approval of the Environment  Ministry in Hesse is required. Hesse's Environment Minister  Joschka Fischer (Greens) viewed the fire as confirmation of his  concerns regarding the safety of the nuclear power plant, which  was built 20 years ago. He asked Environment Minister Toepfer  to withdraw his approval for the renewed operation of the  reactor. Toepfer's ministry announced that it wants to wait for  the report by the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Board.</p>

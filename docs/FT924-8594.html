			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Share price slump leads Tisco to postpone issue TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private sector company, has postponed its Dollars 100m international equity issue to the middle of 1993. This follows a slide in the steel maker's shares on Indian stock exchanges last week after it announced poor half-year results. The company, which had been expected to lead up to 10 Indian companies seeking to raise capital via international issues, deferred its float because it feared its global depository receipts (GDRs) would not fetch more than Rs80 each this month. Brokers said when the company's shares were buoyant, at around Rs400 last May, the company could have expected Rs350 per GDR. At the current low domestic price of Rs240 a share, the company would have to sell its GDRs at around Rs80. Tisco said it was not short of foreign exchange, and would wait until its shares recovered before going ahead with the issue. Mr Ishaat Hussain, executive director for finance, said he was confident the company would eventually secure a good price for its GDRs.</p>

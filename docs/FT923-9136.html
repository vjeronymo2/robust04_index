			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / People: Baxter moves to NatWest NatWest has recruited a seasoned hand to manage its newly formed life insurance subsidiary, National Westminster Life Assurance. Peter Baxter, currently head of marketing with Lloyds Abbey Life, will take charge of the new subsidiary from September 1. Baxter will be heading a new joint venture which will be capitalised at about Pounds 150m and of which 92.5 per cent will be owned by NatWest. The products will be NatWest's own brand and cover three core areas; life assurance including mortgage-related products, pensions and long-term savings products. NatWest, which had been the UK's largest purveyor of independent financial advice, stunned the industry last year when it announced it was forming a 'tie' with Clerical Medical under which it would sell that company's products exclusively. Financial Services Act rules require those who sell financial products such as life insurance either to be independent and recommend the best of all producers' products or to sell the products of a single firm.</p>

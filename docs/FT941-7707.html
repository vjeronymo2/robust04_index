			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Bangkok Bank cuts issue price Bangkok Bank's Dollars 400m convertible Eurobond has received a lukewarm response, forcing the bank to reduce the price at which holders can convert the bonds into shares, according to bankers and brokers in Bangkok. The offer is the largest Thai Euroconvertible issue to date. Thai companies raised Dollars 1.4bn by this method last year. Typical Thai conversion price premiums above the share price at the time of launch have been 20 per cent; Bangkok Bank had hoped for a premium of between 23 and 26 per cent, but was obliged to settle at 15 per cent. The interest rate for the issue, lead managed by Morgan Stanley, was set at 3.25 per cent. The issue was fully subscribed, with options for a further Dollars 60m, although Bangkok Bank had considered raising up to Dollars 500m.</p>

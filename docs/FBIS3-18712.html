			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Begging Letter to the Chancellor"] </F>   [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl is to save an important  large order for the Daimler-Benz subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace  (Dasa). Together with their European Airbus partners, the  Germans want to deliver planes for approximately 10 billion  German marks to Saudi Arabia. However, U.S. President Bill  Clinton announced that Saudi Arabia will buy the planes from the  U.S. companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. As a result, Dasa  Chief Juergen Schrempp sent a begging letter to the chancellors.  "Since we know that the negotiations in Saudi Arabia have not  yet been finally concluded," the letter says, Kohl should  advocate the Europeans' cause. In Dasa alone, almost 1,300 jobs  have to be abolished by 1997, if the order is lost. "Only a  personal intervention by yourself," Schrempp wrote in clumsy  German, could "bring about at least a partial turnaround." The  chancellor has not yet reacted. He is angry with Schrempp and  his colleagues. Over the past months, they have repeatedly  criticized the Federal Government harshly for drastically  reducing research subsidies for aviation and space flight.</p>

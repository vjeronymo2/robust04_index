			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andras Kerekes] </F>   [Excerpts] The outcome of 127 mandates has been decided in  the first round of the elections. [passage omitted] In the  first round 68.9 percent of the electorate voted. A news  conference for the international press ended not long ago at the  National Election Center, where they primarily wanted to inform  the foreign journalists about the overall preliminary results.  [passage omitted]    They have now also announced the distribution of seats on  the  regional party lists. According to this, the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] will receive another 53 seats, with 32.9  percent of the votes; the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has  28 seats with 19.7 percent; the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]  has 18 seats with 11.7 percent; the Independent Smallholders  Party [FKGP] has 14 seats with not quite 9 percent of the votes;  and the Christian Democrats [KDNP] -- although they gained a few  votes more than Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] -- the  latter received seven seats but the KDNP received only five.  This is because of the different numbers of voters in the  regions.    A total of 27 seats passed from the regional lists to the  national lists [to be decided in the second round].    Zoltan Toth, head of the national election office, said that  of approximately 22,000 ballot papers they are unable to account  for a total of 18, but they hope that by 1500 this afternoon,  the time of the briefing in parliament, the premliminary results  of the first round will be complete including these.

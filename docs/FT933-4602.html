			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / MGN may save Pounds 70m through Maxwell agreement MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has provisionally agreed to settle a series of legal disputes with the private companies in the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell which would save it nearly Pounds 70m in tax and costs. The agreement, described in a circular sent to MGN shareholders yesterday, removes the potential for lengthy and uncertain court action. It may also help ease the sale of the 54.8 per cent of MGN shares held by the private Maxwell companies. Under the plan, MGN will abandon potential net claims of at least Pounds 130m against the private companies in connection with money siphoned off by Mr Maxwell. Administrators to the private companies, from accountants Arthur Andersen, will in turn waive counter legal actions against MGN and allow it to release Pounds 19m in provisions. In exchange for a payment of up to Pounds 2.8m, MGN will be assigned losses from the private companies which will reduce its tax bill by up to Pounds 56m for the period 1989-91. Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of MGN, said: 'The directors have concluded that the benefits  .. and removal of uncertainties significantly outweigh any benefits which might accrue from pursuing large but potentially difficult and uncertain claims.' The circular says that the money which MGN could claim from the private empire includes Pounds 80m owed to it by Robert Maxwell Group, Pounds 30m from London and Bishopsgate Group and Pounds 20m from Bishopsgate Investment Trust. But Mr John Allwood, MGN's finance director, said that since the private companies were insolvent, any eventual payments would be unlikely to exceed 6p in the pound. He said MGN would be able to reduce its provisions relating to the misappropriated funds from Pounds 50m to Pounds 35m as a result of the settlement, and release up to Pounds 4m in tax provisions. The agreement proposes that Robert Maxwell Holdings (RMH), one of the private companies, will split equally with MGN up to Pounds 10m of any costs in connection with a claim brought against the empire by Banque Nationale de Paris over a lease at Worship Street in London. The settlement does not cover outstanding litigation on a lease at Orbit House in London, and several insurance policies concerning Mr Maxwell. MGN will retain the right to make legal claims against private companies other than RMH, but will allow RMH to retain the first Pounds 7.5m of any recoveries. Shareholders will be asked to approve the settlement at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on September 23 in London.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney audit set to open Euro Disney's banks hope next week to appoint an investigative auditor to conduct a special analysis of the troubled leisure group's finances. They want the audit before they begin negotiations for Euro Disney's emergency financial restructuring. The banks, led by Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, have emerged from a week of intensive meetings in Paris with representatives of Euro Disney and Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of its equity. A senior banker present at the meetings described the discussions as 'workman-like'. However, the banks' steering committee, which includes J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and National Westminster, as well as BNP and Indosuez, is understood to have told Disney it would not start serious negotiations until the audit was completed. The steering committee has seen presentations from prospective auditors, and is expected to announce its choice next week. The audit is intended to analyse Euro Disney's financial position and to assess its future requirements. It could take up to a month to complete. This means that full negotiations might not start until mid-January. The Disney camp, which hopes the banks will agree to a debt-for-equity swap as part of a package to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net debt, is keen for the negotiations to be completed swiftly. Euro Disney recently announced a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the financial year to September 30, and risks running out of cash by the end of this year.</p>

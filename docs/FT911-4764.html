			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: Japanese lack confidence in chip talks with US JAPANESE officials are publicly confident - but privately cautious - about prospects for a quick settlement of a new semiconductor pact with the US government. A new round of negotiations was to begin here today, but the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said last night that the delayed arrival of US representatives would mean a resumption delayed until early next week. Japanese negotiators are doubtful that the pact will be settled at this meeting, and say that the US position on several sensitive issues, such as a target for market share for foreign semiconductor chips in Japan, is 'unreasonable'. The present five-year pact is to expire at the end of July. US and Japanese industry officials have wanted the new agreement to be finished well before then. The most serious disputes are problems unsettled from the present pact, including the prickly question of whether Japan agreed that a 20 per cent foreign share was a target. US officials insist that 20 per cent was part of the agreement, and want at least that figure clearly stated in the new agreement. At the end of last year, the foreign share was reckoned to be 13.2 per cent. Japanese negotiators say that, if they allow the 20 per cent figure to be identified, the pact could set a dangerous precedent for managed trade agreements with the US. Tokyo fears that US frustration in disputed areas - ranging from cars to computers - could lead to a rush of market share targets. 'The market share problem will not be settled by the pact negotiators. This is a political problem and it will need a political solution,' a senior Japanese trade official said. Miti officials expect that they will have to include a reference to 20 per cent somewhere in the new agreement, but they want the final wording unclear enough to make any claim by Washington to establish the pact as a precedent for other products difficult to secure. Although the concept of a target remains disputed, Japanese negotiators say that the two sides are close to agreement on how to measure the market share. Until now, two sets of figures have been used - a survey of chip-makers by the independent World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) body and a Miti survey of users. Since the start of negotiations, the Japanese government has insisted that Washington drop sanctions imposed under the present agreement. One negotiator said US officials presume that 'we will drop our opposition to the 20 per cent figure', if the sanctions are removed. 'We know that they are using these old sanctions as a bargaining chip. It is quite unreasonable. The sanctions are ridiculous and our concerns about the 20 per cent are very reasonable,' he added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The minimum Private Capital levels of $2.5 million for section 301(c) companies and $1.5 million for section 301(d) companies are floors established by the Act. If a Licensee has no Leverage, SBA is not at financial risk if Private Capital is reduced. Accordingly, &sect;107.802 is proposed to be amended so that non-Leveraged Licensees may have voluntary decreases in Private Capital as long as they do not drop below the applicable statutory minimum. Licensees which are liquidating in accordance with a plan previously approved in writing by SBA may decrease private capital without restriction. All decreases in private capital for non-leveraged licensees shall still be reported to SBA pursuant to &sect;107.1004(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;107.904(a) SBA's prior written approval is presently required whenever a Licensee disposes of assets, including assets acquired in liquidation, by transfer to an Associate (except as a dividend); and SBA's approval is conditional upon a showing that the proposed terms of disposal are no less favorable to the Licensee than are elsewhere obtainable. The need for such a restriction is obvious when SBA is at risk as a guarantor, creditor, or investor. When no such risk to SBA exists, the need for the restriction disappears. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12778, and With the Regulatory Flexibility and Paperwork Reduction Acts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule will not be a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 because, if promulgated as final, it is not likely to have an annual impact on the national economy of $100 million or more, and, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is proposed pursuant to a statutory mandate (Section 408(d) of Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) direction SBA to review its regulations and to exempt non-Leveraged Licensees from compliance with those regulations primarily intended to insure the safety and soundness of Leveraged Licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential benefits of this proposed regulation have been set forth in the discussion above, under Supplementary Information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential cost of this proposed regulation cannot be quantified or estimated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA is not aware of reasonably feasible alternatives to this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBA certifies that this proposed regulation has no federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12278 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of Executive Order 12278, SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Rights and wrongs Trafalgar House's new management certainly has some gall. Barely a month after an annual meeting at which last year's accounts were voted through despite criticism from small shareholders of its auditors, it has discovered the need for a further Pounds 120m in provisions. It has come to the market for a Pounds 205m rights issue despite - or perhaps because of - its failure to dispose of assets at reasonable prices. The earnings outlook remains depressing. Shareholders tempted to swallow the argument that the rights shares carry an attractive yield are being bribed with their own money. This year's dividend will be paid from reserves. The timing of such an opportunistic strike is explained by Hongkong Land's unusual option deal which commits it to buy shares at a rights adjusted price of 79p from a still anonymous counterparty. That both underpins the share price and means the counterparty is able to underwrite a large portion of the rights issue at a guaranteed profit. Without the option deal the issue could scarcely have been underwritten in the market. But the deal expires in May and the share price will again become subject to fundamental influences. Investors who do take up their rights will be pinning their faith in Hongkong Land, which looks set to use the opportunity to raise its stake to 29.9 per cent. Its extra influence might help turn the company round but it will be a long struggle. Trafalgar might have served its shareholders better by persuading Hongkong Land to mount a full bid in the first place.</p>

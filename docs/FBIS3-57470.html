The newspaper points out that during the January 24 meeting  with President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  "according to some data, agreed to the appointment of Boris  Fedorov as the minister of finance directly accountable to the  premier". IZVESTIYA believes that the country's grim economic  prospect could be the main reason for such a decision.    "According to V. Krivov, chief of the group of experts to  the  Russian president, a rapid increase in oil production costs, as  a result of which the export of oil, just as that of coal and  timber, would become unprofitable, is reckoned to be the main  factor which may lead to a further sharp drop in industrial  output, decline in the living standards of people and depletion  of the import of food. Chernomyrdin could not fail to know about  such a prospect".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Ella  Pamfilova, minister of the social protection of the population,  who tendered her resignation. Pamfilova said in particular that  she visualised the possibility of her resignation long before  she took a final decision which was made public on January 16.    Pamfilova said the loss of hope that the prime minister and  the president would heed Yegor Gaydar's proposals about 'the  need to pursue a coordinated policy between the Central Bank and  the Finance Ministry, grant an appropriate status to the latter,  and to shape a social policy dovetailed with decisions that are  made at the macroeconomic level" became the reasons for her  final decision to resign.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on ella Pamfilova's resignation.    The newspaper criticises her activities as the minsiter of  social protection. "Pamfilova is known to have gone on leave  with a subsequent resignation from the ministerial post. This  closely resembles taking to flight. But who will pay the debts  to the older people?" the newspaper asks.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation. The  newspaper emphasises that the matter was decided upon by the  president, not the prime minister. "The president could not  ignore the sentiments of a vast majority of people in Russia who  are disgruntled over the results of reforms and who associate  the sharp decline in the living standards with Gaydar's name".    "Notwithstanding all his sympathy for Gaydar, Yeltsin had to  agree to his resignation."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on housing for servicemen.    "The Housing Problem in the Armed Forces is a Political One"  is the headline under which the newspaper carries an article  about the servicemen's welfare problems. "It is at unreasonable,  to say the least, to allow the army or, at any rate, a large  proportion of army personnel, to proceed along the road leading  from hopes to despair".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with former deputy  speaker Yuriy Voronin.    The newspaper reports that voronin intends to stage a  comeback in politics. In the interview, Voronin again recounted  the October 3-4 events in Moscow and the role played by  politicians who retain their positions in high places now as  well. Voronin is of the opinion that "as a result of the  September-October crisis, it was democracy, not the legislative  branch of power, that turned out to be the loser in Russia".    IZVESTIYA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA run carry a photograph of  former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy in the Lefortovo prison.  The picture was taken by a REUTER photographer on January 23.    "How and why was a foreign reporter allowed to go and see in  prison the person whom Russian ones are not allowed even to  approach?" IZVESTIYA queries.</p>

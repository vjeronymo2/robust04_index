			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HOT PRODUCER READY TO MAKE A BANG AS ACTOR  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S HOT -- but really hot -- producer, Don Simpson, is making his  acting debut in James Toback's coming controversial movie, "The Big Bang." This  one received an ovation at the recent Telluride Film Festival and is all about  real people baring their souls on the subjects of life, death, sex, and the  universe.  </P> <P> Simpson has grown rich and famous as a producer. He and partner Jerry  Bruckheimer did "Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop," and "Top Gun." But Don  recently lost about 40 pounds and became a health and fitness nut.  </P> <P> So now he'll also play the role of the racing driver Aldo Benadetti in the  coming Tom Cruise film, "Days of Thunder." Filming begins Nov. 17 in North  Carolina, Florida and Arizona.  </P> <P> MALCOLM FORBES, Marella Agnelli and Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat laid on  cocktails in the Forbes gallery in New York for their coming "Masquerade" gala  happening Dec. 1 to honor AmFAR's Elizabeth Taylor. I had two dates for this  one -- Hollywood's rising personal manager Keith Addis and his brand new  partner, Nick Wechsler, who co-produced and produced "sex, lies and videotape,"  as well as "Drugstore Cowboy." These guys have formed a management-production  company that will be an L.A. organization of note. (Addis manages Sting, Jeff  Goldblum, Mimi Rogers, Steve Guttenberg and people like that.)  </P> <P> HERE's the real reason why David Rockefeller sold the famous Rockefeller Center  to the sons-of-Mitsubishis. There are more than 100 accredited heirs to the  sprawling Rockefeller fortune. Once upon a time, theirs was a name to conjure  with all over the United States and they were the "masters of the universe" of  their day. Today, the Rockefellers are considered "pikers" when it comes to  wealth and are only middling rich by Nouvelle Society standards.  </P> <P> Those in charge felt the tax situation would be onerous upon the deaths of  Laurence and David Rockefeller. They felt that the other heirs need money NOW  to protect their futures.  </P> <P> Did the Rockefellers sell cheap? Some insiders think so. These smarties  estimate that the real value of Rockefeller Center is around $4 billion. The  Rockefellers sold to the Japanese for only $846 million.  </P> <P> FINALLY CAUGHT up with Faye Dunaway on TNT-TV's "Cold Sassy Tree." Lo and  behold, this is Faye's most subtle and moving performance in years. She has  admirably subdued herself. (Those electric gestures and that high voltage  personality have at times been an albatross around her talented neck. She was  just too much for audiences to take -- or to take seriously.)  </P> <P> In "Cold Sassy Tree," the star is in complete control. This is miles away from  the pyrotechnics of "Mommie Dearest" and is a finer piece of work than her more  recent, acclaimed, but largely unseen movie, "Barfly."  </P> <P> If Faye Dunaway is lucky and gets more good scripts, she could begin to make  those younger stars -- Streep, Turner, Pfeiffer, Foster -- just a little bit  nervous.  </P></p>

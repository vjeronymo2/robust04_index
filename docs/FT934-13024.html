			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Toytown tales of teapots and Mighty Max - A look at the success of and City support for Torquil Norman's Bluebird ENTHUSIASM, creativity and charisma are not qualities necessarily associated with captains of industry. However, they are three words which constantly crop up in conversations about the chief executive of Bluebird Toys. The City fairly gushes with goodwill for the man. One broker with 25 years experience said: 'I think it is tremendously refreshing that despite the problems and the ups and downs he has maintained that enthusiasm for his product. I think that's lovely.' And if Mr Torquil Norman is riding high so is his company's share price which reached a new peak of 543p last month having hit a low of 26p in December 1990. The price rose sharply in late September when the company reported interim pre-tax profits of almost Pounds 2m for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 234,000. Mr Norman started Bluebird in 1980 to make the Big Yellow Teapot, a teapot-cum-house he designed for children aged three to five during a year or so of unemployment. That spell followed a boardroom row at Berwick Timpo, the toy company he stumbled into after almost 10 years in banking. He found he 'couldn't bear' to licence anyone else to make the Teapot. About 120,000 were sold in 1985, the same year the company floated on the USM, valued at about Pounds 5.3m. There was also an element of principle behind the project. 'I started the business in the middle of a recession and I really did it with a sort of idealistic feeling that we could create jobs in the UK, but that sounds a bit pretentious.' And create jobs he did, about 38 initially. Declaring that a weak sterling meant toys assembled by Bluebird from other companies' components could compete with imports from the Far East, Mr Norman watched the profits roll in. 'It was incredible. We thought it would never come to an end.' In quick succession Bluebird acquired Peter Pan Playthings for Pounds 3.5m in June 1987 and Merit Toys in April 1988 for Pounds 1.7m. By this time Mr Norman had stepped down as chief executive to concentrate on designing toys. Profits began to decline in 1989 as more difficult trading conditions coincided with the cost of buying 300,000 sq ft of assembly and warehouse space in Merthyr Tydfil. The situation was further aggravated by retailers reducing orders which caused working capital problems. By 1990 profits had fallen to Pounds 856,000 and the shares, which took their first sharp knock in the 1987 crash, continued their fall to 26p. Bluebird announced a Pounds 5.9m rights issue and Mr Norman was voted back as chief executive. He was quick to realise his ideals could not withstand recession in the UK. He cut the 1,000-strong workforce. It now stands at about 420. He closed two factories, consolidating operations on one site at Merthyr Tydfil. In 1991 the company booked exceptional costs of Pounds 3.46m to pay for the shake up and pre-tax losses deepened to Pounds 3.55m. About 50 per cent of turnover is sold in the UK, with about half sourced in the Far East, mainly China which means that about three quarters of total volume is based on overseas manufacture. 'The point is that the cost of developing, tooling and packaging can't be recovered if you are only selling in the UK,' said Mr Norman. Bluebird returned to the black in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.55m and paid its first dividend since 1989 with future hopes pinned on the so far successful new pocket-money sized ranges, Polly Pocket and Mighty Max. He blamed himself for some of the difficulties. 'I could be accused of being a bit slow.' However, he refused to claim credit for the turnround. 'I may have been a fairly natural marketer, but in those days it was fairly easy. Now we are much larger and it is very different. There really is a team effort.' The Eton-educated son of Air Commodore Sir Nigel Norman was not obviously destined for such a career. 'I was a great disappointment to everybody going into toys,' he said, with barely concealed satisfaction. Things might well have been different but for peace in east Asia. 'I was due to go to Korea and the war stopped about three weeks before I was to have gone out. So my mother sent me a cable saying 'Bad luck, you'll have to go to Cambridge instead,'' he said, laughing. 'It didn't seem to matter about exams in those days.' Leaving Cambridge with a degree in law, he read of JP Morgan and wrote to the bank asking for work. He spent more than four years in America, meeting his fiancee at a parachute club and acquiring a distaste for Britain's political culture. He now describes himself as 'virtually a republican' and an enemy of the class system. 'In industry you have to take decisions quickly and sort things out. Politicians are increasingly professionals, lawyers and so on. The result is they are constantly tinkering and never analysing what needs to be done.' In spite of early doubts about British society, Mr Norman left JP Morgan in the unpleasant aftermath of a merger and returned to the UK. 'I couldn't stand all the merger politics. All the redefining of jobs instead of getting on with them. Anyway I wanted to get married.' He took a job with Philip Hill Higginson Erlanger (now Hill Samuel) only to be confronted with another equally unsettling merger after another four years. As his disaffection with banking grew Mr Norman became more and more involved with a small venture capital company he and a colleague had formed. Called Batehill, it traded under the deathless slogan, 'putting skates on business'. When, during a refinancing the banks made it a condition that Batehill put skates on just one business, Mr Norman chose the toy company, Berwick Timpo, because it was the biggest. Now aged 60, Mr Norman continues with his lifelong hobby of flying classic aeroplanes and has no plans to retire. 'I'll be around for a while.'</p>

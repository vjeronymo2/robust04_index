			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (YONHAP) -- A high-level Chinese  Foreign Ministry official visited Pyongyang last week and  advised North Korea to compromise and negotiate a peaceful  solution to the nuclear problem, a South Korean Embassy source  here said Wednesday.    "A high-level official in charge of Asian Affairs at the  Chinese Foreign Ministry came back after visiting North Korea  last week," the source said, suggesting that Beijing is involved  in last-minute efforts to persuade Pyongyang.    Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told visiting  South Korean Lawmaker Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Wednesday that his  country is urging North Korea to settle the nuclear row through  dialogue and that Pyongyang responded positively.    Tang said this information had been delivered to South Korea  and the United States, according to DLP Spokesman Son Hak-kyu.    The Chinese Government welcomes South Korea's flexibility in  trying to resolve the nuclear dispute, such as withdrawing its  demand for an inter-Korean envoy exchange, Tang was quoted as  saying.    On the delayed conclusion of a South Korean-Chinese aviation  agreement, Tang said the two countries had agreed on overall  principles and commercial airline companies must now determine  the business terms of the pact.    He said he hopes to see the agreement signed soon.    The vice foreign minister said the two countries will sign  an  agreement on forming a South Korea-China Industrial Committee  sometime this month. South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang  Pyong-tae will sign the accord along with Wang Zhongyu, minister  of the State Economic and Trade Commission.    The committee, agreed when South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, is expected to convene its  first meeting in Seoul.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] According to Interfax sources, the forthcoming CIS  summit will concentrate on the implementation of the economic  union treaty. The discussion will begin with the draft  agreement on Ukraine's membership in the economic union as an  associated member.    The CIS leaders will also consider two cardinally important  economic documents. The first one is the draft agreement on the  inter-state economic committee -- a permanent executive and  coordinating body accountable to the Council of the Heads of  State and to the Council of the Heads of Government.    The second one is the agreement on the creation of a free  trade zone, providing for a gradual annulment of customs duties,  taxes and non-tariff limitations. The free trade zone is viewed  as a transition to a customs union which is to become the  subject of a separate agreement.    The CIS leaders are also expected to discuss a new version  of  the provision on the Council of the CIS Defense Ministers, given  changes in military-cooperation bodies. IF Note: The councils  of the CIS defense and foreign ministers are to discuss matters  pertaining to the Collective Security Council, and adopt a  declaration on this body dealing with financial,  personnel-related and functional question. The Collective  Security Council was created in 1993 by the CIS heads of state  and includes the countries which have signed the collective  security agreement: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  Moldova, Turkmenistan and Ukraine did not sign the collective  security agreement.    A special accent will be put on the problems facing  Tajikistan. The foreign and defense ministers are to propose  additional measures to stabilize the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border.    The Council of the CIS border-troop commanders is to present  a report on Russia's talks with the Central Asian and  Transcaucasian states on cooperation in the protection of the  borders with third countries.    The CIS leaders are to sign a memorandum on cooperation  between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in protecting these  countries' borders. IF Note: the draft memorandum says that  the protection of the borders with the countries which are not  members of the CIS is these countries' common concern and is not  aimed at any third countries. This measure is to help Russia,  Ukraine and Belarus to regulate migration processes and combat  terrorism, drug trafficking and other trans-border crimes.    Commander of the Russian border troops General Andrey  Nikolayev told Interfax that support given to the Russian  initiative was a welcome fact. He also announced that Ukraine  had initialled this document and expressed hope that other CIS  countries would join it. He noted, however, that the memorandum  was an outline document and did not contain any specific  measures or figures.    A comprehensive CIS agreement on border issues should be  gradually drafted, he said, because on their own the CIS  countries cannot cope with the problem of border protection.</p>

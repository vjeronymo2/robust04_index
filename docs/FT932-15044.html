			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Holders of Daf bonds plan lawsuit A GROUP of investors who hold bonds issued in 1988 by Daf, the liquidated Dutch truckmaker that has recently been re-established as Daf Trucks, said yesterday they plan to sue the issue's lead-manager, ABN Amro Bank, as well as its trustee, Nederlandsche Trust Maatschappij. Mr Gary Klesch, chairman of London-based Klesch &amp; Co, said that ABN Amro's 1988 prospectus had been 'misleading,' while the trustee company had neglected to protect bondholders' rights when Daf was restructured in 1992. A spokesman for ABN Amro said the bank was aware of Mr Klesch's charges but rejected them. The investors, who belong to the newly-formed Association for the Promotion of the Interests of Daf NV Bondholders, will be seeking damages of Fl 150m (Dollars 83m), which is equivalent to the total value of the 1988 issue of 6 3/4 per cent bonds. The bonds have a nominal value of Fl 1,000 but are trading at just Fl 7 following the collapse of the original Daf company and the formation of its successor. Mr Klesch said that, so far, the association represented investors holding Daf bonds worth Fl 30m and that discussions were taking place with other bondholders. At issue is the prospectus's wording on the subject of equal treatment of current and future creditors. Mr Klesch said holders of the bond issued by Daf NV, a holding company, were given to understand that they would be accorded equal treatment if the company provided security to any future lenders. In the 1992 restructuring, security was furnished to Daf's bankers by the company's operating subsidiaries, not the holding company itself, he said.</p>

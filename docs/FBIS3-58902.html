This was confirmed today  by the German Foreign Ministry. It said the `Palestinian  Information Office' will be upgraded to the rank of `Palestinian  Delegation General' [General-Delegation], following the visit to  Bonn by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in December 1993.    'Abdullah Franji, the long-term PLO spokesman and the new  delegate general, will be entitled in the future to raise the  Palestinian flag in front of his office headquarters in the Bonn  government district, but will not enjoy diplomatic immunity nor  other privileges which are reserved for regular embassies. The  `Delegation General' and its staff will, however, be included in  the `List of Diplomatic Missions and Other Representations'  issued by the Foreign Ministry.    For its part, the German Government intends to set up a  German representation -- officially a German aid coordination  office -- as Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced during  'Arafat's visit.</p>

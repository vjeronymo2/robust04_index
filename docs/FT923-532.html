			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Staff at Bank 'bribed by BCCI' THE Serious Fraud Office and the US authorities are investigating allegations that at least two Bank of England officials took bribes from senior executives of Bank of Credit and Commerce International during the 1980s. After the collapse of BCCI last year the officials were the subject of an internal inquiry by the Bank which found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, it subsequently asked the SFO to carry out its own investigation. A Bank of England official said yesterday: 'We are aware of these allegations and have been for some time. When we first became aware of them we investigated them exhaustively and found they had no substance whatsoever. But in view of the seriousness of the allegations we referred them to the criminal authorities.' The Bank launched its internal investigation more than nine months ago after it learnt that the allegations had been made to US investigators probing the BCCI affair. They were later repeated to the inquiry chaired by Lord Justice Bingham. The allegations were made by an individual claiming to be on familiar terms with a number of BCCI officials. The individual, who describes himself as an accountant and former Pakistani military intelligence officer, is believed to have told Mr Robert Morgenthau, New York district attorney, that in 1980 he saw briefcases filled with money being passed by BCCI executives to middle-ranking Bank officials. According to a senior US investigator, the alleged bribes may have been in the form of both cash and sexual favours. He added: 'We have not been able yet to either confirm or disprove these reports, but we hope the matter will be resolved in the UK in a manner that will restore public trust in the British central bank.' The allegations came just days before the expected publication in the US of a report by Mr John Kerry, a Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations sub-committee which is investigating BCCI. The report is expected to be scathing about the Bank's handling of BCCI.</p>

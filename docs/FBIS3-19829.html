In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cot criticized the EU  states of causing a "confidence crisis" in parliament. With a  view to the EU foreign ministers' meeting on Tuesday [22 March],  intended to settle the week-long internal dispute on the future  weight of votes in the Council of Ministers after an  enlargement, he warns the Twelve particularly against giving in  to British pressure and leaving the blocking minority at 23  votes.    The Parliament would not accept that the differences of  opinion regarding the voting practice in the Council are  "patched up," the chairman of the strongest group (198 deputies)  in the Strasbourg parliament said. "It will not be enough to  satisfy the positions of one or the other or to find ambiguous  formulas that would make it possible for (British Foreign  Secretary -- the editors) Mr. Hurd to save face."    Should the blocking minority of 23 votes for ballots with a  qualified majority in the Council be maintained, then the  already tiresome decisionmaking process in the Union would  become even more difficult. According to Cot, the British  Government has meanwhile openly admitted "that it will indeed  try to use enlargement to trim Europe's sails, keep it on its  course, and keep the specter of `federalism' at bay."  Parliament was firmly determined "not to accept such a change  of course. Raising the blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes is  the absolute minimum Parliament can accept!"    Regardless of the controversy about the blocking minority,  Cot believes that there are numerous other factors that might  make it impossible for the member of the European Parliament to  vote in favor of the membership agreement scheduled for 4 May.  For months, the "negative signals" from the Council of  Ministers to the address of the European deputies have  increased: The suggestion to make the sessions of the Council of  Ministers more "clear" has fallen on deaf ears; among other  things, the member states reject "any discussion" on democratic  control in connection with intensifying judicial and police  cooperation; the issue of the rights of parliamentary  sub-committees has also been blocked; moreover, several member  states have upheld the "threat to reverse achievements in common  foreign policy under the cover of subsidiarity."    Similar to Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros  Pangalos, a few days ago Cot conceded that it might have been a  mistake to enlarge the Union first and later deepen it. Cot  emphasized that, only after long hesitation, Parliament  abandoned its original demand to carry out institutional reform  of the Union before enlarging it. This order was opted for  ultimately, among other things, to signal to the membership  candidates that they are welcome in the Union.    For Cot, "the EU states have fallen behind their obligations  under the Maastricht Treaty to consolidate the Union. On the  contrary, the Twelve initially accepted a creeping process of  disintegration, which has now been clearly confirmed by the  British foreign secretary." To return to the right course,  moving up the date of the government conference on examining the  Maastricht Treaty, scheduled for 1996, could be considered "to  discuss all pending issues right now." However, this would put  at risk enlargement, scheduled for early 1995.    If the EU foreign ministers indeed wanted to save the entry  round, they would have to make sure "that the decisionmaking  processes in the Union are not weakened. The Council of  Ministers must undertake clear political obligation to the  necessity of institutional reform. Without such a commitment  there can be no enlargement!"</p>

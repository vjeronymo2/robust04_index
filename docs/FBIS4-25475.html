			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Total output in each  category of meat, eggs, aquatic products and vegetables has  increased 50 to 80 percent over the 1987 figures.    In an interview with XINHUA reporters, the director of the  All-China Office of the Shopping Basket Project Tang Yong said  that thanks to the efforts of the project, citizens' consumption  of non-staple foods has greatly increased.    The project began seven years ago with the aim to ensure  supplies of vegetables, meat, eggs and other non-staple foods  for large and medium-sized cities.    Since 1987, per capita consumption of meat in China has  increased from 18.4 kg to 32.1 kg, of eggs from 5.5 kg to 9.3  kg, of aquatic products from 8.8 kg to 15.2 kg, and of  vegetables from 135.3 kg to 186.7 kg.    Tang said that China's citizens now consume more diversified  kinds of non-staple food with higher nutritional quality.    New varieties introduced from abroad in recent years can be  seen in today's vegetable stalls. Out-of-season vegetables now  enrich household meals.    He said that the farmers now pay greater attention to  adjusting their production structure to meet the demands of the  market.    To ensure the smooth carrying out of the project, many large  and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,  Guangzhou and Wuhan have taken effective measures.    Construction funds and risk funds for vegetable growing have  been set up to protect farmers. Measures such as keeping  reserves of important non-staple foods have also been adopted.    The Shanghai government will allocate 266 million yuan in  opening up 3,000 more hectares of vegetable fields this year.    The Beijing government plans to invest 67 million yuan in  opening up 10,000 hectares of new vegetable fields and  introducing mass production of vegetables in its suburbs.    He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade in charge of  supplies of non-staple foods, said the state will spare no  efforts to protect vegetable fields in city suburbs. He  suggested that vegetable fields should be included in  comprehensive city construction plans.</p>

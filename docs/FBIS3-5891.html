Seoul's  Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and U.S. Assistant Secretary of  State for Political and Military Affairs Robert Gallucci met to  evaluate recent developments concerning International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in North Korea and inter-Korean  dialogue.    Officials here said the two sides will reaffirm their two  preconditions for Washington to hold the next round of  high-level talks with Pyongyang -- the IAEA inspections must  conclude successfully and the two Koreas must exchange special  envoys.    "One year ago tomorrow, North Korea announced its withdrawal  from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Today, we are still  wrestling with the problem," Kim said in opening the meeting.  "We have to resolve the problem through dialogue. We maintain  that principle," he said.    The IAEA team is currently in North Korea for inspections  after a one-year break but the monitoring activities are not  going as smoothly as expected, according to officials here and  in Washington. Meanwhile, the inter-Korean contacts on  exchanging envoys are dragging on with the next meeting set for  Saturday. Officials say the March 21 meeting between North Korea  and the United States may well have to be delayed until the two  preconditions are met.    "We have been at a crossroads, and we are again in that  position," said Gallucci. "This will be a good time to discuss  the next steps to take together."</p>

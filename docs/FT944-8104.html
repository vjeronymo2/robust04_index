			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Brazil under pressure on indexation: Pay rises in line with prices stoking inflation Inflation in Brazil is expected to remain higher than hoped until the end of the year, and is adding to pressure for the government to outlaw the use of indices which keep salaries and taxes rising in line with prices. The private Fipe research institute announced yesterday that inflation between October 16 and November 15 rose to 3.45 per cent, compared to less than 1 per cent in September after the introduction of a new currency, the Real. The government's official inflation figure for the period, due to be published later this week, is likely to show inflation rising from 1.86 per cent in October to about 3 per cent. The rise stems partly from one-off factors such as rent reviews and higher food prices after a drought, and the inflation rate is expected to fall slightly next month. But unexpectedly high inflation in the government index, known as the IPC-r, is worrying because, according to law, salaries have to be increased in line with the index. The IPC-r has risen nearly 20 per cent since the Real's launch, leading to a bumper pay rise for workers with pay reviews. The increased salaries are also probably adding to inflation by stoking consumer demand. Before launching the Real, the government was forced by Congress to accept the link between salaries and the index. Congress feared inflation would otherwise eat away at workers' spending power. The government was worried about its tax revenues and ruled that overdue tax payments would be increased in line with inflation, as measured by a separate index. Advisers to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, due to take over as president on January 1, are now starting to study how to remove or modify these indices, which most economists agree fan inflation. One idea is to allow companies to negotiate wages directly with their workers, instead of relying on industry-wide union agreements and indices. However, persuading Congress to accept such measures will be difficult, especially since the government had aimed for monthly inflation of only about 1.5 per cent for this year. Many congressmen, and some ministries, oppose removing indices because they believe Brazilian workers do not have sufficient bargaining power against their employers.</p>

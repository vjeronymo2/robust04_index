			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / When the battle's lost and won: The hurly-burly facing Canada's new Liberal government after this week's elections It might be expected that people would show a little gratitude to a government which gave them one of the world's lowest inflation rates, the cheapest borrowing costs in two decades, badly needed tax reforms, and a free-trade agreement with their biggest trading partner. Canadian voters displayed no such sentiments in Monday's general election. They not only booted out the Progressive Conservative party which has governed Canada for the past nine years, but pushed it to the brink of oblivion with just two of the 295 seats in the House of Commons. Their inexperienced leader, Ms Kim Campbell, lacked political instincts and a coherent platform, and lost her seat. The party has also fallen victim to the profound strains which have been tearing at the fabric of Canadian society for the past 20 years. These tensions - between English and French-speaking Canadians, between central Canada and the west, and increasingly between the economically well-off and those left behind by structural change - have only now surfaced at the centre of government in Ottawa. The election is 'a fundamental transformation', says Mrs Sylvia Ostry, chairman of the Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto and one of the country's most respected economists. 'The Canadian model of muddling through depended on the fault-lines not being transparent.' The delicate task of easing the strains, or at least channelling them in a constructive direction, now falls to Mr Jean Chretien, whose Liberal party won a landslide victory on Monday. There is an ironic justice in Mr Chretien's return to power. The tensions exposed by the election began opening up in the 1970s and early 1980s when the Liberals were last in office under Mr Pierre Trudeau and Quebec underwent its so-called Quiet Revolution. Beginning in the 1960s, a new generation of assertive Quebeckers, led by the now-legendary Rene Levesque, was determined to be 'maitres chez nous' (masters in our own house), with their own economic base and greater autonomy from the federal government in Ottawa. Their efforts were, however, strongly resisted, not least by Mr Chretien. Meanwhile, the Trudeau government gouged a new geographical schism between Quebec and Ontario, whose economies centre on the car, steel and other industries, and the energy, wheat and forestry-producing provinces of the west. The creation of Petro-Canada, the government-owned oil company, in 1975, price controls on oil and gas, and curbs on new foreign investment all caused deep resentment in the west. While those specific complaints have subsided, resentment still smoulders in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia against politicians and civil servants in faraway Ottawa. The suspicion is that they still favour the resource-consuming industries of Quebec and Ontario rather than the producers in the west. The sour public mood has been greatly exacerbated by a profound restructuring of the Canadian economy, which the Progressive Conservative government began in the late 1980s, and which is far from complete. The adjustment has been forced mainly by the twin shocks of the unexpectedly deep 1990-92 recession and by the 1989 free trade agreement with the US. Under the latter, multinationals are increasingly integrating their Canadian operations with those in the US and Mexico, forcing Canadian managers and workers to compete for factories and jobs. While free trade has created valuable openings for Canadian exporters, such as a new generation of high-technology companies, it has also exposed molly-coddled industries - among them furniture, textiles and food-processing - to tough competition from the south. Mr William Macdonald, a Toronto lawyer and economic consultant, says that 'while analysis suggests substantial progress on many fronts, for most (Canadian companies and individuals) it does not feel much better, and for many it feels worse'. Many Canadians fear that their quality of life will deteriorate even further as more jobs are lost under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which includes Mexico and is due to take effect next January. Cultural, geographic and economic divisions spawned the two regional parties which, between them, captured more than a third of all seats on Monday. The Bloc Quebecois, under former Conservative cabinet minister Mr Lucien Bouchard, aims to further Quebec nationalists' drive for greater autonomy, and ultimately independence. The BQ hopes that its presence on the national stage as the official opposition will boost the chances of Mr Levesque's old provincial party, the Parti Quebecois, in next year's provincial elections. If it wins, the PQ has promised an independence referendum within 12 months. On the other side of the country, disaffected westerners have flocked to the fledgling Reform party. 'They're mad as hell, and they want to do something about it,' was how Mr Angus Reid, a leading pollster, explained Reform's rise to a US television audience recently. Reform's platform includes tougher immigration rules, a law-and-order crackdown, an end to official bilingualism, and no special favours, such as new constitutional powers, for Quebec. The election has created two broad-brush scenarios of Canada's evolution over the next few years. Under the pessimistic one, the BQ and Reform will play to each other's agendas, fanning separatism in Quebec and anti-French sentiment in the rest of the country. At the same time the prospects for the economy, while it gradually pulls out of recession, are not immediately bright. Unemployment, currently at 11.2 per cent, is not expected to drop significantly for at least a year. The jobless rate in Newfoundland, where the fishing industry has been devastated by the disappearance of cod stocks, is about 20 per cent. The Liberals' ability to dampen regional discontent through government financial hand-outs will be constrained by the sluggish economy and by the towering federal budget deficit, which topped CDollars 35bn last year, equal to 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Weak tax revenues could push the shortfall even higher in the current fiscal year which ends next March. With foreigners now buying more than 40 per cent of all federal government bonds and two-thirds of debt issued by the provinces, economic policymakers' room for manoeuvre is constrained by the opinions of foreign investors and credit-rating agencies. The Liberals have pledged to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP. But economists agree that the new government will be able to reduce the budget deficit only by trimming spending on the generous social programmes which make up about 60 per cent of federal outlays. But there is a more hopeful scenario. Most observers agree that the Liberals are a different party now from the Trudeau years. 'The party has moved very significantly back to the centre from the economic wilderness,' says Mr Tom d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies. Mr Chretien's cabinet is likely to include several MPs with a strong business background. The Liberals pledged during the campaign to try to renegotiate Nafta by, for instance, adding a subsidies and anti-dumping code. But Mr Chretien is widely expected to implement the deal with a minimum of fuss if it is ratified by the US Congress next month. Mr D'Aquino notes that 'if you have a strong majority, you can pretty well do what you want'. On the political front, federalists are crossing fingers that Quebeckers will think twice about breaking away from Canada at the provincial elections or an ensuing referendum. If they do, the BQ could fade away or soften its separatist leanings. The Reform party's future is also not yet secure, despite its big election win. Most of its MPs are political neophytes. Reform's autocratic leader, Mr Preston Manning, may have trouble keeping his troops in line if he carries out his campaign promise to make them more accountable to their constituents. There are countless permutations between the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. It is certain that Mr Chretien will be seeking the first, through restoring growth and thus ensuring political stability. Canada may yet survive in one piece. But the election result has undoubtedly increased the risk that the disintegration of the country could precede any chance he has to usher in economic recovery.</p>

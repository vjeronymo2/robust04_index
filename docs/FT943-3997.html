			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Merloni earnings jump 51% Correction appended to this article. Pre-tax profits at Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian manufacturer of domestic appliances, increased by 51 per cent in the first half of 1994, helped by increased sales outside Italy. Merloni, quoted on the Milan stock exchange but majority-owned by the Merloni family, announced on Friday that profits rose to L21.6bn (Dollars 13.7m) in the first half of this year, compared with L14.3bn last time. The company, which trades under the Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands, recorded consolidated sales of L905bn, against L726bn, an increase of 24 per cent. With the consolidation of the company's production units in Turkey and Portugal, some 72 per cent of sales - or L657bn compared with L495bn a year earlier - are now made outside Italy, although exports were virtually the same as in the equivalent period. Excluding the Portuguese and Turkish factories, Merloni's total turnover rose by 16 per cent. On Friday, Merloni shares rose to L5,450, compared with an opening price of L5,405. Merloni is the only large Italian white goods producer still in Italian hands, but it faces stiff competition from larger rivals such as Zanussi, owned by Electrolux of Sweden, which also achieves about 70 per cent of its sales overseas. In July, Zanussi announced that its operating profits had increased by 51.3 per cent to L257bn in 1993, on sales of L3,022bn, of which L2,079bn came from abroad. CORRECTION In an article from 12 Sept entitled 'Merloni earnings jump 51%', it was stated that 'Merloni is the only large Italian white goods producer in Italian hands'. Candy Group have asked us to point out that Candy Domestic Appliances Spa is a privately owned Italian company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fel V. Maragay] </F>   [Text] President Ramos disclosed yesterday that Malaysian  Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed had expressed his desire for  the final settlement of the Sabah claim during his state visit  last week. He said that while the Sabah issue was not in the  agenda of Mahathir's visit, he (Ramos) brought up the subject  during their one-on-one meeting at Malacanang last Thursday.    Mr. Ramos said he informed the Malaysian premier that the  government put up a foundation to help the heirs and descendants  of the Sultan of Sulu in terms of investment and livelihood  opportunities instead of depending on the small rental paid  annually by the Malaysian government. He said Mahathir conveyed  his wish to assist the heirs of the Sulu sultan, "if my help is  needed please let me know," Ramos quoted the Malaysian head of  government as saying.    The late Sultan Ismail Kiram of Sulu ceded to the Philippine  government sovereignty rights over Sabah in 1963 in order to  recover the territory which become part of Malaysia. But the  proprietary rights remain with the Sulu sultanate. Based on the  decision of a Malaysian court in 1939, the heirs were entitled  to an annual rental payment of 5,000 Malaysian ringgits (about  P50,000.00 [Philippine pesos]).    Mr. Ramos debunked the claims of some of the heirs that the  government has been neglecting its commitment to help in  resolving their propriety or compensation claims. He said the  issue is being addressed by the executive-legislative council on  Sabah claim and the Sabah desk of the Department of Foreign  Affairs (DFA).    The president said the certain problems were created by the  destruction of valuable documents on the Sabah claim when the  old DFA building along Padre Faura street, Manila was burned a  few years ago. He said a group of scholars have been trying to  reconstruct these documents.    Mr. Ramos said part of the comprehensive solution of the  Sabah Issue is his proposal for the creation of an East ASEAN  growth area (EAGA) composed of Mindanao, East Malaysia, Eastern  Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam.</p>

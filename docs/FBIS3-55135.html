He  noted, however, that NATO's concept - partnership for peace -  should take into account the interests of all states, not only  the NATO members.    Grachev believes that this concept should apply not only to  NATO, but also to the all-European security system and said that  Russia was ready to develop cooperation with NATO on the basis  of the following principles: the development of general  political contacts, coordination of positions, and practical and  coordinated actions.    Commenting on the basic principles of Russia's military  doctrine at the senators' request, Grachev stated that this  document was political rather than military, and that the  renunciation of the principle not to use nuclear weapons first  puts it on a par with similar documents on other nuclear powers.    Russia views nuclear weapons as a deterrent, not as a means  of warfare, he said. He noted in this connection that the  commitment not to use nuclear weapons first was at variance with  this assumption.    He expressed the opinion that this commitment had not been  taken seriously by the west. It was viewed simply as a  propaganda statement undermining the former Soviet Union's  military policy, said Grachev. He remarked, however, that the  former Soviet Union had no plans to deal preemptive nuclear  blows on any country.</p>

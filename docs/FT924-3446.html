			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Saying no to Mr Sugar IT NOW looks highly likely that Mr Alan Sugar's attempt to take the Amstrad electronics company private will be defeated at Thursday's shareholder meeting. It is not a reflection on Mr Sugar to say that this is to be welcomed. Any public company founded on the talents of one person has its special features. But the market has tended in the past to exaggerate this: to conclude that if the founder has tired of the public arena, other shareholders can do nothing but shrug in resignation and indulge the whims of genius. When the entrepreneur goes public, a community of interest is established with other shareholders. The obligation this creates is reciprocal. It deserves to be durable as well. Indeed, it is precisely when the founder tires of the relationship with shareholders that shareholders may feel it most worth retaining. On the one hand, it seems wholly plausible that Amstrad has run its course: that the opportunities in electronics which allowed such extraordinary growth in the early 1980s no longer exist. On the other, Mr Sugar has given his fellow investors almost no clues on how he proposes to retrieve the situation. But it is perfectly logical for them to conclude that, whatever his plans, they are likely to be in the best interests of shareholders as a class. Chief loser Mr Sugar has calculated that the company is worth a given price - 30p a share - when loaded with debt for the purposes of the buy-out. It is hard to see how it can be worth much less as a debt-free public company. If his offer is rejected, he has said he might sell his shareholding at the offer price. But any buyer at that price would presumably see his own way to making a profit, thus once more benefiting other shareholders. Again, Mr Sugar has said that as a public company, Amstrad could not pay significant dividends. If he were obliged to remain public, the chief loser from such a policy would be himself. The risk in such cases is that the entrepreneur might deliberately seek to drive the share price down and then return with a lower offer later on. This is where the case for better corporate governance becomes unanswerable. Board representation Perhaps the single most objectionable aspect of the Amstrad affair has been the absence of even a single non-executive director to give shareholders disinterested advice. If shareholders decide to make Mr Sugar stay on and face the music, they should insist on board representation while they are at it. It might be objected that this would run counter to the whole notion of the entrepreneur as free spirit. But if the 1980s have taught investors anything, it is that when the going gets rough, the running of companies has less to do with unfettered genius than with the humdrum skills of professional management. If the stock market were denied the talents of entrepreneurs such as Mr Sugar, it would certainly be the poorer for it. But the lesson of this case and others like it is that such talents need not be obtained wholly on the entrepreneur's terms. Mr Sugar has earned the displeasure of investors in various ways: by unloading shares in advance of a downturn in his company's fortunes, by denying shareholders independent advice and by withholding any real details of his plans for the company as a private entity. It would be senseless to block his offer as a mere act of revenge, but it would serve a useful purpose if it stood as a warning against businessmen dipping in and out of public ownership when it suited them. With luck, it might also prove less expensive than shareholders are disposed to fear at present.</p>

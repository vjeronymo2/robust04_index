			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted Water stocks continued to recapture some of their former gloss, with the sector said to have been given a strong push by James Capel and other brokers after a period of relative stagnation. Dealers said the institutions were still keen on the defensive, high yielding areas of the market. The best individual performance in waters, albeit in light turnover, came from Southern which closed 10 higher at 573p, after 575p, closely followed by Thames, up 6 at 509p and Severn Trent, the same amount up at 545p. Norweb continued its share buy-back programme, acquiring a further 1.5m shares at 795p and boosting the stock price 4 to 790p. South Wales bought in 400,000 shares at 817p with the price easing 2 to 813p and Manweb edged up a penny to 833p after picking up 1m shares at 835p. Northern Ireland Electricity returned to favour, closing 8 higher at 370p. PowerGen celebrated moving into its closed period by sliding 15 to 539p. The oil majors suffered a double hit, reacting to the weakness of the dollar against sterling and to a feeling that the sector had been over-hyped before and after the much-heralded exploration presentations by BP in London and New York and the double-digit dividend increased announced by Shell on Thursday. BP dipped 7 to 413 1/2 p, on turnover of 10m and Shell 12 to 710 1/2 p on 2.6m traded. Enterprise fell 11 to 395p. Calor put on another good showing, the shares edging up 2 more to 299p, still reflecting the good results announced earlier in the week. Betterware, the group which sells domestic products direct to householders, was one of the market's biggest casualties, the shares plummeting 23 to 50p, after 49p, in the wake of the latest profits warning. The group warned that profits for the first half would not exceed Pounds 4m, compared with Pounds 7.6m in the same period last year. Betterware shares peaked at 278p just over a year ago. News that summer 1995 holiday bookings are up 42 per cent on last year's figures, after a month's trading, gave a strong boost to Owners Abroad shares which jumped 7 to 119p. The news was delivered at a egm at which shareholders agreed a change of name, to First Choice Holiday. Aggressive price cutting on trans-Atlantic routes by Continental Airlines of the US cast a cloud over British Airways, pushing the shares down 6 1/2 to 382 1/2 p. Trading volume was a massive 7m shares. Most brokers stand by their profit forecasts for this year. But the US market is clearly a key route for BA and analysts will be watching US airline price reactions like a hawk. Tiphook provided the only other big transport feature, easing a further 2 to 35p on confirmation that a bankruptcy petition had been served against chief executive Mr Robert Montague. The stock market fears that Mr Montague's personal stake in the company - possibly around 3 per cent - could now be overhanging a share price that has tumbled this year from a peak of 79p. British Aerospace shed 12 to 473p in nervous trading ahead of next week's interim results. The decision by Raytheon to switch to the US production of the corporate jet business brought from BAe last year added to uncertainties. BAe has less than two years left of a three year agreement to supply parts to Ratheon. With production moving away from the UK there are serious stock market doubts that BAe will be able to renew the business in 1996. Siebe continued to gain ground, rising 7 against the general trend to 557p with the backing of a buy recommendation from Warburg Securities. Heavyweight pharmaceutical shares came in for markedly heavy selling with Wellcome tumbling 23 to 657p as the bid speculation that has hovered over the company since April showed signs of rapidly evaporating. Waning takeover hopes also hit Zeneca although analysts pointed to the company's strong operating fundamentals as helping to limit the downside shift to 19 1/2 to 810 1/2 0p. Its huge US market interest could only exacerbate the slide at Glaxo which tumbled 17 to 584p. There was heavy turnover in the stock options. Among smaller shares, British Biotech moved up strongly by 15 to 520p on the back of a buy recommendation from Lehman Bros. The major chemicals groups got caught up in the dismal trend. Having opened higher at 852p, ICI quickly lost ground to close 10 1/2 lower at 833 1/2 p. Among motor distributors, Kwik-Fit rose a further 6 to 160p as the market digested Thursday's good interim results and consequent securities house profit upgrades. Schroders left the rest of the merchant banking sector far behind, responding to talk of broker upgrades. The ordinary shares moved up 24 to 1574p. Other merchant banks, however, mostly suffered from the recent turbulence in bonds and equities, which could have triggered losses among the big trading houses. Midland Independent Newspapers were sold down to their March flotation price with the shares falling 14 to 140p on the back of a cautious interim statement. The recovery in advertising flows remains very patchy. Some analysts have been downgrading their profits projections for the full year, notably Smith New Court which has clawed back from Pounds 17m pre-tax to Pounds 15.6m. United Newspapers, down 10 to 505p, put out their interim results next week.</p>

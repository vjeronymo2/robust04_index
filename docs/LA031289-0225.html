			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE COUNTY  </P> <P> I am writing to clarify what I think about anti-Semitism and discrimination in  Orange County. In the Feb. 13 edition of The Times, I was quoted on these  issues in such a way that my observations and conclusions could be easily  misinterpreted. In the March 5 Letters to the Editor, there was just such a  misreading of my opinions by Stephen Lawton.  </P> <P> First, in response to Lawton, I never said that there was no anti-Semitism in  Orange County, and nothing could be further from the truth or my opinion. There  is a significant amount of anti-Semitism in our community. It has been here for  a long time, it is troubling, and it must be confronted wherever it rears its  head. Anti-Semitism is ugly, unfair and ubiquitous, as are other forms of  bigotry. It judges people not on their merits but on their religion.  </P> <P> The Orange County Human Relations Commission is dedicated to the elimination of  prejudice, intolerance and discrimination. We have a laudable record of  aggressive response to anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry.  </P> <P> One of the key ways we overcome bigotry is to bring together people from  different groups around their common interests. Nothing is more effective than  firsthand personal contact to shatter stereotypes, break down prejudice and  build understanding. The commission works diligently in the varied communities  of Orange County to help people understand those who are different and to have  respect for other groups' customs and beliefs.  </P> <P> In an effort to document and respond to hate violence, the commission is  working with all Orange County police departments to establish a protocol for  defining and handling hate incidents. The Harmony Festival in Westminster was a  positive pro-active program initiated by our commission to overcome hate  incidents perpetrated against blacks, Jews and others.  </P> <P> The black and Jewish communities of our county come together in a dialogue that  we sponsor with the American Jewish Committee to help counter some of the  strained relations that developed over the last few years. The commission also  sponsored a similar dialogue between Arabs and Jews.  </P> <P> In a sweeping prejudice-reduction program titled "A World of Difference," our  commission joins the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to utilize the  electronic media to teach about respect for differences between people.  </P> <P> Orange County has been known as an all-white bastion of bigotry. Over the last  10 years there have been dramatic changes in the ethnic makeup of the county.  Today it is a diverse urban community where there is still too much racism,  bigotry and anti-Semitism. BUT, there are important steps that have been taken  to combat this bigotry, and one of the significant efforts has been the  establishment and continued funding of the Orange County Human Relations  Commission by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. In establishing the  commission, the board set out to "eliminate prejudice, intolerance and  discrimination" in Orange County. Our commission is seen as one of the most  effective in the state of California.  </P> <P> It is part of our job in Orange County to put out the word that this is a  community where anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry are not welcome, and where  the top political leadership is willing to take action to eliminate them. This  is our charge. It is in trying to get out this message that I have been  misunderstood to be minimizing the level of anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry.  </P> <P> RUSTY KENNEDY, Executive Director  </P> <P> Orange County  </P> <P> Human Relations Commission  </P></p>

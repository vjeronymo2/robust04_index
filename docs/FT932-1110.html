			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / LDP assails honesty of party rebels TOP OFFICIALS of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday unleashed a vitriolic attack on the record of the leaders of a group of 44 defectors who on Wednesday set up a new party to challenge the LDP in a snap general election on July 18. Mr Yohei Kono, cabinet secretary, launched an unprecedented attack on Mr Tsutomu Hata and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, leaders of the new conservative party, called Shinseito, accusing them of having been up to their neck in corrupt politics in the past. Mr Kono made his attack as Mr Hata paid courtesy calls on opposition party leaders in which they agreed the main aim should be to defeat the LDP, which has been in power for 38 years. Social Democratic party leaders said the leaders of the two parties had agreed they had a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to defeat the LDP and to introduce political reforms. The head of Rengo, Japan's largest trade union federation, joined opposition party officials in calling for a national convention of opposition parties to be held next week to agree an electoral pact which could pave the way for a coalition government. However, the difficulties of organising a viable coalition were underlined by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the recently formed Japan New party, who said he did not want to join a coalition with Mr Hata's group because of its members' past links with corruption. Mr Hosokawa said he would co-operate with a 10-strong group of LDP defectors who set up the New Harbinger party earlier this week. Mr Kono's onslaught, which was endorsed by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, was designed to undermine the credentials of Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa as reformers. Echoing questions raised by most newspaper editorials after the launch of Shinseito, Mr Kono said the new party's two leaders had been closely linked to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former LDP power-broker who is about to be tried on charges of massive tax evasion. However, Mr Kono's attack - which amounts to accusing the defectors of being no better than the LDP - is an indication of the difficulties the ruling party's weakened leadership faces in responding to Mr Hata's challenge. A poll in the Yomiuri newspaper found the approval rating for the Miyazawa government had fallen by 15.9 percentage points to 10.4 per cent, the second lowest rating ever recorded. Emiko Terazono adds: Uncertainty over the future of the LDP has prompted the country's leading banks to reconsider loans to the party. The LDP asked the banks for Y20bn (Pounds 125m) in low-interest loans, but the banks are likely to scale down the amount to Y15bn following the split in the party. Until now, the LDP's ability to maintain stable rule over the country had served as a 'collateral' for bank loans. Meanwhile, Japanese business groups, which have traditionally backed the LDP, expressed the need for a more flexible approach.</p>

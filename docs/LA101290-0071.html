			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN LINKS HIGHER PAY FOR JANITORS TO CRA  FUNDS  </P> <P> A proposed Community Redevelopment Agency policy that could lead to improved  wages and health benefits for thousands of Los Angeles janitors, hotel maids  and low-paid workers received support Thursday from Mayor Tom Bradley and three  City Council members.  </P> <P> Under the plan, employers whose businesses are built with the help of CRA funds  would be required to pay workers substantially more than the near-minimum wage  rates that prevail in the service sector.  </P> <P> Bradley said the proposal would help address the growing disparity of wealth in  places such as downtown Los Angeles and Century City, where blacks, Latinos and  others often work for low pay.  </P> <P> City Council members Gloria Molina, Richard Alatorre and Robert Farrell also  spoke in favor of the proposal at a City Hall hearing. The CRA is scheduled to  vote on the plan in late November after a series of public workshops to review  the policy.  </P></p>

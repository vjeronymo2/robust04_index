			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour seems rosier from the other side of the globe - View from: Tokyo THE SECOND Battle of Britain it may look in London, but in Tokyo no one seems overly concerned about who wins it. Newspaper coverage of Britain's general election campaign has been scant, with Japanese-language editorial comment missing altogether. Even well-informed Japanese seem utterly relaxed about the possibility of a Labour victory. This is, at first glance, surprising. Japan had something of a love affair with Mrs Margaret Thatcher and on almost every front Britain is Japan's most important partner in Europe. Britain is a big recipient of Japanese direct investment, and under the Tories the two nations have seen eye-to-eye on a broad range of political and trade issues. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Japan has sought to promote a tri-polar view of the world  - with Japan, the US and Europe sharing leadership. 'This view is best understood by the British  - rather than by France or Germany,' says a Japanese foreign ministry official who was a student in Britain. If the relationship is so important to Japan, why is the prospect of a change in government not more worrying? The short answer is that Labour, from halfway round the globe, does not look so fearsome. Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager at electronics company Toshiba, says: 'As a company which has large investments in the UK, we feel that the basic attitude to Japanese investment will not change drastically, notwithstanding the election result.' This needs to be put into perspective. Japanese people in Britain under the Labour government of the late 1970s were appalled by what they saw - declining living standards, materials shortages, disruptive strikes. Mrs Thatcher remains something of a folk hero in Japan for having cured the British disease  - a reputation untarnished by the recession. Professor Hidekazu Kawai, a specialist on British politics at Gakushuin University, says: 'Most Japanese believe the British people are still enthusiastic supporters of Mrs Thatcher.' Yet even informed Japanese, who know that Mrs Thatcher has lost her political influence, believe much of her legacy  - the strengthening of market-based institutions, trimmed power of unions, the privatisations  - will survive intact, regardless of who wins the election. While the debates over taxation, economic policy, or social welfare are real enough, from a long distance they look like much huff and puff over small disagreements. It is a battle for the moderate middle ground and, to the Japanese at least, it is not  - as Mr Major tried to portray it  - a choice between socialism and the market. 'This is not a referendum on the Tories for their past 13 years in government,' says the foreign ministry official. It is rather a question of who best can run the government. This is not to say there are no doubts at all. The Japanese government has been genuinely impressed by Mr Major's confident performance in foreign affairs, particularly in regard to Europe. On the other hand, the foreign ministry official says: 'We do not know very much about Mr Kinnock.' Mr Taida Hidea, who managed the London operation of Marubeni, the trading company, from 1977 to 1983, and is now general manager of international corporate planning, says: 'I am just concerned, if Labour wins, that there not be a drastic change in economic policy.' This, he says, could potentially affect Japanese investment in Britain. Mr Nishimuro says Toshiba is confident it can retain good relations with the EETPU electricians' union at its factory in Plymouth regardless of any changes in government policy. His only concern is that the social welfare costs of operating in Britain do not rise steeply. However, he points out that this has nothing to do with Toshiba's Japanese ownership and he thinks it probably won't happen. If there is residual fear of a Labour government it is a fear of change, of the unknown, rather than objections to Labour or its policies. Labour has made successful efforts to win friends. The party has repeatedly assured Japanese diplomats that it would place a high priority on maintaining close relations with Japan and that there would be no change in policy. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, visited Tokyo in 1990 and made a broadly positive impression. Mr Taida, who met Mr Smith briefly at the time, says: 'I think we can believe him.' Underpinning all these views is a deep respect for, and even envy of, the British parliamentary system, where a change in governing party is seen as a healthy sign that democracy survives. In Japan  - where the Liberal Democratic Party has been in power since 1955 and opposition parties offer no credible alternative  - this seems inconceivable. Plainly, many Japanese people have accepted one of Labour's basic messages: that it is a credible candidate to govern Britain.</p>

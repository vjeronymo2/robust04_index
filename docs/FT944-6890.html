			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Mexican party turns on accuser Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party has launched a fierce counter-attack against Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, the former deputy attorney general who last week resigned after claiming senior party figures had blocked the investigation into the assassination of his brother, Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. The party formally accused him of defamation and calumny. Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the party president, brought a defamation suit against Mr Ruiz Massieu, saying the latter had offered no evidence for his allegations. Mr Pichardo, and Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the number two party official, accused Mr Ruiz Massieu of using his brother's assassination to settle personal scores and damage the PRI. Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the former secretary general of the PRI, was gunned down outside a Mexico City hotel on September 28. His brother Mario was until last week responsible for the investigation, and has accused some 10 people of being involved in the crime, including a former PRI deputy. However, the deputy is missing, and the investigation has stalled in recent weeks. Mr Ruiz Massieu says he has put evidence allegedly incriminating Mr Pichardo, Ms Moreno and Mr Humberto Benitez Trevino, attorney general, in a sealed box to be opened on December 1, and says Mr Zedillo will have to decide what to do with the evidence. Mr Zedillo has hardly commented on the fierce battle between Mr Ruiz Massieu and leaders of the PRI. But Mr Pichardo and Mr Trevino both come from a powerful political grouping that has been an important ally of Mr Zedillo. Mr Ruiz Massieu has given emotional interviews implicitly criticising outgoing President Carlos Salinas, referring to the PRI as the 'party of parrots', attacking Mr Zedillo for not returning his telephone calls, and saying he was considering joining the opposition.</p>

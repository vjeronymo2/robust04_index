			<p>BFN     [Text] The Fourth Session of the Yunnan Provincial  Discipline Inspection Commission opened in Kunming yesterday  morning. Liu Fuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, attended the session. On behalf of the standing  committee of the provincial discipline inspection committee,  Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing committee  member and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection  commission, delivered a report to the session. He said: Since  the third session of the provincial party committee, under the  leadership of the provincial party committee and government,  discipline inspection and procuratorial departments throughout  the province have paid intense attention to the honesty and  self-discipline in performing duties of cadres at the office  level and above and investigated and handled major and important  cases. In the last two years, provincial discipline inspection  organizations have investigated and handled 5,951 cases of  discipline violations, punishing 4,982 party members for  discipline violations, of whom 96 were party-member cadres at  the county and office levels; provincial administrative  inspection organizations have placed 967 cases on file for  investigation and prosecution and meted out disciplinary  sanctions to 897 persons, of whom 12 were cadres at the county  and office levels, and they have also specifically handled key  problems and rectified key departments. The provincial  authorities have scrapped 2,451 fee-collection items, lightening  the burden on enterprises and the people by a total of 380  million yuan a year. Thanks to unremitting efforts, the  province has achieved some results in anticorruption work;  outstanding corrupt practices have disappeared to some extent;  and party-member cadres have received a profound reeducation on  resisting corruption and degeneration and on honesty in  government, enhanced their sense of incorruptibility and  self-discipline, worked out regulations on incorruptibility and  self-discipline, and formed a restraining mechanism, thus laying  a foundation for the further improvement of party style and the  construction of clean government. Overall, the momentum of the  province's anticorruption struggle is good and it is now  progressing healthily. This has helped to promote and ensure  the province's reform and opening up to the outside world, and  also economic construction, thus laying a good foundation for  deepening the struggle against corruption.    Lang Dazhong said: This year, discipline inspection  departments should earnestly study and implement Comrade Jiang  Zemin's important speech and the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission;  effectively carry out the anticorruption struggle by proceeding  from the overall situation of reform, development, and  stability; devote efforts to consolidation, policy  implementation, and persistence; and deepen the struggle, step  by step, with the emphasis on practical results. It is still  necessary to continue to pay close attention to the three tasks.  Leading cadres should continue to take the lead in honestly  performing their official duties and exercising self-discipline.  Cadres at the county and office levels of party and government  leading organizations, judicial organs, administrative law-  enforcement departments, and economic management departments  should have finished conducting inner-party democratic  activities by the end of May. It is necessary to continue to  regard the investigation and handling of cases as the focal  point of the anticorruption struggle, concentrate forces on  investigating and handling major and important cases, check  unhealthy practices, and devote efforts toward policy  implementation.    In conclusion, Lang Dazhong said: The key to doing a good  job of this year's anticorruption work lies in improved  leadership. Principal leaders of party committees and  governments at all levels should assume overall responsibility  for the anticorruption work in the localities and departments  under their own jurisdiction, so that the work will be  continuously carried out in depth, level after level down, with  specific persons taking charge and making fresh contributions to  promoting the province's economic development, pushing ahead  with its reform and opening up to the outside world, and  safeguarding its political stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 7 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] It is expected that in order to provide breakthrough  in the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Councilor  Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] will visit the United States early next week and  hold unofficial negotiations with U.S. counterparts in charge of  trade, a government source disclosed on 6 May. The source said  that in unofficial negotiations, Okamatsu, in an attempt to seek  ways to resume and reach an agreement on the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks before the industrialized nations meeting  (Naples summit), will exchange opinions on macroeconomics  policies designed to solve the issue of Japan's trade surplus  and how to interpret and set up "objective criteria" for each  trade sector.    Councilor Okamatsu, together with MITI Minister Eijiro Hata,  is scheduled to attend a two-day East-West meeting of economic,  industrial, and trade ministers to be held in Warsaw on 6-7 May.  After the meeting, Councilor Okamatsu will fly straight to the  United States. Although the main purpose of his U.S. visit is  to deliver a lecture there, the government source said that,  after the lecture, he plans to meet with U.S. officials such as  Cutter, deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president (in  charge of economic policies), who is a member of the National  Economic Council (NEC) and is one of those who are in charge of  trade affairs.    The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have been deadlocked  following the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11  February in concluding the economic framework talks. Former  Foreign Minister (currently Prime Minister) Tsutomu Hata, in  talks with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in Morocco on 15  April, confirmed that the two nations will make efforts to  resume the economic framework talks. Moreover, in late April, a  top MITI leader said: "There have been differences between the  two nations in views on overall objective of the framework  talks. If we discuss this matter, we will be able to find ways  to resume the talks." In this way, the top official hinted that  unofficial vice ministerial talks will be held after the May  holidays.    A visit to the United States by MITI Councilor Okamatsu  signifies that unofficial negotiations will virtually start. It  is observed that with his negotiations as the start,  behind-the-scenes unofficial negotiations involving the USTR  will get under way, in hopes of resuming the economic framework  talks before the Naples summit is held.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Staff Commander Jiri Nekvasil by </F> "(bak)" in the "We Have Asked" column; place and date not given]    [Correspondent] What is the education of the General Staff  members like?    [Nekvasil] Currently, there are 34 graduates of former  Soviet universities, and, of these, 14 are graduates of the  General Staff Academy of the former USSR. Some of them are  graduates of two schools. At present, we are not sending our  experts to Russian schools. Nineteen people have graduated from  foreign military academies (in the United States, France, Great  Britain, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Poland). Twenty  are still studying there. The difference is that formerly  people who had some languages were sent to schools abroad, while  now we are organizing courses for people in whom we are  interested. They are people who have the ability to command and  the moral qualities to be useful in the Army.</p>

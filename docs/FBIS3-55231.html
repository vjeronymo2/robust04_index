While there, as reported by  Lidiya Peresypkina, a BELINFORM correspondent, the prime  minister managed to hold an interview with journalists. Of  course, the prime topic of discussion was the recent CIS summit  in Ashgabat which he attended.    At the Ashgabat meeting, said Mr. Kebich, I came to believe  -- maybe for the first time -- that a good fate awaits us. Here  is one example. We signed an agreement removing custom duties on  assembly components in all CIS countries. This means that the  price of finished products will be reduced by 30 percent all  across the CIS.    It became clear at the meeting that everyone understood that  cooperation is vital to all of us. After more than three hours  of bilateral talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, all  the prime ministers came to one conclusion -- agreements with  Russia must be signed as soon as possible.    Asked what good and bad things Belarus experienced over the  past year, Vyacheslav Kebich said our major success was that  bloodshed on Belarusian territory was avoided. He spoke against  further price increases and the deterioration of people's lives.  Incidentally, the Belarusian prime minister thinks that it was  the Ashgabat meeting that pushed CIS countries closer to a  genuine economic union. Mr. Kebich is convinced that the common  ruble zone will continue to exist. It is only together that  former Soviet republics can stop their downfall.    So, why don't we begin believing in our good fate?</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Water watchdog praises improved customer service THE LEVEL of customer service provided by water companies has improved for the second consecutive year, Ofwat, the industry regulator, said yesterday. It said in a report that the biggest improvements have been in dealing with the 13.5m billing queries and 125,000 written complaints received by the 22 water companies and 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales in the year to the end of last March. Ofwat noted that the companies' response times to customers improved in spite of a rise of 8.5 per cent in the number of billing enquiries and a 27 per cent increase in written complaints. Ofwat judged individual company performance against seven measures of service, although its comparisons between companies were based on four criteria: Pressure of water mains; Interruption to supply; Response to billing queries; Response to written complaints. It found that five companies  - Hartlepool Water, Portsmouth Water; Sutton District Water, York Waterworks and Southern Water Services  - performed particularly well against all four measures. But North West's 'overall performance compares unfavourably with the average', according to the report. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said the report 'shows that some companies can achieve a high level of service across the board which sets the standard that others must achieve'. The report reveals wide variations in performance levels. A total of 15 companies, for example, reported none or very few properties affected by unplanned supply disruptions lasting longer than 12 hours. But two companies  - North West and Yorkshire  - accounted for more than half of the 58,000 properties subject to such interruptions of supply. Other areas in which Ofwat recorded improvements included a fall in the number of people affected by water restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, from 6.7m to 4.7m. Ofwat attributed the decrease to greater water availability, linked in large part to increased rainfall. The companies also reported a degree of success in cutting the number of households classified as being at risk from flooding from inadequate sewers. A total of 20,000 properties are still considered to be at risk, compared with 22,000 listed in a previous report.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / IMF in Moscow for talks on Dollars 24bn aid deal AN International Monetary Fund team will today hold talks in Moscow to try to salvage an aid agreement with the Russian government against a backdrop of faltering economic reforms. The Fund is facing one of the most difficult dilemmas of its post-war history. Thrust by western governments into assessing the fitness of Russian reform to receive a package of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) worth of aid, it is balancing political pressure to 'help the Russians' against its own judgments that the economic reforms are in peril. 'There will be a financial Chernobyl in this country,' said Professor Steve Hanke, head of economics at the US John Hopkins University and a member of a free market economic institute in Moscow. 'And the IMF is trying to save its credibility from the meltdown.' He is not alone in his assessment. 'Every time they (the IMF) negotiate with the Russians the budget deficit seems to go up by another Rbs100bn,' said one economist, in Moscow last week for a session of the World Economic Conference. A senior World Bank official sees a larger problem: 'The real danger is not that the money will be 'wasted': it is not much money compared to their needs. The danger is that it will not attract other, private investment, as it is supposed to do. It will remain as a political gesture which the private investors are not willing to follow. The rigour of the first three months of reform has now largely gone. The story now on subsidies and credit is worse all the time. The IMF looks at this and can't really do much.' Budget figures estimate that subsidies, held down to Rbs55bn (Pounds 347m) in the first quarter of the year, will grow to Rbs500bn during the year - but foreign economists believe that might swell to Rbs800bn or more. At the same time credits, held down to Rbs37bn in the first quarter, are expected to rise to a yearly total of Rbs470bn, which does not include a recently announced sum of Rbs500bn for inter-enterprise debt and payments to non-Russian plants for deliveries. The IMF has already moved from what was seen by its many critics in Russia and abroad as a rigid position to a more accommodating one: it will soon provide a Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' payment. According to Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of overseas economic affairs, the money will go towards supporting the rouble when a unified exchange rate comes into force on July 1. It seems certain the IMF will ultimately agree a programme with the Russian government, unlocking the Dollars 24bn foreign aid. But insiders think it will do so reluctantly, and with concern that its approval will be held against it if the reforms collapse. Diplomats in Moscow feel the IMF has been made into an advance guard for the Group of Seven industrial countries - but left to bear all the fire without support from the rear.

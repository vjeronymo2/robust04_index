			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Pressure for Japan growth package JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party will put pressure on the finance ministry to bring forward plans for a pump-priming package so that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, can outline the plan when he visits Washington in the spring. It is likely that Mr Miyazawa will want to indicate the timing and scale of a stimulus package during talks with President Bill Clinton, possibly next month, in order to counter US calls for Japan to take its surging trade surplus in hand. The finance ministry insists that plans for another such package must wait until the 1993 budget is passed and after the effects of last year's Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) special package begin to spread through the economy. Talks in Washington at the weekend left the Japanese government in no doubt that the Clinton administration will take an assertive approach to trade issues, which could signal the start of a renewed round of trade friction. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, urged Japan to open its rice market to underline its commitment to free trade. Mr Masami Tanabu, the Japanese agriculture minister, dismissed the demand, stating that Japan would stick to its policy of banning imports. Late last year Mr Miyazawa hinted the rice import ban might be lifted to help conclude the Uruguay round of Gatt world trade liberalisation talks. However, the LDP is wary of antagonising rice farmers, who are among its strongest supporters, in the run-up to an election expected in the late autumn. Some Japanese officials believe that the US administration may press Japan to open the rice market before a Gatt deal as a symbol of Japan's commitment to reduce its trade surplus.</p>

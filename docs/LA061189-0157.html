			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMBEZZLEMENT OF HUD FUNDS REPORTED PROBED  </P> <P> Contractors working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development  embezzled millions of dollars the government should have received from homes  sold after foreclosure, a newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported in today's editions that private escrow agents took  the money with little fear of recrimination from the Ronald Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams has been ordered by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp  to conduct investigations in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and  Washington, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> "There are several investigations and/or prosecutions around the country in  which the loss to HUD or the funds allegedly appropriated to HUD exceed $1  million each," said Gary P. Jordan, an assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore who  is handling a Maryland case.  </P> <P> The investigation, the newspaper reported, is separate from a congressional  inquiry into allegations that influence-peddling at the department allowed more  than a dozen former Reagan Administration officials to benefit from housing  programs meant for the poor.  </P></p>

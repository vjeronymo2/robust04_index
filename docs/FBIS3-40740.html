			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nabila Amir: "Algiers the Gray: Who's To </F> Blame?"]    [Text] People all over the world pride themselves on the  beauty and cleanliness of their country, especially their  capital city, site of the most important exchanges and meetings.  But what about Algiers, once known as "Algiers the White"?    This historic city, a city with a rich legacy, a city of  beautiful byways lined with enchanting buildings. What has  become of all those historical treasures? From end to end, in  every nook and corner, from top to bottom, Algiers is  unrecognizable; it is no longer the same, the air is no longer  pure, it smells foul.    At a time when emphasis is being placed, all over the world,  on hygienic problems because of the multitude of epidemics  raging alike in other countries and in our own, particularly in  our capital city, an unconscious or deliberately indifferent  populace may not appreciate the risks to which it is  exposed--how otherwise can we explain the deplorable state into  which the city has fallen?    Streets are strewn with detritus of every sort, with  half-open trash bags where well-fed rats multiply at an alarming  rate.    Rarely is a passerby late in the day courageous enough to  venture on sidewalks alive with this undesirable and very  menacing "population."    Just going from place to place in the capital has become a  painful ordeal. We have become accustomed to seeing rats the  size of rabbits and cats as big as dogs.    Have our citizens so far lost their civic spirit that they  use their own doorsteps as refuse dumps instead of cleaning up  after themselves?    The worst part is, everyone blames someone else. The  citizens  themselves, of course, must bear part of the responsibility for  deteriorating conditions.    But some of the blame falls too on the authorities concerned  and on the trash collection services, which let refuse  accumulate all up and down the streets and sidewalks where they  constitute "healthy" sites for vermin to breed and multiply.    "What a difference there is," one old man tells us, "between  the population of yesteryear, when Algiers was truly `the White'  and deserved that name because of the efforts and good  citizenship of the people, and today's inhabitants, who have  turned the capital city into Algiers `the Gray,' a place where  the air is almost unbreathable!"    It is well-known that unhygienic conditions are the source  of  many diseases.    So why aren't people concerned enough to try to avoid its  propagation? The reappearance of diphtheria in Algeria is  entirely the result of this negligence.    People do not need expensive equipment to make a  difference--just the will to take a mop and a pail of water to  clean up their own doorstep and determination not to dump waste  in the middle of the street.    In the domain of health, the inadequacy of our country's  sanitation infrastructure is well-known. So is the shortage of  medications, and the high price that must be paid for them.    But why do we have to spend our precious few resources on  things that could have been avoided?!    Health is critically dependent on hygiene. Other factors  also  enter in, aggravating conditions in certain slum areas including  well-known quarters such as Bab-el-Oued, Place des Martyrs, and  Place First of May.    Even if the street sweepers came by several times a day, our  streets would not be clean, for the peanut and cigarette vendors  continue shamelessly to scatter papers and butts in the street  instead of automatically throwing them in trash bags.    As one woman told us, "cleanliness and responsibility come  with education. How can you expect a child not to throw waste in  the street when his mother tosses refuse out the window all day  long?    "The problem goes very deep. You have to attack the problem  at its roots."    There is another problem befouling Algiers: the reeking  sewage outlets. There is also the invasion of tramps and beggars  into our capital. Under the arcades, in certain parts of  Algiers, these homeless have ensconced themselves atop  ventilation ducts in search of warmth. Passersby must not only  avoid all the laundry dripping from the balconies but also take  wide steps to avoid all the urine.    These sights are all in plain view in our capital. It is a  sad spectacle that continues unabated year after year, right  under the noses of certain culpable authorities, exacerbated by  the inexcusable behavior of many citizens. Are these people out  of touch?</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Polly Peck mystery SOMETHING strange is happening to the shares of Polly Peck International, the conglomerate built by Asil Nadir which collapsed last autumn. Someone, somewhere, seems to believe the shares are worth something after all. That, at least, is the message from a recent spate of buying. The thousands of Polly Peck small shareholders who thought they had no better use for their certificates than papering the walls should perhaps think again. The source of the buying is not easy to trace. The shares are suspended in London, but institutional and private holders have been approached directly with offers (often in cash) to part with their shares. A month ago, these private offers were being made at around 10p a share - compared with a suspension price of 108p last September. Now, they have risen to around 12p. There are two theories about this buying: one, that it represents a concerted effort by a person or persons unknown to build a substantial stake. The second theory is that the buying is by a number of wealthy individuals prepared to take a gamble on Polly Peck bouncing back from its current plight. Before parting with any shares, investors should note three things. First, if someone tries to buy your shares on behalf of another person, and is not authorised to conduct investment business, they are committing an offence under the Financial Services Act. Anyone dealing with them will not be protected by the investors' compensation scheme. Second, there is a very imperfect market in the shares. On the Zurich stock exchange they are changing hands at nearly twice the 12p being offered privately in the UK. Third, and most important, there has been rumour and speculation concerning the planned restructuring of Polly Peck by its administrators. Next week broad restructuring proposals are published and on May 24 there is a creditors' meeting. Administrators have never made any secret of the fact that they hope to refloat the group but, even if this can be achieved, existing shareholders are likely to see their interest heavily diluted. Anyone buying at this stage is either prepared to take a hefty gamble - or knows something the rest of the world does not.</p>

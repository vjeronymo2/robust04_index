			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- A civil organization was  formed Tuesday to support North Koreans who have fled to China  or who are working as loggers in Siberia.    The "Headquarters of Movement for Helping Brethren Fleeing  North Korea" was officially inaugurated in a founding rally  attended by nearly 300 persons including lawyer O Chae-to, Chong  Nam-yol, president of the Association of Protestant Orders, and  Song Won-yong, a former lawmaker, at Kodang (Cho Man-sik)  Memorial Hall in central Seoul.    The group said, "North Koreans who fled to China to avoid  human rights suppression and adversities and North Korean  loggers in Siberia do not receive any adequate protection from  the Chinese Government and the Russian Government, let alone the  South Korean Government.    "It's about time we, citizens, began a pan-national movement  to bring them and help them settle here."    The organization said it will begin with a fact-finding  survey of the North Koreans in flight in Russia and China, ask  the Russian and Chinese Governments to provide humanitarian  assistance to them and start gathering funds to held them settle  here.</p>

According to Alabama-Tennessee, the amount due results from a true-up performed by Alabama-Tennessee following the elimination of its Transportation Cost Rate Adjustment (TCRA). Alabama-Tennessee states that its filing reconciles the remaining costs associated with stranded upstream capacity still owed to Alabama-Tennessee, notwithstanding the elimination of its TCRA pursuant to the Commission's November 9, 1994 order in Docket No. RP93&hyph;198, and certain refunds recently made by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company to be flowed through by Alabama-Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alabama-Tennessee proposes that it be permitted to recover this true-up adjustment through a one-time direct bill to affected customers which it will show on regular invoices that it will tender for January, 1995 service when its former resale customers' demand historically increases. Alabama-Tennessee states that by utilizing this approach, any adverse effects that these customers might otherwise experience during the time these costs are being recovered will be mitigated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alabama-Tennessee has requested that the Commission grant such waivers as may be necessary to accept and approve the filing as submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

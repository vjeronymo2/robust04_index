			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: How the Raj curried favour - Books for Cooks THE RAJ AT TABLE: A CULINARY HISTORY OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA by David Burton Faber, Pounds 14.99, 240 pages FOODS FROM FRANCE by Quentin Crewe Ebury Press, Pounds 15.99, 160 pages PASSION FOR PASTA by Antonio Carluccio BBC Books, Pounds 15.99, 192 pages THIS IS the Raj seen through the kitchen door. But this entertaining, and at times very amusing, book is not just for cooks, in spite of its 60 exotic and saliva-producing recipes. Burton, a New Zealander, has taken pains to discover and share with us his discovery of the enchantments and chaos of colonial and Raj food and cooking habits. So, this is also an excellent and authentic contribution to the social history of the era. The Raj left several enduring legacies: parliamentary democracy, a legal system, health services, cricket, and the English language. But the reverse traffic was not very significant. It made no widespread or fundamental impact on British social and political institutions. Today, the Indians are, with total British collaboration, practising a benign form of curried kebab imperialism in reverse. Indian cuisine, sneered-at by pukka sahibs and memsahibs of the raj, proliferates in the UK as a welcome aspect of contemporary British life. Yet, it took the British a long time to learn there was more to Indian cuisine than kedgeree, curry powder and mulligatawny soup. (Mulligatawny is anglicised corruption of the Tamil words milagu and tanni, meaning pepper water). Indeed, this change has come about only in recent years. Social life, eating and cooking habits underwent several transformations during the 300 years the British ruled India. In the 17th and 18th centuries, expatriate men were content to live like the Indians and ate betel nut, smoked the hukka (hubble-bubble) and kept local mistresses. I learnt a thing or two from Burton. Up to the early 17th century, for instance, he tells us: 'In England, forks were still not considered proper eating utensils for a gentleman of the time, and the English maintained the medieval custom of scooping food to their mouths with bread sops which they held in their hand - an identical practice to the Indians, both Muslims and Hindus.' At the same time, Burton deflated my gastronomical ego by declaring that chillies, potatoes and tomatoes - much-used ingredients of Indian cuisine - did not originate from India. They came from South America through Portugal, he says. Another illusion gone. Social life in British India was governed by a leisurely pace. Burra Khanas  -the grand feast - was a common feature. It took time to organise and, once launched, went on until the early hours. Later the British lapsed into the dreadful habit of dressing for dinner, even in the summer months. Eccentricity was an accepted part of imperial life: indeed, Noel Coward's well-known doggerel about 'Mad (dogs and) Englishmen' is not all that far off the mark. Some of them did the oddest things. The Rajwallahs made a fetish over the order of precedence at gubernatorial banquets, and Burton relates a topping anecdote. One governor found himself sitting between the wives of recently-knighted husbands. Each thought herself superior to the other. Finally, the one sitting on the left could not restrain herself. 'I suppose, in a place of this size, it is difficult to know sometimes just how to place people at table,' she said. She met her match in the governor, who replied, coolly: 'Not at all. You see, the people who matter do not mind, and the people who do don't matter.'                            *      *      * THE IDEA for Foods from France is deceptively simple. Take 18 foods for which French regions are famous, such as oysters from Brittany, foie gras from Gers, truffles from Drome, chickens from Bresse and wild mushrooms from the Dordogne. Throw in two distinctive drinks, Sancerre and Armagnac, and track down the finest producers of each of them. But in the hands of Quentin Crewe and photographer John Brunton, this simple tour becomes a complex affair, revealing much that is distinctive with the world of French gastronomy. Take their visit to La Dombes, an area north-east of Lyon where 1,000 lakes supply the nation's finest frogs. The first fisherman to whom they were directed would not meet them in case their questions aroused the suspicions of the taxman. Then, they were told that local restaurants served only frogs imported from Albania or Greece. Finally, with the help of Philippe Jousse - the chef now in charge at Alain Chapel's renowned restaurant at Mionnay - they tracked down Rene Maisson, who catches frogs with rod and line for a living. The manner in which Crewe and Brunton stumble across their reclusive producers is one of the book's charms. En route, two further aspects of French haute cuisine become obvious. One is that, however rich the ingredients of French cuisine, the individuals producing them struggle perpetually to make a good living. Then, by a clever juxtaposition of recipes using these ingredients, the book shows how many top chefs depend on these individuals if they want to continue to produce food that is distinctive and representative of its terroir. There is a bitter finale, though. While the book celebrates the work of these producers, it also depicts them as one of Europe's vanishing breeds, trapped between EC legislation which affects how they produce and increased pollution which is reducing how much they can produce. They need a book like this to highlight their plight. Meanwhile, interested cooks will thoroughly enjoy the interviews, recipes and photography. FEW FOOD books manage to convey the same enthusiasm on the front cover as that of their contents, but Carluccio's Passion for Pasta is an exception. It shows the author tucking in to a Parmesan cheese stuffed with taglierini, tomatoes and basil. Good culinary advice is dispensed and unusual recipes - such as macaroni with sardines or agnolotti with ricotta and truffle - are explained concisely.</p>

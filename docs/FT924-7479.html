			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / People: Departures Less than five months after acquiring J&amp;J Fashions for Pounds 27m, Claremont Garment (Holdings) has parted company with J&amp;J's founder Jenifer Rosenberg, a former Veuve Clicquot/Institute of Directors Businesswoman of the Year. There is understood to have been a clash of cultures between the two Marks and Spencer suppliers as the manufacturing disciplines of Claremont met the more fashion-driven J&amp;J, which had far lower profit margins. As part of the acquisition agreement, Rosenberg was due to sign a two-year contract as an executive director of Claremont at Pounds 100,000 a year. After the acquisition this became a six-month contract. ***** Tae Hwan Suh has resigned from PACIFIC HORIZON INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Brian Goodland, director, safety and environmental affairs, has retired from TEXACO.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The report about China  sending additional 30,000 troops to Sino-Indian border is a  "sheer fabrication", Wu Jianmin, a spokesman for the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, said here today.    "Spreading such lies is obviously out of ulterior motives,"  he said.    He told a news briefing that the Governments of China and  India signed an agreement on the maintenance of peace and  tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control in the border  areas last year and have begun talks on the reduction of troops  along the Actual Control Line," he said.</p>

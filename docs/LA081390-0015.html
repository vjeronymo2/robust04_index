			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> SOMETHING EXTRA WITH RODGERS &amp; HAMMERSTEIN  </P> <P> Normally Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Night at Hollywood Bowl is a signal for  everyone to go on automatic pilot, as the Los Angeles Philharmonic listlessly  cranks out the big tunes for the Los Angeles Master Chorale. But this year's  edition reached for something extra -- no Master Chorale, a pops conductor  (Erich Kunzel) who knows and apparently enjoys his business, and two bona-fide  Broadway belters, Mandy Patinkin and Barbara Cook.  </P> <P> The result was a mostly idiomatic, sometimes eccentric Richard Rodgers concert,  with some side trips into Harold Arlen, Stephen Sondheim, Harry Warren and  other American melodists.  </P> <P> Much of the eccentricity was provided by Patinkin, who, in his Bowl debut,  hustled on stage in a black T-shirt, baggy black pants and sneakers, looking as  if he was going to clean out his garage. Somewhere along the line, this hugely  gifted singer/actor has developed a bad case of histrionics -- yelping,  shrieking, overacting, overemoting, going over the top even in "Over the  Rainbow."  </P> <P> Perhaps Patinkin thought he had to ham it up before such a large audience,  reportedly 16,243 strong on Friday (and 17,913 on Saturday). Yet only when he  brought himself under control ("Younger Than Springtime," "Bein' Green") did he  remind us of the Patinkin who was so emotionally affecting in "Sunday in the  Park With George" on Broadway.  </P> <P> For her part, Cook could teach Patinkin a few things about dramatic and dynamic  control, interpreting "Mister Snow" and "A Wonderful Guy" beautifully, giving  Sondheim's "Losing My Mind" the right amount of urbane longing. At the close,  she and Patinkin ventured "Getting to Know You" and "People Will Say We're in  Love" together, marred only by some silly Patinkin scatting in the former.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Kunzel and the solid-sounding Philharmonic prefaced each half of the  program with an agreeable mix of Rodgers tunes, as if to whet the appetite.

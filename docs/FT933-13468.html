			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Observer: Grave outlook The bad news for investors in the business sector just reviewed by London securities house BZW is that not only the short-run but the medium-term prospects look 'bleak'. The relevant figures show that 1993 'commenced at a disappointing rate', mourns BZW's report Where Now? And the trend is unlikely to improve until the next century, although it is set to peak around 2030. The good news for the rest of us in the meantime is that the figures in question are mortality statistics and the sector is the funeral directing business.</p>

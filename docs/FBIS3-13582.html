			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers, Arab opposition groups that operate from  one Arab capital against another usually operate from the  capital of an opposition country. This opposition is usually an  agent of the host country and not a democratic opposition. This  type of opposition is not effective. On the contrary, it may  benefit the party the opposition has targeted by exposing this  party's enemies. The most effective opposition is a free  opposition that neither belongs to another country nor works  under its instructions. Such opposition is motivated by  ideological or nationalist objectives.    Today, brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] faces  opposition of both types. While we hear a great deal about the  opposition of the 10 factions in Damascus, as well as that of  others, I have always sensed that opposition by the Palestinian  intellectuals abroad is by far more effective than any of the  opposition groups that cannot refute charges of agentry.  Perhaps Professor Edward Said is the best example of effective  opposition. The man, who greatly contributed to the PLO winning  respect in the seventies and eighties, now stands against  brother leader Abu-'Ammar and his aides and calls for changes in  the Palestinian command. Professor Said has found many  sympathetic ears in the East and the West, and in the Arab  countries because his opposition, which is based on ideas and  interpretations of policies, cannot be a subject of the  accusation that face the minor Palestinian factions, whose  presence is only felt because they have an office in an Arab  country.    Opposition is a right to be exercised by those who have  different viewpoints. However, this does not necessarily  justify the opposition of certain Palestinian intellectuals just  because they cannot be accused of agentry and subservience.  Although opposition is necessary to show that the Palestinian  political course is a democratic course, I believe that the cons  of this opposition by far exceed the pros.    One of its positive aspects of opposition is its shock  value.  It forces the Palestinian command to realize that there are  people watching and holding it to account, that if it commits a  mistake, it cannot hide this fact from the Palestinian people.  Thus, the command works more carefully and more accurately.  Another positive aspect is that the Palestinian opposition  facilitates brother leader Abu-'Ammar's dealing with the West,  including the United States. He can cite the pressure that is  being brought to bear on him and the opposition he faces during  the negotiations to decline offering gratuitous concessions and  to call for removing obstacles on the road to an agreement so  that he may offer the Palestinians what satisfies them.    On the other side, we find that the following factors work  against the opposition:    1. Brother Abu-'Ammar and his partners have maintained the  flame of the Palestinian revolution for more than a quarter  century. At the end, this has led to the Declaration of  Principles and to negotiations that could end with real autonomy  rule followed by an independent state.    2. If the agreement is bad and the negotiations are bad, the  Palestinians in the occupied territories will have their say  when the elections that are scheduled for this year are held.  Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, and his  colleagues have a right to resort to ballot boxes after their  protracted struggle.    3. The acceptance of the agreement and the negotiations have  come in the wake of pressure from the East and the West, and  from the Arab countries themselves. Had the PLO persevered in  its refusal, the Palestinian cause would have been lost for good  over the years in light of the realities Israel is creating and  the refusal of the international community to bring pressure to  bear on Israel to force it to change its stand.    4. This is the most important point. None of the opponents  have an alternative. In practice, there is no alternative to  the PLO command. Edward Said himself wrote in both AL-HAYAH,  [word indistinct] and THE NEW YORK TIMES that alternatives are  not dropping from trees and that capable people are just  appearing when there is a void.    While the opponents should fully enjoy their right to  oppose,  the fourth point suffices to defend Abu-'Ammar and his partners  and to reaffirm that it is impermissible to think for one moment  of toppling a command for which there is no substitute and then  wait for the emergence of an effective command. We could end up  with a command that will make us truly regret losing the one we  have.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA bids ADollars 716m for coal group CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday launched a hostile takeover bid for Coal &amp; Allied Industries (Cail), a coal producer in the Hunter Valley area of New South Wales, almost exactly two years after the failure of an earlier offer. The ADollars 11.50 a share bid values Cail at ADollars 716m (USDollars 487m). CRA owns 40.4 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 7.85 a share offer in March 1991, and the purchase of a further 2.9 per cent stake yesterday. The offer is conditional on approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb) because CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, the world's biggest mining group. Mr John Ralph, CRA chief executive, said the acquisition of Cail was an integral part of the group's strategy of increasing the size of its coal business. However, he said the offer would not be increased. Mr Tony Haraldson, Cail chief executive, urged shareholders not to respond to the offer until it had been considered by the board. He said the board would probably meet early next week. The long-awaited bid represents CRA's second attempt to leapfrog Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) as Australia's biggest coal producer by acquiring control of Cail. The offer, which is pitched at 14 times average brokers' forecasts for CAIL's earnings for the year ending June, represents a premium of 28 per cent over the ADollars 9.05 closing price of Cail shares on Thursday. However, Cail shares closed ADollars 2.05 higher at ADollars 11.50 yesterday.</p>

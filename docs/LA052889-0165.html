			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALENDAR'S SUMMER SPLASH;  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CHOICES;  </P> <P> STAGE  </P> <P> What am I looking forward to seeing this summer? All the shows that got past me  this spring, starting with Taper Too's "Standup Tragedy." It transfers to the  Taper mainstage on Thursday.  </P> <P> Also -- "Phantom of the Opera," despite the buildup (Ahmanson, Wednesday.) John  Steppling's "Teenage Wedding" -- a suspiciously cheerful title from our darkest  playwright (Cast Theatre, July 1.) The Padua Hills Playwrights Playwrights  Festival -- where Steppling and Jon Robin Baitz got started (CSU Northridge,  Aug. 6.) Also -- Shakespeare at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego, especially  John Hirsch's staging of "Measure for Measure" (June 29). Romulus Linney's  "Heathen Valley" -- a fable of Pharisees: it won last year's American Theatre  Critics Assn. award (Gem Theatre, Aug. 18). "Fiddler on the Roof" with Topol  (Pavilion, July 25.) Marlane Meyer's "The Geography of Luck" (LATC, Aug. 26).  </P> <P> And much more. Theater slows down elsewhere in the summer. In Southern  California it heats up.  </P></p>

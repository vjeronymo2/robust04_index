			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F> Guenter Schmidt at the EU summit in Corfu on 25 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Schmidt] You said yesterday that a dream was  beginning to come true. Considering the severe fighting for the  succession of Delors, is this still the same dream or is the  dream no longer that nice?    [Mock] This is why I said that one has to be realistic. The  dream is a more peaceful, stronger, and more solid --  economically and ecologically -- Europe. Not for tomorrow; it  is tomorrow that the work will start. Tomorrow is today. This  will take a whole generation, and the Austrians are now part of  it. Yes, it has been a dream. [passage as heard]    [Schmidt] Minister, this dream may be somewhat disturbed by  the events in the former Yugoslavia. In the foreign ministers'  councils and the European councils in the past few years, all  one could hear were declarations expressing regret for what  happened there and appeals for peace. Can you imagine anything,  or are there plans that are more promising?    [Mock] I am approaching this issue with a great deal of  realism. In Austria, we have told the people, especially also  in the run up to the referendum, that this security structure of  the Maastricht Treaty is necessary. After all, the European  Community so far has not had a security structure, no joint  foreign structure. This cannot be developed within 10 years. I  think that if this is developed step-by-step and if, together  with the Americans, the European Union proceeds with a somewhat  stronger sense of realism, then the European Union will achieve  credibility in this area, too.    [Schmidt] In the past few months, the Greeks introduced the  issue of enlarging the European Union in the south through  Cyprus and Malta. This issue was also discussed today. Do you  see any major problems in this connection? Would such a step  take away energy from the Eastern enlargement or can the  European Union cope with it?    [Mock] For these two very small countries, I see a chance in  1997-98. After yesterday and today, I am more convinced than  ever that it will take a long time before other new members will  be accepted.</p>

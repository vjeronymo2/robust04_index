			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour relations with Lib Dems 'abysmal' RELATIONS between Labour and the Liberal Democrats plunged to new depths yesterday with the parties' public row in Wednesday's Maastricht debate reducing any chance of an 'anti-Tory' alliance before the next general election. One senior Labour official described the relationship between the two parties as 'abysmal'. He added: 'These people have jumped straight into bed with the government. We can't work with them.' Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the Liberal Democrats had shown 'a high degree of naivety and a low degree of judgment'. The two parties are taking very different views on the role of opposition parties. Labour is determined to harry the government relentlessly. But Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the opposition's role was 'to behave as far as possible as it would in government and always put the national interest first'. He qualified that, however, by adding: 'Of course we would have liked to kick this government out, but this is not what was on offer.' Mr Ashdown said his party's decision to vote with the government had been essential for the UK's economic future. 'Nobody can ever say that a small force of Liberal Democrats cannot make any impact on the important things that happen in this nation,' he said. He expected a 'short-term downside' to Liberal Democrat electoral fortunes after the vote, but said the credibility of Mr John Smith, Labour leader, had suffered long-term damage. Mr Ashdown did not rule out co-operation with Labour, and Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, who still favours some kind of deal between the parties, said that the events of Wednesday had increased the need to 'open up lines of communication'. One similarity between the parties is that both are deliberately being reticent about the tactics that they will adopt when the Maastricht bill resumes its progress through the Commons. They fear that outlining these will help government's business managers. However, it seems the strategies of the two parties will only occasionally coincide. Labour's leadership is opposed to a 'guillotine' debate on the bill, and to a referendum. Liberal Democrats would probably favour both. Liberal Democrats also put more emphasis on increasing the democratic accountability of European Community institutions, including the introduction of proportional representation for the European parliament. One significant overlap is that both parties back re-instating the social chapter. Mr Cunningham said that without it, Labour would not vote in favour of the legislation on its third reading. But the inclusion of the social chapter is not an issue that would bring a single Tory Euro-sceptic into the opposition division lobbies. Moreover, Labour faces internal schisms on Europe. Many of its MPs are fiercely opposed to Maastricht, but others had to be persuaded to vote against the government. Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy Labour leader and a pro-European MP, warned on BBC radio yesterday: 'We must not be party to any stratagem employed by the Euro-sceptics designed to destroy the bill.' With one exception - Mr Nick Harvey, MP for Devon North - the 20 Liberal Democrats are likely to remain more or less united.</p>

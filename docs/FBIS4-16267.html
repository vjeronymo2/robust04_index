			<p>BFN     [Text] The GOLOS ARMENII newspaper publishes a message the  group of Armenian and Karabakh parliamentaries sent to the  Serbian President Mr. Sl. Milosevic. The letter says that just  at the beginning of the military actions in Yugoslavia Armenians  became indignant following the tragedy Serbians and  Chernogorians [as received] were and are being involved.  Armenians as all the people of Yugoslavia have been fighting  for independence for years.    It's very difficult to fight for independence while Russia  is  under the influence of "Atlantism" and practically takes the  position of an observer with respect to the fate of her  traditional aliens. Just this fact let the Anglo-Saxons and  their Western and Eastern aliens using the slogan of  peace-keeping dictate their "world order" to those nations who  are in an artificial borders' deadlock.    Armenian and Karabakh parliamentaries express their  confidence in the fact that the creation of new political  realities let the orthodoxy and the Islamic fundamentalism  prevent wars and death in the region.</p>

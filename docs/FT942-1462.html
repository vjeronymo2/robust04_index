			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Congress tries to solve crime bill conflicts Congress members met again yesterday to try to resolve conflicts delaying final passage of all-embracing anti-crime legislation. Both Senate and House of Representatives have already passed crime bills covering everything from drug treatment programmes to gun-control measures. Hardly anyone in either chamber is anxious to face the electorate in November without being able to boast about what they have done on an issue now topping most voters' concerns. But House and Senate seem deadlocked over whether the bill should include legislation allowing defendants to cite statistics showing the death penalty has been unevenly applied to different races as part of their defence. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in McCleskey vs Kemp that such statistics were not enough to sustain a constitutional challenge to the death penalty. Opponents of the death penalty have been trying ever since to restore this weapon by legislative means; the measure is included in the version of the crime bill passed by the House. Many senators oppose the provision, which is not included in the Senate version. To complicate matters, the House later voted in favour of a non-binding resolution urging its representatives, in meetings with the Senate, to oppose the measure it had earlier approved. Cost of the bill continues to climb. The Senate version would originally have cost Dollars 22.3bn over five years, the House version Dollars 28bn over six years. Cuts have resulted in a total Dollars 30.2bn over six years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina described Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, one day before the  initiation of the Fourth Ibero-American Presidential Summit, as  very successful.    Upon his arrival in this city, which has close similarities  to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' visit had  shown the Cubans' and Mexicans'-- especially their governments'  -- capacity and will to increase bilateral ties.    He considered it especially significant that the Aztec  country had respected the path taken by the island to initiate  its economic changes and had not allowed Cuba to be left alone  in these moments.    His stay in Havana, Robaina added, was very intense and  provided the Cuban delegation to the fourth summit a head start  in the collateral bilateral relations program and the  celebration itself.    The Cuban foreign minister believes the activity of the  Mexican leader in Havana furthered practical steps to be taken  in a new situation for both countries. During his stay,  important agreements were signed and still others are in a  process of negotiations.    In this sense, he considered the signing of the agreements  as  very important, especially the agreement on the telephone  system. Agreements in other sectors, such as in the cement,  textile, tile, and sanitary furniture manufacturing industries,  had also been advanced. Finally, he recalled that both leaders  had valued their encounter as being courageous, deep, fruitful,  and extremely friendly.    Robaina is a member of the official Cuban delegation to the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit, headed by President Fidel Castro.  The Cuban president was received here by an enthusiastic  solidarity group which awaited, since very early today, his  arrival close to the Hilton Hotel, where the presidents have  been staying.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hannover -- The strike in the west German metal  industry has been averted two days before its scheduled start.  After 14 hours of negotiations and consultations, on Saturday [5  March] morning, the IG Metall trade union and the Gesamtmetall  employers association agreed on terminating the conflict.    The compromise provides for keeping the existing holiday pay  and leave arrangements. At the same time a job securing model,  similar to that at Volkswagen, will be introduced. In addition,  the 3.6 million metalworkers will get a 2 percent higher pay for  seven months, as of 1 June.    IG Metall's head, Klaus Zwickel, called the compromise an  "agreement achieved virtually at the last minute." Without the  1.5 million workers out on warning strikes and the high turnout  of 92.2 percent in the ballot vote, this result could not have  been achieved. The agreement is to serve as a model that all  districts are recommended to adopt.    Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, said that  this compromise involves "no additional costs" for compaines in  the metal and electrical industries. Holiday pay and extra  payments will be calculated on the basis of May 1994. This will  ease costs in 1995 and 1996. In addition, there will be a  one-time 10-percent cut in extra payments this year.    The model, which will be valid for two years, shall enable  companies to cut the work week from the current 36 hours to down  to 30 hours if incoming order levels are low. In certain cases,  this will be linked with securing jobs, Zwickel said. [passage  omitted]</p>

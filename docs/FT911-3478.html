			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Wide margins lift Texaco 26% in first quarter THE WIDE refining margins prevalent throughout the oil industry lifted Texaco's earnings by 26 per cent in the first quarter. Thanks to a doubling in operating profits from refining and marketing, earnings of the US's third biggest integrated oil company rose to Dollars 415m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, from Dollars 328m, or Dollars 1.15, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.2bn from Dollars 9.2bn. But operating earnings from exploration and production fell to Dollars 282m from Dollars 317m. The company ascribed the drop to maintenance of UK facilities, lower heavy crude prices in the US, and the impact of the mild North American winter on natural gas volumes and prices. These negative factors were only partly offset by higher crude output in Indonesia and production from a new field in China. First-quarter capital spending jumped by a third to Dollars 791m, due largely to expanded exploration and production activity in the US and the North Sea. Phillips Petroleum suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings due largely to several non-recurring and non-operational items. Net earnings fell to Dollars 160m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 259m, or Dollars 1.06, a year earlier. Without these items, which include a Dollars 70m gain from asset sales this year and special gains last year of Dollars 148m, earnings would have risen to Dollars 149m from Dollars 107m. Revenues rose to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars 3.1bn.</p>

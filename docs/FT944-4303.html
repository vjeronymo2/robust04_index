			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Belgian defence minister quits The Belgian defence minister, Mr Leo Delcroix, resigned yesterday after he was implicated in a real estate scandal, the fourth senior government member to be forced out this year. Mr Delcroix said he stepped down to keep the government from becoming implicated in the scandal. Prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene announced that another Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat, Mr Karel Pinxten, would become the new defence minister. Mr Delcroix had denied earlier this year that he owned a villa in Provence, southern France, but he admitted on Wednesday that he did, adding that the house was valued at FFr15m (Pounds 1.78m) to FFr20m. But he denied that the villa was built with illegal funds and illegal labour, as some allegations had claimed. In January, deputy prime minister Guy Coeme, Mr Delcroix's predecessor at the defence ministry, the minister-president of the Walloon regional government, Mr Guy Spitaels, and his interior minister, Mr Guy Mathot, resigned after their parliamentary immunity was lifted to investigate corruption allegations. The three French-speaking Socialists denied any wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A group of four Chinese  naval vessels are approaching seas off Japan on their way to pay  a goodwill visit to the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok,  Defense Agency sources said Friday [13 May].    The sources said the ships, including a destroyer and a  frigate, are expected to pass through the Tsushima Straits into  the Sea of Japan early Saturday.    It is believed to be the first time in the postwar period  for  Chinese naval ships to enter the Sea of Japan.    Russia's ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported earlier this month  that three Chinese Navy ships, led by Chinese Northern Fleet  Commander Wang Jing and including the destroyer Zhuhai, escort  ship Huainan and rescue ship Anxindao, will arrive in  Vladivostok on May 17.    The sources said Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) P-3C  aircraft spotted a 3,250-ton Luda-class destroyer, a supply  ship, and a submarine support and rescue ship.    Also sighted by the MSDF, but not mentioned in the report,  was a 2,250-ton frigate equipped with antiaircraft missiles.    The ships are returning a visit paid to the Chinese port  city  of Qingdao last August by a group of three Russian Navy ships.</p>

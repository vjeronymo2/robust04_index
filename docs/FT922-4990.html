			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Bank accused of savings cartel DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank and one of Europe's most powerful financial institutions, has been accused of operating a domestic cartel with public sector savings institutions to keep interest rates low on the most popular form of savings accounts. The German federal cartel office makes the charge in a letter to Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chief executive, sent after he remarked at a shareholders' meeting that if the public sector savings banks raised their interest rates, the bank would follow suit 'within 24 hours'. The cartel authorities have asked Mr Kopper to explain, suggesting that his reluctance to raise rates first is evidence of a lack of competition at the less sophisticated end of the savings market. The inquiry relates to a special type of account with interest rates of 2.5-3 per cent - lower than inflation and half as much as can be obtained on more sophisticated products. Despite the low rates, these basic savings accounts are the most popular form of savings vehicle in Germany and deposits are thought to total DM500bn (Pounds 170bn). 'We are basically concerned that interest rates on these accounts are too low,' a cartel office spokesman said yesterday. 'If there really were competition you would expect Deutsche Bank just to put interest rates up.' Deutsche Bank said yesterday that the charges would be denied flatly. The bank is likely to argue that competition exists already - as individual regional branches are free to set different prices to compete according to local conditions. The bank will also argue that Mr Kopper's remark has been taken out of context. The savings banks have denied fixing market rates and have accused Mr Kopper of speaking in a way hostile to a market economy.</p>

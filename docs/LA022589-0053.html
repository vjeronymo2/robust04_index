			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RENT CONTROL WINS ROUND IN U.S. COURT  </P> <P> In a major victory for Santa Monica, a federal judge Friday granted the city's  motion for summary judgment and ruled against a 93-year-old landlady  challenging the city's strict rent control law.  </P> <P> Landlords had hoped to use the case to overturn Santa Monica's rent controls on  constitutional grounds. But U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew in a 14-page  ruling said the law could not be found unconstitutional because there was no  evidence that it deprived owners of the use and control of their properties.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the landlady, Lena Schnuck, complained that the rent law  prevented her from evicting a tenant and had sought a jury trial. Attorney  Robert Jagiello said he planned to appeal.  </P> <P> "Our audience is not a trial judge in Los Angeles," he said. "It's the Supreme  Court in Washington."  </P> <P> But Santa Monica Deputy City Atty. Barry Rosenbaum said the ruling "should send  a clear signal to any landlord organization that if they want to change rent  control laws, this (the courts) is not the avenue."  </P></p>

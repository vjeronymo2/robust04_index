The conference called on the  people of various nationalities and all circles across the  region to work with one heart and one mind, to pool the efforts  of all and to strive to realize our region's two expected goals  by the end of this century and to realize the grand objective of  "marching towards the front rank."    The conference was presided over by Wang Qun. Qian Fenyong  gave an important speech. Bai Enpei, Wang Zhao, Geriletu and  Wuyunwimuge attended the conference.    In his speech, Qian Fenyong first relayed the guidelines of  the national united front work conference. He said: The  national united front work conference was held at the time when  our country's reform, opening up and modernization have entered  a new historical stage. The conference used Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as a guidance, conscientiously studied and  clearly defined the new situation and new tasks facing the  current united front work. Qian Fenyong said: Inner Mongolia is  a border minority area and the first region of our country where  the regional national autonomy is implemented. The  characteristics of having minority nationalities to live in  compact communities and various religions have enabled our  regional united front work to occupy an important position and  to play an important role. To accelerate the pace of reform,  opening up and economic development, Inner Mongolia must  mobilize the strength of all sectors to participate in reform  and construction and safeguard national unity, the reunification  of the motherland and stability in the border areas. Along with  the establishment of the socialist market economic system, the  new pattern of establishing a structure of ownership with  socialist public ownership as the main body and the joint  development of multiple economic sectors is taking shape in our  region and the rank of workers of the non-public sector is being  expanded unceasingly. Under such circumstances, our region's  united front has become greater in scope with more objects and  heavy tasks. Party committees and governments at all levels, in  particular, the party's leading cadres at all levels, should  fully understand the important significance of our region's  united front work from the strategic perspective of promoting  the building of two civilizations, democracy and the legal  system, safeguarding stability in the border areas and realizing  a long period of order and stability, adopt practical and  effective measures, strive to form a new atmosphere in our  region's united front work and create a new situation.    Qian Fenyong said: To comprehensively promote our region's  united front work, we must particularly grasp well four current  tasks. First, we should conscientiously do nationalities work  well. To successfully carry out nationalities work, the most  crucial and core issue is to accelerate our region's economic  development. At present, we should conscientiously implement  the guidelines of the eighth enlarged plenary session of the  fifth regional party committee under the guidance of the spirit  of the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  central Committee, regard the establishment of the socialist  market economic system as the objective and carry out our work  in close connection with the main theme of reform, opening up  and development. We should continue to consolidate and develop  a socialist national relation of equality, mutual help, unity  and cooperation among the people of various nationalities and  strengthen the great unity among people of various  nationalities; second, we should strengthen management over  religious affairs in line with law. We should comprehensively  and correctly implement the party's policy on reform of  religious beliefs, consolidate and develop the patriotic united  front between the party and the religious circles and  concentrate the will and strength of all religious believers on  the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Meanwhile, we should ban and deal strict blows to illegal and  law-breaking activities in line with law and channel religious  activities to the path of policies and law; third, we should  further strengthen the democratic party work. It is necessary  to continuously uphold and improve the system of multi-party  cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of  the CPC and give full play to the role of democratic parties and  nonparty personages in joining the discussion of political  affairs and democratic supervision. Party committees, people's  congresses, governments, and the committees of Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference at all levels should  realistically issue specific policies in an effort to  institutionalize, standardize and regularize political  consultation and democratic supervision. Party committees at all  levels should strengthen the selection and training of nonparty  cadres and unceasingly improve their quality; fourth, we should  do a better job in united front work in various spheres and  boost the enthusiasm of all sectors. It is necessary to further  strengthen the work on intellectuals outside the party, unite  with and mobilize the nonparty intellectuals to actively offer  plans and measures and give full play to the role of the united  front as a "tank of personnel." We should strengthen overseas  united front work, give play to the role of overseas friendship  associations, make friends extensively, and attract more  compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and Overseas  Chinese compatriots to come to our region on tour and  observation and for making investments and engaging in economic  and trade activities.    Wang Qun gave a speech at the end of the conference. He  pointed out: The united front is an important magic weapon for  our country to win a victory in revolution and construction.  During the new historical period, the united front has a more  extensive and profound historical significance. Party and  government departments at all levels across the region, in  particular, the principal leaders, should fully understand the  important meaning of our region's united front work and  conscientiously study and deeply understand the spirit of the  national and regional united front work conferences. In  implementing the party's united front policy, the task of prime  importance is to grasp nationalities work. We should continue to  consolidate and develop socialist national relations; uphold and  improve the regional national autonomy system; and strive to  accelerate economic development and social progress in minority  areas. Wang Qun stressed: We should unite with all the forces  that can be united, mobilize and educate people of various  nationalities and various circles across the region to work with  one heart and one mind, pool the efforts of all to overcome  difficulties, and struggle to win a comprehensive victory of  reform, opening up, development, unity and progress in our  region.</p>

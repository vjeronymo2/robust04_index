			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: 'She Loves Me' tunes in again on Broadway - Karen Fricker admires Scott Ellis's new production at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre Ask a musical theatre buff what his favourite show is and the odds are he will murmur mistily She Loves Me. When it first opened on Broadway in 1963, that musical, with a book by Joe Masteroff and music and lyrics by the Fiddler on the Roof team of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, won critical acclaim and boosted the emerging careers of its producer/director, Harold Prince, and its star, Barbara Cook. She Loves Me has gone on to countless regional, stock and college productions - but why has it taken so long to return to Broadway, where it has just opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in a beguiling production directed by Scott Ellis, first seen at the smaller Roundabout Theatre in June. For the answer one only need look to She Loves Me's Broadway neighbours, the glitz-laden mega-musicals that are making it big of late. A little musical about the romantic entanglements of perfume shop clerks in 1930's Hungary seems wholly out of style. It has taken the enterprising Ellis to show Broadway what it has been missing, in a production filled with all the humanity, integrity, and charm those mega-musicals lack. Masteroff adapted She Loves Me from a play by Miklos Laszlo, which was also made into a film, The Shop around the Corner with James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. It is an unabashedly simple story, as delicate as the psyches of its sensitive heroes, the hardworking parfumerie manager Georg Nowack (Boyd Gaines) and the assiduous new shopgirl Amalia Balash (Judy Kuhn, who played the role at the Roundabout, has been replaced by by Diane Fratantoni), who clash on the job by day and send each other love letters by night, realising only as the story unfolds that each is the other's lonely hearts pen pal. None of Bock and Harnick's songs, save Amalia's second- act falling-in-love number 'Vanilla Ice Cream,' has become a standard; it is the way they are woven into what is happening on stage that makes the show musically remarkable. There are a few big musical numbers (staged with rousing cleverness by Rob Marshall), but, more often, song flows into scene or scene into song with an almost uncanny naturalness. One need only scan the list of song titles - 'Good Morning, Good Day,' 'Sounds While Selling,' 'Where's My Shoe?' - to know that this is a world in which even life's little banalities prompt a song. Ellis directs with a rare confidence and intelligence, with finely observed relationships between the shop's employees. His only gaffe - and it is a serious one - is that he neglects to paint the broader picture in which this lovely cameo is set. Times were tough in 1930s Budapest, and jobs hard to come by, but we are given little clue of the greyness that lurks outside the golden glow of Maraczek's Parfumerie. Without this context the musical's darker events - betrayals, selfishness, and even a suicide attempt - make little sense. Ellis' wisest step was his most basic: excellent casting. None of his company are stars, yet, but all are good actors as well as singers. Gaines is just the right blend of dorky and dashing as Georg, and Kuhn made a loveably gawky Amalia, although her final costume, a dowdy purple number, does overstate the point a bit; otherwise the costumes by David Charles and David Greenwood are well-done. Sally Mayes' chirpy-tough portrait of Ilona, Amalia's not-so-dumb-blond co-worker, is a delight. Howard McGillin is given less to work with as the one-sided rogue Kodaly, but finesses the job with mustache-twirling glee, and Lee Wilkof makes an odd character - the plodding salesman Sipos - oddly likable. Only Louis Zorich as shop owner Maraczek and Brad Kane as the messenger boy Arpad fall prey to caricature. The timing is just right for the re-introduction of She Loves Me to Broadway. Arriving just after the rabble of the Tony Awards - it is officially the first production of the 1993-94 season - it seems at once answer and antidote to its techno-driven neighbours, and its freshness is going down a treat.</p>

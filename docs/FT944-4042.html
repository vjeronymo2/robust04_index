			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Setback for Deutsche Telekom as chief quits two years early Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, said yesterday he was quitting two years early, dealing a severe blow to the company's hopes of making a smooth move to privatisation. Deutsche Telekom said Mr Ricke was leaving next month for 'personal reasons' and declined to give further details. Mr Wilhelm Pallman, a board member, will take over temporarily but the company said it had begun the search for a new chief executive. Mr Ricke's departure will leave Deutsche Telekom without its top executive at arguably the most important moment in its history, as it changes from a state-owned monopoly to a leading private telecoms operator. The company, due to become a joint stock company on January 1, will then be partially privatised through a DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) sale of shares early in 1996. Just two weeks ago the company unveiled an international consortium - including some of the world's leading investment banks - to manage the placement of shares, one of the largest issues ever undertaken. Officials suggested Mr Ricke was unhappy that Deutsche Telekom's new 10-man supervisory board, appointed this week by the government, included five political appointments. Mr Ricke, they said, had been pushing for Deutsche Telekom to be as free from political influence as possible in the run-up to privatisation. Mr Ricke said in a recent interview with the Financial Times that his contract had been renewed earlier this year and he would stay until the end of 1996 to complete the job he began five years ago. However, a series of setbacks recently is believed to have disheartened the 58-year-old chief executive. Last month the European Commission refused to approve MSG, a three-way venture between Deutsche Telekom, the media group Bertelsmann and KirchGruppe, one of Europe's biggest private television companies, because of fears it would dominate the pay television market. It is also still unclear if Brussels will approve the strategic alliance between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the French state-owned operator. There was no suggestion that Mr Ricke's sudden departure was connected with press reports this week alleging that several thousand Deutsche Telekom employees were working with criminal gangs to syphon off the charges from overseas phone calls. Deutsche Telekom has had little luck with recent senior appointments. Mr Dieter Gallist, the board member who dealt with private clients, died earlier this year, and Mr Horst Gellert, responsible for corporate clients, is leaving to take charge of Detecon, a subsidiary. Mr Ricke previously worked for Loewe Opta, a leading manufacturer of telecoms equipment, and had been appointed because he was the only representative of medium-sized business on a Telekom advisory council.</p>

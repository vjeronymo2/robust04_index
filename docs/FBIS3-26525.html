The main breakthroughs will be achieved by developing  non-State-run high-tech enterprises, establishing a technology  market and focusing on key research projects, according to Sun  Haiying, director of the Shaanxi Provincial Science and  Technology Committee.    "The total income of non-State high-tech enterprises this  year will hit 1.5 billion yuan ($170 million), 28 percent more  than last year, while the business volume in technological  transactions will be 500 million yuan ($57 million)," Sun said.    Six out of 10 key research products developed this year will  reach the production stage, he added. The rate of transferring  technology development to production should be even faster, he  noted.    This year, the province plans to build a technical  market--the Northwest Technological Trade Centre, the largest of  its kind in Northwest China. More than 1,000 technical market  brokers will be trained in technology, business and management.  Local governments will focus more on developing private  high-tech enterprises that have flexible operation and  management systems. Their development will be supported with  loans through such channels as new technical credit  cooperatives, Sun said.    "We hope the non-State high-tech enterprises will increase  to  more than 6,000 from the 4,000 in 1993," Sun said.    The province has identified 10 agricultural and  manufacturing  projects as vital to Shaanxi's economy.    These key projects will actively use foreign advanced  technology and funds.    The province also plans to further widen its international  co- operation and exchanges. This includes plans to attract  foreign research institutes and enterprises to establish  high-tech joint ventures in Shaanxi.    More local research organizations and manufacturers of  high-tech products will also be encouraged to compete in the  international market, Sun added.    Shaanxi's technological strength now ranks third in the  country, behind only Beijing and Shanghai. Some 50 universities  and colleges and more than 500 research institutes are located  in the province.</p>

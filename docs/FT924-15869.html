			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Beijing to retain US trade status CHINA is set to retain its low-tariff most favoured nation (MFN) status in trade with the US, following a vote in the Senate yesterday which sustained by a 59-40 vote a presidential veto of legislation attaching conditions to its status. This follows a 345-74 vote in the House on Wednesday in favour of placing conditions on China's status. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses for this to stand. The attempt to use trade as leverage with China to improve its human rights policies has picked up support in both houses since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests were crushed. But the White House argues the US has more influence over China if it keeps close trade ties.</p>

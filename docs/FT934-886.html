			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Yeltsin announces abolition of Russia's security ministry President Boris Yeltsin last night announced the abolition of Russia's Ministry of Security - formerly the KGB - in a move which brings the country's security and intelligence services under his direct control. A new federal counter-intelligence service has been created, with its director explicitly under Mr Yeltsin's command. The director retains ministerial status but is no longer in the cabinet. Mr Nikolai Golushko, the current security minister, has been named director of the service and given only two weeks to present a proposal for the reorganisation. The move comes after Mr Yeltsin criticised the ministry for failing to warn of the armed uprising staged by the former parliament in October. It follows the gains made by the Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the recent elections. Many of the party's leading members are former security officers, and it is routinely accused of being a creation of the KGB since its foundation in 1990. Security agents are temporarily retained on staff, but only until they take a test which almost certainly will require proof of their loyalty to the president. The abolition of the ministry was presented as the death of a service which was powerful and feared in Tsarist times, which became a vast empire of terror and suppression under the communists. A statement from the president's office said that in its various forms - as Cheka, NKVD and KGB - the security police had 'proved unreformable'. It said: 'Attempts to re-organise it in the past were superficial and unsuccessful. At the present time, the security ministry has no concept of Russia's state security needs. The counter intelligence system has been weakened, while the system of political police has been preserved and can easily be recreated. 'On the landscape of the democratic transformation going on in Russia, the system of providing security has outlived itself, is ineffective, is a heavy burden on the state budget and is a barrier to economic reform.' The reshuffle does not affect the foreign counter-intelligence service, which was separated from the KGB last year, and is now headed by Mr Yevgeny Primakov, a former aide to President Mikhail Gorbachev. Another former Gorbachev aide and liberal politburo member, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, was yesterday named as head of the main Ostankino state television channel, following the sacking of Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, seen in presidential circles as the man who handed the election to Mr Zhirinovsky. Mr Yakovlev has supported the Russia's Choice political group. Yeltsin hint of new economic course Page 4</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Why pension funds are glum at the bull market In the midst of roaring bull markets we are suddenly confronted with the curious spectacle of distressed pension funds, on both sides of the Atlantic. Rising securities prices can imply lower future returns, so they bring no comfort at all to those who are seeking to pay for future liabilities from investments made out of future cash flows, or from the roll-over, at maturity, of existing fixed income securities into future issues at lower interest rates. The better-known sob story is that of the big US corporations anxiously tracking the long Treasury bond yield. General Motors has said that each percentage point drop adds Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to its pension deficit, which is probably now more than Dollars 20bn. There is a rather less publicised debate going on in the UK amongst actuaries about the impact of the minimum solvency standard proposed by the Goode Committee. Some fear it may trigger a shift of strategy by British funds away from 90 per cent equities and towards a much heavier bond exposure. The discontinuance basis of valuation has returned to prominence; it forms a fragile link between rising equity prices and slumping bond yields. A similar problem is aggravating the US crisis, because of the attempts by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission to tighten valuation rules. Many US plans are undervaluing their liabilities by applying unrealistically high discount rates. If schemes are terminated, they need to contain enough assets to provide the promised benefits. The most conservative test of solvency on this basis is whether there is enough money to buy the required annuities from life assurance companies. In the UK, not only have the gilt yields which underpin annuity rates dropped by 2 percentage points so far this year but life companies are offering exceptionally poor rates because they are suffering from balance sheet strains. Hitherto, British pension schemes have tended to regard their American counterparts with slightly patronising sympathy because of the latter's need to cope with unhelpful rules. The US pensions accounting standard FAS 87 focuses on the market values of assets and has thus encouraged a high bond element in portfolios, aiming at low volatility. The equivalent UK standard SSAP24 permits smoothed actuarial valuations, so that a dive in the stock market can be made to disappear by fancy figuring. British funds have gone confidently for the high equity returns (19 per cent a year since 1979) and have prospered. But now they face two awkward problems. The stringent solvency test is around the corner, unless the actuarial profession can mount a rescue. Second, the latest surge in equity prices has been based largely on the stretching of the valuation basis rather than on improved fundamentals. So the actuarial smoothing, based upon dividend growth, has temporarily gone into reverse: thanks to Norman Lamont's raid on pension funds' dividend tax relief in March, the actuarial valuations this year will show a slight fall in UK equities. The Goode Committee suggested that one way in which the problem of a minimum solvency standard could be moderated would be through the issue of special gilts by the government. These would be deferred income index-linked bonds, and would partly get around the problem of unacceptably poor annuity rates. However, each terminated scheme would have a different liability profile. Actuaries are now telling the Bank of England that in an ideal world the government would issue a whole series of zero coupon index-linked gilts with a long spread of maturity dates. It would then be possible for each fund to put together a package of zeros, maturing in different years, which would closely match its expected pension liabilities. Each zero being attractive to many different funds, it would be a reasonably liquid investment. The irony is that the British and American governments see themselves as successful in driving down their cost of borrowing, but now they are faced with the troubles of pension schemes which have based their funding on the expectation that investment returns would be high. One thing leads to another . . .</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Motoring: Worth every yen - Stuart Marshall predicts UK success for Mazda's latest luxury model Europe's quality car-makers have not been best pleased to hear Americans asking why they should buy another BMW or Mercedes when they can get the same quality and reliability, and lots more equipment, for less money from Japan? They are talking about the posh brands, of course: the Lexus (Toyota), Accura (Honda), Infiniti (Nissan) and Xedos (Mazda). The Lexus, in particular, has profited at Germany's expense in the US and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Can Mazda do likewise in Britain with the latest Xedos? I think it might. It will not be due to lack of ambition or product quality if it fails; this is a car on which any manufacturer would be pleased to put its badge. Whereas the Xedos 6 (this column, November 29 1993) is pitched against the BMW 3-Series, the larger Xedos 9 is targeted mainly at owners or users of the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and, perhaps, the top end of the new C-Class. There is a very strong family resemblance between the Xedos 6 and 9. Inside and out, the styling emphasis is on curves. The body shell is galvanised and has an eight-year anti-corrosion warranty. Unlike its main rivals, which have rear-wheel drive, the 168 horsepower produced by the Xedos 9's 2.5-litre, 24-valve V6 goes to the front wheels via a silky, four-speed automatic transmission, with no manual gearbox option. But, even on wet roads, you would never know it was front-wheel driven. A traction control system - using the same electronics as the anti-lock brakes - eliminates wheel-spin and, with it, torque steer. (This is the disagreeable tugging sometimes felt through the steering of muscular front-drive cars). The Xedos 9 would take very good care of an aggressive, must-be-in-front driver because it holds the road and handles securely, whether accelerating, cornering or braking. Other users, while appreciating its excellent dynamics, would revel in the quiet, smooth way it progresses. It might sound like a back-handed compliment but I shall think of the Xedos 9 as Mazda's Lexus. Both are so tranquil that you must pay close attention to the speedometer on a motorway. The velour-trimmed seats are supportive (although not as hard as they tend to be in top-quality German cars). Tall people will discover that the Xedos 9's only real snag is a steering wheel adjustable for reach but not for tilt. If you stand over 6ft, the rim could obscure the tops of some of the instruments. Otherwise, a typical business motorist would find a Pounds 24,399 Xedos 9 difficult to fault. It is equipped lavishly. In addition to automatic transmission and traction control, the price includes air-conditioning, cruise control, driver and front passenger air bags, remote-control central locking with alarm and immobiliser, and a high-class stereo radio/tape player. Leather trim is the only optional extra. Mazda claims a top speed of 130mph (210kph) and 0-62mph (0-100kph) acceleration in 11 seconds. With a likely consumption on a journey of 26-27mpg (10.5-10.9 l/100km) and a 68-litre tank, its refuelling range is about 350 miles (560 km).</p>

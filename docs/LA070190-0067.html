			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** GEORGE STRAIT, "LIVIN' IT UP," MCA.: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> For those who don't mind a heavy dose of predictability in their music, "Livin'  It Up" provides a fairly pleasant outing -- but not much more. Strait shows no  sign of breaking with the past as he enters his second decade of making nice,  neat records that don't fuss with the extremes of human emotion. He may claim  to be livin' it up, but George never veers far from the Strait and narrow.  RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- The abolition of the  lustration (screening) law cannot be considered because there is  not enough political will for it, Premier Jozef Moravcik told  journalists today. However, its amendment, which is being  prepared, should be used to rectify the "wrongdoings" and put it  in harmony with the principles of the law-abiding state, he  added.    The lustration law, which was passed by the now-defunct  Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and taken over by the  two successor states, the Czech and Slovak Republics after  Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist Party  officials, StB (secret police) agents and collaborators and  People's Militia members from high economic and political posts  until 1996.    The lustration problem reappeared in Slovakia after Moravcik  had asked the Slovak Information Service (SIS) to issue  lustration certificates for the members of his cabinet. The SIS  was empowered to conduct lustrations under a resolution by  former Meciar's cabinet whose validity expired in January.    According to Moravcik, Meciar's government did not create  conditions for anybody to make the lustrations. "Worse still,  there were 'wild' lustrations," he stressed. No one asked for  them officially, but their result was taken into account in the  decision- making which contradicted the spirit of the law  codifying the protection of the personality, he added. "It is  not possible to deal with information from the archives  otherwise than as laid down by the law," Moravcik concluded.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Quadrant reorganisation will reduce staff by 220 QUADRANT Group, the photographic materials and video company, yesterday announced it is to close three photo-processing laboratories with the loss of 220 jobs. The laboratories, in Chalgrove, Braintree and Yate, are being closed as part of a reorganisation of Quadrant's photo-processing business. The division, which mainly provided photo-processing for estate agents, has been affected by recession and the slump in the property market. Quadrant has decided to continue to market the estate agency services, but transfer the processing to ColourCare International, a subsidiary of London International Group. Quadrant also reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.78m to Pounds 1.41m for the year to February 29. Turnover fell to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 54.5m). At the operating level the loss was reduced from Pounds 386,000 to Pounds 360,000. Net interest receivable fell by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.08m. The final dividend is again 2.35p for an unchanged total of 4p. The company said Lord Rees, the former cabinet minister, will become chairman 'when his existing commitments permit'. He will replace Mr Robert Brothers, who will also retire as chief executive officer in favour of Mr Andrew Douglas, chief operating officer.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> THAT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER FISH STORY  </P> <P> Regarding "Catch-22: Must a Thriving San Diego Fishing Community Die So More  Pacific Dolphins May Live?" (May 1): Why doesn't someone ask August Felando,  head of the American Tunaboat Assn., what he and his family did before the  advent of the dolphin-killing purse-seine netting (1967-'69)?  </P> <P> There is no reason the tuna fleet can't go back to long-line fishing -- unless,  of course, the purse-seine fishing has out-fished these areas closer to home  than Africa.  </P> <P> No, a "thriving San Diego fishing community" need not die -- just wake up to  today's world and its problems, some of which it created.  </P> <P> BEMI DeBUS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

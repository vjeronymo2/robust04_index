			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES IS HOME SWEET HOME;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CHANCE THAT EACH OF THE HUNDREDS OF NEW CATCHES  REPRESENTS A NEW INFESTATION. THE FIRST OUTBREAK, YEARS AGO, WAS NEVER  ERADICATED.  </P> <P> Well, friends and fellow citizens, the first battle in the Medfly war -- the  epic struggle that began 15 years ago -- is over. We've lost. We have lost  abysmally, ignominiously and unconditionally. The Huns are pouring into Rome.  The Russians are swarming over Berlin. Malathion has not worked. The sterile  flies have not worked. Humiliation. We have to face reality. We have to step  back and reassess. Any ecologist who is not employed by the state or federal  governments, who looks to biological truth for guidance, not to political  mandate, will tell you the same thing.  </P> <P> What, then, is going on -- what is really going on behind the biological scene?  James Carey, an entomologist at UC Davis, has taken on that question. As a  university scientist, his job and his reputation depend on finding the  biological truth. He therefore began with the most elementary step in data  analysis, looking for gross patterns in whatever evidence that existed; he just  added up the Medflies caught in Los Angeles County each year. What he found has  revolutionized the Medfly story.  </P> <P> It begins in 1975, with the first outbreak of 34 flies, and, according to the  state, it was eradicated. No more flies appear for five years. Then, four flies  show up in 1980 and 53 more in 1981. Again the Medflies are eradicated,  according to the state and federal governments. Of course, one fly happens to  be caught in 1982, one in 1984, one in 1986, but these are just the odd bug,  declares the government. Nothing to worry about. Easy to eradicate. . . . Until  1987. Forty-four turn up then. That population is also eradicated. Fifty-three  arrive in 1988. Yet another successful eradication. A resounding 241 enter the  traps in 1989, incredible in light of the fact that the flies have been  eradicated in eight of the previous 13 years. But by now it has become routine  to eradicate them. The government has become so good at eradication that there  is no need for alarm; they can do it any time. They are not about to "let" the  Medfly immigrate illegally.  </P> <P> In the minds of the government bureaucrats and their in-house scientists, each  year's outbreak is a new invasion. Without realizing it, they have fallen  victim to a fundamental function of the human mind: illusion. The mind creates  illusions of life; illusion is the explanation of the images that move across  the screen of the conscious mind. The problem is, illusions are crafted around  one's interests. You see the world in a way that supports your job. All your  research is right-headed, all your methods work.  </P> <P> There is also denial. The mind instinctively ignores facts that run against its  illusions.  </P> <P> So, tourists, immigrants and illegal aliens are said to be sneaking infested  fruit into Los Angeles and lobbing it, presumably, into the various  neighborhoods as they drive by. With drive-by lobbings out of control, what  more could go wrong? There is talk of fruit-fly terrorism. A $10,000 reward is  offered for information leading to the arrest of any miscreant. But for some  inexplicable reason, no one is able to claim this prize. And there it is, the  drive-by, fungus-spore, sterile-duped, malathion-suckered, state-controlled  Medfly.  </P> <P> A very different explanation occurs to Carey, the ecologist whose mandate is to  find biological reality. When, like the government agents, you are defending a  cause, you bend the truth to fit the illusion. When, like Carey, your mandate  is to find the truth, you bend the illusion to fit the facts.  </P> <P> What Carey sees is not an endless series of new introductions. It is an  absolutely classic, textbook example of a single, massive invasion. He applies  the discipline known as "invasion biology," a field in its own right, for  insects do strange and remarkable things when they acquire new territory.  </P> <P> A typical insect invasion has four phases: There is the introduction, when the  first colonists arrive; there is colonization, in which they reproduce; then  naturalization, in which the insect calibrates its body and adjusts its  behavior to its adopted land, and, finally, the spread phase, in which,  remodeled and finely tuned, it multiplies and marches, multiplies and marches  and settles down in those regions to which it is genetically suited. Carey  claims, and he is undoubtedly right, that the Medfly has entered that fourth  and final phase.  </P> <P> There are some crucial points to be emphasized here.  </P> <P> First of all, Phase 3 -- naturalization -- is a critical and difficult time for  an insect. It is not easy to get a toehold in a new land. It arrives suited for  life in the place it left, and like a human immigrant, it has a sort of  biological "accent." Also like the human immigrant, its offspring will become  native speakers and natural citizens. The only difference is that the insect  takes a number of generations, for its adjustments are genetic. It must adjust  to different pathogens, different strains of food with different levels of  minerals, and so on. And, if pesticides are used heavily against it, the insect  must acquire some kind of resistance, some way of coping with them, because  they are part of the new environment. Malathion bait is part of the Medfly's  new home, a big part.  </P> <P> To get some idea of how difficult it is for insects to adapt to a new land,  entomologists have been introducing beneficial insects deliberately for more  than 100 years, and only about 30% of the species have ever established  themselves. And these were given every advantage -- matched to similar  environments, released in huge numbers, put in sheltered places, provided with  food, shielded from pesticides.  </P> <P> The point is, Medflies are not like fungus spores or plant seeds. Infestations  do not sprout wherever an infested fruit rolls to a stop, which most likely  would be the garbage can. There is virtually no chance that each of the new  catches represents a new infestation.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Medflies are being caught in the same neighborhoods where they  were caught eight years ago. At least four of these sites were heavily sprayed  with Malathion. The odds of new infestations occurring on top of old ones  cannot be calculated, literally.  </P> <P> Finally, if, for the sake of argument, tourists, immigrants and aliens were  importing fruit, and if the flies were sprouting like seeds as the government  claims, then you would expect infestations throughout Southern California.  Especially in San Diego, with its river of immigrants flowing northward.  Southern and Central California would have gone up in a huge Medfly  conflagration long ago. Until this last month, all of the captures have been in  the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The truth can be denied, but it cannot be altered: The Medfly is established.  Almost certainly it has been among us since 1975 and has never been eradicated.  The chances are excellent that it arrived even earlier, as long ago as the  mid-1960s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How The County Tried To Kill A Fly  </P> <P> The number of medflies found in Los Angeles County each year.  </P> <P> 1975: 34  </P> <P> '76: Eradication claimed  </P> <P> '80: 4  </P> <P> '82: Eradication claimed  </P> <P> '84: 1  </P> <P> '86: 1  </P> <P> '87: 44  </P> <P> '88: 53  </P> <P> '89: 241  </P> <P> Source: California Dept. of Food and Agriculture  </P></p>

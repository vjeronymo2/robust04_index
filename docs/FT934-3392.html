			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Abta payout judgment reserved Judgment was reserved yesterday in a High Court action by a schoolgirl and her teacher against the Association of British Travel Agents for return of a Pounds 10 holiday insurance premium which was not repaid when one of Abta's members went out of business. Mr Justice Mitchell gave no indication when he would give his ruling. About 25,000 other cases, with a value of Pounds 250,000, are resting on the outcome. Abta denies liability.</p>

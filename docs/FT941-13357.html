			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Recruitment: The benefits of a switchable personality - Upheavals in the working world put premium value on learning to be motivationally versatile Why do so many managers fail after being promoted? If that question strikes readers as having an antique air, you're right. The nine words in it were the first the Jobs column's retiring writer ever penned on the subject of management, in October 1967. What leads me to exhume those words is not so much nostalgia as my surprise, on coming across them in old cuttings, that I had ever started an article with such a question. When I first asked it, the high rate of failure among newly promoted managers constituted a serious risk for ambitious people of the sort who read this column. But the world of work has undergone such upheavals that, for those of you with careers still stretching ahead, the important issues have changed radically. The difference is not that managers have ceased falling down on receiving a leg up. They still do so. What has made the change is that employers have cut whole layers of management out of their hierarchies. As a result, where future career prospects are concerned, the risk of failing after promotion is now far less of a problem than getting promoted in the first place. How severely the hatchet men have reduced the chances was illustrated recently by IBM UK's chairman Sir Anthony Cleaver. He said his group was cutting back to only four managerial tiers, which 'means a maximum of one promotion every 10 years, and even this is for the one man who makes it to the top.' Although that one man - or woman - will no doubt often be an FT reader, the speed of advance seems unlikely to appeal to thrusting ambitions. So those of you who are impatient to make your mark will need to find other avenues for your abilities. How, alas, is another matter. One advantage today is that better sources of careers advice are available. The handiest I know of is the computerised guide, Career Design*, which for anyone investing the 40 hours needed to go through it properly, prompts a searching self-analysis. Nevertheless I doubt that such *UK distributors Careers by Design, Maple House, Green Lane, Padgate, Cheshire WA1 4JN. exercises are personally sensitive enough to get to the heart of the affair, which to my mind lies in individual motivation. True, the particular ways in which people are motivated were important to careers even before the wholesale removal of steps from promotion ladders. But in those days, it was enough to find jobs suited to your characteristic motivational pattern. If you were promoted to one that didn't match, you still had a fair chance of finding another which did. Today, however, there is far less chance of finding jobs that fit your particular pattern. So the only way ahead may be to change your motivation to suit such opportunities as are available. The bad news is that a lot of psychologists think motivation is such a basic part of the human personality that making such a change is well nigh impossible. The good news is that some of them now think differently. They are the small but seemingly growing number of shrinks at work on a newish development in psychology called Reversal Theory. They believe they have cogent evidence that most people not only can, but frequently do, change (or 'reverse') their standard motivational pattern. One switch we make - which I have mentioned in previous columns - is between contrasting fundamental approaches to the things we are doing. Sometimes we will be doing them solely as a means to some different end. An example is if we are reading a textbook because we need to pass an examination, which, in turn, will improve our job prospects - the theory's term for that particular mode is telic. But there will be other occasions when we are doing something just for the sake of doing it, such as when we immerse ourselves in a novel simply because we feel like reading. The jargon for that mode is paratelic. Research by reversal theorists suggest that the differences between the two approaches are far-reaching. For instance, people operating in a paratelic way seem to be more innovative. It may be that, in the telic mode, they are concentrating too hard on the specific, further goals they have in mind to discover much that they don't know already. But as there are times when focused effort is more important than creativity, and vice versa, career horizons would be broadened by the ability to switch at will from one mode to the other. Moreover, the researchers say the same applies to another pair of fundamentally different approaches to doing things. In one, the conforming mode, the urge is to join in with the crowd, which is more often than not conducive to effective teamwork. But the other negatavistic mode can sometimes be more valuable, not least in resisting 'group-think' and the gadarene rush into daftness if not destruction that goes with it. The theory also identifies two further pairs of approaches which condition our dealings with other people. At one end of the first pair is the self-serving autocentric mode, the opposite being the urge to put someone else first, which is termed allocentric. No matter which of them we are in at any time, we can be seeking either mastery over the others or sympathy from them. Once again - as will surely be obvious to anybody who needs to motivate people who cannot be simply commanded - the ability to switch voluntarily between the opposites would expand career horizons. Unfortunately, the ways in which the last two pairs interact are complex, and there is no longer room to explain them in what is my next-to-last column. But the details can be found in Reversal Theory - Motivation, Emotion and Personality, published by Routledge at Pounds 14.99. Its author is one of the theory's originators, Michael Apter, who works at Yale University. Besides being supported by research in various countries, his brainchild sheds more light on my own motivation than any other theory I've heard of. So I went to see him while he was visiting his native Britain over the Christmas holiday. He too is concerned about the effects of upheavals in the world of work, not only on individuals but on companies. For instance, he says that no organisation can thrive without the wholehearted effort of employees whose usual approach to doing things is telic and conforming. But an essential part of such people's motivation is having clear and realisable goals, one of which is progress up the promotional ladder. Moreover one British company with a keen eye for psychological developments, but which he won't name, has spotted such dangers. It has commissioned him - together with the McMillan Partnership consultancy based in Beech Hill, Berkshire - to set up workshops aimed at helping company staff to become more motivationally versatile. 'The plan is to tutor them in ways of reversing modes,' Dr Apter said. 'The most simple example is that, if you are in the paratelic frame and faced with something you dislike doing, you can usually switch to the telic mode by keeping your mind on the worst things likely to happen if you neglect the chore any longer. And if you think that's easy for a typical paratelic to do, believe you me that it isn't'</p>

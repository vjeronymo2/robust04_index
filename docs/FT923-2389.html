			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Major strives to salvage policy: FT-SE jumps 105 points as base rates are cut to 10 per cent and sterling sinks MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to salvage the government's economic strategy from the wreckage of devaluation by insisting that sterling would eventually rejoin the exchange rate mechanism. But senior ministers were forced to admit that it might be months before sterling was again tied to the D-Mark as it continued to sink in the currency markets. Meanwhile, base rates were cut to 10 per cent and the stock market soared. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted the defeat of inflation would remain at the core of his policy. However, ministerial colleagues said the government could not now avoid a fundamental reappraisal of its overall economic strategy. Mr Major also faced the threat of revolt by Tory MPs over his approach to Europe and the economy, with a growing number arguing that he should abandon the ERM entirely in favour of a rapid cut in interest rates to 'kick-start' economic recovery. Mr Lamont, who was given a vote of confidence at an emergency cabinet meeting, flatly rejected suggestions that he should resign. He said: 'I am not going to resign. I have been operating the policy of the whole government, and I know that I have the support of the prime minister and the full support of my cabinet colleagues.' In his first formal television interviews since the crisis erupted, Mr Lamont said: 'What we faced yesterday - and in the last couple of weeks - has been a wholly exceptional set of circumstances, the like of which haven't been seen for 20 years or more. 'It affected not just this country but Italy, which has also had to leave the exchange rate mechanism, and Spain, which has had to devalue its currency as well. What I did yesterday was simple commonsense in the face of a whirlwind.' Mr Lamont denied there had been a devaluation of the pound. He told ITN: 'We have not resorted to devaluation. The pound is now currently floating and we will have to see what level it finds.' The damage-limitation exercise did not dispel widespread doubts at Westminster over the chancellor's long-term future. Some of his colleagues believe his authority has been fatally undermined. Cabinet ministers said that the political row over the Bundesbank's role in causing the sterling crisis would delay attempts by the government to ratify the Maastricht treaty even if it was approved by the French electorate on Sunday. It is now thought that detailed debate on the legislation will have to be delayed until after the Edinburgh summit in December. As the Bank of England reversed the 2-point rise in base rates announced as part of its vain efforts on Wednesday, the pound slid more than 13 pfennigs below its previous ERM floor to close in London at DM2.6400. But the reversal of Wednesday's sharp rise in interest rates, and expectations of further rate cuts gave share prices their biggest boost since the Conservative party's election victory in April. The FT-SE 100 share index closed up 105.6 at 2,483.9 in one of the most heavily traded sessions on record. Equity dealers sensed that sterling's effective devaluation and suspension from the ERM could signal a shift in UK government policies in the direction of lower interest rates. Mr Lamont, who appeared in surprisingly resilient mood after the drama of Wednesday's devaluation, indicated that he wanted to make a number of assessments before deciding when and at what rate to take the pound back into the ERM. The most immediate would be the pattern of exchange after the results of the French referendum. But the chancellor also wants a thorough examination by the European Community of the effectiveness of co-operation between governments and central banks within the ERM. Such a debate would focus inevitably on the obligations of the Bundesbank in helping to defend the weaker currencies. Mr Lamont's next concern is to get confirmation that German interest rates - at the root of sterling's problems in the ERM - are set firmly on a downward path before fixing a new rate for the pound against the D-Mark. That suggests the Treasury believes there may be scope for further small cuts in British interest rates over the next few months if the inflation rate continues to fall at the present rate. In spite of Mr Lamont's devaluation denial, there was little conviction behind Downing Street's suggestion that it was possible that sterling could rise significantly before it was taken back into the ERM. Mr Major's aides were keen to stress that every member of the cabinet had endorsed at yesterday's meeting the decision to rejoin eventually. Some ministers were also raising the question of whether Mr Major should re-examine the option of granting statutory independence to the Bank of England - an idea favoured by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The aim would be to restore credibility to the government's anti-inflation strategy. But colleagues said that after his experience in recent days with the Bundesbank, Mr Lamont was disinclined to consider it as an immediate option. Seizing on the cabinet's attempt to rally to Mr Lamont, Labour gave notice that it would target Mr Major as chief culprit for the sterling crisis in next Thursday's Commons debate. While Mr John Smith, the party leader, claimed that the chaotic events revealed 'muddle and confusion' at the heart of Mr Major's government, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, quoting from Mr Major's speech made less than a week ago that ruled out devaluation, said: 'It is time for the prime minister to explain in full in a statement to the British people what the government policy for the economy now is.'

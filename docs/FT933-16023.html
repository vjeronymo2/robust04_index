			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Exchange will review disclosure guidelines: Concern over effects of new insider dealing rules THE STOCK EXCHANGE is to review its guidelines spelling out how company directors can give price sensitive information to investors without breaking insider dealing rules. The review, to be drafted in conjunction with leading corporations and institutional investors, has been prompted by a crackdown on insider dealing under the new Criminal Justice Bill, and investor concern about selective leaking of information. A draft report is scheduled for early September. The review was initiated partly by the 100 Group of Finance Directors, representing Britain's largest companies, the Association of British Insurers, a shareholder body, and the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a trade association. The groups had expressed concern over ambiguities in the Criminal Justice Bill which could discourage companies from giving information to their institutional shareholders. The review will offer guidelines on what constitutes material information. It will also consider whether there should be regular reporting of companies' trading conditions in addition to the biannual earnings statements. Shareholders are anxious to see rules requiring companies to disclose price sensitive information - such as profits warnings - to the entire market at one time. At present, some companies inform their brokers or key institutional shareholders days before such warnings are issued publicly. 'The longer information remains inside, the greater the opportunity for insider dealing,' said one of the institutional shareholder representatives. The exchange says it has no immediate plans to change its so-called 'yellow book' of rules governing the release of company information. However, institutional shareholders are understood to be pressing for tougher yellow book requirements on disclosure by directors. Some shareholders argue the main problem is enforcing present rules involving inside information. The yellow book already requires immediate release of information which could 'reasonably be expected to have a material effect on market activity in, and prices of, listed securities'. Dividends, interim figures and 'exceptional matters' fall into this category.</p>

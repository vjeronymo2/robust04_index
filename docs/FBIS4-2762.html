			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Treasury Bond Sales Win Warm Reception"] </F>   [Text] The 1994 treasury bonds have enjoyed a warm  response from Chinese residents since they were first issued on  April 1.    More than 17.73 billion yuan ($2.03 billion) worth of bonds  had been sold by last Saturday, according to the People's Bank  of China.    The sales included 8.13 billion yuan ($934.4 million) in  two-year bonds and 9.6 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in three-year  bonds.    This year, China is planning to issue 87 billion yuan ($10  million) in two- and three-year bonds--twice as much as last  year.    Bonds have sold better in large cities than in small- and  medium- sized cities. They have also had a warmer welcome in  urban areas than in rural areas, and in inland provinces than  along the coast.    In Beijing alone, the sales volume for the first nine days  amounted to nearly 2.9 billion yuan ($333.3 million). Shanghai  also tallied up more than 2.5 billion yuan ($287.3 million) in  sales.    But in some places, the issuance of treasury bonds has not  been as successful due to competition from other high-yield  investments.    Analysts said the receptivity to this year's treasury bonds  is good news for the government, which has high expectations for  the bonds. Starting this year, bonds are the government's sole  method to offset the national deficit--estimated at 60 billion  yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year.    Bond sales are attractive this year because of the financial  reform that began last year. The unauthorized raising of  capital has been stopped, which frees up more capital for bond  sales.    The bonds' high interest rates also spark interest. This  year's two-year bonds go for 1.3 percentage points higher than  bank deposits for the same term. The three-year bonds are 1.72  percentage points higher.</p>

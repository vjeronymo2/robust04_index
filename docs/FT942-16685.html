			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Chinese groups seek NYSE listings Four of the largest state-owned Chinese companies selected for listing outside China are aiming for the New York Stock Exchange. Two power supply companies and two regional airlines, expected to raise between Dollars 250m and Dollars 500m each, have signed up with US investment banks, according to industry executives. In January the Chinese government published a list of 22 large and medium-sized state companies which it had approved for a foreign listing. Most were, and still are, expected to list their shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Chinese corporate regulators are understood to have sanctioned the US listings. They are, however, waiting to see how these progress before allowing companies to list on other foreign exchanges. So far 13 of the companies are believed to have issued mandates to merchant banks, with seven going to US investment banks. UK and Japanese houses have captured only one each, while the Bank of China's merchant bank in Hong Kong has received two lead mandates. The US listings are expected to be among the first of the 22 to come to the market, towards the end of this year, with the power companies at the head of the list. Lehman Brothers has secured the mandate for Huaneng International, a power generation and supply company incorporated in Beijing, while Credit Suisse First Boston will bring Shandong Huaneng Electricity, a Beijing incorporated operator of seven power companies, to the New York market. Goldman Sachs has won the mandate for China Southern Airlines and Morgan Stanley the mandate for China Eastern Airways. Some bankers query the value of a foreign listing for mainland Chinese companies, claiming that the natural market for these stocks is Hong Kong.</p>

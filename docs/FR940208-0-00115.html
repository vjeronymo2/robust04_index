			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 35:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several people were concerned that designation of critical habitat would preclude the recreational use of lands that their families have used for generations, and they strongly opposed its designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat is not synonymous with setting aside wilderness, locking up the lands within, or prohibiting all uses. The Service anticipates that the land management agencies will designate roads and trails within critical habitat, and that they will close some roads that are secondary and not necessary for access to private lands or mines. Also, designation of critical habitat could increase certain types of recreational use. Many people enjoy areas that show fewer signs of human activity. Activities considered not likely to adversely affect critical habitat include hunting, picnicking, casual horseback riding (on designated roads and trails), camping, birdwatching, bike riding (on designated roads and trails), hiking, and motor vehicle use on designated roads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 36:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some local agencies and utility companies were concerned that designation of critical habitat would affect their ability to access, use, and maintain existing facilities, rights-of-way, and fee property. Some stated that existing utility corridors should be excluded from critical habitat designation. Several agencies were concerned that critical habitat designation would either exclude or significantly increase the cost of future public works projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat should not interfere with on-going maintenance of existing roads and utilities. These structures do not normally contain primary constituent elements, and they would, therefore, not be affected by the designation. Routine maintenance operations on existing pipelines, buried fiber-optic lines, and electrical transmission line rights-of-way are generally covered under existing section 7 consultations and are not likely to constitute adverse modification of critical habitat. Any expansion, addition, or modification within the rights-of-way or fee property will be subject to section 7 consultation if authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal agency. Through such consultation, the Service will determine if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 37:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several individuals requested that the final rule contain a discussion of how CHUs will be managed. Other members of the public were concerned that critical habitat designation forces creation of a management plan, establishes population goals, or prescribes specific management actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Savers who are caring, and sharing - Investment clubs are coming to Britain. A new way for investors to pool ideas and money for profit THE IDEA is widespread in the US but has never taken off with the same enthusiasm in the UK. This week, however, Proshare, the organisation which aims to promote deeper and wider share ownership, launched ProShare Investment Clubs to inject renewed interest into the concept. Investment clubs are a way for people who know, like and trust each another to meet regularly in order to make collective stock market investments by pooling knowledge and funds. The idea is to make direct stock market investment affordable. For example, if 10 individuals can each afford to save up to Pounds 30 a month for a stock market investment, it would take at least a year for each to build a worthwhile lump sum to invest. By pooling the amounts, it would only take a few months before entering the market could become viable. People who want to invest, but do not have the confidence to do so on their own, may find being part of a group the answer. Brokerage costs also account for a smaller proportion of the total investment when compared to the costs of buying and selling 10 separate investments. Moreover, informal meetings can make investment as enjoyable as any of the more conventional club activities, such as golf or playing bridge. Sir Peter Thompson, chairman of ProShare says: 'Investment clubs are for everyone - they are a fun, sociable and cost-effective way for the British public to discover the excitement of investing in the stock market. You don't need a fortune, just enthusiasm, a group of friends, business colleagues or acquaintances, a few hours a month and a little surplus cash.' The first investment club was founded in Texas in 1898 but it is the Mutual Investment Club of Detroit, set up in 1940 by Frederic C Russell, an American businessman, which is regarded as the spur to the worldwide investment club movement. Russell died in 1965 but the investment club he founded, and which has averaged 18 members, is still in existence. Over the years members have subscribed Dollars 300,000 and the club now has a portfolio worth Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.67m) after withdrawals of Dollars 1.2m. There are more than 9,000 investment clubs in the US, with a total of 230,000 members, and 15,000 clubs in France. Investment clubs were first launched in the UK in the late 1940s. Although the National Association of Investment Clubs, established in 1959, helped to create 2,000 investment clubs, the 1987 stock market crash contributed to a fall in numbers to an estimated 600 today, with an average of 12 to 15 in each. ProShare has taken over the NAIC and relaunched it as ProShare Investment Clubs with membership costing Pounds 50. Members will receive a 70-page manual on establishing and running an investment club, a monthly newsletter and the ProShare Guide to Information Sources, a useful directory of places to search for investment advice. Membership brings with it automatic registration with ProShare Investment Clubs and allows access to any special offers and discounts as well a helpline. ProShare is also offering, free, its Shares for You video and two copies of its Guide to You and Your Stockbroker. Alternatively, the manual can be purchased for Pounds 25 and the video will be sent free. ProShare will not introduce individuals to existing investment clubs. Since money in a club is pooled, trust between members is important and it is unlikely that any club will welcome the inclusion of strangers. Instead ProShare recommends that an individual gathers round them like-minded people to form their own club (see the accompanying panel). One disadvantage of investing through a club is that it is not possible to take advantage of tax-efficient personal equity plans which are for individuals only. However, many investment club members are likely to have investments of their own and can use a Pep for these shares. Sir Peter Thompson says if the investment club movement takes off, ProShare will lobby for similar tax advantages to be extended to club investments. Barclays stockbrokers has linked up with ProShare to offer investment clubs a sharedealing and administration service. Other brokers are likely to provide a similar service in the near future. Barclayshare Investment Club package offers a portfolio service from Pounds 12 a quarter (plus VAT) or an advisory service from Pounds 30 (plus VAT) a quarter. The minimum brokerage fees for equities are 1.5 per cent on the first Pounds 10,000 in the portfolio service and 1.35 per cent in the advisory service. Proshare: Tel: 0800-556622.</p>

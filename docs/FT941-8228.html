			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The regulator armed with a horse-whip: Andrew Large talks to Norma Cohen on the future of the investment industry Andrew Large, the bespectacled, slightly stoop-shouldered chief City regulator is poking, prodding, coaxing and in some cases, horse-whipping the investment industry into the 21st century. His personal demeanor is more of a poodle than a Rottweiler but he is the instigator of a radical shake-up of the investment industry for small investors and large securities firms alike. In the 18 months since he took on the role of chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, he has forced an overhaul of the way retail financial services are regulated despite the implacable hostility of the insurance industry. This week, he will unveil the blueprint for the Personal Investment Authority, the vehicle for far tougher oversight than yet achieved. And last week, he launched a review of the way wholesale markets operate and suggested that, to make markets more efficient and competitive, professional investors may have to give up some of the practices which have protected their profits. He concedes that some suggestions made in his report, couched in the non-combative language of a discussion document, are radical. But he says London must face the issues. 'All these issues have been addressed in the US. Any financial centre that aspires to be a major financial centre must answer these questions,' he says. 'If we don't do this, we are not doing our duty.' Moreover, he has announced a permanent group of securities regulators to improve the ferreting out and punishment of wrongdoing in the securities industry. Regulators ought to act as a 'street-wise support' to criminal prosecutors, helping them obtain convictions. Mr Large acknowledges as legitimate the public anger over the failure of the criminal courts to convict and punish individuals widely accused of cheating investors and says that something must be done. Former colleagues say his boffin-like demeanor is misleading. 'He is out to win,' says a colleague who worked closely with him at Swiss Bank Corporation in London in the 1980s. 'And if he can't win, he'll get out.' Proof of that, colleagues say, was his decision to quit the board of SBC after two years, despite the prestige of having been the first foreigner named to such a post. 'He came in early one morning and tried to make himself a cup of coffee. The staff wouldn't let him do it - they said directors don't make coffee,' says one former colleague. Aside from the cultural differences, there were other difficulties over the board's reluctance to consider expansion projects he thought necessary. For his part, he speaks glowingly of his 10 years at SBC, during which time he established the bank as a major force in international finance, particularly in Eurobonds. But he does describe his years on the board as 'stressful'. Former associates give fulsome praise to him for intellectual adroitness and management skills. 'His organisational skills are second to none,' says one ex-SBC official. Moreover, he was sufficiently international in character - he was carted around the world as a child by his father, an army doctor - to win business where others could not. Former associates describe an almost complete lack of humour. Not one recalls a joke or prank committed by him - a unique trait in the Eurobond markets where absurd personalities abound. In an interview, he intoned with a straight face that he could never be a doctor like his father because 'I don't have any patience,' oblivious to his own pun. An intensely private person, at first blush, he hardly appeared the catalyst to shake up the investment industry when he was appointed to head the SIB in June 1992. A product of Winchester College and Cambridge University, his first job was with British Petroleum which sent him to Malaysia. Back in London, he was in charge of an abortive project to extract protein from fuel oil. The turning point came, he says, when BP offered him the opportunity to train for an MBA at Insead, the French management school. Insead was wonderful, he says. 'It was totally international. You didn't care where anyone was from.' The year there gave him his interest in finance. But he says BP refused to give him a job in finance because he wasn't an accountant, and he jumped ship to work at Orion Bank, a consortium set up by six foreign banks. After 10 years there, he was one of a group of five poached by SBC in 1979 to set up international activities based in London. While he was at SBC he first entered the regulatory arena. He was chairman of the Securities Association, the precursor of the current self-regulatory body and in that role, fought hard to reduce the regulatory burden on professional investors envisaged in the newly-created Financial Services Act. He says he still believes professional markets require a different regulatory approach than retail markets with their unsophisticated investors. Asked whether he still believes in self-regulation, he demurs. 'I don't think self-regulation should be a theology.' 'If regulation is going to work so that investors are going to be protected in an efficient manner then you must have practitioners involved in it.' The extent to which practitioners should be involved in writing the City's rules will be the stickiest question for the remainder of his term. His main challenge will be to ensure that whatever the regulatory regime when his term is over, City hearts and minds are in it too.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The archer who will ignite the world  -Peter Berlin previews the next fortnight's prospects for athletes, television networks and couch potatoes THIS EVENING, an archer will fire a flaming arrow in the air which will come to earth who knows where. On its flight, it will ignite the Olympic flame. The flame is a symbol of the Olympic ideal, a signal that competition may start and that for 16 days the city of Barcelona has become the modern Olympia. Unfortunately, the symbolic and the real are some way apart. The great mishmash of sports that is the Olympic Games is beyond the scope of even a city as cosmopolitan and spendthrift as Barcelona. The Games have burst past the girdle of mountains that belts the city and spilled beyond the Games' 16-day fortnight. Competition started yesterday with four soccer games, including one 360km away in Valencia, and a burst of Basque pelota. Tomorrow afternoon the Dream Team, a gang of towering American millionaires, will sweep down from their luxury rented villas and slam-dunk a basketball through the five hoops of the Olympic ideal. The basketball stars' experience of the Games will be in sharp contrast to that of the true amateurs of the modern Olympics: the fans. Many spectators will be taking time off and paying their own expenses to be there. For them, the next 16 days will be a serious strain on energy, cash and the host city's organising ability. There is no substitute for being here in person - for sitting in the stadium as the US team races to a world 400 metres relay record; as the Dream Team peaks in the basketball final; as the world's best young soccer players battle for gold; as the men's hockey tournament reaches its climax . . . except that you cannot, because all these events are crammed together on the evening of the orgiastic final Saturday and spread around the four corners of Barcelona. But then, no one should expect the Olympics to make sense from a sporting point of view. Nor should spectators expect things to be easy. The Games are no longer run for the benefit of spectators or athletes, but for the TV companies. This is no bad thing. After all, the broadcasters are trying to serve billions of fans around the world. The biggest team here is not entered in the Games. It is made up of 1,300 employees of NBC (versus 925 for the entire US team), which is involved in the altogether rougher, more serious competition for audience share in the US. Thanks to the efforts of TV companies and the miracles of tape delay, video recorders, cable, satellite and remote control channel changers, couch potatoes around the world can see the finals of the 4x400m and the basketball and the hockey and the soccer should they want to. For dedicated sofa slugs, the Olympics represent a test of stamina and flexibility. The important thing is to pace yourself. In this respect, the TV companies and the Olympic schedulers have co-operated to create a viewer-friendly timetable. On many days, there is enough sport for 72, sometimes 96, hours of non-stop live action. But unless their own country is about to win a medal, the broadcasters will simply ignore many sports - particularly non-telegenic events such as archery, shooting and fencing. For sports which do interest the broadcasters, timetables have been tailored to deliver the biggest audiences. The action is conveniently concentrated in the evenings - to suit European and North American viewers - and during the Olympic fortnight's three weekends. In the basketball tournament, the US team will play the bulk of its games at 8.30pm or 10.30pm local time, while the final is scheduled for 10pm on the last Saturday - prime time in the US. The two biggest medal sports, athletics (43 golds) and swimming (31) helpfully get all the qualifying nonsense out of the way in the early mornings and save their finals for the evenings. So far as broadcasters are concerned, swimming is the only game in town during the first week. In the periods between Olympic Games, few broadcasters would dream of transmitting swimming in prime time, but the Olympics lend it status. Its central place at the Games is consecrated by tradition. Swimming was in the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. Swimming will award one in every eight gold medals in Barcelona. While swimming is dull - swimmers race in straight lines at steady speeds, so it is generally clear after 200m who will win the 1,500m freestyle - it is also easily intelligible compared with wrestling. Viewers do not need to understand the nuances of the tumble turn to understand who is leading. As a matter of fact, the winner's rostrum at pool-side will provide an early answer to one of the most intriguing questions at Barcelona. In Seoul four years ago, the East German women won 10 of the 15 swimming events, seven in world or Olympic record times. They collected 22 medals in all, and now join forces with the West Germans (who won a silver in Seoul). But only two members of that all-conquering team even reached the finals in the world championships in Perth last year, and the unified German squad failed to win a single women's gold. If this happens again, and if the women's races also are slower than in 1988, it could be a sign that socialism really does produce better athletes. Or it could be a sign (the IOC hopes, piously) that everyone is taking fewer drugs. Socialism is the more likely bet. In this alone, the IOC and the TV companies are at odds. The latter hope there will be loads of world records to fuss over; the IOC hopes there are none. The swimming winds up with its usual spray of relays next Friday night, leaving the airwaves free for the other aquatic sports and for the one sport guaranteed to draw women viewers: gymnastics. The most glamorous TV event, athletics, starts quietly next Friday, too, with the finals of the 20km walk and the shot put. The first significant finals are the next day: the 100m sprints and the women's marathon, which feature in Saturday's prime time. This irritates the marathoners, who would rather start in the traditional cool of early morning rather than in hot late afternoon. After that, apart from the rest day on August 4, athletics keeps the pot boiling with a steady stream of finals. Meanwhile, sports which know their place, such as archery, kayaking and table tennis, sort out their medals quietly at unobtrusive times, and the majority of the team ball games (except baseball) as well as two viewer favourites, boxing and tennis, also build toward their climaxes on that frenzied final weekend. After the 29-medal blitz of the final Saturday, armchair athletes can make a gentle start to the last Sunday. They can see six boxing finals in the morning, watch the male marathoners tormented by the heat and the killer hill - and then tune-in to the closing ceremony and the dousing of the flame lit by the Spanish William Tell 16 days previously. By then, the Atlanta organising committee will be at work on plans to offer viewers an even more exhausting spectacle in four years' time. Given inflation, I doubt that Atlanta will bother with a bow and arrow. Perhaps it will use an inter-galactic laser to make its opening ceremony go with a bang.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ben Maclennan] </F>   [Text] Cape Town June 3 SAPA -- The SA [South African]  National Defence Force [SANDF] would be sent into the  gang-ridden Cape Flats next week, the African National Congress'  Western Cape spokesman on policing Vincent Diba told protesters  outside Parliament on Friday [3 June]. Some of the 30  protesting Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum members chained themselves  to the gates of Parliament demanding stronger action against  gangs.    The protest is believed to be the first at parliament since  the ANC came to power after the April poll. One protester  carried an ANC flag, while others wore ANC buttons. Police who  monitored the four-hour demonstration at one point confiscated  posters and a coffin carried by the group, but returned them  after intervention by Mr Diba.    He said he had held talks with Western Cape MEC [member of  the Executive Commission] for police Patrick McKenzie on Friday  and Monday but Mr McKenzie did not yet have the delegated powers  to address the gang problem. "I want to assure you now that you  say you want the SANDF to go to Manenberg. You will get it.  You are definitely going to get the Defence Force in that  area." He said he would speak to Minister of Safety and  Security Sidney Mufamadi on Friday or at the weekend and report  back to the group on Monday.    The SANDF would be in Manenberg "definitely in the coming  week". An independent office to receive complaints against the  police would also be set up.    Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum spokesman Irvin Kinnes said the  protesters included National Party [NP] and ANC supporters. "We  are sick of gangs," he said. "It has nothing to do with whether  you are ANC or NP. Parliament has a responsibility to protect  the lives of our people in Manenberg. We want the Defence  Force, we want the gangsters' guns out. "If it's the people's  Parliament they must react to the people's demands."    Three protesters chained themselves to the gates of  Parliament in Plein Street at about 12.20PM as members of the  police special guard unit looked on. They unchained themselves  later in the afternoon. Several protesters stood on the kerb of  Plein Street with a coffin, which Mr Kinnes said was meant to  symbolise the number of people who had died in gang violence on  the Cape Flats. Posters called for the removal of "corrupt"  police forces from Manenberg, and for the SANDF to move in to  the area.    Shortly after 4PM policemen confiscated the posters, then  picked up the coffin and tried to carry it to a patrol van.  Protesters moved to stop them, and a tug-of-war developed. The  senior policeman on the scene, Lt-Col Willem Snyman, told the  protesters they could reclaim the coffin from Cape Town's  central police station when their protest was over, and it was  loaded into the van. Mr Kinnes later asked Mr Diba to negotiate  its return "because someone has to be buried in it tomorrow".    "I have no problem with that," said Col Snyman. "I just want  to look inside and see if there's anyone in it." He watched as  two of the protesters opened the coffin's top panel. The  demonstrators dispersed shortly afterwards -- with their coffin.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORDS MAKE AGENDA IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> The Israeli capture of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a military as well as spiritual  Shiite leader in Lebanon, has triggered renewed international interest in the  10-year struggle between Iran and the United States. The changing circumstances  of this struggle vividly illustrate the complex diplomatic terrain of the  Middle East and one of its most nuanced yet highly effective weapons: words.  </P> <P> Did Israel capture a "combatant" or kidnap a "hostage"? Should the 300 Shiites  now held by Israel be viewed as "prisoners of war" or equated with the Western  "captives" held hostage in Lebanon? How important are semantic choices in the  Middle East conflict?  </P> <P> U.S. and Iranian leaders have sought to advance their respective interests by  conveying political signals through highly nuanced messages while preserving  flexibility of action. President George Bush and Iran's Hashemi Rafsanjani try  to convince the other to behave differently without explicitly acknowledging  any fundamental changes in the basic tenets of their forcefully articulated  policies.  </P> <P> Maintaining flexibility is vital for both men, not only in the international  arena, but with respect to their domestic constituencies.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani, a "moderate" who has advocated a more pragmatic policy toward the  West -- including an end to Iranian efforts to export revolution -- still faces  considerable opposition from radicals who oppose any reconciliation with the  United States. Hezbollah receives most of its support from those radical  factions who oppose Rafsanjani's pragmatism. Thus, Rafsanjani proclaims  simultaneously that while he is prepared to "approach the problem reasonably,"  the United States must end its "bullying, arrogant approach" to the situation.  </P> <P> Bush is also walking a high wire between domestic critics who favor immediate  military action and those seeking political initiatives aimed at freeing  hostages at any cost. To his credit, Bush is demonstrating statesmanship by  deftly conveying signals of resoluteness and a readiness to use force with  ambiguous but patient diplomacy.  </P> <P> These combined efforts have created a tenuous political opportunity that could  lead to the release of the hostages in Lebanon, peace and economic recovery in  south Lebanon and the normalization of U.S.-Iranian relations. Notwithstanding  these hopeful developments, it should remain clear that Iran and its allies are  at war with the United States.  </P> <P> There should be no ambiguity regarding the Iranian-backed Shiites' loathing of  America and their readiness to fight the West in advancing the Shiite cause.  Their success can be largely attributed to America's failure to act in defense  of its national interests.  </P> <P> Instead, America once again finds itself manipulated -- politically and  emotionally -- with the media delivering the messages of our enemy. In this  "wartime" environment, decisions by public-opinion-makers to describe Israel's  abduction of Obeid as a "kidnaping," rather than a legitimate act of  self-defense, or to identify Israel's Shiite prisoners as "hostages," take on  considerable political significance.  </P> <P> Moreover, the rhetorical treatment of particular factions of Shiites in Lebanon  as an independent, national force, exaggerates their political status in a  country being ripped apart by Syrian and Iraqi proxies. To Lebanon's Shiite  community, such rhetoric, whether official or unofficial, is perceived to  reflect subtle but fundamental shifts in U.S. policy -- extending a form of  political legitimacy to Hezbollah aspirations, strategy and tactics.  </P> <P> The accepted use of such charged rhetoric can only register as a victory for  terrorism and a defeat for Western values and interests. After all, how was  America's airborne interception of the Achille Lauro hijackers characterized --  as legitimate "self defense" or as unlawful "hostage-taking"?  </P> <P> Not only does such careless or carefully chosen rhetoric legitimize Hezbollah's  struggle -- by equating Israeli actions with those of lawless terrorists -- it  exacerbates the already strained relations of Israel, the United States and the  Western democracies.  </P> <P> Such strains weaken America's regional position and will make it more difficult  to arrange some sort of prisoner exchange between Israel and Hezbollah, or to  persuade Israel to take risks for peace in the broader context of the  Arab-Israeli conflict.  </P> <P> Another example of the important role of semantics in the struggles of the  Middle East is the Palestine Liberation Organization's recent political  recognition by the U.S. government and the ensuing strains in U.S.-Israeli  relations.  </P> <P> The PLO was recognized by the United States government not because it had  changed its behavior. After all, the PLO maintained it already had renounced  terrorism. Rather, Washington began an official dialogue with the PLO simply  because the PLO had finally uttered the "magic words." As far as the U.S.  government is concerned, the PLO is now a legitimate participant in the  political dialogues.  </P> <P> The PLO -- well aware how word choice can alter the process -- picks its terms  carefully. It selects a word in Arabic to satisfy its domestic constituency but  the English meaning is far different. In recent weeks, Al Fatah called on its  constituents "to intensify and escalate armed action and all forms of struggle"  against Israel.  </P> <P> Always seeking opportunities to enhance its international standing and achieve  legitimacy, the PLO recently tried to achieve de facto statehood by asking to  become a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the subsequent  protocols.  </P> <P> Whether groups other than states can be a signatory is subject to legal debate.  But PLO semantic objectives are clear: advance the goal of  "self-determination," the code word for an independent state, and enhance the  status of Palestinians arrested in the occupied territories by increasing  international pressure on Israel to treat detainees as "prisoners of war."  </P> <P> In the current hostage situation, it appears likely that the United States and  Iran, with Syria playing its "why ask me?" role, will try to inch forward in  the coming months through a complex set of public and private diplomatic  initiatives. Israel has offered to exchange the Shiites it holds -- including  Obeid -- for the Israeli and Western hostages. Hezbollah seems to have said  implicitly -- although it has also seemingly recanted -- that it will secure  release of Western hostages if Israel first releases "its hostages." Yet the  Iranian foreign minister says the Lebanon hostage issue doesn't concern Iran.  </P> <P> Choice of words and timing are critical to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough.  While it must be clear that Washington will use force if necessary to give  teeth to U.S. diplomacy, a carefully conducted war of words may offer the best  chance of achieving political results.  </P> <P> Opinion-makers must choose their weapons carefully, however, in advancing or  describing U.S. interests. As a nation we risk the lives of the hostages,  unnecessary damage to our relationship with Israel and repeating our  regrettable penchant for self-inflicted wounds.  </P></p>

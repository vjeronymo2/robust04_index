			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Ming Chi-liu (2494 </F> 0796 3177): "Lu Ping Talks About Hong Kong Flat Prices, Other  Economic Affairs When Meeting With Hong Kong Manufacturers'  Delegation"]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Today, Lu Ping,  director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, met with the visiting delegation of the Hong Kong  Chinese Manufacturers' Association at the Hong Kong and Macao  Center of Beijing. He said at the meeting that there are only  three years plus 17 days before the transfer of government in  1997, but a good deal of things needed to be done to ensure a  smooth transition. In particular, many issues in the field of  economic affairs should be considered and solved as soon as  possible. For example, the issue of property prices, the  coordination of capital construction between Hong Kong and the  mainland, the operational costs and charges of the container  terminal, and the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and  the mainland.    Lu Ping said: Now, there are only three years plus 17 days  before the transfer of government in Hong Kong. "When meeting  the delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, our  President Jiang said that time flies like an arrow, and the sun  and the moon move back and forth like a shuttle. Three years  will pass very quickly, but we are now still facing a great deal  of preparatory work. Such preparatory work only serves the  purpose of guaranteeing Hong Kong's smooth transition to the  period beyond 1997. We hope to achieve this purpose in the  political, economic, and social aspects."    When talking about the issue of flat prices in Hong Kong and  the Hong Kong Government's recent measures, Lu Ping said: "We  should have foresight when approaching this issue, and should  not only look at current prices. Because the measures set forth  by the British Hong Kong authorities will become effective  before 1997, we hope that after 1997, a smooth transition will  be effected for both flat prices and land prices, and no major  fluctuations will arise." He added that in order to ensure a  smooth transition, the relevant issues must be submitted to the  the Sino-British Land Committee and other channels for mutual  consultation, because these issues are all related to how Hong  Kong will be able to maintain prosperity after 1997. He said:  The soaring flat prices have made ordinary people unable to buy  flats, and this is indeed a big problem which must be solved.  At the same time, the high flat prices will also raise the  costs of production and thus weaken the competitive power of  Hong Kong products. In addition, this may force some overseas  transnational groups to give up plans for setting up Asian or  Far East headquarters in Hong Kong, or force some of them to  move their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong to other  countries or regions. This will certainly affect Hong Kong's  status as an international economic, trade, and financial center.    Therefore, he stressed, the issue of high property prices  must be resolved as soon as possible. The Chinese side has also  long expressed its opinion. It is hope that the British Hong  Kong authorities will squarely face this problem, and will adopt  some measures that are really effective. On the other hand,  however, this issue must be handled prudently. "Like a person  who has a high fever, the body temperature cannot be lowered  drastically, but should be cooled down gradually." The real  estate industry is the pillar of the Hong Kong economy. If  drastic ups and downs arise, the overall economy in Hong Kong  will certainly be affected.    As for the issue of coordinating the large-scale capital  construction projects between Hong Kong and the nearby mainland  areas, Lu Ping said that this will not only affect Hong Kong,  but will also affect the development of the mainland cities.  For example, the plans for the construction of railways,  highways, and shipping terminals on the two sides must be  properly coordinated. It is impossible that each goes its own  way. Otherwise, what should be done in the future if the  projects launched separately on the two sides do not dovetail or  become incompatible? Lu Ping cited an example and said: At  present, China is building the Beijing-Jiulong (Kowloon)  Railway. After the railway line stretches to Shenzhen, where  should it be extended into Hong Kong, how should the railways  built on both sides be linked up? In addition, there is a  shortage of storage facilities along the railway line on the  Hong Kong side; after the new railway is opened to traffic in  the future, how will the Hong Kong side handle the suddenly  increasing freight as well as passengers? The settlement of all  such issues requires coordination between the two sides.    With regard to the construction of the new container  terminals, Lu Ping said that Hong Kong actually needs to build  new container terminals, but attention should also be paid to  the competition from the new container terminals in Shanghai,  Shenzhen, and Shekou. In particular, operation costs and  charges of the Hong Kong container terminals are rather high  now, and this may weaken their competitiveness. Therefore, Lu  Ping said, if the construction and operation costs of Container  Terminal Number Nine are not properly brought under control, the  new terminal will not have competitive power if it is built.    As for the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and the  mainland, Lu Ping said that it is necessary to consider as soon  as possible the issue of whether ships registered in Hong Kong  will be treated as "foreign ships" or "domestic ships" when  entering mainland harbors after 1997, and how the Chinese ships  will be treated when entering the harbor of Hong Kong, because  this is an issue that both sides will be facing as of 1 July  1997.</p>

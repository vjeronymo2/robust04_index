			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Sino-German bilateral  trade should be developed further and cooperation between the  two countries in all fields should be promoted, a German  minister said here today.    The German Minister of the Economy, Guenter Rexrodt, made  the  remarks at a joint press conference for the first Sino-German  medium-sized and small enterprises' conference which opened on  Thursday.    He expressed the hope that Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit  to  Germany, scheduled for early July, would serve to develop  Sino-German political and economic relations further,    Rexrodt said that Sino-German bilateral trade required  further promotion and that China's infrastructure, its energy  supply, transport and communications in particular, needed  development.    Germany has long been China's most important economic  partner  in western Europe. In 1993, the volume of trade between the two  countries reached 10 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 54.9  percent from 1992.    The German minister said on Thursday that for Germany China  was an extremely important investment market in Asia and its  biggest economic partner among the developing countries.    He also expressed the hope that China would continue its  successful economic reform policies.    Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, who is heading the Chinese  delegation, today asked the European Union (EU) to abolish their  discrimination against and restrictions on Chinese products.    In response, Rexrodt said Germany would try its best within  the EU to have the restrictions rescinded.    The two-day Sino-German medium-sized and small enterprises'  conference ended today. Some 250 items for cooperation were  introduced by the two sides and 77 of them underwent serious  discussion during the conference.</p>

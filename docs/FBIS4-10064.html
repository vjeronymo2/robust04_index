			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marta Marina Gonzalez and Arquimedes Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Santiago Rivas Betancourt is 27 years old and  allegedly one of the terrorists who were supposed to kill  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina for $400,000. He told  BARRICADA: "I have never had anything to do with such a plan. I  went to Honduras to buy spare parts. We are clean. We did not  plan any murder. I am incapable of becoming involved in such a  plan," he has said, expressing his willingness to appear before  police authorities to clarify the entire situation, because, he  said "I am innocent."    Betancourt said he did in fact travel to Honduras with Luis  Rene Quintero Gonzalez and Jose Arguello Hernandez at the  beginning of March. They went to buy spare automotive parts.  When they arrived in Honduras, he added, they were robbed at the  San Miguel market in Comayaguela and "left penniless." They  decided to go to the Nicaraguan Consulate. The ambassador gave  them 100 lempiras so they could return to Nicaragua. He  recalled they had requested a 90-day multiple entry permit.  After the robbery, he said, "I had to ask an uncle, who lives in  Honduras, for thirty lempiras to complete the return fare and  then travel back to Nicaragua alone."    He admitted meeting Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the alleged  informant, by pure chance. He met Jose Arguello Hernandez,  another alleged plotter, when they were cell mates serving time  at Esteli Penitentiary. Santiago Rivas Betancourt said he was  arrested last year for insulting a law officer. Unofficially it  is reported, however, he served time for illegal possession of  weapons and drugs. He also said he was a former member of the  Sandinist People's Army, where he served as a battalion chief in  the Army's 5th Infantry Company, in the country's first region.  Betancourt lost his left hand in a mine explosion, just before  being discharged. This happened in 1990, when he switched to  civilian life.    Unofficial reports state Luis Rene Quintero Gonzalez, the  alleged informant of the "plot," has an automotive body shop  near Bello Horizonte Rotonda. None of the mechanics working in  that area was able to give any information about Quintero. They  did say, however, the police had been there at 1830 looking for  the body shop and its alleged owner. A reliable government  source has confirmed to BARRICADA the police were on Quintero  Gonzalez' trail. They had not yet arrested him when we went to  press. Unofficial reports state Quintero lived in the  neighborhood of Fundeci, Managua. It was impossible to contact  him there either.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> HUGHES AIRCRAFT TO TRADE IN 1,000 OLD PCS FOR NEW APPLE, IBM COMPUTERS  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft Co.'s Ground Systems Group in Fullerton said Monday that it  will trade as many as 1,000 aging personal computers for discounted new Apple  Macintosh and IBM systems in a buyback program with Businessland, a computer  retail chain.  </P> <P> "This buyback program offers us a cost-efficient way to replace 30% of our  current systems, which are over 4 years old, with new systems at a potential  savings of close to $500,000," said Mary Howlett, Hughes manager of management  information technologies.  </P> <P> Hughes is one of the country's largest Macintosh users, and the Ground Systems  Group has about 2,500 Macintoshes currently in use.  </P> <P> The Hughes unit imposed a moratorium on computer purchases in May, 1989, after  an internal review showed that it had two PCs for every employee. The company  concluded that it had the right ratio of computers to employees, but it decided  to upgrade its computers after a study indicated that obsolete equipment was  taking a toll on employee productivity.  </P> <P> Apple officials said they are aggressively pursuing buyback clients who would  like to replace older PCs with newer models. Hughes said it will save more than  50% off the retail price of the PCs it purchases because of credits for used  equipment and volume purchase discounts.  </P></p>

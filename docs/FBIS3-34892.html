Following the meeting, Juppe told reporters that France would  continue to support the peace process. In particular, the  foreign minister said, France would contribute funds to the  Palestinians, in addition to the 500 million ECU's already  pledged by the European Committee.    [Begin recording] [Juppe] Yes, we have decided to implement  a new protocol of 60 million francs in 1994 for the occupied  territories. [end recording]    Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, who attended the  meeting, told reporters he believed the recent spate of terror  attacks could be better handled if the Palestinians controlled  the areas. Al-Husayni agreed that support among Palestinians  for the peace process had dwindled, but was convinced that  things could change.    [Al-Husayni] There is less support because nothing is  implemented on the ground. In the moment that there will be  implementation on the ground, I believe that the Palestinian  people will support. The Palestinian people stopped to believe  words and sentences; they would like to see something on the  ground. [end recording]</p>

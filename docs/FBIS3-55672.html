			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Lennart Meri signed today, in front of the  Riigikogu, the proposals by Prime Minister Mart Laar, so to  speak, concerning the government reshuffle.    In his speech, the president emphasized it was not what one  would wish, but it was compelled by this moment in the internal  and external political situation. In the words of Meri, an  exceedingly unsuitable time has been chosen for the government  reshuffle, because leading Estonian politicians should, at  present, give the main attention to the NATO and the U.S.-Russia  summit meetings, and not to the examination of, so to speak,  one's own navel.    The president regards the wish by the Isamaa [Fatherland  faction] to stay in power at any cost as the cause of the  situation that has arisen. The president expressed surprise  that Laar himself did not resign, but began a government  reshuffle. The resignation of Laar, in the opinion of Lennart  Meri, is in the interests of Isamaa itself. The Isamaa crisis  is a crisis for the prime minister. Meri appealed also for a  decisive expansion of the government coalition.    With that, the president has officially released Toomas  Sildmae from the position as economy minister, and appointed  Heiki Kranich and Toivo Jurgenson as finance and economy  ministers respectively.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER in stock index futures rose sharply as the June contract on the FT-SE closed above the 2,700 level after a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo. A positive mood was much in evidence early in the session as June opened at 2,712, up 15 on Friday's close. A squeeze pushed the contract higher, buoyed by speculation about a cut in UK base rates. The announcement of a cut at around 10am, however, led to a sell-off in June, as the weakness in gilts and the nervous trading in sterling both played their part in dampening the initially positive mood. Consequently, June hit a low of 2,683 at around 1pm, but recovered some of the lost ground as dealers moved to cover short positions just before the official close. June finished at 2,702, around 22 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover at 11,074 was high, with dealers reporting many trades done in large lots. In traded options, volume at 34,698 was up on Friday's poor levels. The FT-SE option traded a total of 9,104 lots. British Steel was the busiest stock option, with a day's total of 3,923 contracts. It was followed by BP, in which 1,517 contracts were transacted.</p>

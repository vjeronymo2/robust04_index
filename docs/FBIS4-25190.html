			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 7 (XINHUA) -- A school was  inaugurated here today for migrant laborers.    Co-funded by Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, East China  Teachers' University, and Shanghai Textile Workers' Trade Union,  the school will educate migrant farm laborers in the city and  aims to set up branch school in some districts and counties.    The municipal public security bureau says the city now has  nearly a million farm laborers, who work for the city's  building, municipal engineering and textile industry.    Almost all the building workers in this city are migrant  laborers and 40 percent of the textile workers are girls and  women from the countryside.    But the cultural and technological levels of these migrant  laborers are comparatively lower than the urban residents, and  many of them are illiterate or half-illiterate. Many also lack  consciousness of safety and quality standards.    So the school will give lessons on public order, laws,  morals, techniques and culture to these people from the  countryside in their spare time. The text books have been  written by East China Teachers' College.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Gold stocks lose their lustre: Central banks are cutting bullion holdings Gold mining companies are casting a nervous eye at the world's central banks. They are beginning to realise that the huge stocks of gold in the banks' vaults, which they hoped were permanently locked away for protection against some unimaginable disaster, are for sale after all. The industry's fears intensified last week when the Dutch central bank revealed it had sold a quarter of the gold in its reserves - 400 tonnes, equivalent to more than 20 per cent of all the gold mined last year. The world's central banks hold 35,000 tonnes of gold - a mountain that dwarfs annual production of about 1,750 tonnes. It represents a substantial potential new source of supply which threatens to depress gold prices further, even though they are already near their lowest levels for seven years. The Dutch bank sold its gold towards the end of 1992. It was following the example of Belgium's central bank which sold 202 tonnes earlier in the year. Canada's central bank has been steadily reducing its gold stocks for 10 years, selling about 10 tonnes a month. Between them, these three banks contributed more to total world gold supply in 1992 than output from South Africa, the biggest producer. 'The gold market has been transformed,' says Mr Andy Smith, precious metals specialist at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'For 150 years central banks built up a big buffer stock of gold which kept the price artificially high.' But in recent years forces for change have emerged. Most important, gold finally lost its formal role in the international monetary system when the US authorities stopped exchanging it for dollars during the 1970s. Central banks rarely change their policies quickly. But growing pressures on the banks from their governments to earn a return on their reserves have increased their willingness to reduce gold stocks which are earning no interest. Pressure to reduce bullion holdings has also increased because of the poor investment gold has represented. Mr Ricky Hall, assistant general manager of the Bank of International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, says that, even at a modest compound interest rate of 6 per cent, gold bought 10 years ago at Dollars 459.25 an ounce would be worth Dollars 823 an ounce instead of today's Dollars 330. Mr Smith, from UBS, estimates that if the reserves of the eight largest holders, which together account for more than 85 per cent of officially declared central bank gold, were invested instead in bonds at current international interest rates, they would yield about Dollars 20bn a year. Switzerland's reserves would yield more than Dollars 550 for each citizen every year. With this in mind, some central banks have started to 'mobilise' their gold by lending some to the market. Up to 800 tonnes of central bank gold is on loan to commercial banks and producers at any one time. Producers have been keen to borrow this gold because with interest rates typically only 0.5 per cent it costs much less than borrowing money, while the banks are willing to lend when they are sure producers will be able to repay from future mine output. Recently, central banks began offering 'call' options on gold. As these give the option holder the right to buy at a future date at a pre-determined price they indicated the central banks' increasing willingness to sell rather than merely lend. Another indication of such willingness has been the use of metal from official reserves to produce gold coins. Belgium, for example, began issuing gold Ecu coins in 1987. The first big outright sales of central banks' gold started last year. Until then, their total holdings had remained fairly constant. Mr Stewart Murray, chief executive of the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy organisation, says there had been little change in the 1980s. But he adds that 'the proportion of gold within total reserves has declined because of the explosion in foreign exchange holdings and a weaker gold price.' European central banks, which own about 40 per cent of the world's official gold reserves, have a special reason to reduce their gold stocks. Mr Smith points out that moves towards a single European currency would reduce the principal need for reserves - intervention in currency markets. As a result, many bullion market analysts have been predicting that some European central banks will seek to reduce their gold holdings before the implementation of legislation for a new European central bank which may require each EC member to deposit a proportion of its reserves with the institution. Such thinking seems to have been in the minds of the Belgian and Dutch central banks. Mr Smith points out that the sales did little to increase government income. Only a very small proportion of the proceeds is transferable to ministries of finance - and in both cases this represented less than 2 per cent of the country's budget deficit. The Dutch central bank said this week it had acted after 'several months of deliberation' so, says Mr Smith, 'this was not a panic sale. It was premeditated. It was strategic, not tactical.' Mr Smith believes central banks may become net sellers of about 700 tonnes of gold a year in the 1990s. He says: 'Selling gold will be just part of a day's work for a central bank, not an admission that the financial world, as investors know it, is about to end.' Investors in the gold market are unlikely to feel reassured.</p>

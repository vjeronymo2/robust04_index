			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Gold leads precious metals surge GOLD MADE further progress towards restoring its tarnished image this week and dragged other precious metals up with it. The London bullion market added Dollars 12 to last week's Dollars 5.30 gain in reaching a nine-month peak of Dollars 356.20 a troy ounce on Thursday. That was trimmed back to Dollars 355.75 an ounce at yesterday's close but traders were not dismayed; some attributed the selling to operators who had come late into the rally, others to Australian producers attracted by the relatively remunerative prices now available in terms of their national currency. The latest upsurge in the gold price has somewhat dubious origins, however, being the result of a concerted effort by some high-profile international financiers. It was revealed last weekend that Mr George Soros, the speculator who netted Dollars 1bn last September by betting against sterling and the Italian Lira, had bought Dollars 400m-worth of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest North American gold producer. The shares were bought from Lord Rothschild, the UK investor, and from aptly-named international wheeler-dealer Sir James Goldsmith. The latter revealed at the same time, moreover, that he had used the cash to purchase more than Dollars 300m of options to by gold bullion in the London and New York markets. The combined news 'had gold bugs coming out of the woodwork left, right and centre', commented one trader after Monday's Dollars 7.35-an-ounce price surge. Successive bouts of profit-taking later in the week did not dent the market's new-found bullish sentiment and many traders were still talking of a near-term upside target of Dollars 360 an ounce. Gold's buoyancy spilled over into other precious metals markets, with platinum ending the week Dollars 15 to the good at Dollars 386.50 an ounce and silver up 39 US cents at 435.5 cents an ounce, a 21-month high. The silver market remained more nervous than gold, traders noted, with wide price swings possible. Palladium, platinum's sister metal, had been the star performer of the precious metals market last week as its established upward price trend was underpinned by the announcement of a planned cut in Russian output. But it hung behind the others this time. Nevertheless yesterday's morning fixing of Dollars 119.50 an ounce was the highest for nearly three years; the afternoon fixing was 15 cents lower but still Dollars 1.60 up on the week. At the London Metal Exchange the copper market began with an attempt to consolidate following the heavy falls of the preceding three weeks. The line was held initially, as talk of labour disruptions resulting from Chilean and US labour contract negotiations helped to narrow forward premiums, but options-related and Chinese selling had re-established the downward trend by mid-week. However, a rally yesterday saw the three months price closing at Pounds 1,209 a tonne, up Pounds 12.75 on the day and Pounds 1 overall. By way of contrast, nickel market traders set out on Monday to build on last week's rally. But the upward move quickly ran into overhead resistance. The three months price peaked after adding Dollars 62.50 to last week's Dollars 235-a-tonne advance and closed yesterday at Dollars 6,005 a tonne, Dollars 167.50 down on the week. The announcement of LME warehouse stocks rises totalling 2,460 tonnes did not help the metal's cause. Lack of buying interest continued to weigh down the lead market and the LME three months contract closed yesterday with a Pounds 7.25 loss on the week at a fresh 6 1/2 -year low of Pounds 271.50 a tonne. But aluminium was firmer, reflecting trade and commission house buying encouraged by rumours of further output cuts. The three months quotation gained Dollars 21 on the week at Dollars 1,115 a tonne in spite of running into overhead resistance yesterday. A chart-based rally in the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) robusta coffee market was interrupted on Thursday when selling was prompted by Brazil's announcement that it would sell 600,000 bags (60 kg each) from its stockpile. Traders were sceptical about the announcement, however, as there was no indication of when the sale would take place or at what price, and the upward trend was reinstated yesterday. The renewed strength, which saw the July futures price rise to Dollars 915 at one time, was sparked by a technically-inspired overnight surge in the New York arabica market. But although the New York prices were holding their gains in late trading yesterday the London market once more found it difficult to move decisively above the psychologically-significant Dollars 900-a-tonne mark for the July contract, which closed at Dollars 903 a tonne, up Dollars 27 on the week. New York raw sugar futures edged further ahead, though there was no repeat of last week's surge. In late trading yesterday the July contract was quoted at 12.90 US cents a lb, up 0.09 from the end of last week. There was little response to news that FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency, had cut its forecast of the 1992-93 world crop to 113.01m tonnes from its January figure of 114.88m tonnes. Licht also reduced its 1991-92 crop estimate by 290,000 tonnes to 115.88m tonnes. London ceased to be a raw sugar futures trading centre yesterday with the expiry at 11:22 GMT of the May contract, the last remaining quoted month on London Fox's No 6 contract. Fox announced on April 13 that it was suspending trading in the No 6 contract because of declining interest.  ------------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------ tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium  +6,875 to 1,781,500 Copper     +3,950 to   392,325 Lead       +1,400 to   249,500 Nickel     +1,512 to    89,910 Zinc      +15,125 to   636,800 Tin          -195 to    20,350  ------------------------------------</p>

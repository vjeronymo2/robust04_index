			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Primerica shows 28% profits rise PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in second-quarter profits to Dollars 150.5m, due to a continued strong performance from its broking and investment banking subsidiary, Smith Barney. The recent slowdown in Wall Street business activity, however, meant that second-quarter earnings for both Primerica and Smith Barney were below the record levels achieved in the opening three months of the year. Primerica earned Dollars 220.8m in the first quarter, although almost one-third of that came from one-off sales of stock in subsidiaries. Smith Barney earned Dollars 42.4m in the April-June period, up 13 per cent on a year ago but well below the Dollars 56.1m profit made in the first quarter. Earnings from retail broking operations and its institutional investment banking business were strong, but lower than the previous quarter. The recent cut in US interest rates, however, is expected to boost Smith Barney's business as investors switch into stocks from lower-yielding short-term instruments such as bank certificates of deposit and money market funds. At Primerica's consumer finance services operations, earnings were 10 per cent higher than in 1991 at Dollars 47.5m, but virtually flat compared with the January-to-March period. Similarly, insurance services were little changed on the first quarter at Dollars 45.5m but slightly higher than a year ago. Primerica's figures were warmly received on the New York Stock Exchange, where the group's share price rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 in active trading. The Federal Reserve Board approved a proposal by BankAmerica Corp of San Francisco to indirectly acquire HonFed Bank of Honolulu and some of its non-banking subsidiaries, Reuter reports from Washington. HF Holdings is the third largest deposit-taking institution in Hawaii.</p>

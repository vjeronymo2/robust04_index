			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F> Anna Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- "Boris Yeltsin promises to  pay off debts to coal-miners in April," the Russian president's  spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told today's briefing in the  Kremlin.    The spokesman explained that "loss-making mines will be  gradually closing down with due regard for the social and human  factors." According to him, the so-called "miners' problem,"  which is so acute at the moment, stems from the bygone economic  system which has become completely obsolete. Kostikov also  reported that President Yeltsin intended to meet the government  for talks on this issue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of an unspecified number of installments of an </F> "abridgment" of an interview with Kurdish Workers Party, PKK,  leader Abdullah Ocalan by reporters Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip  Duran, Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 March]    [Text] Question: In your message to the  International Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan, you proposed  a cease-fire for the second time. You also agreed to abide by  all the decisions of the conference. Why?    Ocalan: I felt a need to repeat this cease-fire  offer to clear ourselves of responsibility. It was mostly  addressed to the Western public, rather than Turks; and was  announced partly at the request of our friends. I told them our  views were consistent, that nothing had changed. But they  asked: "Could you not put it in writing?" I told them I was  not afraid to do that, and in an act of modesty, I went as far  as to say I would abide by the decisions made by the conference.  The Western alternative shows interest in a democratic  solution, even a limited one. The West does not fully accept  the renunciation of our national identity, it is impossible for  them to deny a people's cultural identity. Therefore, do not  disparage my pledge that "right now I accept any decisions you  make." The result was clear from the start and I had to respect  it. I asked if it would have any practical results and could it  lead to other developments? It seems the decisions of the  conference will have a significant impact on the Western public.  Already, parliamentarians are increasing their support for our  proposals. Influential people from various parliaments  participated in the conference, and I hope it will influence  their governments. Diplomatic channels have already been  opened, including ties with the big powers.  <H5>  France and Germany Will Backtrack </H5>   Question: Germany and France joined Turkey last  winter in declaring your organization illegal and terroristic.  Do these new developments mean those countries are retracting  their statements?    Ocalan: There will be a clear renunciation of  these statements, and that will not be all. Why were such  statements made in the first place? Because they had an  important place in the plans of the United States and the West.  At one point, Mitterrand told Ciller: "We will make your star  shine." The meaning of this is very clear: "You take certain  steps and in return we will boost your popularity." Do you know  when France made this statement? A day before the True Path  Party Congress. Ciller needed some success, a great victory to  win over the congress. The West expressed their support for  her, and this is how the "star wars were won." Soon after that,  France and Germany made certain joint decisions with the  knowledge of the United States. They expected things of Ciller;  she had to take certain steps on the Kurdish problem. We were  aware of the West's inclination, and therefore we wanted to show  that we were not opposed to their policies as far as values are  concerned and that we were not opposing this on the battlefield.  Now, the West is returning to its original policy and is  abandoning the idea of "giving moral support Ciller's shining  star." Why? Because "she failed to fulfill the promises she  made." Ciller had long been under the influence of the special  warfare forces, and was acting as their mouthpiece. The West  realized this and asked: "What does that finger wagging by  Gures mean? Can he raise his finger against a prime minister?"  [reference to a newspaper photo of Chief of General Staff Dogan  Gures raising an admonishing finger over a sullen Ciller] The  West noticed this. Of course, this symbolically reflects a  reality -- she has come under the control of the Army. The  promises have come to naught and there is nothing to show for  it! Now, the West is angry at this. In addition to  backtracking, it has also withdrawn its support. As the system  requires, NATO still generally supports Turkey, but that is a  different matter. Here I am talking about this government.  Something new has arisen; my proposals had an enormous impact.  Just the way the cease-fire proposal last year created an  extraordinary effect in Turkey, the present one has generated a  far greater impact on the international level. I think that  this will put a lot of pressure on Turkey.    Question: The concluding statement of the  conference links the intractable Kurdish problem to the West's  policy of dividing up the Middle East and Kurdistan during and  after World War I. Is this new attitude linked with the PKK's  diplomatic initiatives, or with the democratization of the West?    Ocalan: Undoubtedly, Turkish realities foiled the  West's policies; this is evident. They are unable to carry out  their policies and have nothing left to say on the Kurdish  problem. In the past the approach was: "The Kurdish problem  cannot be solved by the PKK." For the last ten years, a Kurdish  solution without the PKK was the most fashionable. The United  States spearheaded this policy. The great difference is that  now they say: "This cannot be accomplished without the PKK."  This is a dramatic development; it is the achievement of the  year. The fact that the PKK has been accepted as a factor in  the solution will have repercussions. Another assessment of the  conference was: "We have made a great mistake by seeing the PKK  in this light thus far, we have had a mistaken view of it. We  should have realized that the problem cannot be solved without  the PKK. Our governments wanted to isolate the PKK and they  supported the war, which has led to much bloodshed. The West --  France, Germany, and the United States -- are responsible for  the bloodshed. We will pressure our governments to repent of  their historic sin on the Kurdish problem and for supporting the  12 September regime [the Turkish Government since the 1980 coup  d'etat]. Seeing that this job cannot be done without the PKK,  we will stress the importance of establishing contact with it."  The conference adopted decisions in line with this assessment.    Question: What path will your party follow after  the conference?    Ocalan: A period of diplomacy has now begun. The  friendly parliamentarians, influential persons, professors,  thinkers, and ministers are participating in developments and  will be able to meet with all the ambassadors. This is a new  trend, and I think it will intensify in April. This does not  mean that the PKK has fallen under the control of the West. No!  We are protecting our identity! We are really attached to our  independence and freedom. There are no concessions on this  issue! But on the other hand, we are sure it is senseless to  make enemies out of the West for no reason at all. The West has  its own values. Logic and democracy require that these values  be taken into account and unity be achieved around them. The  fanatical Turkish leftist and rightist circles consider that  "the PKK is collaborating with the West." No! The conference  decisions show the degree of Western support for Turkey. The  West is equally responsible for the bloodshed. It is a fact  that the West fought against us bitterly, and the United States  was the leading force in this war. Again, it was the United  States which supervised the tortures in Diyarbakir [reference to  Kurds detained in Diyarbakir prison after the 1980 coup]. For  many long years the United States supported plans to eliminate  the PKK. The October 1992 attack against us during the war in  the south [northern Iraq] was guided by the United States. The  West also kept silent during the latest bombing of the Zhalah  camp. As soon as four [Serbian] planes take off in Bosnia the  West shoots them down; but when 50 planes raided Zhalah they  approved of it. The region now is under Poised Hammer's  jurisdiction. This raid shows the extent of the support given  to Turkey. But now the West sees that it is responsible for the  bloodshed. We proved their responsibility, and now they now  want to back away from this policy. This backtracking is not a  bad thing. Naturally, we will again announce that we are ready  if they want to promote democratic and cultural rights and a  political solution to the problem. We will say: "We express  our agreement and compliance in advance" with any possible  solutions, as logic and democracy require, not as an act of  surrender or collusion as some claim.</p>

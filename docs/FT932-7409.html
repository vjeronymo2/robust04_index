			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: BBC's Business Breakfast - its audience and its objectives Sir, The Financial Times is regarded - rightly - by most people in business as a journal of record. It is unfortunate therefore that the review by Bruce Fireman of BBC's Business Breakfast (Arts: Television, May 19) should have drifted so far from the standards of accuracy and fair reporting which the paper normally sets for itself. First, let me correct factual errors. It is not true, as Mr Fireman says, that 'Business Breakfast has an average of only 199,000 viewers'. According to the industry figures, our audience ranges from 200,000 at 6am to 400,000 at 7am. The weekly audience reach - the number of people who tune in for some part of the programme - is around 1m. Now the distortions: It is simply not a fair description to say that we present national, international and local news, sport and weather, broken up with reports from our correspondents around the world. The non-business components account for about 18 minutes of an hour's programming. Mr Fireman glibly suggests that the presenters are arithmetically challenged because in our market reports there is occasionally a difference between the figures which are read out and those which appear on the screen. The explanation is simple - the data we are giving comes from a live screen which is being continuously updated. The presenter reads directly from the screen. The studio graphics system takes a little time to convert the figures into caption form. He says that we have fallen back on the idea of importing journalists as experts. We have not. But when it is clear that the most knowledgeable person on any subject is a journalist, we turn to that journalist. Finally, Mr Fireman charges us with failing to do something we are not attempting to do. He suggests that we should realise - as Earl Brian of the Financial News Network in the US did - that 'the real demand for a daily business programme was from the sort of people who sat around watching the screens in stockbrokers' offices'. He must be aware that the reason FNN went bust was because it failed to find a viable audience. While we are interested in being watched in the City, we are also concerned to address a much larger public by making business, economic and industrial news accessible to the widest possible audience.

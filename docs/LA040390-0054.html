			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING BOARD DROPS CHARGES AGAINST TRAINER STEIN  </P> <P> The California Horse Racing Board is dropping its case against Roger Stein, the  trainer who was suspended for six months and fined $2,000 after one of his  horses tested positive for cocaine after a race at Santa Anita in October of  1988.  </P> <P> The Stein case is the last to be dismissed by the board, which dropped charges  last year against five other trainers whose horses also tested positive for  cocaine. Those trainers included Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera, two of the  biggest names in racing. The three others were Albert Barrera -- trainer Laz  Barrera's son -- Bryan Webb and Tony Hemmerick.  </P> <P> The earlier charges were dropped after the board was advised by the state  attorney general's office that the cases were weak. The Stein case apparently  is being dropped for the same reason. Members of the board were reluctant to  discuss the Stein matter Monday.  </P> <P> Barrera recently filed a $25-million suit against Truesdail Laboratories, the  Tustin facility that handles the state's horse testing. Truesdail's contract  expires on June 30 and the racing board is soliciting 105 labs to make bids on  the new contract.  </P> <P> Stein, 36, has also filed a $25-million suit but it wasn't clear Monday whether  that would be dropped.  </P> <P> "I would have to see the order before I can comment," said Russ Iungerich,  Stein's attorney. "If the board has dropped the case, then justice has been  done, but whether we will go ahead with damages hasn't been determined."  </P> <P> A hearing before an administrative law judge, Amanda Behe, had been scheduled  for April 17 in Los Angeles. Stein, who said he was planning on introducing new  evidence, had opposed the use of Behe, who had presided over an earlier hearing  in the case and ruled against the trainer.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, the lab breached its contract a long time ago, when  it started coming up with all these positive tests that weren't positives,"  Stein said. "If the lab loses its contract, it's because they've fired  themselves."  </P> <P> Stein, who had gone back to training harness horses at Los Alamitos, said that  he would try to reassemble a thoroughbred stable.  </P> <P> "The last 18 months have changed my life," Stein said. "I'll never get over the  bitterness. Even though this has finally been dropped, once there are the  accusations, there's always going to be a lot of doubt in people's minds."  </P></p>

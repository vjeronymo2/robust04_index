			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 6 (AFP) -- Peace talks on  Bosnia-Herzegovina were set to resume here Monday morning [6  June], Bosnian Government Ambassador Mohammed Sacirbey said.    "All conditions are met. Negotiations on an overall  ceasefire will proceed this morning," he told reporters.    The mostly Moslem Bosnian government had earlier rejected a  resumption of talks because of the failure by armed Serbs to  withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) radius area around  the east Bosnian town of Gorazde, in defiance of UN demands.</p>

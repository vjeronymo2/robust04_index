			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Three entertaining series come to an end tonight. Aside from Christmas specials, and perhaps even the occasional non-Christmas special, we are assured that after 15 years Minder will end today. As ever the episode title is a cinema pastiche: 'The Long Good Thursday'. The story has Arthur Daley (Flash Harry, 40 years on from St Trinian's) going into the restaurant business with a nice little earner called Cosa Noshtra (8.30 ITV). The second series of Jennifer Saunders' comedy Absolutely Fabulous also comes to an end, with Edina, Patsy and Saffron remembering their time in the womb. This second series has not been as good as the first, but nor has it been as bad as some have said (9.30 BBC1). That is followed by Ben Elton's stand-up comedy programme The Man From Auntie (10.00 BBC1). BBC2 begins a series about Britain's most famous steeplejack, Life With Fred (8.00). We have been watching Fred Dibnah reducing tall mill chimneys to rubble since 1979. Now, with a new wife 20 years his junior and most of the chimneys gone, it seems that life is changing.</p>

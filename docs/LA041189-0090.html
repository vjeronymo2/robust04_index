			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: HOLLYWOOD MAY TAKE THE DRAMA OUT OF SETTLING DISPUTES  </P> <P> An era of labor-management peace in the nation's film and television industry  just might come out of last year's devastating writers' strike.  </P> <P> The corporate giants and tens of thousands of employees suffered such heavy  losses from the strike that industry and union leaders alike at last seem to  realize that it doesn't make sense to bash each other every time their  contracts expire.  </P> <P> The impressive unity of members of the Writers Guild of America shut down the  industry for 154 days, the longest strike in Hollywood history. It ended Aug.  5, but the aftershocks rumbled on till December, as the networks continued  using reruns until full production resumed.  </P> <P> The compromises that ended the acrimonious struggle left both sides claiming  that they were content with the settlement. But now they talk earnestly about  avoiding another one.  </P> <P> Film industry workers aren't strike-happy. The Screen Actors Guild, for  instance, has had only five major strikes in its 56-year history. When they  come, though, they are dillies.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan exaggerated only slightly when as SAG president  in 1960 he said the actors' union is the only one that doesn't have to put up  picket lines when it strikes; the members just stay in bed and production  stops.  </P> <P> Even without strikes, though, the industry suffers when contract deadlines  near. Studios either race at great cost to complete films or don't start  productions that might not be finished before a potential strike.  </P> <P> The first harbinger of a less confrontational future came last month when SAG  and the American Federation of Television &amp; Radio Artists reached agreement  with the industry more than three months before the expiration of their  contracts.  </P> <P> The industry had already started going into its usual, expensive pre-strike  preparation when SAG Executive Director Ken Orsatti offered what sounded like a  hard-line contract proposal.  </P> <P> However, it was a realistic proposal that included concessions management had  already won from the writers and other unions. In return, the industry only had  to give some good but hardly exorbitant increases to the actors.  </P> <P> The industry accepted. The actors' pact was historic because never before had a  film industry agreement been reached so early. But two other factors offer the  real hope for less adversarial relations:  </P> <P> * Broadcast TV networks, the biggest buyers of films, are losing huge hunks of  their markets to pay TV, cable, videocassettes and independent TV stations. The  networks cannot rationally risk more market losses and so should put heavy  pressure on the studios to avoid another crippling strike if at all possible.  </P> <P> * Cooperative union-management committees are being created to discuss problems  as they arise and possibly resolve them before they reach a crisis stage and  become strike issues. Some unions have had labor-management committees before  but rarely used them.  </P> <P> For starters, the committees should deal with that perennial problem of  residuals, the additional money paid to actors and others when the films or  shows they work on are repeated or sold to other outlets such as  videocassettes.  </P> <P> Complex formulas are used to determine the amount of the residuals, and the  formulas vary. The one for sales to free TV differs from the one used for, say,  videocassettes.  </P> <P> As sales increase in one market and decrease in another, actors and others who  get residuals will certainly want to review the old formulas.  </P> <P> Why? Last year, for instance, so-called supplemental markets such as  videocassettes paid actors $29 million while sales of theatrical films to free  TV brought them $19 million. Eight years ago, the situation was reversed.  </P> <P> Revising the formulas might mean more money for residual earners, so why not  start now to work out solutions to that and other problems?  </P> <P> A peaceful future isn't assured. There are factors that might work against that  happy day.  </P> <P> Not too many years ago, movie moguls such as Jack Warner and Sam Goldwyn loved  to make barrels of money, but also loved making movies. Both of their joys  stopped when labor troubles halted production.  </P> <P> These days, corporate tycoons own conglomerates that include businesses other  than studios and networks. They may enjoy movie-making, but money seems to be  their primary goal. So if production is stopped by a film industry strike,  their income may be slowed, but money can still roll in from other sources.  </P> <P> That means they could afford to be hard-nosed about film industry union  contracts even if it means taking a strike.  </P> <P> Coca-Cola, owner of Columbia, could keep earning money from sales of soft  drinks and other products. Walt Disney's Disneyland, Disney World and other  non-film production operations would continue bringing in a bundle for Disney.  </P> <P> But these companies, too, presumably learned from the writers' strike that  there ought to be a better way to make money than battling with their  employees.  </P> <P> Some strikes may be unavoidable. The one that gained residuals was certainly  worth it to the actors, who have earned $1.2 billion in residuals since they  began in 1952.  </P> <P> But for now, at least, union and management leaders are talking about more  intelligent ways of settling their inevitable differences over who will get how  much of that huge money pie their joint efforts produce.  </P></p>

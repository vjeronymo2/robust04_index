			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The Treasury bond market seems likely to remain in a jittery mood this week. With the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee due to meet eight days from now, there seems little immediate cause for buyers to come back to the market - particularly with a wounded dollar and the Treasury's quarterly refunding this Tuesday and Wednesday. At least the chance of further price declines this week looks limited. A belief that the authorities will raise the Federal funds rate sharply, possibly by more than the 50 basis points, was already largely reflected in bond prices by last Friday night. The 30-year bond ended the week at a yield of 8.15 per cent, up from 7.95 per cent a week before and its highest level for more than three years. The only significant new data will come on Thursday, with the publication of the producer price index for October. (With the market closed on Friday for the Veterans Day holiday, the consumer price index follows next week.) This is widely expected to show only a modest increase of 0.2 per cent or so, if any at all, after a 0.5 per cent fall the previous month. However, last week's jump in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index suggests that producer price inflation could feed through into figures later this year.</p>

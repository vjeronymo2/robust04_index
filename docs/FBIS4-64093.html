			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Servicemen Association Chairman </F> Mikalay Statkevich, head of the public control commission for  presidential elections, by Taststsyana Lazowskaya; place and  date not given: "Job or Kebich?"]    [Text] Our paper has already reported that, at the  initiative of the Belarusian Servicemen Association [BZV], a  public control commission for the presidential elections was  established. BZV Chairman Mikalay Statkevich who heads this  commission has outlined its goals.    [Statkevich] I would like to note that BZV is not a  political organization, nor does it fight for power. This is  what determines our stance on the presidential elections. We  support all candidates who stand for democratic and patriotic  positions, and we have given our members the opportunity to  independently support this or that candidate. Perhaps the BZV  leadership has assumed a wrong stance. But we could not stand  aside during the elections, since the fate of our country --  which, as we believe, is controlled by the Mafia -- depends on  the election returns, which are the last chance to eradicate  this evil in a peaceful way. Knowing unpopularity of the ruling  circles' main candidate for the presidential office -- Mr.  Kebich [Belarusian prime minister] -- as well as of possible  violations of the law and fraud during the elections, BZV came  up with the initiative to establish a public control commission.  The initiative was supported by 14 organizations, who had  nominated seven candidates for the presidential office. Some of  them, as the saying goes, have already dropped out of the race.  Nevertheless, these organizations have confirmed their  membership in the commission, whose main goal is to ensure  honest elections.    [Lazowskaya] Mikalay Viktaravich, the commission has  already been operating for quite a while. Obviously, its  members have already learned about certain violations of the law.    [Statkevich] We have been receiving a great many reports  about them. The lion's share of them concerns one of the  candidates -- Mr. Kebich.    [Lazowskaya] Apparently, there is no point in listing  every case of fraud. Nevertheless, could you outline the  methods used.    [Statkevich] First of all, this concerns using state  administration bodies to collect signatures, including abuse of  office and moral pressure on state organizations' workers. The  commission members know of cases where pensioners were not paid  their pensions, kolkhoz workers -- their wages, and that workers  and clerks were threatened with layoffs should they refuse to  sign the petitions for Kebich.    In Zhlobin, for instance, the following case took place: A  teacher joined [former Supreme Council Chairman] Stanislaw  Shushkevich's team at his own initiative. However, he learned  later that his name was included in the list of signatures  collected by the prime minister's initiative group. Thus, the  law was violated.    I can also say a few words about the situation in the Army.  Only representatives of the Council of Ministers chairman's  team have the right to canvass and collect signatures among  servicemen. Activists from Comrade Novikaw's [Communist Party  leader] team also obtained the right to do so, but a little bit  later. Yet, despite their commanders' orders, soldiers do not  always sign the petitions for the aforementioned people. It so  happened that a commander himself is collecting military  identification cards from his subordinates and placing the  signatures in support of a candidate.    [Lazowskaya] The electoral battle continues. In my  opinion, new facts of violating the law are still to appear. Is  the public control commission predicting them? What measures  are being taken to prevent them?    [Statkevich] According to our sources, the most widespread  instance of fraud will be the practice of oblast commissions'  not registering voting ballots. Local commissions' attempts to  fill out ballots in pencil may become another kind of violation,  all the more so since the law does not say anything about it.    Additionally, in rural areas, there is a widespread practice  of dropping ballots into boxes delivered directly to houses,  which gives to people the opportunity to plant extra ballots.    During a meeting between a delegation of the public control  commission and the Central Electoral Commission Chairman  Abramovich, we shared our concerns in this regard. Alyaksandr  Mikhaylavich [Abramovich] assured our representatives that there  will be lists of people who want to vote at home. I would like  to point out that our observers will monitor this.    Mr. Abramovich also stated that accountability is envisioned  for forging ballots. If the Central Electoral Commission learns  of such incidents, the case will be handed over to an attorney's  office.    I would like to add that BZV will carefully monitor the  election results. Those electoral commission chairmen who  commit any violations, hoping that the victory of their favorite  candidate will wipe everything out, will be punished in the most  severe manner.</p>

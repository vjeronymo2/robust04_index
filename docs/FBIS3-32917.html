			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 15  February.    Panama Stock Market Manager Roberto Brenes has disclosed to  LA PRENSA that transactions on the domestic stock market  amounted to approximately $203 million in 1993. Brenes  explained that this figure surpassed expectations by more than  $50 million. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 11A)    In its preliminary assessment of regional economies, the  Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) reported that  during 1993, Panama maintained its trend toward growth (5.5  percent) but at a slower pace than in the previous two years.  According to the report, Panama's economic expansion was  attributed to active investments and, to a lesser extent, on  consumption which showed a moderate increase. The construction  sector registered a growth of nearly 40 percent. Farm  production dropped because of a reduction in the harvest of  plantains, sugar, and tobacco. The ECLA report added that  unemployment dropped from 13.6 percent in 1992 to 12.4 in 1993.  (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 11A)    Agricultural Development Minister Cesar Pereira Burgos has  reiterated that the closing of silos to the Melo, Fidanque, and  Toledano poultry firms for an indefinite period of time is due  to their alleged illegal import of 50,000 quintals of corn from  the United States. Last Monday, President Guillermo Endara  expressed disagreement with this corn import, ordered the  closing of the silos, and banned the unloading of soy beans from  a ship that docked at Balboa port. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 2A)    A Canadian-Panamanian mining consortium will invest more  than  $300 million in the exploitation of a "polymetallic" mine whose  reserves are estimated at $20 billion. Such a project will  generate more than 3,200 direct jobs during its full period of  activity. The Cerro Petaquillaa project, located in Colon  Province, is in the exploration process and is being carried out  by Minamerica Corp. jointly with Adrian Resources Ltd. of  Ontario, Canada.

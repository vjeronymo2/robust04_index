The  huge debt for nuclear fuel for them from Russia has practically  halted its deliveries and reserves are being used up. At No. 1  set of the South Ukrainian Nuclear Electric Power Station, for  instance, its reserves are enough only till mid-May, and at a  number of others for little more; and the Ukrainian press is  already sounding the alarm about the destiny of the republic's  nuclear power overall, even claiming that its nuclear power  stations are dying.    Is the situation really so alarming? I asked this question  of Nur Rashitovich Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of  Ukrainian Goskomatom. He explained:    [Begin Nihmatulin recording] The situation in nuclear energy  today is rather complex. We have worked fairly successfully in  the autumn-winter season, producing up to 42 percent of the  electricity throughout Ukraine. This is not because we raised  the power at our atomic stations. It is because conventional  power was forced to reduce generation of electricity owing to  nondelivery of oil and gas. About 30 percent of the capacities  were in reserve.    But we are feeling a terrible shortage of deliveries of  nuclear fuel. To date, we have not paid for fuel for four sets,  and if this situation continues we will be forced to take out of  circulation about 4 million kWh of capacity. That is one set at  the South Ukrainian, one set at the Zaporozhye, perhaps even a  second set at Zaporozhye, and lower the load on the Chernobyl  atomic power station.    Today, we consider that it is being resolved positively:  There is compensation for the strategic weapons that will be  sent off to enterprises in Russia, and on account of that  strategic weaponry fuel is to be supplied for our reactors, and  we hope that nuclear power will be alive and we will not have to  take out of circulation a single set of a single station.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 27 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Foreign  Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the United States should not  have made negative statements on the proposed East Asia Economic  Caucus (EAEC) until the East Asian nations had given their views.    He said the United States should first listen to the views  of  the East Asian nations.    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold  a meeting with East Asian countries soon to discuss the matter  officially.    When all the East Asian countries have stated their views,  then the other countries can give their comments, he said after  receiving the Russian minister of culture, Yevgeniy Sigorov, and  secretary general of the Libyan People's Congress on Foreign  Affairs, Saad Mujabar [title and name as received], here Monday.    He said whatever proposal about EAEC now was still at ASEAN  level and as such it was not necessary for any country outside  East Asia to make any comment on the matter.    Abdullah said the U.S. should realise that EAEC was not a  conspiracy against the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  or the U.S.    On the other hand, he said, EAEC would be consistent with  APEC and would complement the efforts of APEC, while the U.S.  was seen as a friend in which Malaysia and ASEAN had many common  interests.    He said ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, the  Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, was holding to  the statements made U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and Japanese Foreign Minister Kabun Muto in Singapore last July  that they did not oppose the proposal for the EAEC and were  prepared to continue to discuss the matter.</p>

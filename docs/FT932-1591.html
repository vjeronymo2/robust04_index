			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Mining group calls pit sale plans 'a farce' NSM, the private mining group, yesterday condemned the government's plans to privatise British Coal as a 'farce' and said it would not bid for any of the 20 pits put out to tender under the present rules. The company was previously thought to be a likely bidder for some of the mines. Its decision to keep out of the privatisation process is a further blow to the government's plans to sell 20 of British Coal's pits. Last month the Young Group, the independent mining company, said it was withdrawing from the tender process. Mr John Jermine, NSM chief executive, said: 'No one in their right mind is going to buy the pits put out for tender by British Coal. 'The way the process is being conducted shows how privatisation of the industry has become a farce.' The tender documents for the first four pits have recently been sent to prospective buyers. Although NSM is heavily debt-laden, with borrowings of more than Pounds 80m, it was seriously considering buying some of the pits after its reorganisation last year. Mr Jermine said the British Coal documents contained such punitive demands that he believed the corporation remained intent on closing them. He described Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, as acting as the 'government's receiver'. As things stand, Mr Jermine has ruled NSM out of bidding for any other of British Coal's pits put out to tender. He identified four main clauses in the privatisation documents which he believed made it financially unrewarding for any private company to bid for the mines: British Coal is selling mines which have no market for their coal. It is not clear how much the private sector will have to pay for subsidence in the pits put out to tender. Restoration of the pits after the mines have been exhausted could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. British Coal has not made clear how it plans to use the subsidy from the government. Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, is considering bidding for some of the 20 pits, although not for any of the first four. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, recently said he would bid for up to 11 pits in the belief that British Coal's concentration on the electricity supply market leaves gaps in other markets.

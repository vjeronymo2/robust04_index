			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / President's work in progress: In his first 100 days in office, Clinton has seemed determined to prove government can make a difference The rush to judgment is now a permanent sprint. Bill Clinton's presidency was pronounced irrevocably dead - and alive - even before he assumed office, in its first days and round the clock, on the half hour, ever since. This has been more than usually evident this week, with 86 dead in the ashes of a religious fanatic's fortress in Texas, a jobs bill killed by 43 obdurate Republican senators and with a nation now conditioned to demand to know who was at fault. But a presidency - as well as the political and national contexts in which it operates - is a permanent work in progress. Hindsight can always identify watersheds - Jimmy Carter's 'malaise' speech in the summer of 1979 and George Bush's approval of the 1990 budget act increasing taxes can now be said to have definitively marked the beginning of the end of their presidencies. But Mr Clinton's first 100 days, a mere one-fifteenth of his first term and one-thirtieth of what he might serve, are only up next week. Had he promised a rose garden, he would by now only have been able to deliver a few buds. But even these demonstrate the enormous gulf between Mr Clinton and his predecessor, above all domestically. Mr Bush thought everything could be set to rights by a balanced budget amendment, the line item veto and a conservative Supreme Court, of which he had only the latter and then not consistently. It is, on the other hand, hard to imagine a problem, no matter how small, to which Mr Clinton could not come up with a programmed solution and even a means, probably a tax, to pay for it. And he will get the chance substantially to reshape the nation's highest court. Government, in the Clinton doctrine, can make a difference. It may, as he frequently says, have to 'get by on less', and its pockets, even in the great cause of aiding Russian reform, may not be too deep. But this does not invalidate its mission to lead by example and, where necessary, to intervene. Thus, the first 100 days have been phenomenally busy. The single great achievement has been the passage by Congress of the broad outlines of the plan to cut the budget deficit substantially over the next five years. The truly hard parts - enacting specific tax increases and cutting spending programme by programme - still lie ahead, but the fact remains that for the first time since 1985 a president has proposed a budget that is not automatically 'dead on arrival' on the steps of the Capitol. It is even possible that Congress will improve on it and cut spending even more. But this has not been all. Also at home, Mr Clinton, under his wife's direction, has got stuck into the momentous issue of healthcare reform, with serious proposals due perhaps next month. He struck down Republican restrictions on abortion and in the labour market, obtained a family leave bill, committed himself to ending the ban on homosexuals serving in the military, instituted easier bank lending to small businesses, inserted the government into technological research and development, set up a civilian national service corps, mediated in the trees-versus-spotted owls dispute, promised to sign the international bio-diversity treaty, and more besides. He has run a thousand hares already and if few are radical in themselves the collective impression is of a man determined to change the way the country looks at itself and what it thinks it can do for itself. It is an agenda as ambitious as the ideological Reagan revolution it is intended to reverse. All it lacks is the single-minded focus of the first Reagan term, opposition to which was made in any case almost impolite by the president's own brush with an assassin's bullet. There have been setbacks, the most telling of which was this week's defeat of the jobs bill at the hands of a Congress run by Democrats. This was not supposed to happen in the first flush of Clinton's presidency and so soon after the great budget victory. The package may be dismissed as economically insignificant - at Dollars 16bn it is one-tenth of the size of that just proposed by Japan - but its demise in its proposed form serves as a potent reminder to the new president that working on Congress is a full-time occupation. Successful presidents instil a mixture of fear and respect into Congress. So far Mr Clinton has earned respect for his marketing abilities but has not generated fear. He was unable to scare off the Republican filibuster, itself a remarkable display of solidarity by a party in search of a role and nervous of being blamed for yet more gridlock. Somehow the White House has to learn to overcome its understandable dislike of Republicans such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a man with the voice of a dentist's drill and a personality to match, and come to terms with the crafty minority leader, Senator Bob Dole, so adept at making trouble if not courted or cowed. As a very practical politician, Mr Clinton should know about compromise. Not that the Democrats are necessarily much easier, especially the new, independent-minded freshman class. Of the barons, Mr Clinton already has his hands full with the resentful Sam Nunn of Georgia on the gay question. Even George Mitchell, the faithful majority leader, Pat Moynihan, of the finance committee, and Dan Rostenkowski, powerful chairman of the House ways and means committee, have started muttering disapproval about value-added taxes and investment credits. Nor has he yet found cruising speed with another important Washington institution with the power to wound - big media. The fact that he has held only two formal presidential press conferences so far puzzles many because Mr Clinton is so articulate when thinking on his feet, so much the stimulating contrast to the men who went before him. Press relations with George Stephanopoulos, the smart and influential communications director, are frequently fractious, while lesser White House lights, schooled by last year's electronically sophisticated election campaign, point out with scorn that it is now technologically easier than ever to bypass the Washington media establishment to get targeted messages across, which is exactly what Mr Clinton does all the time. Indeed Mr Clinton is still playing pretty well in the heartland through his public speeches and other appearances, which repeatedly display his extraordinary ability to explain the complex in comprehensible and sometimes moving terms. He is also making some serious friends at the state and local government levels, not simply by loosening the federal purse strings but by actively encouraging the sort of policy innovation that he feels appropriate for all forms of government. This should be no surprise, given his record in Arkansas and his recruitment to his cabinet of several members known for their state, not federal, experience. But going over the head of Washington, where much policy and even more comment is minted, is risky, and in the capital his administration has already been stretched painfully thin. At the last count he had nominated barely a third of the approximately 3,500 senior political appointments in his fief and many of these had still not been confirmed in office, a handful because of the typically mischievous delaying tactics of Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative curmudgeon. But the real reason why this administration is barely formed is the determination of the White House (not the cabinet secretaries themselves) to follow the president's instructions and form a government that 'looks like America' in its ethnic, gender and geographic diversity, all minus skeletons such as illegal nannies in their closets. The net result has been much resentment, some ridicule and, worse, the occasional acute embarrassment. Whole departments, most obviously Justice, have been mostly run by brand new cabinet officers assisted by Republican hold-overs, unaccountable political advisers and career civil servants without clout. This week's denouement in Waco found Janet Reno, the attorney-general fresh out of Miami and in office for barely a month, very short of institutional help, apart from a beleaguered FBI director assumed to be on the way out. She was admired for immediately taking full responsibility, Mr Clinton rather less so for waiting a day to say the buck stopped on his desk. From the outset it was clear that Mr Clinton, though comfortable in a collegial environment, intended to take most of the big decisions himself. He was involved, endlessly, in the nitty-gritty of the deficit reduction plan, is becoming more immersed in healthcare and will take nobody's recommendation on trust for the vacant Supreme Court nomination, especially after two botched attempts to find an attorney-general. Cynics point out that the last president to try and do everything himself was Jimmy Carter. Foreign policy clearly interests Mr Clinton, as it does every president, and his maiden voyage in it, to Vancouver with Boris Yeltsin, showed him at his subtle best, artfully disguising that the Russian president was the supplicant by apologising for submarine collisions and old but extant US anti-Soviet trade laws. His speech before the summit, explaining why aid to Russia was in the US vital interest, was among his most thoughtful. But, mostly, the unwavering Clinton's external message is that US national security in the post-cold war era must increasingly have a predominant economic component, and his own involvement appears all the greater when this element is to the fore - in developing US competitiveness, pursuing more vigorous market-opening trade policies and assisting Russia. In contrast to Mr Bush he appears to take no particular comfort in the company of foreign statesmen, entertaining them either to businesslike lunches or, in the case of Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, to a very pointed lecture on the way the world had changed. With the additional current exception of Bosnia, Mr Clinton has chosen to leave most of the rest of routine foreign policy to his subordinates, under Warren Christopher, the very capable secretary of state, while the domestic agenda is being pursued. This neat division does not always work. The Vancouver summit and its Tokyo follow-up also preoccupied Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, who knows more about twisting arms in Washington than anyone. There was no one of equivalent clout left behind to lobby for the jobs bill. Mr Clinton seems perfectly comfortable in the presidency, relishing its challenges, and the nation more accustomed to him in it, even if it still harbours doubts about his character. The great question is whether this one-man band (and his formidable wife) can keep it up, especially if the domestic agenda, such as the budget and healthcare, gets shredded and if foreign affairs refuse to be neatly compartmentalised offshore. It could all end in tears, but for the moment, and for the next 100 days, too, there is going to be more going on, for better and for worse, in America and its capital than most other places, much of it because of Bill Clinton. That would not have been predicted under George Bush.</p>

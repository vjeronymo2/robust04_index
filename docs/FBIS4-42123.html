			<p>BFN     [Text] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi made some  provocative remarks from the floor of the Conference on  Stability in Europe, being held in Paris. Serreqi spoke about  the extreme nationalist stance taken by Greece, which is  affecting the Greek minority in Albania and described the  guidance, as he put it, given the North Ipirus citizens as  unacceptable.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou, who met with  Serreqi on the sidelines of the conference, reacted strongly.  Papandeou protested the Albanian foreign minister's remarks and  against the arrests of North Ipirotans. Serreqi denied that any  arrests had taken place.    Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos and  Papandreou  described Albania's stance as paranoid. The Athens Television  Network correspondent in Gjirokaster reports that more North  Ipirotans were arrested last night and today, and were taken to  court.</p>

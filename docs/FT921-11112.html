			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Environment on directors' agenda COMPANY BOARDS of directors expect to devote more time to environmental issues, according to an Institute of Directors survey published yesterday. Almost half the directors questioned said their boards spent no time at all on environmental issues. However, 61 per cent believed that over the next five years environmental issues would become matters for board decisions. Compliance with legislation was seen by the majority of companies as the main driving force for their interest in environmental issues, with social responsibility a close second. Twenty-two per cent of directors said their company already had a formal environmental policy.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH CAROLINA STATE IS PUT ON NCAA PROBATION;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TWO-YEAR PENALTY WILL KEEP THE WOLFPACK FROM APPEARING IN  NCAA OR NATIONAL INVITATION TOURNAMENTS THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> The NCAA put the North Carolina State basketball program on probation Tuesday  for two years because of violations involving the sale of complimentary tickets  and sneakers during the past four seasons.  </P> <P> The sanctions will keep the Wolfpack out of this season's NCAA or National  Invitation tournaments.  </P> <P> Jim Valvano, who resigned recently as athletic director as a result of an  internal investigation, will remain as basketball coach, interim Chancellor  Larry Monteith said at a news conference in Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> "The report pinpoints institutional responsibilities and does not single out  individual responsibilities," Monteith said. "Therefore, no personnel actions  are called for at this time, nor will any be taken based solely on this report.  However, I will continue my evaluation of the men's basketball program."  </P> <P> Besides ordering the postseason ban, the NCAA concurred with the school's  self-imposed sanctions resulting from the internal investigation: no off-campus  recruiting for a year, no paid recruiting visits for a year and a limit of 12  basketball scholarships, instead of the customary 15, during each of the next  two academic years.  </P> <P> The NCAA suspended a sanction that would have kept the school's team off live  television for a year because of "mitigating circumstances."  </P> <P> The school also will not be required to return any of its $1.7-million share of  NCAA tournament revenues during the past four seasons.  </P> <P> The NCAA said it did not impose harsher penalties because the school "undertook  corrective and punitive actions" before the hearing.  </P> <P> North Carolina State will be allowed to participate in the ACC tournament.  Commissioner Gene Corrigan said the conference voted Tuesday to allow the  Wolfpack in.  </P> <P> The NCAA cited North Carolina State officials' prompt reporting of alleged  violations to the NCAA and cooperation in the investigation after a book jacket  for author Peter Golenbock's book, "Personal Fouls," had become public.  </P> <P> Valvano said that being barred from the NCAA tournament was "as serious a hurt  and blow as I have had personally in my life." But despite the loss of  potential revenues -- the tournament brought North Carolina State $707,000 last  year -- he said, "We accept the NCAA findings and its punishment."  </P> <P> The infractions committee said that, although North Carolina State did not gain  "a competitive advantage" from its transgressions, the case was major because  of the lack of institutional control or monitoring and because the violations  were "not isolated or inadvertent."  </P> <P> The NCAA cited "as many as 650" instances of improper use of complimentary  tickets, which are limited to family members, fellow students and teammates'  family. The NCAA said that several team members during the 1985-86, 1986-87 and  1987-88 seasons each received a total of more than $1,000 in value for the  complimentary tickets.  </P> <P> They sold for as much as $150 each, and players also traded them for stereo  equipment and other items. The NCAA concluded that some of the team's managers,  at the urging of players, changed the names on the complimentary list shortly  before games began.  </P> <P> Regarding sneakers, the NCAA said that "excessive numbers of shoes" were made  available to basketball players, "with little or no effort to keep track of the  shoes" by the school. Some players sold them to other athletes and fellow  students, according to the NCAA, and several players exchanged the shoes,  valued at $75 a pair, at a local sporting good store for other shoes and  apparel of equal value.  </P> <P> "In this case, the failure to exercise institutional responsibility concerned  matters of omission, such as the absence of adequate compliance monitoring  systems and slow responses to correct practices and procedures that the  institution and its then director of athletics . . . should have recognized as  fraught with potential for rules violations," the infractions committee  concluded.  </P> <P> The NCAA also cited four secondary violations, involving free meals, lodging  and transportation, but said those violations had no impact on the sanctions  imposed.  </P> <P> Valvano, who coached the Wolfpack to the 1983 NCAA title, has a clause in his  contract that provides him with a $500,000 payoff if the university fires him,  unless he is directly linked with an NCAA rules violation. Becky French, the  university counsel, said there is nothing in the NCAA findings that would  exempt the university from having to make such a payoff at this time.  </P> <P> "Personal Fouls" claimed that grades had been changed and that positive drug  tests had been kept secret to keep players eligible. The major area of the  internal investigation turned out to be academic abuses, however, an area not  covered by the NCAA.  </P> <P> "Even if the NCAA had not found any problem with shoes or tickets, there's  still the overriding concern identified in our report in August about the abuse  of academic rules and regulations," said Art Padilla, vice president for  academic affairs for the University of North Carolina system. "This is being  addressed forcefully by the institution."  </P> <P> Golenbock said in a telephone interview from Pompano Beach, Fla., with the  Associated Press that he was surprised that the NCAA had focused on players  instead of "the tandem of Valvano and former chancellor Bruce Poulton."  </P> <P> "I think the book made its impact and I'm pleased about that," Golenbock said.  "And I'm pleased for my sources who had the guts to speak out."  </P></p>

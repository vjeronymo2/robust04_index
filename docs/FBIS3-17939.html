The talks were chaired by Russian President's special  envoy on the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict,  Vladimir Kazimirov. Deputy Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group,  Mathias Mosberg, and the leaders of the CSCE monitoring mission,  General Burg and Berkman also participated at the meeting.    The expert of Azeri delegation, Tofik Zulfugarov, told TURAN  that the mediator presented its draft of the agreement to both  parties.    The draft stipulates for cease-fire and liberation of  territories occupied by Armenia.    "It was difficult to find agreements with Armenia since it  does not wish to liberate Kelbadzharskiy and Lachinskiy regions  of Azerbaijan. The experts discussed the draft of the agreement  proposed by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The draft must  be reviewed by the mediator taking into account several  amendments and then will be presented to Azerbaijan's and  Armenia's top powers as well as to the leaders of Azerbaijan's  and Armenia's communities of Karabakh", said Zulfugarov.    Armenian experts insisted on liberation of a part of  Azerbaijan's occupied territories with exception of Lachinskiy  and Kelbadzharskiy regions. Those two regions will be liberated  if Nagorno-Karabakh exists as a sovereign republic.    Azeri party offered the opposite, that is liberation of all  territories occupied by Armenian troops and then Azerbaijan's  and Armenia's communities will decide the matter concerning the  status of Nagorno-Karabakh themselves. However, territorial  integrity of Azerbaijan must be maintained.    Last week [as received] Kazimirov's and Mosberg's missions  will arrive in Azerbaijan, reports Azerbaijan Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.</p>

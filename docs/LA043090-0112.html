			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. AND SOUTH YEMEN TO RENEW TIES AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS  </P> <P> The United States and South Yemen announced today that they are restoring  diplomatic relations after a lapse of more than 20 years despite U.S. concerns  that the Marxist country has aided terrorists.  </P> <P> The announcement, made simultaneously in Washington and South Yemen, came on  the day that the State Department released its annual list of countries that  support terrorism.  </P> <P> South Yemen was included on the list because of evidence that it has supplied  safe haven for international terrorist groups.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the decision to resume  diplomatic relations was made independently of South Yemen's record on  terrorism and was in line with the U.S. policy to have normal relations with as  many nations in the world as possible.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said, "We are pleased at this restoration, and seek a useful  productive relationship."  </P> <P> South Yemen -- known formally as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen --  broke relations with the United States in October 1969, accusing the United  States of meddling in its internal affairs. The restoration of relations comes  at a time when South Yemen and non-Marxist North Yemen are talking of the  possibility of political and economic reunification.  </P></p>

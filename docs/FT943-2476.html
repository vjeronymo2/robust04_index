			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / SA bank plans syndicated loan A South African bank is to launch the first syndicated loan by a South African company since 1985, marking an important step in the country's return to international capital markets after its first all-race elections in May. Rand Merchant Bank, one of South Africa's three largest investment banks, is to borrow Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) from a syndicate of international banks within the next two weeks, according to Citibank, the US bank which is arranging the deal. Although the amount is relatively small, larger deals are likely to follow. Gencor, the South African mining company, is expected to come to the syndicated loans market at the end of this year with a seven-year Dollars 537.5m loan to help finance the company's acquisition of Shell's Billiton metals and minerals business. These loans are emerging as South Africa seeks a debt rating from the international rating agencies, and follow the completion in July of the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company, a Dollars 300m deal for Liberty Life, the country's largest life insurance company. South Africa plans to tap the international bond market, when it has acquired a rating. Many international banks are keen to lend to South Africa which is viewed as a high growth area but which has been largely closed as a result of sanctions. In a syndicated loan, one or two banks arrange a transaction and parcel out portions of the loan in order to share the risk. Citibank, which is in the process of sounding out interest among other banks, said the loan will have a final maturity of one year with individual drawings maturing in 90 to 180 days. It said European banks are expected to be the main participants but also reported strong interest from the Middle East.</p>

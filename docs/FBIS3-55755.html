In his words, "the document, in particular guarantees of  Ukraine's security, is being drafted." He added that if the  document is not drafted before Friday, the Moscow meeting will  be consultative."    According to Sergeyev, the brief meeting of the U.S. and  Ukrainian presidents in Kiev on January 12 will concentrate on  the bilateral relations. "Ukraine and the United States want to  have balanced relations which should emphasize the economic  rather than the military and political sphere," he explained.    Sergeyev also explained that all treaties and accords that  the Ukrainian president would sign must be ratified by the  country's parliament.    The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet ratified START I with numerous  reservations. The treaty provides for withdrawal of nearly  1500, or 16 percent, warheads and 176, or 42 percent, strategiic  missiles from Ukraine.    Numerous national democratic deputies of the Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet have criticized the president's intention to sign  a nuclear disarmament treaty in Moscow.</p>

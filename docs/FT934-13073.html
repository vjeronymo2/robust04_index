			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Israel to ease conditions for Palestinians ISRAEL yesterday announced it was easing a seven-month closure order in the occupied territories in an effort to bolster support among Palestinians for its autonomy accord with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. However, the move did little to dispel the widespread Palestinian grief and shock over Thursday's assassination in Gaza of a leading member of the PLO, Mr Assad Saftawi. Israel's police minister, Moshe Shahal, announced yesterday that from next week all Palestinian women, men over 40 and children under 16 will be allowed to cross from the occupied territories into sovereign Israel. Doctors and Jerusalem city council employees will also be allowed in, he said. But despite requests from PLO peace negotiator Faisal Husseini for a complete lifting of the closure order, most Palestinian men will still be barred from entering Israel. The ban was issued after a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers and civilians last March, and Mr Shahal explained that it could not be completely rescinded because of continuing 'security concerns.' The easing of restrictions, combined with Thursday's agreement on a phased release of thousands of Palestinian security prisoners, were described by Israeli officials as 'goodwill gestures' in advance of next spring's scheduled start of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho areas. But the gestures have been overshadowed by the death of Mr Saftawi, whose funeral in Gaza yesterday attracted a crowd of mourners estimated at 15,000. A lifelong friend of PLO leader Yassir Arafat, Mr Saftawi was arguably the most prominent loyalist in the Gaza Strip of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction which dominates the PLO. But while Mr Sami Assaya, the official in charge of Fatah's Gaza offices, blamed Israelis or Palestinian collaborators for the killing, Palestinian sources and Israeli press reports yesterday insisted that Mr Saftawi was the victim of internal Fatah rivalries. In Paris yesterday Mr Arafat warmly thanked France for its political and financial support for Palestinian self-rule, saying Paris would have privileged relations with 'our new state.' On the second day of an official visit, Mr Arafat met parliamentary leaders in what he called their 'temple of democracy' and pledged that the Palestinians would follow French revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.</p>

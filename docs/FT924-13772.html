			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Filipino-Chinese students guarded as they leave classes Philippine police guard Filipino-Chinese students as classes were dismissed yesterday in Chiang Kai Shek college in Manila in a move to combat the recent wave of kidnappings, writes our Foreign Staff. Most of the victims have been Manila-based businessmen of Chinese descent, along with a number of Americans and Japanese, and other expatriates in Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Worried Chinese-Filipino traders are talking of defensive measures, including plans to set up vigilante groups manned by foreign mercenaries, and some families are reportedly packing up and taking their assets elsewhere.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Wired up - Reading matter It can lay reasonable claim to being the trendiest magazine in the world. What New Musical Express and Rolling Stone were to the rise of popular music, a new US magazine called Wired aims to be for the emerging world of multimedia. In the 1960s Rolling Stone and NME were essential for young rock fans who each week bought LPs to play on the mono record players in their bedrooms. Wired aims to be the essential accessory for a generation brought up with the personal computer, electronic games and e-mail. Launched in January last year, with 12 full-time staff and only Dollars 250,000 of capital, Wired's circulation has risen from 150,000 to 230,000 copies a month, mainly in the US. Its success rests on making the cyberspace world of the computer nerd accessible to the average consumer. It offers an informed and exciting guide to the new products, services and businesses which are being created by the convergence of computers, telecommun-ications and entertainment. The magazine's trick is that it approaches this often intimi-dating world from angles which will satisfy novices and specialists alike. Its apparently chaotic design borrows heavily from style magazines such as The Face. It has its very own grammar: each article ends not just with the writer's name, but also their e-mail address on the Internet networking system. Yet it's not afraid of being mainstream. It carries meaty articles which would grace a staid business magazine. Recent issues have included long pieces about the US government anti-trust case against Microsoft and the battle between MCI and AT&amp;T in long distance telecommunications, for instance. Jane Metcalfe, the magazine's 32-year-old president and co-founder explains: 'We wanted to make a magazine for really modern people living in a digital, electronic world. All these technologies can allow people to take power themselves.' She and her co-founder, Louis Rossetto, spent their savings and almost two years hawking the project around US publishers before they got their launch finance. Now they employ 52 people and sell in 26 countries. Wired is also about to go international in a big way, with a recent deal to start a Japanese language edition and rapid expansion planned in the UK and continental Europe. In the UK, Wired is distributed by CoMag Tel: 0895 444055. By Charles Leadbeater</p>

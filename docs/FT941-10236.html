			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Hoechst considers spinning off fibres Hoechst, the German chemicals group, may hive off its European fibres operations in an effort to cut costs. Hoechst is Europe's biggest polyester manufacturer and its fibres division had sales of DM5.1bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in the first nine months of 1993. Although profitable globally, the division is heavily loss-making in Europe. Any move to separate fibres from the rest of the company should be seen against the background of the 'extremely unsatisfactory' earnings position, the company said yesterday. Hoechst has already rationalised its fibres activities: last month it said it would cut 2,000 jobs, mostly in Germany. 'Almost all our competitors pursue their business in this sector via legally independent subsidiaries,' Hoechst said. News that Hoechst is considering the separation of its fibres business follows Bayer's lead. A new subsidiary company, Bayer Faser, will come into being on February 15. Hoechst denied that it intended to cut wages, but said a hiving off would cut costs. Mr Rolf Brand, chairman of the workers' council at Hoechst, said yesterday: 'We are currently working on a major reduction of personnel in this area and we will investigate whether it is sensible to establish fibres as a separate company.' Last year, Hoechst merged production of acrylic and viscose fibres into a new joint venture, Faserwerk Kelheim. Courtaulds is taking a 74.9 per cent stake in this, subject to regulatory approval.

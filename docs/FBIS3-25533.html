			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] A security situation in the self-declared territory  Somaliland is becoming a cause of increasing concern to the SNM  [Somali National Movement] Government. In spite of an ultimatum  to renegade militias to hand in their weapons, many have set up  their own checkpoints to extort money from travelers and last  night, an armed attack is reported to have taken place on the  residence of Somaliland's President Mohamed Egal. On the line  to Hargeysa, Raggi Omar asked the president what actually  happened.    [Begin recording] [Egal] What happened.... [pauses] I will  tell you exactly what happened. You know, this is Ramadan now.  People usually stay up late at night, you know, and some young  ex-militia who had had a very pleasant night and a lot to drink,  much more than was good for them, were driving in this kind of  car and, as they were passing the street before the president's  house, you know, the residence, one of them fired a shot at the  gate. The bullet went through the gate and grazed, just grazed,  one of the guards who were standing next to the gate, and then  they were chased and four of them were arrested and one of them  was arrested next morning.    [Omar] So what you are saying is that an attack took place,  but it is not as serious as might seem to be the case.    [Egal] They were just five young boys, you know, who had had  too much to drink, and as they were passing.... They really did  not come here to attack us. They were just passing along the  road. One of them, as they were passing the gates of the  Presidency, fired the shot.    [Omar] But some people might interpret it as being very,  very  serious because, as you say, the five men were ex-militias. You  have been launching a campaign to demobilize and decamp the  militias which are still out on the streets of Hargeysa and  other towns in Somaliland, and some of them have been very  unhappy about these efforts by you. Could there not be serious  sort of, you know, political undertones to the attack?    [Egal] No, I am afraid that is exactly what it is not. You  know, there were these young chaps who did not come here to  attack. There was no concerted and planned attack on the  Presidency. It was just these young boys passing along the  street and as they were passing one of them fired that shot and  then they ran away. Of course, we are in the middle of this  demobilization and disarmament, but it is not being done against  the will of anybody. We are doing it through persuasion,  through dialogue, through peaceful means. There are people who  describe themselves as opposition here. I do not know what they  are opposing. We are now trying to knit together a very, very  delicate fabric of a nation which has been completely destroyed.    [Omar] So you will continue to demobilize these soldiers  from  mounting these custom posts and taking money off people at  checkpoints and you will be sleeping very comfortably at the  Presidency this evening without worry?    [Egal] Yes, I had been sleeping last night and all the  nights  before that and I am going to sleep very comfortably tonight,  too. People might call me a bloody bastard but they will not  shoot at me. [end recording]</p>

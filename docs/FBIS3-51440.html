			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] Even though the Marines have already started working  in Juanchaco, the population still has doubts concerning the  North Americans' real intentions. We have followed the gringos'  steps in their everyday life.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Why did you come  this weekend to Juanchaco?    [Unidentified woman] Because I wanted to see what the  gringos had done. I wanted to see them and to see whether it  was true that they were here and what they had done. [end  recording]    Indeed, tourists to the area, whose numbers have increased  by  nearly 35 percent, are coming to see -- practically to supervise  -- the work of these U.S. soldiers, which for the people is  still a mystery. For the inhabitants, it represents a genuine  invasion.    The work under way in this lot, which is located  approximately 2 km from the urban area of Juanchaco, begins at  0700. Tourists and inhabitants of the area are denied access to  this place. Some soldiers operate machines, while others remain  on the make-shift landing strip that will service small  airplanes and helicopters. Supposedly, small aircraft will be  able to land here to bring materials that might be needed for  the little school and the health center.    Even while the U.S. soldiers guard this place, they enjoy  the  exotic sights of Colombia. The North Americans only speak among  themselves. They barely even speak to the Colombian soldiers.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you do here?    [Unidentified Colombian soldier] I provide security for the  gringos, follow them wherever they go, and check on them. [end  recording]    It is precisely these people -- the Colombian soldiers --  who  paradoxically have to prevent the gringos from coming in contact  with the Colombian press.    [Begin recording] [Reporter in English] Where is the school?    [Unidentified Colombian soldier, moving away from camera]  Miss, please. [end recording]    The North Americans' work ends at 1700, when they return to  the dock to leave for Bahia Malaga.    What these people are doing, or not doing, in Colombia is  still a mystery. The only thing that is true is that what we  have shown you is the daily routine they will carry out at least  until the end of February, when they very well could still be in  Colombia.</p>

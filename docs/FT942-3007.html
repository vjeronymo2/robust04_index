			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: BZW role in airports sale BZW, the UK-based investment bank, has been given the job of advising the federal government taskforce which is looking into the potential privatisation of Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, writes Nikki Tait. Although the possible sale has been widely flagged - BAA of the UK has been tipped as one potential buyer - the government has yet to decide how to proceed. There are 23 properties involved, ranging from international airports to small domestic 'general aviation' centres.</p>

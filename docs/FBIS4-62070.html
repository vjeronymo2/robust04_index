			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- The government  and National Bank of Ukraine are, in the very near future,  expected to issue a joint resolution making provision for a ban  on the circulation of foreign currencies as a means of payment.  "Notification about this will be given 60 days in advance,"  Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of the National  Bank of Ukraine [NBU], has told a UNIAN correspondent. The ban  is to take effect in the summer of this year. Viktor Yushchenko  made the following comment: "Fighting dollarization has always  been an element of national currency stabilization at a certain  point in the financial stabilization of the state. It is the  national currency having the exclusive right to circulation on  the market of the state, rather than the conclusion of contracts  in foreign currency being prohibited, that is at issue. The ban  will concern goods trade for foreign currency and will extend to  every single foreign currency."    The NBU chairman of the board recalled that at the third  attempt dollar circulation had been banned in Russia from 1  January of this year. In the Baltic countries, that had been  done a year and a half ago. In Viktor Yushchenko's words, "the  directive cannot achieve full prohibition, and even after a  legal ban the dollar is still in circulation in Russia." The  NBU chairman of the board did not rule out that the same  situation could occur in Ukraine. In his words, "it is hard to  imagine the French franc being in circulation in the Canadian  province of Quebec only because the majority of the province's  population is francophone." The NBU chairman of the board is  convinced Kiev is to retain its monopoly in currency policy  regulation. "The circulation of the Russian ruble in separate  regions and in Crimea in particular, is out of the question."</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: CONTENTS OF PAPERWEIGHT MAY CARRY HEAVY PRICE  </P> <P> Question: For years I have been using a paperweight on my desk -- a U.S. silver  dollar, which in retrospect I imagine was one of the few I ever brought back  from Las Vegas a number of years ago. However, on looking at it -- it does not  shine like the Vegas silver -- with a magnifying glass, I was surprised to find  it was dated 1799. Everything is clear to tread, and there is no mutilation. At  the Hollywood Library, only one book listed it, and it gave only the degrees of  grading or condition. Nowhere did it give a clue to any price value. Can you  give me a ballpark figure of its possible value? -- W.L.  </P> <P> Answer: The earliest United States dollar was issued in 1794. Certainly 1799 is  desirable, as are all of the early dollars. It's hard to believe that anyone  would transform such a coin into a paperweight, even in Las Vegas. It's  important to find out whether your coin is genuine. Many coin dealers can help  you with this, or you can go to a certification service. If genuine, your 1799  $1 is worth $300 and up, depending upon condition.  </P> <P> Q: What is the market price for the 1986 proof silver Eagle and gold Eagle  coins? How about the 1989 proof version for both? -- R.E.B.  </P> <P> A: Proof 1986 silver Eagles are now selling for about $30. Proof gold Eagles  for the same year are about $429. This is a popular United States bullion coin  that essentially will fluctuate in price along with the spot price of gold and  silver. With the passage of time, however, you can also expect it to become a  collector piece, which should add to its value.  </P> <P> The 1989 edition is being offered for $585 for the 1-ounce proof gold and $23  for the proof silver. Since its inception in 1986, there has been a drop-off in  Eagle orders. The Mint only produces as many as are ordered; in 1986, 446,290  gold proofs were sold. The number dropped to 87,133 in 1988. If the pattern  continues the Eagle could become a rather low-mintage piece. Only time will  tell.  </P> <P> Q: I have two gold coins: a $10 1906 Liberty and a $5 1913 Indian; also a 1928  Irish florin and several quarters, 1934 to 1944. I would like to know the  estimated value of these coins. -- J.R.  </P> <P> A: Your $10 gold piece is worth $225 and up; the $5 gold piece is $200 and up;  the Irish coin is worth about $12, and your quarters are worth 75 cents each  and up, depending on condition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> When you can't have the real thing, either because it's too expensive or too  rare, sometimes a reproduction will have to do. Paper money fanciers can  enhance their collections with a souvenir card (pictured) depicting the back of  the Series 1891 $1,000 silver certificate. Depicted on this card, issued in  conjunction with the recently concluded American Numismatic Assn. convention,  is an offset vignette from the Centennial Share Certificate of 1876. The card,  identified as ANA '89 Item No. 974, is $5.50; a postal service canceled version  (ANA '89 Item No. 975) is $5.75 from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Mail  Order Sales, Room 602-11A, 14th and C streets S.W., Washington, D.C. 20226.  </P> <P> Twelve of Israel's most important historic and holy sites are being  commemorated in a series of silver medals. Four of the medals commemorate  Jerusalem, while others depict Bethlehem, Nazareth, Capernaum, Mt. Tabor,  Armageddon, the Jordan River, Tomb of Rachel and Masada. These medals are also  available in gold, from $110 to $135, and bronze for $12 each.

The coin will have lower mintages than last year.  Only 2,500 four-coin sets have been authorized for worldwide distribution, and  1,500 two-coin sets containing the 1/4-ounce and 1/10th-ounce coins have been  authorized.

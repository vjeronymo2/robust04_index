Their voluble talk about "outflow of money" is totally  unfounded fabrication. It is a product of their persistent  intrigues against the DPRK and Chongnyon.    Their allegation that colossal funds amounting to several  hundred billion yen flow to the DPRK from Japan annually is  based on false materials provided by the modern Korea institute,  an anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon plot-breeding organization. This  is, indeed, a preposterous, trash which could be invented by  two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a lie.    They, above all, give am extravagant overestimation of the  number of Japan-resident Koreans visiting the homeland and are  misleading the public opinion with the talk that they have been  donating a large amount of money to the homeland. This is the  height of folly.    It is unimaginable for the DPRK, a powerful socialist  country, to receive money from Chongnyon, its overseas Koreans'  organization, and the whole world knows that the DPRK Government  has sent a large amount of educational aid fund and stipends to  Chongnyon for the children of Koreans in Japan.    As far as the joint-venture factories run by Korean traders  and manufacturers in Japan in the homeland are concerned, it is  a matter of their legitimate rights as businessmen.    This notwithstanding, the Japanese reactionaries are  misleading the public opinion in a bid to create the impression  that the DPRK is getting along with the "funds" leaking from  Japan. This is an intolerable insult to the DPRK.    The DPRK has owed nothing to Japan up until now. It has  lived and can live without Japan's help, and is able to live by  its own efforts.    Under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance we have  built  a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance  and self-reliance in national defence, not affected by any  fluctuation of the situation, and are proudly exalting its grand  might.    The Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK intrigue is an outcome  of the consciousness of crisis of those who are dazed at the  might and indestructibility of the anthropocentric Korean-style  socialist system.    In fabricating the preposterous "outflow of money" fiction  reversing the stark reality they seek an aim to tarnish the  international image of the DPRK, a highly dignified country, and  find an excuse for suppressing Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.    It is not a happenstance that they launched into a frenzied  anti-DPRK false propaganda at a time when the United States and  seditious forces were unhesitatingly driving the situation on  the Korean peninsula to an extremely dangerous, catastrophic  crisis on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the  DPRK.    Exasperating, indeed, is the despicable talk about  fictitious  "outflow of money" of the Japanese reactionaries who still do  not intend at all to make an apology and adequate compensation  for their disgraceful past in which they had inflicted  immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon the Korean people,  including the "comfort women for the army" issue.    Their talk about "checking" the "outflow of money", a mere  fiction, is a ridiculous hokum of those seized with  schizophrenia.    They must act with discretion, clearly mindful that if they  persist in intrigues against the DPRK, working in collusion  with the United States, no good results would await them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately forty comments were filed by aviation commenters, nine by the motor carrier industry, eight by maritime interests, seven by transit, three by pipelines, and two by rail. Forty-four of the commenters were regulated entities, eighteen represented trade associations, four represented unions, two were from consultants, and one was from a governmental entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost all the commenters supported reduction of the testing rate and the increased flexibility in tying the testing rate to the positive rate in a specified population. The commenters differed, however, on how low the rate should be and what positive rate was low enough to justify reduction. Forty-two of the commenters, including all of the aviation interests, supported a 10 percent testing rate, in some form. The Air Transport Association/Airline Industrial Relations Conference, for example, wanted a permanent rate of 10 percent for the larger commercial air carriers (Part 121 and 135 certificate holders.) Alternatively, they suggested that the Department set a testing rate ranging between 25 and 10 percent for the entire industry or airline segment, or adopt the three-tiered system in the alcohol testing rules. The Regional Airline Association, on the other hand, suggested that 10 percent of covered employees be tested annually for either drugs or alcohol. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York, the American Movers Conference, the Transportation Trade Department of the AFL-CIO, and the American Trucking Associations also argued for a 10 percent testing rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twenty-three commenters supported the NPRM proposal of a reduction to 25 percent. These included all of the marine commenters (American Maritime Officers, American Waterways Operators, Inland Steel, the International Association of Drilling Contractors, the Lake Carriers' Association, Sailboats, Inc., Sealand, and the Transportation Institute), all of the pipeline commenters (Columbia Gas, Enron and Questar), the Association of American Railroads, six motor carrier commenters (including the American Bus Association, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association and the Regular Common Carrier Conference), several transit commenters (the American Public Transit Association, the South Bend Public Transportation, and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority), the State of Michigan Department of Transportation, and the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace. In general, these comments reiterated and supported the arguments made in the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters, including the Substance Abuse Program Administrators Association, Substance Abuse Management, the Bay Area Rapid Transit, and Connecticut Transit supported maintaining the current 50 percent testing rate. They stated that the current rules are effective, that a reduction in the rate alone would not produce significant savings, and that DOT should explore other cost-saving alternatives. One transit system believed that a reduction in the testing rate by DOT would undermine local discretion to continue testing at a higher rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters suggested a number of variations to the reduction mechanism proposal in the NPRM. The Regulated Common Carriers wanted the Department to use a 2.0 percent positive rate benchmark for 25 percent random testing. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) had a lengthy and complex submission. It wanted DOT to lower the testing rate to 25 percent by January 1, 1995; drop to 10 percent if a motor carrier's positive rate were less than 1.5 percent; change the 2 year rule to 1 year; and randomly collect past data from carriers. ATA claimed that reduction to 25 percent would save the motor carrier industry $300 million per year with no adverse effect on safety. ATA surveyed 300 ATA motor carrier members concerning their drug testing experience in calendar year 1992. Of the 120 members who responded, approximately 75 percent of the responders began testing at a 50 percent rate. They conducted 22,577 tests with 271 positives, which equals a 1.20 percent positive rate. Twenty-five percent of the responders tested at a 25 percent rate. Of the 2,745 tests conducted, there were 36 positives, which equals a 1.31 percent positive rate. According to ATA, this shows that there is no significant difference in the positive rate based on 50 percent or 25 percent testing. It was not clear, however, why the respondents were testing at different rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eighteen commenters addressed the issue of what is the appropriate grouping for triggering a potential reduction in the testing rate. Thirteen commenters (including the American Trucking Associations, the American Movers Conference, the American Public Transit Association, the National Air Transportation Association, the Regulated Common Carrier Conference, all the pipeline submissions, and a number of smaller aviation and motor carrier interests) suggested the rates be determined for each company or operator. The Air Line Pilots Association and the Allied Pilots Association suggested that the rates be determined by job category. Several comments favored a breakdown by industry segment (e.g., intercity buses, aviation contractors, offshore mobile drilling units) or by state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the commenters were anxious to institute a reduction in the testing rate as soon as possible and to ensure that the testing rate would not be raised without good cause. A number of commenters were concerned by the relatively long time before there was any possibility of reducing the random testing rates in most of the industries. These commenters, therefore, wanted the Department to expedite or ``fast track'' the potential reduction in testing rates. Many marine and motor carrier commenters, for example, asked that DOT either randomly collect or specifically require reports of past years' data that employers are required to maintain. These commenters suggested that DOT should consider this retroactively-collected data to determine whether a reduction is warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were a number of comments on the appropriate number of years for lowering or raising the random testing rate. For example, several commenters strongly argued that DOT should allow the testing rate to be reduced based on one year of data. The Air Transport Association stated that an increase in the testing rate should be based on either 3 years of data that demonstrate a clear upward trend or a significant increase in any 1 year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters were concerned that recent changes in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug-Testing Programs, as incorporated in 40 CFR Part 40, will result in more frequent identification of the presence of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) on screening tests, thus leading to an increase in the number of positive tests. These commenters argued that the Department should make a special accommodation in the rules to account for this expected increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

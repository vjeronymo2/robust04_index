			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (INA)--AL-THAWRAH daily of Iraq  wondered about how long would the Iranian regime continue to  play the role of a guardian on Arab and Islamic affairs.    The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Ba'th Socialist Party,  said  in an article today that the regime, which faced an irritating  armed resistance in many of its major cities, districts and  villages was incapable of playing any positive role in the  region.    AL-THAWRAH added that instead of solving its internal  problems, rising from its messed up policies and its failure to  find suitable solutions for obstacles facing its people, the  Iranian regime intervened in the internal affairs of Arabs and  Muslims despite the harsh lesson it learned from its war with  Iraq.    The paper commented that the Iranian regime received a  similar blow when it attempted to interfere in Iraq's internal  affairs during the chapter of sabotage and hooliganism following  the 30-state aggression on Iraq.    The paper cautioned Arabs and Muslims against Iranian  attempts to intervene in their internal affairs through  spreading chaos and instigating trouble under false slogans  similar to what has been going on in Jordan and Algeria.</p>

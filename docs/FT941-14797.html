			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Prosecutors step up action against bribery Public prosecutors yesterday stepped up their purge against political bribery in the construction industry by arresting two senior executives of Obayashi, Japan's fourth largest contractor. The arrests coincide with the publication of government plans to reduce barriers to foreign competition in the construction market, including the much-criticised practice of bid-rigging. The two men arrested are Mr Koreaki Hagiwara, a vice-president of Obayashi and Mr Juichi Konishi, in charge of a branch office in the northern city of Sendai. They are suspected of paying a former Sendai mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, Y10m (Pounds 60,000) to get a contract for a waste incineration plant. The cash was channelled in late 1992 to the local branch of the then ruling Liberal Democratic party, prosecutors believe. Mr Ishii has admitted receiving cash from four other construction companies. Obayashi is the seventh leading contractor to be drawn into the widening net of the inquiry. It has become the biggest corruption scandal since the second world war, with the arrest of more than 30 people, including two regional governors and two city mayors. The construction industry is believed to have been a prime source of illicit funds for leading political parties, public distaste for which contributed to the LDP's election defeat last July after 38 years in power. The new coalition government is attempting this week to overcome LDP opposition to get parliamentary agreement on proposals to curb political funding and redraw the electoral system. Yet the Tokyo prosecutor's office, which initiated this investigation, has so far stopped short of arresting a national politician or bureaucrat. There is mounting speculation, however, that the office might soon hit a national target since the appointment late last year of the celebrated investigator, Mr Yusuke Yoshinaga, as prosecutor-general. The government's appointment of Mr Yoshinaga, a leading figure in exposing the Lockheed bribery scandals of the 1970s, is seen as an attempt to beef up the inquiry, which had appeared to be losing impetus. A former prime minister and two former cabinet ministers, on both sides of the house, are under suspicion, according to political commentators and lawyers in Tokyo.</p>

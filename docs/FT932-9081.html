			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Asil Nadir preferable to administrators in running company he created Sir, Given the endemic prejudice and hostility in Britain against Mr Asil Nadir, the absence of any balanced account in our press as to the reasons behind Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus was perhaps only to be expected. However, the plea from Polly Peck administrators ('Administrators call on Nadir to help strike deal on assets', May 13) for Mr Nadir to co-operate in the further dismemberment of the company he created is breathtaking in its audacity and hypocrisy. It is alleged Mr Nadir has misappropriated Pounds 30m of company funds, precipitating the crisis which led to the appointment of administrators. Yet, to date, the administrators have taken for themselves and their lawyers at least Pounds 16m in fees. From your report, the rump of Polly Peck's assets in Turkey and Cyprus would appear to have been owned through intermediate offshore holding companies which are strictly unaffected by the parent company's insolvency and of which Mr Nadir is either still a director or would seem to retain some measure of control. If this means these companies can now be wrested from the grasp of the administrators, I am sure I would be one among many Polly Peck shareholders who would welcome it. While there may be some doubt about Mr Nadir's stewardship of Polly Peck's assets, what is in no doubt at all is that UK insolvency law is a recipe for its practitioners to plunder an insolvent company's assets with impunity. Given a choice, I would on balance prefer our company to be run by the man without whom it would not have existed, than by people who create nothing, contribute nothing and do nothing except to trade for their own profit in the misfortunes of others.

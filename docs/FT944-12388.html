			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Gonzalez in row over corruption claims Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez was yesterday at the centre of a row over reports in the Madrid newspaper El Mundo that allegedly link his brother-in-law to a speculative property deal in Seville, home town of the Spanish Socialist leader. Mr Gonzalez was also seeking to distance his government from Swiss-born Italian businessman Mr Ferdinando Mach di Palmestein who was arrested in Paris at the weekend on warrants issued by Milan's anti-corruption magistrates. Mr Mach di Palmestein is reported to have acted as a middleman between the Rome and Madrid governments in Italian takeovers of Spanish companies. Speaking at a news conference in Casablanca on Monday, where he was attending the Middle East and North Africa economic summit, Mr Gonzalez fiercely denied allegations that his brother-in-law, Mr Francisco Palomino, a Seville businessman, had made Pta346m (Pounds 1.7m) last year when he sold an industrial estate that he had acquired in 1989 from an agency of the public works ministry. Mr Gonzalez said the allegations were a 'calumny'. He said the report on Mr Palomino's property deal was 'false and was published in the knowledge it was false'. The prime minister also said that press reports about Mr Mach di Palmestein's dealings with the Spanish government and the ruling Socialist party were part of the same 'campaign of lies and defamation' as well as an attempt to 'copy certain models from abroad'. Yesterday Mr Palomino said he had not been connected to the property company at the time when it had bought and later sold the industrial estate in Seville. But El Mundo printed documents purportedly signed by Mr Palomino that apparently link him to both the acquisition of the property from a real estate agency called Sepes, which is controlled by the public works ministry, and to its subsequent disposal at a high price to a subsidiary of the big domestic construction company, Dragados y Construccions. The new twist to the allegations provided by El Mundo's publication of documents could prove highly embarrassing for the prime minister. Mr Palomino was involved in considerable controversy during the 1980s when he attempted to develop coastal land close to a large wild life resort south of Seville.</p>

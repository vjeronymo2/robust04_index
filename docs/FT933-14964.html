			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Search for new NY Fed chief near end THE successor to Mr Gerald Corrigan as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one of the most powerful positions in international finance, is likely to emerge this week. Mr Corrigan, who announced his decision to step down in January, is due to leave on August 20. If the search committee fails to make a recommendation at Thursday's monthly meeting of the bank's board of directors, it will have to wait until August 19. That would not leave enough time before Mr Corrigan's departure for the confirmation of the candidate by the governors of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Three names have emerged as front-runners for the post, which is second only to the Fed chairmanship in importance in the US central bank system. But the selection process has taken longer than normal. One observer with a close knowledge of the Fed said last week: 'I heard that there was a real fight over this. Someone clearly had a rough time making up their minds.' The front-runners are: Mr William McDonough, Mr Corrigan's number two in New York and the official responsible for implementing Fed policy in the domestic bond market and foreign exchange markets; Mr Thomas Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; and Mr Gary Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Mr McDonough is tipped by most insiders to win the job. Others believed to have been considered include Ms Karen Horn, chairman of Bank One in Ohio and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve; and Mr Richard Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. In the past, the New York Fed president has played a key role in helping the financial system survive crises, including the October 1987 stock market crash.</p>

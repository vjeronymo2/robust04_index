			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TUC finds few deals on recognition at new plants UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday. Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU electricians' union. Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June last year, unions should tell the TUC about any single-union deal they are about to sign. Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s. He added that the TUC might support establishing the size of union membership in a company by a workforce ballot instead of a petition drawn up by a union, saying this method might be 'politically advisable' in order to gain public support for TUC proposals.</p>

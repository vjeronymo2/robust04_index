			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Sweden tries to calm markets Sweden's central bank yesterday cut its overnight lending rate to the banks to 50 per cent from 500 per cent, in an attempt to calm the markets, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The move came before trading started. But doubts and confusion emerged over the exact details of the all-party budget cuts package announced in outline on Sunday evening. After considerable fluctuations the Stockholm bourse closed down 1.5 per cent with a SKr380m (Pounds 36.9m) turnover. The fall was particularly pronounced in the finance sector with a drop of 4 per cent.</p>

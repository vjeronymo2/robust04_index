			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY AND YOUTH  </P> <P> William Raspberry states that an investment is needed in the moral development  of kids ("Kids Need a Moral Compass to Go Straight," Commentary, Oct. 25).  </P> <P> He doesn't spell out this investment.  </P> <P> Morality is learned by example. Our whole culture is caught up in expediency,  in dishonesty, in hypocrisy. This starts from the very top. This sets the wrong  example. Look at the Washington budget process, the election process. These set  very poor examples of morality. Look at the whole era of Reaganomics. It set an  example of me first, not morality.  </P> <P> When we point our finger at the kids and their parents, notice how many fingers  are pointed back at ourselves.  </P> <P> RICHARD FOY  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

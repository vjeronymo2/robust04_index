			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A news conference was held at the Russian Ministry  of Defense today. The military and political aspects of the  Moscow summit meeting were discussed at the news conference.  Viktor Levin, our observer, reports.    [Levin] Colonel-General Maslin, chief of a main directorate  of the Russian Defense Ministry, introduced by the minister's  Press Secretary Yelena Agapova as the chief specialist in the  area of nuclear safety, dwelt in detail on the issue of the  state of nuclear arms in Ukraine.    [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement, the presidents  emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability  of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. However, nuclear  safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse. Storage  facilities are more than full with warheads and nuclear  ammunition which have been stood down. This is impermissible.  Apart from everything else, it has resulted in a considerable  increase in background radiation. This is confirmed by the  chief design specialists from Arzamas-16 who visited the  territory of Ukraine, Pervomaysk, last September.    Guarantees on most spare parts have run out. Regular  technical servicing is not being done everywhere. The findings  of the chief designers who investigated those three munitions,  you remember, the ones which were sent from Ukraine because they  were in a very dangerous state, landed on my desk yesterday.    Specialists are neither trained nor retrained in educational  centers. Due to a lack of effective control, the personnel's  theoretical knowledge and practical skills have been  substantially lost and this engenders a great deal of doubt with  regard to their capability for getting the work carried out with  any degree of quality.    Due to lack of equipment and absence of field training, the  special emergency repair crews are not in practical terms ready  to carry out tasks dealing with the elimination of the  consequences of possible accidents involving nuclear ammunition.  Besides, there is a great deal more affecting the servicing and  maintenance.    Well, and it is in a situation such as this that proposals  emerge within the military circles of the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry to have the munitions moved to a former engineer depot,  to have them stored there for a so-called interim period. Apart  from everything else, this is very dangerous. [end recording]    [Levin] I asked a question whether it is really the case  that  Ukraine fails to understand that keeping nuclear weapons in such  a poor technical state poses a threat to Ukraine itself. Here  is General Maslin's reply.    [Begin Maslin recording] There exists...[pauses] Well, I  have been in touch with my Ukrainian colleagues practically from  the very inception of the negotiating process. There are  sensible people there who do understand this. However, there  are also people -- and I am not afraid to say so -- who fail to  understand this danger.    For some 50 minutes I had to address some committee -- I  don't remember what they call it -- the Defense and Security  Committee of the Ukrainian parliament. For 50 minutes I told  them, in great detail, what nuclear ammunition is, what danger  it poses, in the first place for Ukraine, but the questions that  came afterwards dealt mainly with the costs -- how much if we  sell it to you. That is to say -- I would not like to offend  anyone by this -- but nonetheless, the statements, you have  after all noticed that statements have appeared in the press  alleging treachery, well, these are the people who do not  understand and they fall into one category.    There is a second category of people who do understand, but  who wish to retain their positions in the new structures that  emerged there to supervise the nuclear weapons. My former  subordinates are there, too, working and unwilling, to some  extent, to part with these weapons and probably this can serve  as an explanation. [end recording]    [Levin] The trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine,  and  the United States removes financial problems. It is now up to  the Ukrainian parliament and its political will.</p>

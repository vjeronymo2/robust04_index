			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT TREE CAN ENHANCE HOME  </P> <P> Trees can do a lot to enhance your home and property, but proper selection is  important, says Phil Hahn, director of forestry research at Georgia-Pacific  Corp.  </P> <P> "Small- to medium-sized trees planted at the corners of a home can give the  illusion of extending the width of a narrow house," Hahn says. "Japanese maples  and gray birch are excellent choices because they won't outgrow a small or  single-story home."  </P> <P> Because of their full shapes, red maples, honey locusts and other shade trees  are used to accent tall houses and provide contrast to square homes. Trees of  various heights at maturity often are planted in rows to break the roof lines  of long, low houses.  </P> <P> Trees such as maple, birch, white spruce and yews provide soft accents at  angular corners and have tame root systems, so they can be planted close to the  foundation, Hahn says.  </P> <P> To create a privacy screen between properties, plant low-branched trees such as  beech and sweet gum because they have dense, heavy foliage.  </P> <P> "These trees also are used to define property boundaries, compose backgrounds  and block wind," he says.  </P> <P> Tree barriers to block sound or unsightly views should have light-colored  foliage and low branches to give a feeling of spaciousness. Cedar, Canadian  hemlock, upright yews and other columnar trees often are used in hedgerows for  natural screening or in areas with limited space.  </P> <P> If poor drainage is a problem, silver maples, honey locusts, common hackberrys  and willows can survive in wet, low-lying areas.  </P></p>

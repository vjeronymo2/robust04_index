			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank and German investors in a bind - Christopher Parkes explains the economic background to the becalmed and troubled Frankfurt bourse Just when it seemed safe for investors to raise their heads above the parapet - a federal budget consolidation programme in the bag, an outbreak of industrial harmony in east and west, and interest rates apparently fixed on a gentle but persistent downwards slope - the flak has started to fly again. Growth in German money supply, after lagging early in the year so far below the central bank's target range that some Bundesbankers even started to believe that action was needed to give it some encouragement, returned to its bad old ways in April with a 7.3 per cent annualised surge in the M3 measure. Then came Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, confirming the discovery of another black hole in federal revenues. Some DM100bn of savings would be needed to the end of 1996, he said. The Bundesbank, already blaming the government for most of the upwards lurch in M3 and thereby feeding more inflationary pressure into the system, was hardly likely to be impressed by the implications for federal deficits. This week, as more junior members of the bank's policy-making council muddied the issue, differing in public over whether a 'pause' in the interest rates decline was necessary or not, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the bank's permanent directorate, tried to raise the mood. The German economy would hit bottom this summer (industrial output fell more than 10 per cent in the first quarter), but it would start to improve in the second half. Then he spoilt it all. Inflation of 4 per cent was incompatible with the bank's aim of stability. Monetary growth rates and a situation in which the D-Mark was relatively strong outside the country but declining in purchasing power inside, made it difficult for the bank to formulate policy, he said. The bank once again finds itself in a bind, more willing than it is prepared publicly to admit to ease rates in the interests of softening the domestic recessionary squeeze, but unable to move as fast as some of its members and most of the rest of Europe would like for fear of rocking the D-Mark's stability. This leaves investors in a comparable position, weighing the likelihood of rate cuts pushing the market upwards against the downward tendencies encouraged by falling company earnings. Mr Thomas Holmes, at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, believes this condition will prevail through the summer. Although he believes that the Bundesbank 'must and will do something', its policymakers were genuinely shocked by April's monetary growth through its annualised ceiling of 6.5 per cent. Their lack of action on securities repurchase rates, following the recent relatively steady downward moves followed by chips off the discount rate, suggests that they feel that market expectations had started once again to exceed what they could realistically deliver. The government has promised to cut deep into public spending. There will be no sacred cows, it pledges. The Bundesbank has heard such promises before and may be forgiven for a measure of scepticism. For all its failings, however, the first so-called 'solidarity pact' which was intended once and for all to stem deficits, at least proved that the political establishment was capable of relatively speedy compromise in areas where rapprochement would have been unthinkable a year ago. Spending cuts on the scale now needed will require approval by the opposition-controlled Bundesrat or upper house. While the horse-trading proceeds, the bank is unlikely to sit on its hands. Partly to encourage the negotiators, but mainly to prevent any further decline in consumer and business confidence, it will probably make its contribution in the shape of sporadic but small rate reductions. It is still widely believed in Germany that the post-summer recovery (an unhappy echo of the one being forecast at this time a year ago) will start from improved foreign sales, which account for some 45 per cent of gross national product. Given that 70 per cent of exports go to European countries, many of which are labouring under high interest rates as a result of Bundesbank policy, the optimists are well advised to be cautious. At current exchange rates, German products also lack a certain edge in the area of price competitiveness. Chances of internally generated demand helping to improve matters are virtually nil. With industrial capacity utilisation below 80 per cent, there is no reason for increased capital investment. Consumers are tightening their belts to cope with a real earnings fall this year - average pay is up by 3.5 per cent while average inflation will be 4 per cent. They are increasingly afraid of unemployment: industrial absenteeism is half 'normal' levels. Already confronted with a round of looming increases in taxes and welfare contributions, the public now face a round of swingeing public spending cuts to fill Mr Waigel's black hole. Such confidence as exists within industry and government about an end to the recession is based partly on the shaky premise that things, surely, cannot get any worse. The finance and economics ministries, in an unusual display of harmony, agree this is now the worst economic slump in the history of the federal republic. Where it is to be found at all, hard evidence for improvements is equally flimsy. At Volkswagen, for example, where the management has done a creditable job talking up its prospects, chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech admits that most of the company's progress back towards consistent profitability this year will have to come from cuts within. As for selling cars, he says that he expects business to get a bit of a lift from the September Frankfurt motor show. Meanwhile, he says he is encouraged by an increase in second-hand car prices over the past three weeks. That Mr Piech, for all his preoccupations, should keep such a close eye on the banger market speaks volumes for the intensity of the search for good news.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``Diphtheria `Mowing' Our Ranks''] </F>   [Text] Perhaps the most serious problem in Moscow now is  diphtheria. Just in the last 8 months 995 persons caught this  disease in the capital, at the same time that there were only  424 patients in all of last year. Nor are the statistics of  deaths due to this disease encouraging--this year 56 persons  died of diphtheria, which is more than double last year's  ``record.'' By the way, diphtheria is now ``mowing'' adults  primarily. This is associated with a drop in the population's  immune defense. The fact is that immunizations against this  disease are effective for not more than 10 years. After this  time, they must be repeated; otherwise there is no avoiding the  disease. However, our people now shy away from this one word  ``immunization''--they fear catching something more serious.</p>

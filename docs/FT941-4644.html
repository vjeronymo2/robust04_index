			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Food manufacturers about to report will salute Cadbury Schweppes' results. The stock market may fret about Cadbury's flat second half profits in the UK once exceptionals are stripped out - although the weather had a lot to do with that. It may also be unnerved that 6 per cent volume growth in UK soft drinks was bought at the cost of a 2 per cent decline in prices. But any UK food manufacturer that can achieve underlying volume growth of 3 per cent and lift margins from 11 to 11.7 per cent in unforgiving markets must be doing something right. Besides, while the UK still accounts for 45 per cent of profits, Cadbury has a comparatively small exposure to the big food retailers. It is also the best positioned to exploit alternative distribution channels such as vending machines. But Cadbury aspires to play in a bigger league. On that score, there remain considerable strategic doubts. The biggest concerns its 25 per cent shareholding in Dr Pepper; Cadbury is showing a capital gain on its shares but receives no dividend and can not equity account its holding since it does not have board representation. Cadbury may be able to sweet talk some co-operative deals but the investment only makes sense if it can buy Dr Pepper at a fair price, adding that company's 11 per cent market share of US soft drinks to its own 5.6 per cent. But Cadbury will have to tread a careful path to avoid antagonising Coca-Cola and Pepsico. Its agreement to help the Canadian private label manufacturer, Cott, in mainland Europe can hardly endear it to its mighty US competitors.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES' HEATON IMPROVES RECORD TO 6-0  </P> <P> The saga of Neal Heaton continues.  </P> <P> The left-hander nobody wanted a year ago pitched seven strong innings Saturday  night at Pittsburgh and, with a 3-1 victory over the Houston Astros, became the  first Pirate pitcher in 61 years to win his first six starts in a season.  </P> <P> Heaton, 30, has not lost a game since July 28. He's won his last 11 decisions  after being on the verge of going to the minor leagues. Heaton gave up an  unearned runs and four hits.  </P> <P> The Pirates have won seven of their last eight games.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds doubled home a run in the two-run fourth inning. He has 20 runs  batted in and is batting .500 with runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> The turnaround by Heaton is hard to believe. When he started last season by  losing seven of his first eight decisions, the Pirates stuck him in the  bullpen. He was 3-10 at Montreal in 1988.  </P> <P> Manager Jim Leyland, his staff depleted by injury, used him in relief. He won  twice and moved into the rotation.  </P> <P> Even Heaton can't explain why he has become unbeatable. "It's amazing," he  said.  </P> <P> The only change is a pitch he developed this spring called a screw-knuckle  change by catcher Mike LaValliere. It breaks like a screwball, but Heaton  actually grips it with one knuckle. Pitching coach Ray Miller told him he had  to come up with another pitch because the hitters would jump on a one-pitch  pitcher.  </P> <P> "The first time he threw his new pitch," Miller said, "the hitter almost fell  on his face. That's when Neal said, 'I can have some fun with this.' He's also  had success."  </P> <P> Heaton readily admits the new pitch has made him a confident pitcher.  </P> <P> "I saw a quote from Frank Viola the other day that every time he goes out on  the mound, he thinks he's going to win. That's 75% of the game right there,"  Heaton said. "If you go out on the mound not sure, or wondering what's going to  happen, you're going to get beat."  </P> <P> The Pirates have won 13 of their last 16 games and lead the East by 4 1/2  games.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 -- Tom Browning went into the seventh inning with a  no-hitter. But he didn't even win the game.  </P> <P> Shawon Dunston did more than spoil the no-hitter. His single to right ignited a  four-run outburst that carried the Cubs to a victory.  </P> <P> Mike Bielecki (2-3) had a three-hit shutout until he gave up singles to Mariano  Duncan and Barry Larkin to open the ninth inning.  </P> <P> Mitch Williams, who gave up two hits and two runs in relief Friday night,  replaced Bielecki. He got Todd Benzinger to hit into a double play, but Paul  O'Neill spoiled the shutout with a two-out home run.  </P> <P> San Francisco 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Matt Williams and Will Clark hit three-run  home runs at Philadelphia and Scott Garrelts won his first game.  </P> <P> Although the Giants have been in a slump, Williams has been a hot hitter. His  three runs batted in gave him 18 in 14 games. Clark hit his fourth home run in  the ninth.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Atlanta 3 -- For the second game in a row, Lee Smith came through  at St. Louis. He saved Friday's game, then came back to pitch two perfect  innings for the victory in this one.  </P> <P> The Cardinals won in the 10th. Vince Coleman bunted and pitcher Joe Boever  bobbled it. Coleman stole second, his 16th steal, and went to third on an  infield out. Boever walked Terry Pendleton and Dave Collins intentionally.  </P> <P> But rookie Todd Zeile was walked unintentionally on a 3-and-2 pitch to end the  game. Willie McGee and Pendleton both hit their first home runs of the season  for the Cardinals.  </P> <P> McGee hit his in the first inning over the 414-foot sign in center. It was the  50th of his career.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Montreal 2 -- Bruce Hurst (2-4) had his string of scoreless  innings stopped at 12 at San Diego, but he pitched a six-hitter for his second  complete game.  </P> <P> Hurst gave up home runs to Andres Galarraga in the seventh and Delino DeShields  in the ninth.  </P> <P> Roberto Alomar had a run-scoring single in the first inning and doubled to  ignite a three-run outburst in the sixth. Alomar was two for four and is  batting .571 since being moved into the third spot in the batting order last  Sunday. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

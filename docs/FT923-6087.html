			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Mistrial in case of Iran-contra official A MISTRIAL was declared yesterday in the US case of former senior Central Intelligence Agency official Mr Clair George, accused of concealing his knowledge of the Iran-contra affair. The jury was unable to reach agreement on any of the nine criminal charges, which included obstructing Congressional and grand jury investigations into the affair. Almost simultaneously, President George Bush said he had no knowledge of a 1987 memorandum, apparently at odds with his version of events, submitted as a court document in the Iran-contra case against Mr Caspar Weinberger, former US defence secretary. 'I've told very openly everything I've had to say about that,' Mr Bush said. The memo was dictated in August 1987, by Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, and took exception to Mr Bush's claim in a newspaper interview the previous day that he might have opposed the operation by White House aide Lt-Col Oliver North, if he had he been aware that Mr Shultz and Mr Weinberger were objecting to it so vigorously. The memo records: 'Cap (Weinberger) called me and said, that's terrible. He (Bush) was on the other side. It's on the record. Why did he say that?' A second trial for Mr George was set for October 19. Mr Weinberger's case, also on charges of unlawfully withholding information, will be heard in early January. In the end, the jury was unable to decide between the conflicting evidence of Mr George and Mr Alan Fiers, a former friend and subordinate at the CIA, who pleaded guilty in July to lesser charges in return for co-operation with the prosecution.</p>

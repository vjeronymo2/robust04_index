			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PORAT TELLS OF LIFE AMID ANTI-SEMITISM;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE MOZART CAMERATA CONDUCTOR, SON OF SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST, FOUND  HIMSELF A CONTINUING VICTIM OF BIGOTRY AS HE GREW UP IN ROMANIA.  </P> <P> Persecution against Jews came early into conductor Ami Porat's childhood in  Romania.  </P> <P> "There were daily anti-Semitic attacks, even from little kids who obviously  repeated what they heard from their parents," Porat said in a recent phone  interview.  </P> <P> "I remember a 4-year-old boy who lived in our building, who used to throw rocks  at us daily when we came home from school, 'You dirty Jews, get out of my  country.' "  </P> <P> "And I remember the insults that even the teachers inflicted on us. How would  you like to be called (in class), 'the Jew Ami Porat'?  </P> <P> "We had no other choice but to get straight A's. That they couldn't take away."  </P> <P> Porat, the son of survivors of the Holocaust, grew up in Cluj, the capital of  Transylvania. His mother had been in Auschwitz and his father had been taken to  the Ukraine. "They found each other after the war," Porat said.  </P> <P> He recalled the mood of his hometown: "There was a great mentality of siege  because of the bleak economy and widespread anti-Semitism. We were forced to  expand and beautify our inner world. We had very few avenues of expression  left."  </P> <P> Classical music was one of the open avenues of expression, but even so, Porat  recalled, the authorities "put incredible obstacles in our way."  </P> <P> "I started on the piano, when I was about 9 or 10. I wanted to play a string  instrument. I was taken to a concert, fell in love and wanted to play the  cello. But they would not let me play the cello. There were two kids in my  class who already played cello. It was too late for that. The only instrument I  could learn was the double-bass. I didn't choose it at all."  </P> <P> Politics soon entered Porat's life, too. His father was an avid fisherman whose  hobby was to make artificial lures and flies. Word spread, and friends and  neighbors would come by to get the gear.  </P> <P> "Many insisted upon paying him something -- pennies, no way it was proper  compensation," Porat said, though it provided enough money to buy a modest  piano, which was later confiscated by the police.  </P> <P> "When we applied to emigrate, my father was called up to the offices of the  Securitate. They showed him a list of every single person who had ever given  him money for his fishing flies. They said this was illegal, a crime against  the state.  </P> <P> "They had two choices, they said: They could put him away for life; or he could  emigrate, but he would have to do some industrial spying for them. They wanted  some pictures of (military) installations in Israel.  </P> <P> "They gave him the name of a contact and a telephone number in an embassy. . .  . He, of course, accepted on the spot. One chooses freedom over life in  prison."  </P> <P> The Porats, like the Schwartzes and others, had to buy their way out of the  country, despite the "agreement" with the authorities.  </P> <P> "The government made you pay -- $10,000 per person -- for the privilege, for  the right to renounce Romanian citizenship," he said. "Our house was  confiscated. We were allowed to leave with about 50 pounds of personal  belongings each. When we got to the border, I remember throwing cash out the  train, Romanian currency because we weren't allowed to be caught with it."  </P> <P> The family arrived in Israel on May 1, 1961. Porat was 14 1/2. The next month,  his father tried to call his spy contact at a Western embassy as prearranged.  </P> <P> "By tremendous coincidence, there had been a natural gas explosion in the  embassy," Porat said. "The contact vanished, and my father was free."  </P> <P> Why did his father even try to keep his end of the bargain?  </P> <P> "There were lots of family members still left in Romania," Porat said. "There  was a claim against all the land . . . also, they told my father (that) they  had 'very long arms.'  </P> <P> "It's very hard to describe the feeling of living in a police state for 20  years," he added. "Believe me, everybody was afraid. There were informants of  the Securitate everywhere. We lived in a U-shaped building, with maybe 30 to 40  families. Every one of the buildings had at least one or two informants."  </P> <P> Upon arrival, Porat went to a kibbutz called Givat-Haim (the Hill of Life). His  parents remained in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> The kibbutz members heard him improvising at a piano one night and decided to  send him back to his family so he could pursue music.  </P> <P> "Slowly, slowly my chains fell off," he said. "My mother says my posture  improved. I was no longer standing beaten down. I was standing tall and proud."  </P> <P> He joined the National Youth Orchestra in 1963 and toured with it to North  America and Canada a year later. He went on to attend a music academy in Tel  Aviv, was drafted into the Israeli army and in 1969, won a scholarship to the  Juilliard School of Music in New York.  </P> <P> Since 1975, he has lived in Orange County. He formed the Mozart Camerata in  1980 as a private organization; in 1985 it was reorganized and began to give  public concerts.  </P> <P> Like his compatriot Sergiu Schwartz, Porat would like to return to Romania now  that the move toward democracy has begun.  </P> <P> "I have a desire to go back and see the place I was born," he said. "Also I  want to see the place where I got my first music lessons. I want to see the  cathedral in the center square, where I used to lean out the window to see the  time . . . and also I want to see where I caught my first fish with my father."  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Turkey-Russia pact paves way for gas accord TURKEY and Russia have agreed terms for settling an outstanding debt owed by Moscow, paving the way for a new gas trade accord, worth Dollars 290m (Pounds 163.8m) in 1991, John Murray Brown reports from Ankara. Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkish prime minister, has won assurance from Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, that Russia would repay a Dollars 35m debt over the next three months. Russia has also agreed a Turkish request that proceeds of the gas trade be paid into the Turkish Eximbank in Ankara, rather than the Vnesheconombank, the bank through which former Soviet foreign debt is paid. Under the deal Russia assumes contractual responsibility for the natural gas contract first agreed with the former Soviet Union in 1984. However, the two sides have still to finalise details on changes on both the price and volume of the gas shipped.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul Prosecution on  Monday afternoon placed under arrest Chang Yong-cha on charges  of fraud and violating the bad check control law. The  prosecution charge said Chang last October illegally withdrew  from the Apkujong branch of the Seoul Trust Bank 3 billion won  belonging to Ms. Ha Chong-im without the depositor's permission.  Chang is also suspected of cheating 7.75 billion won out of the  Sampo Mutual Trust Fund with the false promise of giving the  fund a large deposit. The charge also said that when she was  heading Yupyong Corp. as its chairwoman last October, the corp.  issued a 500-million-won note but failed to honor it.    A law stipulates that a person found guilty of fraud  involving more than 5 billion won is to be given a term of five  years to life. Besides, she had five years and two more months  to serve when she was paroled in 1992 from prison. She was  serving a 15-year term over a 1982 financial scandal.    Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry on Monday afternoon  retracted  the parole granted to Chang in 1992, obliging her to serve out  the remaining term.    A ministry official said that by law a parole may be  cancelled if the parolee fails to behave properly or engages in  abnormal conducts. "We have cancelled her parole upon she was  arrested," the official said.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TOURISM;  </P> <P> FEAR OF LONG LINES SEEN AS DETERRENT TO WOULD-BE VISITORS AT NIXON LIBRARY  </P> <P> Has the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace fallen victim to its own publicity  wave?  </P> <P> That's the question Kevin Cartwright asks when people say they haven't visited  yet because they don't want to have to wait in line.  </P> <P> Cartwright, the library's spokesman, said the facility has had an average of  1,000 visitors a day since opening to the public July 20. At that pace, the  library's annual attendance would fall short of the 500,000-visitor-a-year  estimate projected when ground was broken two years ago.  </P> <P> Cartwright said he tells people that there are few waits at the library and  that the building can handle large groups.  </P> <P> He said some people may have the impression there are long waits at the library  because of the hoopla during its opening, which was attended by President Bush  and former Presidents Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The library has  attracted worldwide attention.  </P> <P> Visitors have ranged from Southern Californians to out-of-state tourists to  foreign visitors, especially from Japan. Cartwright said that 35 Japanese news  agencies covered the opening ceremonies, giving the library wide exposure in  the Far East.  </P> <P> Cartwright said the library should appeal to budget-conscious tourists. At  $3.95 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and free admission for children under  11, the price of admission is much lower than that of Disneyland or Knott's  Berry Farm.  </P> <P> So far, the library has managed to attract crowds without a word of paid  advertising. But Cartwright said that may change.  </P> <P> "We knew we would have to have some sort of other ad campaign," he said.  </P></p>

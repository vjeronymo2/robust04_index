			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Unilever cautious despite rise in profits to Pounds 1.8bn UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, yesterday reported a Pounds 10m increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.79bn after seeing an 8 per cent rise in the fourth-quarter to Pounds 473m. In spite of the improved final quarter figure, which compares with Pounds 438m a year ago, Sir Michael Angus, chairman, was cautious about immediate prospects: 'It is difficult to predict the outlook for 1992 at a time when so many forecasts of recovery appear to have been premature.' Sir Michael said Unilever had shown resilience in difficult economic conditions in some of its main markets. Though volumes on industrial businesses had declined, consumer operations had continued to grow, thanks in part to rapid introduction of new products. The Gulf War and turmoil in the Soviet Union had cost the group sales and profits, while its performance in the US and Britain had been held back by the persistence of a recession which had proved longer and harsher than expected. While economic conditions in the US were not worsening, there was no evidence they were improving. Sales rose 2 per cent in the full year to Pounds 23.1bn against Pounds 22.7bn, and 5 per cent in the fourth quarter to Pounds 6.2bn compared with Pounds 5.9bn. Operating margins during the year fell to 8.6 per cent from 9 per cent, due to currency movements and smaller exceptional gains than in 1990. The group incurred restructuring charges of Pounds 70m during the year. Cash flow was strengthened by tighter control over working capital, which reduced net borrowings during the year to Pounds 1.5bn from Pounds 1.9bn and cut net interest cost to Pounds 276m from Pounds 328m. In Europe, full-year operating profit rose to Pounds 1.24bn from Pounds 1.23bn on sales of Pounds 13.7bn against Pounds 13.6bn. In North America, volumes were static and operating profit fell to Pounds 336m from Pounds 364m on sales of Pounds 4.77bn up from Pounds 4.63bn. Currency movements led to a drop in operating profits in the rest of the world to Pounds 420m from Pounds 455m on sales of Pounds 4.6bn compared with Pounds 4.46bn. Full-year earnings per share increased 4 per cent to 61.62p (59.52p). The final dividend is raised to 13.91p (13.3p), bringing the total to 18.94p (18.16p).

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Work harder, or not at all - Global Investor Some curious and significant trends lurked in the latest crop of US quarterly results. Profits, as might be expected at this stage in the cycle, were up strongly: by 39 per cent for a sample of larger companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. Sales volume was also up sharply. The odd fact was that many manufacturers said they were still shedding labour: odder still, quite a few were unable to raise their prices. An extreme but not isolated example was the chemicals giant DuPont, whose earnings nearly doubled in the quarter. In its polymers division, sales volume was up a remarkable 15 per cent (and profits by 150 per cent); prices, however, were 1 per cent lower. Job cuts were continuing across the group, a representative said. 'Hopefully,' he added, 'we're getting near the end.' Here is productivity and no mistake. If this is what the peak of the cycle looks like, God help the workers in the next downturn. However, the conventional business cycle may have little to do with it. What we have here is a real revolution based on information technology and new approaches to manufacturing. Nor is it confined to productivity of labour. The inability of manufacturers to raise their prices is slightly mysterious, but one important reason must be that they continue to find new ways to raise the productivity of their plant. For years, pioneers like General Electric have been using Japanese-style ingenuity to wring more output from existing machinery. Today, even a car manufacturer like Ford talks almost casually of moving its output towards 130 per cent of rated capacity. Since this increased flexibility is hard to capture in official data, it risks distorting monetary policy. If the Fed puts too much trust in its own figures on capacity utilisation, it could end up raising rates for the wrong reason. Other official data point the other way. Although monthly inflation figures are notoriously unreliable, it is worth recalling that US factory gate prices (excluding food and oil) fell 0.5 per cent in October, with capital goods down 1 per cent. The price of cars fell 2.6 per cent - and this at a time when General Motors was incurring strike action for excessive use of overtime. Also last week came figures showing an annualised rise in productivity of 2.7 per cent in the third quarter. This may be small beer to a star performer like the manufacturer AlliedSignal, which looks on course this year to hit its regular target of 6 per cent (and which is still laying off workers, despite having just recorded a double digit sales increase for the first time in six years). But the figure is still above the average for the previous 13 quarters. At the same time, unit labour costs are running only 0.9 per cent up on last year. Mr Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley, calculates that over the past four cycles in the US the average rise at this point in the cycle has been 6.1 per cent. Since, as he observes, labour accounts for 70 per cent of production costs, this leaves room for further rises in corporate profits. From a stock market viewpoint, the productivity revolution might seem unambiguously good news. So it is, subject to two provisos. First, the social divisions created by the revolution must be containable. Second, even those workers who keep their jobs must agree to work increasingly long hours for the same money or less (see chart). After all, one of the effects of the revolution from a stock market perspective is to make labour an expensive nuisance. The biggest industrial employer in the US is General Motors, with a workforce of 711,000. Dividing that figure into its market capitalisation gives a stock market value per worker of some Dollars 63,000. As you drop down the list of top employers, the valuation rises: Pepsico Dollars 72,000, Ford Dollars 101,000, IBM Dollars 115,000, General Electric Dollars 403,000. At the other extreme comes Microsoft, whose 15,000-odd employees carry a price tag of Dollars 2.5m apiece. Not everyone can become a software designer at Microsoft, while fewer and fewer blue collar workers can expect to find jobs in Detroit. One of the most topical and contentious books in America at the moment is The Bell Curve, by the social scientists Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein. They argue that America is creating a 'cognitive elite', to which only those of high intelligence are admitted; also, that intelligence is largely inherited and thus immutable. One does not have to accept the argument to take the point: one way or another, the technological revolution is social dynamite. Even for those who emerge on top, life may be getting tougher. There have been productivity increases in the service industries, but much of it has consisted of cutting out layers of bureaucracy. For the survivors, especially those who work purely with their brains, the only way to increase output is to work longer hours. According to Mr Roach of Morgan Stanley, the average work week in US factories is now longer than at any time since the second world war. Something similar seems to be happening to white collar workers. As he also observes, greater exertion is not the same as greater efficiency. So lengthening hours do not represent true growth in productivity, even if it shows up as such in the official statistics. If it is not true productivity, nor is it true wealth. And if, in the long run, harder work fails to translate into a higher standard of living, the American worker is likely to rebel. In a wider context such rebellion may be futile. One does not have to be Sir James Goldsmith to accept that the blessings of free trade are not unmixed. Americans and Europeans consume a hugely disproportionate slice of the global pie. It may be that, in a world without trade barriers, fairer shares are inevitable. As the defenders of free trade will point out, there is no reason that the pie should not become big enough for everyone to be better off; and even in the short run, those few who stay at the forefront of knowledge may hold on to their bigger slices. Meanwhile, the average American or European worker could face a starker choice: work harder for less, or do not work at all. Again, of course, this is splendid news for the world's stock markets. In the period of transition to global equilibrium, the providers of capital can secure skilled labour at cheaper rates than before. For workers, too, this makes the stock market all the more attractive. After all, if the machine is going to put you out of work, you might as well have shares in it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 10/11/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.09     0.04      0.09      0.70      0.16   0.10 Month                0.43     0.19      0.42      0.64      0.70   0.46 Year                 3.69     2.13      5.56     -0.08      8.31   5.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.04     -0.02     0.43      0.70      1.00   0.37 Month               -0.76      0.46     0.91      0.64      2.42   0.75 Year                -2.49     -1.15     0.95     -0.88      2.47   0.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.00     -0.32     1.30      1.68      1.57   0.59 Month               -1.33      0.50     1.10      0.55      2.91   1.08 Year                -6.83     -2.97    -3.03     -5.88     -3.61  -2.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 -0.6      -3.0      1.4       2.0       2.0    0.2 Month                 1.6      -3.7      2.8       2.9      -0.6    2.7 Year                  3.5      -0.8      1.4      -2.4      24.7    4.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

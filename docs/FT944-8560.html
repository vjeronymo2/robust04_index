			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / A balance of profit and nature John Fellowes, 5th Lord de Ramsey, who is set to become chairman of the Environment Agency that will control pollution in England and Wales, said last night that the most important part of his new job was to establish the credibility of the new agency with the public when public confidence in politicians, businessmen and the media was at a very low ebb. He had no doubt that the agency would on occasion cross swords with government ministers and many others. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, recalled that as minister of agriculture he had engaged in some robust debate with Lord de Ramsey, then president of the Country Landowners' Association, whose members are estimated to own half the privately owned land in England and Wales. Lord de Ramsey, 52, who succeeded to the title 18 months ago, has been described as 'the very model of a modern farmer-businessman'. His company farms 6,500 arable acres at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire where his family has been active in draining and farming the fens since the middle of the 17th century. He spoke proudly yesterday of the 1,000 elm trees on his estate, virtually the last surviving in southern England, kept free of the killer Dutch elm disease by surgery and injections of fungicide. Instead of bulldozing old farm buildings his company has converted them into light-industry workshops without changing the character of the village in which they are situated. 'You need profits to keep this lovely landscape looking as it is,' he said. Lord De Ramsey said he would resign as a director of the Cambridge Water Company and as president of the Association of Drainage Authorities, mainly because of potential conflicts of interest, but this would give him more time towards the 2 1/2 days a week he would spend on his part-time, chairmanship. 'But I expect to have my weekends and holidays disturbed.' He has still to make his maiden speech in the House of Lords where, while president of the CLA, he sat on the cross benches. More recently he has taken the Conservative whip.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN BOMBINGS PUT FOCUS ON HATE GROUPS  </P> <P> A broad spectrum of civil rights organizations, alarmed by the deadly bombings  in the South, has gone on a heightened state of alert amid speculation that  hate groups may be responsible for the wave of violence, officials said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Representatives of the groups, including the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League  of B'Nai B'Rith and the Center for Democratic Renewal, joined judges and other  court employees in taking extra precautions while opening mail and other  packages.  </P> <P> On Saturday, a mail bomb killed U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert  S. Vance, who prevented white supremacists from taking over the Alabama  Democratic Party. On Monday, another mail bomb killed Savannah, Ga., Alderman  Robert Robinson, a lawyer active in a contentious school desegregation case. On  the same day, a bomb found in the 11th Circuit Court building in Atlanta was  disarmed, as was one found Tuesday at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the  NAACP.  </P> <P> "It's frightening," said Sunny Stern, assistant area director of the American  Jewish Committee in Atlanta. "Any time this type of hate group spews out  against any group of people, we know we can be a target as well."  </P> <P> The distinct possibility that racist motivation is behind the bombings has  renewed attention on white supremacist groups, raising questions about who they  are, where they operate and how they have changed over the years.  </P> <P> Civil rights organizations are busy compiling answers, warning that while the  number of Ku Klux Klan members has declined during the last decade, newer, more  violent groups have sprung up, attracting disciples in droves.  </P> <P> Individuals who monitor white supremacist groups say the recent violence may be  a reaction to recent court decisions -- including the 1987 award of $7 million  to the mother of a teen-ager murdered by the klan in Mobile, Ala. -- and a  sense that violence is necessary to keep their movement growing.  </P> <P> "They feel that their options are limited," said Charles F. Wittenstein,  counsel for the Anti-Defamation League. "Violence is the only thing left. They  may be hitting out at an institution like the Court of Appeals that has  traditionally defended the rights of blacks, Jews and other minorities."  </P> <P> At the Center for Democratic Renewal, also known as the Anti-Klan Network,  Leonard Zeskind, research director, said that the klan, perhaps the oldest and  best known of hate groups, saw its membership plummet from an estimated 15,000  in 1980 to some 6,000 today.  </P> <P> But in addition to the klan, remembered for kidnapings and killings of blacks,  Jews, Catholics and civil rights workers for decades in the Old South, there  are now the Skinheads, the Neo-Nazis and Posse Comitatus. There is the  California group called the White Aryan Resistance, and Dallas is the home base  for a group called the Confederate Hammer Skins.  </P> <P> In all, said Zeskind, his organization has identified some six-dozen hate  groups, with 20,000 "hard-core" members nationwide and another 150,000  sympathizers -- people who are on mailing lists and may attend meetings  occasionally.  </P> <P> "There is a burgeoning of this movement," Zeskind said. "People think it's  going away when you have it increasing."  </P> <P> The Klanwatch Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.,  estimates that 230 such groups are operating, and are responsible for 11  murders, 100 shootings and assaults, and 60 cross-burnings during the last two  years.  </P> <P> A report by the project said that the groups' "cult of violence" has grown more  brutal during the last decade. A combination of factors fuels the white  supremacist movement, the report says, including the groups' ability to reach  huge audiences of prisoners and disenchanted youth through cable television.  </P> <P> And the youthful Skinheads, the report says, are "the most violent group of  white supremacists this country has seen in a quarter-century."  </P> <P> Morris Dees, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said: "Skinheads  were considered the radical upstarts of the 1980s, but they are on their way to  becoming the domestic terrorists of the 1990s."  </P> <P> In Jacksonville on Tuesday, a longtime resident said Skinheads are highly  visible there. "My wife and I were by a park . . . not long ago, and there was  a group of them standing around there," he said. "They were obvious by their  attire -- black clothes, combat boots, shaved heads and swastika tattoos."  </P> <P> Although no state is without members in these groups, analysts say, the  greatest numbers are in the eastern half of the country, in California and in  the Northwest. A map by the Southern Poverty Law Center depicting locations of  various groups shows heavy concentrations of klan members from Pennsylvania  down through eastern Texas and large numbers of Skinheads in California.  </P> <P> "Nobody paid any attention to the groups" before the recent bombings, says  Willis Edwards, president-emeritus of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP. "Now,  people are saying, 'We'd better take another look.' "  </P> <P> The fear rising from speculation about the bombings has been profound,  affecting the groups in seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand it has  had an energizing effect, as several rights activists cited the bombings as  reason to enact legislation that would mandate federal collection of data on  racist incidents.  </P> <P> Others said they have been told that potential members are afraid to join the  rights groups because of the bombings. Additionally, the Atlanta NAACP office  was the target of a smoke bomb earlier this year.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have said they don't want to be involved (with the NAACP)  because it's too big a risk," Edwards said. "These hate groups are very serious  people. They're nothing to play with. They're out to win."  </P> <P> In some parts of the country, the groups have demonstrated openly. About six  months ago, for example, a small klan march took place in Savannah. And similar  marches occur periodically in and near Atlanta. Lately, many of those marches  have been aimed at immigrants, especially Mexicans and Asians.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some people connected with racist organizations dispute the  theory that racists committed the bombings. A woman answering the telephone of  a man who publishes an anti-minority newspaper in Marietta, Ga., Tuesday called  speculation about racist bombings "a smear."  </P> <P> The woman, who refused to give her name, said: "Nobody wants to be connected to  such a thing" as the bombings. "I think the FBI is investigating the drug  lords. They should be investigating Morris Dees."  </P> <P> As for stories about racist groups, she said: "The media's wrong to be jumping  to conclusions. They're climbing up the wrong back."  </P> <P> Researcher Edith Stanley contributed to this story.  </P></p>

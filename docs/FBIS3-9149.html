			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Goran Gotev: "God Save Us From Bulgarian </F> Janissaries"]    [Text] If you know who is in power in the Western Outlands  [border region of Serbia inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians], you  will not be surprised at the demand of the authorities in  Bosilegrad Municipality to ban the Democratic Alliance of  Bulgarians in Yugoslavia (DSBYu). Both there and in almost all  the other settlements with a Bulgarian population Bulgarian  janissaries are in power. Five hundred years of servitude have  taught us that no oppressor is more terrible and vile than they.  They are the mayors, municipal councillors, judges, and police  chiefs who have long been in the service of an alien faith and  an alien language.    Otherwise, everything appears to be civilized and normal.  When the Serbian authorities receive delegations from Bulgaria  -- and there have been plenty of them of late -- they assure  them that in the areas with a predominantly Bulgarian population  in eastern Serbia our compatriots occupy leading places in the  administration and in municipal life. Moreover, the Bulgarian  language, even if it is not the chief language, is only so  because the Bulgarians themselves want it so.    Later our delegations meet these mayors, municipal  councillors, judges, and police chiefs, from whom they hear the  same thing, and then return to Bulgaria enchanted by this new  Arcadia, where everything flows with milk and honey. They then  start publishing one article after another in which they try to  convince the other 8 million Bulgarians that those who defend  the rights of the Bulgarians in the Western Outlands are a  handful of dubious personages who want to provoke a quarrel  between us and Serbia, which shows abundant love toward us.    As this is going on, our compatriots can barely make ends  meet, because not a single new workshop has been built for  decades in their villages, forgotten by both Belgrade and Sofia.  They try to come to terms with their children's new Serbian  names, hoping that they at least will not have to suffer as they  are, and even regard with distrust the enthusiasts from the  DSBYu, because they have known for ages that every time a voice  is raised in defense of the Bulgarians violated rights, only  misfortunes and torment follow. How can they fail to think like  this, when even in their motherland people were found to assure  us that everything is fine in the Western Outlands? Who then is  to tell our compatriots that the other minorities in former  Yugoslavia have been fighting for their rights for a long time  and will certainly win their rights and freedoms through their  struggle? Who is to tell them that the time for bowing one's  head is already long past?    The totalitarianism here, like totalitarianism anywhere  else,  has created an impression of ostensible democracy. The Serbian  Parliament has no deputies from a party that defends the  Bulgarians' rights, nor will it ever have any. A fiendishly  cunning electoral system has divided the Bulgarian settlements  in such a way that in all the electoral constituencies a Serbian  population predominates that will never support a Bulgarian  candidate. However, Bulgarian deputies from the ruling parties  have served in parliament and will certainly continue to do so.  The trouble is that history has not recorded the name of a  single Bulgarian deputy who has said at least two words in  defense of his compatriots. Precisely the opposite is the case  -- to this very day they are remembered only for having defended  the rulers' policies more fervently and furiously than the  rulers themselves. When the enthusiasts, who included some of  the most eminent and respected names of Bulgarians in  Yugoslavia, founded the DSBYu, the Belgrade mass media poured  out rivers of defamation and abuse. The first legal political  organization of Bulgarians that had appeared in the Western  Outlands since their separation from Bulgaria in 1918 was  stigmatized not by Serbs, but by Bulgarians. They even signed  their denunciations and gave their addresses, so as to be sure  receive their thirty pieces of silver.    I know that every undemocratic government needs such  traitors, and that every such government rewards them highly by  quickly promoting them up the ladder of the administrative  hierarchy. However, I also know that any self-respecting  government cannot fail to hold them in contempt.    Therefore, I think that if Belgrade listens to the calls of  its Bosilegrad informers, if it bans the only organization of  Bulgarians of the kind that all the other minorities in the  multinational state possess, this will mean that Belgrade has  lost its own sense of self-respect.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Swiss police start hunt for Lloyds Bank employee GENEVA police have put out an international warrant for the arrest of an employee of the Geneva branch of Lloyds Bank, following the discovery of some SFr29m (Pounds 11.6m) in losses on unauthorised foreign exchange dealings. The branch specialises in portfolio management for wealthy individuals. Lloyds would not reveal details of the incident, but said clients' money was not involved. Geneva investigators say the employee, who is of both Egyptian and Swiss nationalities and is believed to have fled to Egypt, is a portfolio manager for some of the bank's Middle East clients. Many of these clients did not wish to break the Koran's prohibition on interest-bearing investments, so they instructed him to put their money into foreign exchange futures and other instruments only offering the possibility of capital gain. According to Mr Pierre Marquis, the investigating magistrate, the employee created phoney accounts over the past five years for investing in foreign exchange contracts. When these accounts went into loss, he created phoney pledges of funds from the accounts of some of his clients to cover the losses. Lloyds said no other employees were involved. This is the second time in a month irregularities in a British controlled bank in Switzerland have come to light. Zurich based Rothschild Bank, an affiliate of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, had to shore up its equity base following revelations of large loan losses, a breach of Swiss banking regulations and the arrest of a former senior executive.</p>

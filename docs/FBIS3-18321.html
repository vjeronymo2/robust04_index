			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- The Bundeswehr mission in Somalia  has cost some 310 million German marks [DM], DM240 million of  which will have to be paid by the German taxpayer, while DM70  million will be refunded by the United Nations. Material worth  DM60 million, including, for example, a field hospital and  communications equipment, can be used in the future, too, and  has, thus, to be regarded as "long-term investment." This was  stated by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. The  budget funds used by the Bundeswehr in Somalia are an  "investment in humanitarianism and the future of the  Bundeswehr," the minister stressed.    According to Ruehe, the mission of the German Armed Forces  within the framework of the United Nations saved tens of  thousands of people from sure starvation and illness. "The  commitment of our soldiers was an act of humanitarianism, which,  due to the special conditions in Somalia, could only have been  provided by soldiers," Ruehe said. The funds used for it are  "an investment in humanitarianism."    The largest single amount (DM102 million) of the almost  10-month mission of a total of approximately 3,000 German blue  helmets, which started in May 1993, went to transportation. Of  that, a total of DM48.5 million was spent on civilian transport,  above all charter flights. The military transports cost DM53.5  million. [passage omitted]    According to a paper issued by the Defense Ministry, the  United Nations already last year transferred DM13.4 million of  the total refund of DM70 million.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By THE KOREA TIMES correspondent Chong Pyong-chin] </F>   [Text] OTTAWA -- Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said here  Tuesday that he will tune policies with U.S. officials on the  North Korean nuclear problem in Washington again after seeing  the schedule for inspections by an IAEA team.    "I hope that the inspection will go smoothly as agreed upon  by the IAEA and North Korea," Han said, welcoming North Korea's  decision to open the facilities to the IAEA inspection.    Following are questions and answers from a press conference  at Westin Hotel here.    Q: What do you think about reports that North Korea accepted  a fullscope inspection of its nuclear facilities?    A: North Korea representatives in Vienna informed the IAEA  just a few hours ago that the North will accept the IAEA's  inspection to maintain continuity of safeguards at seven  declared nuclear sites. We welcome this and hope that the  inspection will be carried out as agreed on by the IAEA and  North Korea.    Q: When do you think the inspection will begin?    A: I don't know the exact date. But I believe that an  inspection team will enter Pyongyang in a week.    Q: When do you expect Rep. Ronald Dellums, chairman of the  House Armed Services Committee, to visit Pyongyang?    A: The Department of State had not reached a final decision  on when he would visit Pyongyang due to the expectation that  North Korea and the IAEA would make progress at inspection  talks. Even now, I believe there is no finalized schedule.  Chairman Dellums himself has his own plan. I believe that he  will be able to visit Pyongyang in a few days if his visit to  North Korea is not likely to hinder the nuclear negotiations.    Q: Will high-level North Korea-U.S. contacts resume soon in  New York?    A: I believe that a North Korea-U.S. contact had been sought  before the negotiations made progress in Vienna. North Korea  proposed resumption of a high working-level contact in New York.  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard and Ho Chong,  North Korean deputy representative to the United Nations, are  scheduled to meet at five Tuesday afternoon in New York. The  contact will take place as there is no reason to cancel it now  that progress has been made in Vienna.    Q: What do you think about reports that North Korea proposed  to the United States a contact in New York last weekend?    A: I think it's better not to mention it now that progress  has been made on the IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear  sites.    Q: What will you talk about in your second meeting with U.S.  officials in Washington Feb. 17? (Han is scheduled to reenter  Washington Thursday via New York, where he will meet with United  Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Wednesday.)    A: First of all, I will look at the itinerary of the IAEA  inspection team. But nothing has been decided on whom I will  meet. The schedule will be fixed when I go there.</p>

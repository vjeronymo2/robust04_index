Speakers at today's meeting of the territorial  administration  noted that the Kubans have managed to organize the protection of  borders and public safety in the territorial border areas  bearing in mind the on-going clashes in the Transcaucasian and  North Caucasian republics.    They have formed check points and mobile groups. Cossack  organizations have made 130 units to participate in operations  together with the local police.    Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin told the meeting that  the escalation of violence in the Krasnodar Territory has become  stable and criminal terror has turned regular. Last year alone  the Kuban police revealed 400 criminal groups with an overall  strength of 1,000 people.</p>

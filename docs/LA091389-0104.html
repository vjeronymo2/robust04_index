			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : AN ENCYCLOPEDIC REVIEW OF THE IDIOM; BRUNCH TO AID BLACK MUSIC  FOUNDATION  </P> <P> Whether you're new to jazz and want some insight into its history and major  (and minor) players, or a seasoned fan looking for a nostalgic stroll down the  music's memory lane, you'll find the September issue of down beat, which  celebrates that magazine's 55th year of continual publication, of more than  passing interest.  </P> <P> The 104-page issue, on the newsstands now, is a mini-encyclopedia, replete with  reprinted stories (some in the original typeface, some reset), pictures (of  artists and the magazine's original covers) and reviews. It also includes  chronological compendiums of hundreds of facts for each decade from the '30s  through the '80s. "We wanted to bring things up to date, let people know where  we've been, where we're going," said editor John Ephland. "We felt the end of  the '80s was a good time to take a pause and reflect."  </P> <P> Since down beat began pretty much as a pop music fanzine, the early years find  issues with corny covers and blaring headlines like " 'W.C. Handy Is a Liar!'  says Jelly Roll (Morton)" or "Clothes Torn Off Girl Vocalist." But by the  mid-'50s, the publication's subject matter had taken a much more serious,  scholarly tone, represented by, say, a mid-'50s profile on Miles Davis written  by Hentoff or a mid-'80s Q&amp;A piece with Wynton and Branford Marsalis,  written by Times contributor A. James Liska.  </P> <P> The issue is not without its drawbacks. Articles are truncated and stop  seemingly in mid-sentence, some of the most biting criticism is offered without  bylines, and the page layouts often make it hard to separate editorial copy  from advertising. Still, for a brief yet broad look into jazz's past and  present, the issue is excellent.  </P> <P> Reliving the glory years of the Central Avenue musical scene will be one of the  themes of "Jazz &amp; Pizazz," a jazz brunch and fashion show benefiting the  nonprofit BEEM foundation. The event, which will begin at noon Sunday at the  Doubletree Hotel in Marina del Rey, features reedman Buddy Collette's quintet,  singer O.C. Smith, violinist Ginger Smock and fashions by Leslie Thames.  </P> <P> BEEM -- Black Experience as Expressed Through Music -- was founded in 1982 "to  promote appreciation of the contributions made by black composers and  performers to the world of music," said Bette Y. Cox, the organization's  president.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 285-3366.  </P> <P> Red Holloway doesn't spend much time at home these days.  </P> <P> The bluesy saxman -- who resided in the Los Angeles area for two decades before  moving to Cambria, Calif., in 1987 -- has the kind of work schedule that many  musicians only dream of. Since May, Holloway -- who plays with Ray Brown and  Friends at the Loa in Santa Monica Friday and Saturday -- has been to Europe  three times and is set to go to Australia in a week, after he takes part in a  jazz cruise from Vancouver, Canada, to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Long as they keep paying, I'm ready to go," said Holloway, whose latest LP is  "Locksmith Blues" (Concord). "It helps take care of some of my bills and lets  me live in the manner to which I'm not accustomed."  </P> <P> While in Los Angeles a few weeks ago for a two-night engagement with Jack  Sheldon at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, Holloway got a call to do  part of the sound track for David Lynch's latest film, "Wild at Heart," which  is filming in locations around town.  </P> <P> "Mark Roswell, the music supervisor, had heard me play at the (now-defunct)  Parisian Room (a Los Angles club where Holloway was musical director from  1967-82) and wanted to use me," Holloway said. "So pianist Dave MacKay, bassist  Kenny Wild and drummer Joe Porcaro played a tune of Kenny's, a blues with a  bridge, that's used behind a striptease dancer at a restaurant."  </P> <P> The tune, "Blues Cake Jazz Icing," was changed slightly by the saxman. "(Music  coordinator) Cheryl Churchill asked me if I could come up with a different  beginning, I said, 'Yeah,' and when I played it, she said, 'That was exactly  what I wanted,' " Holloway said. Wild will still receive full writer's credit,  he added.  </P> <P> If there's anything left unfulfilled for Holloway, who has toured with greats  like George Benson, Sonny Stitt and Clark Terry, it's a trip to Japan. "That  would really put the icing on the cake," he said, pun intended.  </P></p>

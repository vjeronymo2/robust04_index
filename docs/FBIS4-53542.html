			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk from the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The </F> Fundamental Principle in Socialism That Should Be Consistently  Maintained in the Revolution and Construction"]    [Text] In his immortal classic work "The Historic Lessons  in Socialist Construction and the General Line of our Party,"  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il elucidated that the  fundamental principle should be consistently maintained in order  to defend and protect the socialist cause.    The idea and theory of dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on  consistently maintaining the socialist principle in revolution  and construction illuminated a revolutionary path that enables  us to thoroughly smash the imperialists' anti-socialist  maneuvers and to tenaciously defend, protect, and carry to  accomplishment the socialist cause.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The  principle of socialism should be consistently maintained in the  revolution and construction to carry to accomplishment the  socialist cause.    The dear comrade leader clearly expounded the fundamental  principle that should be consistently maintained in socialist  construction. The fundamental principle that should be  consistently maintained in socialist construction is to  thoroughly protect and embody the independent demands and  interest of the popular masses.    The socialist society is a society that has embodied the  natural demand of the popular masses to eliminate exploitation  and oppression of the people by the people and to live all  equally independently. The course of building socialism and  communism is the course of realizing the total independence of  the popular masses.    Although circumstances and conditions of struggle in the  course of building socialism may change, the fundamental demand  and position of the popular masses to achieve independence will  never change. Therefore, the party of the working class should  tenaciously defend the independent demand and interest of the  popular masses while leading socialist construction, and should  resolve all problems raised in the revolution and construction  thoroughly in accordance with the fundamental interest of the  popular masses.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has clearly elucidated  the issue as to how one should carry out work to maintain the  fundamental principle of socialism.    For one to maintain the fundamental principle of socialism,  which defends and protects the independent demand and  fundamental interest of the popular masses, one should  strengthen the party of the working class organizationally and  ideologically, and should firmly ensure the party's guidance  over the revolution and construction. In addition, one should  constantly enhance the role and functions of the socialist  regime; should adhere to and develop the socialist ownership,  and should tenaciously struggle against the imperialists.    This is the revolutionary principle which we cannot concede  even to a slightest degree. The independent demand and interest  of the popular masses can be firmly ensured and achieved only by  the leadership of the party of the working class.    The working class is the class that has embodied  independence  at the highest level and that struggles more tenaciously than  any other class for achieving the independent demands and  interest of the popular masses.    For the working class and for its party, there cannot be any  other demands and interest than the demands and interest of the  popular masses. The class mission of the working class is to  thoroughly defend and achieve the demands and interest of the  popular masses.    Therefore, it is an indispensable demand to maintain  consistently and thoroughly the embodiment of the revolutionary  principle in socialist construction to strengthen the party and  firmly ensure the party's leadership.    It is a firm guarantee for thoroughly adhering to the  principle of socialism to strengthen the socialist regime and  enhance its role and functions.    The socialist regime is a commanding system that represents  the sovereignty of the popular masses--the masters of socialist  society--and manages overall domains of socialist life in a  unified manner.    Thanks to the socialist regime, the independence of the  popular masses is to be ensured, creative activities are to be  carried out in a unified manner, and socialist construction is  to be pushed for.    Only when we strengthen the socialist regime, can we always  dampen the swell of antirevolutionary factors by using  revolutionary weapons under the condition that the imperialists  are continuously maneuvering against socialism.    To maintain [kosu] and develop socialist ownership is also  important in holding fast to socialist principles. If we fail  to maintain socialist ownership and tend toward private  ownership, we would completely destroy the socialist system  itself and, as a result, the working people would become slaves  of capital.    Therefore, we should constantly develop socialist ownership  by evolving cooperative ownership into all-people ownership  [hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuero chopkunsikinun  pangboburo] while continuously enhancing the guiding role of  all-people ownership.    Revolutionary principles in socialist construction are  importantly shown in one's attitude toward imperialists. It is  particularly important to thoroughly hold fast to an anti-  imperialist position under the situation in which imperialists  are strengthening the antirevolutionary maneuver to annihilate  [wahae] and destroy [malsal] the socialist cause. Accordingly,  we should continue to struggle against imperialism.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il not only elucidated  questions raised in adhering to socialist principles, but also  clearly explained that one should not abandon the basic  principle of socialism under any condition and that even the  slightest concession of the basic socialist principle would  result in the grave situation that the party itself will be  destroyed and socialism will be frustrated.    We should creatively develop our line and policies in  accordance with the changing environments and conditions for the  revolutionary struggle in the course of building socialism,  communism. Under any situation, however, the working-class  party shouldering the people's destinies should not deviate from  revolutionary principles and the working-class line.    To abandon revolutionary principles in the struggle in  between socialism and capitalism means surrender and  degeneration. If one vacillates in a temporary obstacle, yields  under the imperialists' pressure, and abandons revolutionary  principles after making a gradual concession of them, it will  result in an unimaginably grave consequence.    In adhering to the basic principle of socialism, it is  particularly important to heighten our caution against pluralism  being blared by imperialists and to thoroughly oppose it. The  so-called pluralism cannot be allowed in socialist society.  Ideological freedom, a multi-party political system, and varied  ownership under the mask of pluralism are political methods of a  capitalist society that is governed by a struggle for existence  based on individualism and liberalism.    As the socialist society is based on collectivism, and its  heart [saengmyong] is the unity of popular masses, socialism and  pluralism cannot coexist. Introduction of pluralism in  socialism would encourage individualism and liberalism, which  will infringe upon common social interests, destroy the unity of  popular masses, and create social disorder and confusion. The  allowance of ideological freedom and a multi-party political  system will result in the destruction of socialist ground.    An ideological struggle is the prelude of a political  struggle, which finally develops into a power struggle. If  antisocialist ideological trends are dissipated due to  ideological liberalization and antirevolutionary political  parties' activities are guaranteed by the allowance of democracy  represented by the so-called multi-party system, the class  enemies and reactionaries will raise their heads and try to  conquer the people's regime.    If we generally accept the capitalist political methods and  economic system after completely abandoning socialist  principles, being obsessed by an illusion of capitalism without  faith in socialism, socialism will be frustrated and capitalism  will revive.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught  [karuchisimyonso]  us that only one step backward from socialist principles will  lead one to make 100 steps of concession and retrogression, and  stressed that we should keep them to the last under any  condition.    Embodied herein is our party's revolutionary position and  iron-strong will to consummate the socialist, communist cause  under the banner of the chuche idea while boldly overcoming any  severe circumstance and trial.    The justness of the ideological theory on invariably  adhering  to socialist principles in the revolution and construction is  clearly proven by specific realities in our country. All party  members and working people should firmly keep the basic  principle of socialism, whose justness and vitality are  obviously being demonstrated, and should faithfully uphold the  leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by meteorologist Lyudmila Parshina: "Spring the </F> Beautiful"]    [Text] The weather during the last winter month on the  territory of the European part of Russia was mostly cold. The  coldest temperatures were registered closer to the middle of the  month, when the freezing Arctic air penetrated all the way to  southernmost latitudes.    On clear nights the temperature in many cities in Russia and  the Baltic countries dropped below the absolute lowest values.  On 12-13 February new cold records were registered in Kursk,  Voronezh, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Astrakhan,  Krasnodar, and Kaliningrad; in Ufa on 12 February the cold  temperature reached the -40 degree mark.    Thus February has lived up to one of its names--"the severe  month." However, as the end of winter approached, there were few  blizzards and snowstorms. Only during the last days of the month  did the snow swirl descend. Still, despite the cold, on clear  days we were cheered by the sun and the anticipation of imminent  spring.    Ahead of us is March--the morning of the year. True, the  first half of March is still winter in the middle belt of Russia  and the north of the country: solid snow cover, frequent  blizzards and snowstorms. On a considerable part of the European  territory of the country, however, the average 24-hour  temperature climbs above the freezing mark, and in the southern  parts of the country (Sochi) it rises above five degrees.    The day of 22 March is the spring equinox, the beginning of  spring astronomically. The number of sunshine hours increases.  The snow begins to melt.    In the north and the middle belt of Russia there is still  ice  cover on rivers in March; in the south of the European territory  (the lower part of Volga, Don, and Dnieper) the ice begins to  break.    Even more noticeable than in February will be the increase  in  daylight hours. And the sun's warmth reaching the earth's  surface will be twice as great as in February. This is a  dangerous time for orchards. The trunks of fruit-bearing trees  crack because of sharp fluctuations in temperature over the  24-hour period. If the orchard is neglected at this time and the  trees are not stained with bleach, they will be traumatized and  may die altogether.</p>

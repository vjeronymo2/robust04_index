			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UN report paints grim picture for disabled The world's 290m disabled people suffer appalling discrimination, abuse and neglect and in developing countries only 3 per cent of those in need receive conventional rehabilitation services, according a United Nations report published today*. The report, timed to coincide with the first UN International Day of Disabled Persons, says the number of people with severe or moderate disabilities is expected to double to 573m by the year 2025 because of rising population and increasing numbers of old people, from 5.5 per cent of the total population to 6.7 per cent. Of these, 435m will live in developing countries, compared with 200m today. Every fourth family in a developing country has a disabled family member, the report estimates. In some countries babies born with a disability are put to death. Disabled children often die early from neglect. Providing professional rehabilitation services for all who need them in developing countries would even now cost Dollars 60bn or Dollars 1,000 per person, the report notes. Providing home helps for the increased number of elderly in rich nations could cost 13 per cent of total national income by 2025. Dr Einar Helander, the report's author, argues instead for a 'common-sense' community-based approach within a national framework. 'We have to create a caring society,' he says. 'The family and the community are the best resource.' *Prejudice and dignity: An introduction to community-based rehabilitation, by Einar Helander.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Thailand and Growth: Luck Will Run Out Soon"] </F>   [Text] East Asian economic growth has attracted a great  deal of interest recently. Two top researchers at the Thailand  Development Research Institute (TDRI) have concluded that  Thailand is on a muddled path towards economic prosperity.    "Unlike other newly-industrialized countries in Asia, where  governments helped repair market failures, Thailand has relied  on the market to overcome government failures. This formula  will no longer suffice, given technological, environmental and  human resource challenges at hand," concluded TDRI's Scott  Christensen and Amma Sayamwala.    The state is indeed struggling to keep up with the demands  of  a rapidly changing economy. The problems are too well apparent  as the two researchers noted: "Even though Thailand has enjoyed  some success, it is not well prepared for the next stage of  industrialization. Its investments in secondary education and  its output of technicians and engineers fall seriously short of  the country's needs. Moreover, the state is institutionally  ill-equipped to assume the monitoring, enforcement, and social  welfare functions for regulating an advanced industrial economy."    So what should we do?  <H5>  State intervention? </H5>   The two researchers stopped short of advocating increased  state intervention in the economy but called for more effective  government action in those sectoral policy areas where the  private sector will increasingly rely upon the government to act.    These policy areas include education, worker training,  public  health social welfare, monitoring and enforcing environmental  and safety regulations and supporting and perhaps coordinating  scientific research.    All these, they argue, do not need more active state  intervention but rather more vision to make intelligent  decisions, acquire a better information base and initiate better  coordination between the private and public sectors.    In a parallel tone, Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam  Commercial Bank and former top economist at the Bank of Thailand  suggested that the government should make it a policy to create  "national awareness" about technology upgrading, and build up  skilled labour, in order for the country to compete more  effectively in international markets.    The era of cheap labour is gone, Olan said. "National  awareness should be made concrete... There may be tax incentives  for the private sector to undertake manpower and on-the-job  trainings," Olan said.    While consensus has emerged on the target areas, the speed  to  which the government is responding is slow and varies between  ministries and agencies. Some are doing better than others but  an overall policy strategy and direction is still lacking on the  part of the government.    Also, profound economic changes are taking place within the  Asean region where there is now a high standard of living and a  rapid process of industrialization. However, uneven development  between and within nations persists and presents numerous  contradictory economic problems that ultimately explain the  extent of labour migration that is occurring within the region.    Thailand is both an exporter and importer of labour, but yet  migration push and pull forces have yet to be fully addressed by  the government. As the world enters the 21st century, it is  inevitable that international labour migration flows will  intensify within Asean itself.  <H5>  Brain-drain phenomenon </H5>   While the government complains about the rapid brain-drain  phenomenon in the country, especially among new engineering  graduates, nothing is made to prevent them from leaving Thailand  to take up lucrative offers from multi-national companies.    It is easy to urge Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to exert his  leadership in order to create a more effective state. However,  his performance in the past two years leaves much to be desired.  Moreover he lacks a vision for Thailand in the 21st century  unlike many of his counterparts in Asean. Perhaps, more  pressure should be exerted on certain forward-looking ministers  to take up this challenge.    Without doubt, Thailand must put its house in order first  before it begins to pull its weight in the 21st century. If it  fails to do so, sad to say within a few years it might not be  able to keep pace with its vigorous neighbors.</p>

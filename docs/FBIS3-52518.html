			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel has presented the PLO with amendments to the  Cairo draft paper on the Gaza and Jericho withdrawal  arrangements. Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says a  new document, bearing the signature of Major General Amnon  Shahaq, was relayed to Dr. Nabil Sha'th. This document  introduces changes to four of the clauses from what is defined  as the accepted format. The changes relate to the fate of  private Arab-owned land in the Qatif Bloc; the safeguarding of  roads from the Allenby Bridge terminal to Jericho; the  arrangements at the border crossing points in Rafah and Jericho,  as well as to other issues.    Well-informed Palestinian and Israeli sources this evening  confirmed these amendments have been introduced. Israel is  arguing that if Yasir 'Arafat wants to introduce changes, it too  can demand changes.    A Palestinian source told our correspondent the negotiations  can be wrapped-up in three weeks -- that is, after the  Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES;  </P> <P> BEER MAKES HEADWAY AS DUPLEX ATTRACTION  </P> <P> Beer is becoming a big deal in restaurants. Some places pride themselves on  their variety, offering all sorts of exotic brews from faraway places. Some  actually make it on the premises and prove it by proudly displaying their  expensive equipment.  </P> <P> But one of the best beers I've had recently is being quietly served at Duplex,  where there is neither a long list nor expensive equipment. Chef Mark Carter  does, however, offer his homemade "Carter's Little Pils" in specially marked  glasses. And if you want a burger with your brew, you'll be glad to know that  the restaurant's new lunch menu is featuring those as well.  </P> <P>  Duplex, 1930 Hillhurst Avenue, Los Angeles. (213) 663-2430. -- R. R.  </P></p>

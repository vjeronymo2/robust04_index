			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (16): New ideas improve an old system - The US COMPUTER technology has long been at the forefront of change in the operation of the US banking industry. From the introduction of the first automated teller machines (ATMs) in the 1970s through to the widespread introduction of the 'debit card' over the past decade, computer systems have been instrumental to maintaining the breathtaking pace of change in what is - by its very nature - a somewhat conservative industry. In spite of all this change, however, most US banking customers still prefer to do some things the old way. One might be forgiven for thinking, for example, that the growth of interest in EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and consumer debit cards would have started to make the banking industry a great deal more paperless. But that would be to ignore the familiarity and friendliness of the cheque. According to the financial services division of computer giant IBM, around 50bn personal and business cheques are processed by the US banking system every year and there is no sign of a significant decline in the use of cheques. For this reason, the banks are taking another look at the way they handle cheques. The cheques are often proofed manually and then added up, using elderly 10-key adding machines before being finally entered into the bank's main computer system. IBM, for example, has developed what it calls a 'proof of deposit' system based on image processing and optical character recognition technology. It operates by first scanning all the cheques into an image-processing system and storing an electronic image of each cheque and then using optical character recognition (OCR) software to read the details of the transaction represented by the cheque. IBM claims that its ImagePlus High-Performance (HPTS) Proof-of-Deposit (POD) system is able to read and record more than half of the handwritten and machine-printed dollar amounts that appear on image-captured cheque faces. It is also supposed to balance deposits automatically and identify illegible amounts and route them to a keyboard operator who can look at the on-screen image of the paperwork concerned and correct it accordingly. The IBM system has been undergoing extensive trials at big North American banks in recent months and the company expects to start shipping it in December. Among the institutions involved in these trials were the Royal Bank of Canada, Key Bank, Mellon Bank and the Bank of America. 'Longer term, image (processing technology) has the potential to give the entire industry a higher quality level for its customers,' says Mr Gil Arbuckle, a senior vice-president and cheque services manager at Mellon Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. According to Mr Bill Gee, manager of the Royal Bank of Canada's item processing services in systems and technology, this kind of technology is vital to his organisation's long-term strategy. 'Proof of deposit is our focus today,' he says. '(These systems) allow us to invest in a platform on which we can build new image applications and offer new customer services in the years ahead.' Cost savings and productivity improvements can come from all parts of the cheque-handling process. Most North American banks, for example, send customers back the originals of their processed cheques once they have been deposited through the banking system. These used cheques are generally sent out with bank statements - and must be physically sorted and enclosed with the bank statements in envelopes with which they are sent out. Using image-processing, an electronic image of the cheques can be stored with the bank statement information and printed out along with the bank statement when it is prepared. Image processing also offers the US banking industry other gains - helping them to handle all manner of paperwork without paper. It could be used to handle mortgage loan processing, credit card billing inquiries, commercial lending, mutual funds management, trust management and letters of credit. The beauty of this technology is that it offers banks a 'halfway house' between entirely automated, paperless operation - which many customers are still not entirely comfortable with - and the inefficient, over-staffed, paper-laden systems of old. When using image processing systems, paper still plays a vital role in getting information about financial transactions to the banks. But once a paper document arrives at the bank, it immediately becomes a computer image that can be passed around the corner or around the world electronically in an instant. This not only means that the banks have greater flexibility in how they handle documents, it also means that the work represented by those documents need not necessarily be handled at the place where the documents are physically stored. If one branch or department is over-burdened with financial documents to process, another can help out by having the electronic image of those documents sent over a wide area network or leased line. The work can then be completed by the other department and sent back to the place it came from. Finally, image processing could make life a lot easier for bank customers. If, for example, a bank held a sample signature, a colour photograph or even a spoken voice sample as part of its worldwide database, any customer from any of that bank's branches worldwide could prove who they were easily and carry out more complex transactions than would normally be allowed from a foreign branch office. Such a system also improves security for the bank - as it is much harder to forge a face, voice and signature than it is to forge the signature by itself.</p>

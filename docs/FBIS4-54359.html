			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A tax reform subcommittee of  the ruling coalition is expected to keep the maximum tax rate on  personal income unchanged at 65 percent in working out tax cut  plans to take effect in 1995, council officials said Thursday  [26 May].    Under the plan, the income tax rate would be 50 percent and  the residential tax rate would be 15 percent, the officials said.    The plan would also continue the present progressive tax  system of levying the income tax in five stages of between 10  and 50 percent and the residential tax in three stages of  between 5 and 15 percent.    The panel's discussions will now focus on a possible raise  in  the minimum taxable income to lighten the tax burden for people  with low-incomes and an expansion of an income bracket to which  a tax rate of 10-20 percent would apply, the officials said.    The latter proposal would reduce the tax burden for  taxpayers  with annual incomes of between 7 million and 12 million yen.    The government's tax commission last November proposed that  the maximum tax rate on personal income be cut to 50 percent  from the present 65 percent.    The proposal was widely criticized as benefiting the rich.    The 65 percent tax rate currently applies to taxable income  of more than 20 million yen, after various deductions.</p>

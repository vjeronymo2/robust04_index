			<p>CSO     [Text] Sharp developed technology for oscillation with a  high-output semiconductor laser which emits 680 nanometer red  light. By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window,  to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the  world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat  generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal  absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the  reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical  discs. Sharp will continue to prevent the deterioration of  interior elements and such and also plans to apply this  technology to short wavelength lasers, which are suitable for  high density recording.    The most distinguishing feature of the newly developed laser  is the window which was grown by the MOCVD [metal organic  chemical vapor deposition] method on a laser element composed of  aluminum, gallium, indium, and phosphorus. The window has a  composition similar to that of the laser element. Because it is  possible to control the light absorption at the end surface, it  is possible for the laser to have a long life span. When 50  milliwatt lasers were compared, the one with the window was able  to extend its lifetime by more than 10 times that of the one  without the window.    When a semiconductor laser's output is increased, the laser  element's end surface absorbs light, heat is generated, and the  crystal structure breaks down. Up until now, the optical output  for a red laser came to a halt at 200 milliwatts.    The red semiconductor laser is used for compact disc [CD]  reading and for minidisc [MD] reading and writing. A 700  nanometer type with an output from 30-50 milliwatts has been put  to practical use. The volume of information, which includes  imagery and voice and such, increases the need for the  commercialization of shortwave lasers that can record with  higher speed and more density. The company intends to apply this  element design to short wavelength lasers with high output.</p>

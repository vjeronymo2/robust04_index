			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Minorco bids for Hudson Bay Mining MINORCO, the international mining group, is coming to the rescue of Canada's Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting by offering to buy the struggling northern Manitoba base metal producer from its 56 per cent-owned US subsidiary, Inspiration Resources. Minorco, part of the empire controlled by South Africa's Oppenheimer family, has offered to pay CDollars 100m (USDollars 86.9m) in cash for Hudson Bay, unless Inspiration finds another buyer before July 1. Minorco will also advance CDollars 20m in interim financing for a CDollars 187m project to modernise Hudson Bay's facilities and comply with Canadian environmental regulations. Without the modernisation, the new anti-pollution rules would force the closure of most of Hudson Bay's operations in early 1994. Inspiration and Hudson Bay have so far been unable to secure financing for the project. Minorco said that its pledge of interim financing is conditional on the Canadian and Manitoba governments agreeing to contribute CDollars 80m towards the modernisation project.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 19 (BTA) -- French President  Francois Mitterrand, who is on an official visit here, delivered  a nearly two-hour address at the Bulgarian Parliament. "Who  could think five years ago that in 1994 I would speak in front  of a Bulgarian Parliament elected by democratic means, but even  then one could feel the first signs of the coming change,"  President Mitterrand said, recalling his previous visit to this  country in January 1989, several months before the downfall of  the communist regime. The French president came to Bulgaria on  condition that he would meet dissidents. He stressed that he  has good memories from this country, from his meetings with  Bulgarian students whose courage he then admired. Often Mr.  Mitterrand's address was interrupted by applause.    "I want to express my admiration and respect for how much  you  have accomplished in such short terms, because you had to build  a new society, starting from nothing," the French guest said.  He stressed on his respect for the Bulgarian Parliament several  times. Mr. Mitterrand spoke in general terms, giving also his  personal evaluation, about the democratic values, freedom and  the hardships accompanying an economic reform.    The French president stressed that Bulgaria will be the  first  East European country to preside over the Council of Europe's  Committee of Ministers. "Believe me, both Bulgaria and Europe  have made a progress," he said. The speaker went on to say that  France is most supportive of a speedy ratification of a number  of accords Central and East European states have signed with the  European Union (EU). He said that France may be expected to  ratify the agreement on Bulgaria's association with the EU by  the end of April. Mr. Mitterrand pledged to insist that this  issue be settled in the first days of the French Parliament's  session. These words were met with loud applause. The French  president evaluated in highly positive terms this country's  desire to join the European states. "Europe belongs to you as  much as it belongs to us," Mr. Mitterrand said. He said that  Bulgaria has already found decisions to unsolvable problems and  went on to cite as an example the peaceful co-existence of  Bulgarians with the Turkish-speaking community here. "The  Balkan Peninsula will probably hold you up as a model," the  French president stressed, adding that Bulgaria could have a  positive influence on the other Balkan countries. He praised  highly Bulgaria's stand on the Yugo-conflict and the strict  observation of the UN sanctions which costed this country a lot.  "You lost profits but win international recognition and  Europe's respect," he said.    "Any European country which sees a threat should rely on the  solidarity of the other democratic states," President Mitterrand  said, commenting on the Partnership for Peace plan. According  to him, it is unthinkable that Bulgaria could face any threat  and not have the support of the other democratic countries. Mr.  Mitterrand said that France had tabled a European security pact  to be put to discussion in Paris this April. He expressed his  hope that this conference would turn into a new forum, which  Bulgaria will choose to join. The speaker also expounded his  idea for an European confederation.    The French president traced back in history the roots of the  Bulgarian-French relations and commented on their future. He  concluded his address expressing the hope that Bulgarian  President Zhelev will pay an official visit to France sometime  soon.    Introducing French President Mitterrand to the Bulgarian  MP's, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that  they themselves could see how far Bulgaria had reached along the  road of deep democratic changes. During his visit at the  Bulgarian Parliament, Mr. Mitterrand was accompanied by his wife  Danielle Mitterrand. Bulgarian President Zhelev, Prime Minister  Berov and ministers were also present to hear President  Mitterrand's address.    Since 1990, the Bulgarian Parliament have been addressed by  Israeli President Chaim Herzog (June 1991), King Juan Carlos II  of Spain (May 1993) and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  (July 1993).</p>

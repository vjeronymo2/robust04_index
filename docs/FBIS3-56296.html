			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Documents with regard to the Russian-U.S. talks are  to be signed in the Kremlin today. Our observer Yuliy Semenov  has the details and is on the phone:    [Semenov] Hello again from the Kremlin. The Kremlin is  magnificent, as ever, but both presidents and their assistants  have other things on their minds, working hard since early  morning.    Several minutes ago the trilateral meeting smoothly turned  into a bilateral one. Documents on the results of the meeting  between the three presidents connected with the problem of  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament have been signed: a joint  statement, which has the status of a treaty, an appendix to it,  and letters that the delegations exchanged, setting out their  specific views.    The essence of what has taken place is that the agreement  that has been reached reflects a balance of interests. Each  side had to make some concessions, but the final result is a  victory for all--a victory for the principle of the  non-proliferation of nuclear arms.    Two hundred nuclear warheads will be transported from  Ukraine  into Russia over the next 10 months, and the withdrawal  timetable will be agreed on. It is not being made public  because it is a working schedule.    The United States and Russia extend security guarantees to  Ukraine. Great Britain, as is known, has already joined in  this. Russia will compensate Ukraine in an equitable and honest  way--as Boris Yeltsin put it--for its nuclear fuel, and a  proportion of Ukraine's financial debt to Russia is wiped off as  part of this compensation.    For its part, the United States will substantially assist  Russia and Ukraine in the implementation of the accords, and  this naturally includes material assistance. All the  participants in the meeting have appraised these results as a  breakthrough.    Replying to journalists' questions following the signing of  the documents--a brief meeting took place--Yeltsin said that  this was a historic day for the nuclear security of the whole  world and for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and was  an important step in world disarmament.    Bill Clinton's view is that by agreeing to sign these  documents and to resolve problems, Ukraine has made its position  in the world weightier, having strengthened the security of the  United States, Russia, Ukraine, and world security as a whole.  Clinton said that the potential for nuclear espionage,  terrorism, and blackmail has been diminished.    This will make it possible both for Russia and Ukraine to  raise their living standards for their citizens. His view is  that Ukrainian prestige will grow in the world; more people and  states will wish to cooperate with Ukraine, and Ukraine will be  altogether better off as a result.    Finally, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that his  view was that this step would help strengthen everyone's  security and the security of Ukraine in particular, because it  was precisely in the U.S. and Russian guarantees--their nuclear  umbrella--that Ukraine saw its security. If we are friends with  Ukraine [as heard] and Russia, nothing will threaten us.    Currently, as I am speaking, the Russian-American dialogue  has been resumed--a plenary session of both delegations with all  officials present is taking place in the Yekaterinskiy Hall in  the Kremlin.    A whole package of U.S.-Russian documents will subsequently  be signed, to be followed by a news conference, during which we  will be given complete information.</p>

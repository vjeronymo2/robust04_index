			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The results of the recent municipal polls in Turkey  and the success of the Islamic Rifah -- Prosperity -- Party in  some of its cities, including Ankara and Istanbul, have  (?entailed) sensitivity and reaction from the country's  statesmen and government officials.    The Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, in a meeting with a  group of editors from the country's highly circulated newspapers  and magazines this week, stressed that the central government  would not allow measures repugnant to its laic [as heard]  policy. He said that the administration of Istanbul, too, is  the responsibility of the government rather than that of the  municipality.    Also, Turkey's interior minister, in a similar statement,  has  sounded a warning to the new Islamic mayors of Ankara and  Istanbul, as well as of other cities in the country. He  declared that they would probably be prosecuted in the event of  not adhering to the policy of the separation of politics from  religion.    Undoubtedly, such statements from Turkish officials arise  from their concern over the impact of the assumption of power by  the Islamic Prosperity Party in some major cities of Turkey. In  fact the acceptance of such an issue -- based on the secular  system of government in Turkey -- is something which can hardly  be likeable to the country's laic circles.    At any rate, the reality cannot be overlooked that the  outcome of the recent municipality elections has shown that,  despite 70 years of sovereignty of un-Islamic laws and  propaganda about secularism, Islamic trends in Turkey are on the  rise and this is something which has put the secular government  of Turkey at loggerheads with the Muslims of the country.    However, aside from the various reasons that have led to the  recent election success of the Islamic-based Prosperity Party,  which has been allowed to have political activities, it can be  said that the frustration that the Turkish Muslim people have  with respect to the potential of the country's secular and  liberal parties in overcoming the social, economic, and  political problems of Turkey has also acted as a main factor in  shifting the voters toward the Prosperity Party. Now, in view  of these considerations, the secular circles in Turkey are faced  with the question and concern as to what extent the Islamic  trends in that country are going to influence the economic,  social, and political aspects in the future. Besides, according  to these secular circles, there is no guarantee that, during the  future parliamentary elections, the Muslim people of Turkey will  turn to the Islamic-based Prosperity Party.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Manufacturers protected already - at a cost Sir, Claude Imbert of Le Point suggests that we 'extend to other sectors the system of Community preference already in place in agriculture' (the Common Agricultural Policy); and that 'we (the EC) should not fear to bring in quotas' to restrict imports of manufactured products ('Visions of Europe', June 1). I am sorry to have to disabuse Mr Imbert of his beguiling notion of a CAP for industry, but the truth is that the Community has already been following this policy for years. Euro-champions such as Philips and Thompson have been granted huge subsidies while import quotas and anti-dumping duties cover a huge swathe of manufactured products ranging from steel to CD players and cars to machine tools. Indeed, there are very few goods which are not covered by some kind of EC import barrier. The result has been that Europe's industry has become steadily more uncompetitive, and less and less able to compete outside of its high-cost, protected European base. A bit like the CAP, really. Philip Oppenheim, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

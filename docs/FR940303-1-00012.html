			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (e): Investigation of Additional, Different or Ongoing Crimes or Civil Violations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph is similar to, but not identical with,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;77.7(d) of the previously published proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is ``offense-specific.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> McNeil  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2207 (1991). Thus, a defendant whose Sixth Amendment rights have attached as to one offense remains subject to questioning, whether direct or covert, regarding uncharged crimes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.; Maine  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Moulton <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 474 U.S. 159, 180 n.16 (1985);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mitcheltree <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 940 F.2d 1329, 1342 (10th Cir. 1991);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terzado-Madruga <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 897 F.2d 1099, 1111&hyph;12 (11th Cir. 1990);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chu <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 779 F.2d 356, 368 (7th Cir. 1985);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grego <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 724 F.2d 701, 703 (8th Cir. 1984). The proposed rule employs an analogous approach, permitting  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented party has neither been arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional, different or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is typically one of three varieties: (1) Conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes that are intended to impede the trial of the charged crime or unlawful conduct, such as subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct that is a continuation of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or scheme to defraud that continues past the time of indictment. The new or additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at the time of the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By definition, communications pursuant to this exception will take place when the represented party is the subject of pending criminal or civil enforcement charges for which he or she is represented by counsel. Government attorneys must take extreme care to avoid violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel whenever they invoke this exception in the criminal context. In particular, care must be taken to avoid the deliberate elicitation of incriminating information regarding any pending criminal charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f): Imminent Threat to Safety or Life <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Supreme Court has recognized that, in certain limited situations, otherwise applicable constitutional requirements may be suspended by the need to guard against threats to public safety. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Warden  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hayden <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 387 U.S. 294, 298&hyph;99 (1967) (warrantless search permissible when delay would endanger lives of officers and citizens);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New York  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quarles <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 467 U.S. 649, 657 (1984) (``the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Miranda <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). Paragraph (f) recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exception has three requirements: (1) The attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example, the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However, information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with Constitutional limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

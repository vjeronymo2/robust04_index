			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol May 27 TASS -- The decree of Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk to reorganize the Crimean security  service into the Ukrainian security service's main department in  the Crimea and subordinate it directly to Kiev "is illegal in  all respects," Chairman of the Crimean Security Service Vladimir  Lepikhov told ITAR-TASS today.    In his opinion, the decree will not help to raise the  efficiency of the department or ensure security of the  law-governed democratic Crimean Republic.    Judging by official statements of the Ukrainian side, the  Ukrainian Security Service does nothing to destabilize situation  in the Crimea, said the service chairman. At the same time,  movement of materiel and deployment of hospitals claimed by Kiev  as an arrangement planned for the first half of the year run  counter to the striving to preserve tranquility in the Crimea  and give grounds to mass media for stirring up tension. The  ongoing reinforcement of the Ukrainian National Guard units in  the Crimea both with materiel and personnel does the same.    All these steps provoke concern of Crimean residents,  parliament deputies and republican heads, said Lepikhov. It  would be better to abstain from these actions or change their  form, he added.    In the opinion of Lepikhov, the only civilized way out is  boosted negotiations with the Crimea. The intensive dialogue  should aim to settle disputable issues related to the restored  validity of the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992,  coordination of this decision with Ukraine at all levels, and  conclusion of corresponding treaties and agreements and  delegation of powers. All efforts should aim to reach a  consensus, he stressed.</p>

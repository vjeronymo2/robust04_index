			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (1): Stark choice - clean up or be wiped out - If the chemical industry fails to respond to environmental pressure, legislation in the developed world could impose further curbs. So it has launched a global initiative called Responsible Care to regain public confidence Seveso in 1976, Bhopal in 1984, Basle in 1986. The litany of chemical companies' accidents makes doleful reading. The sector's poor environmental performance has been directly responsible for its reputation ebbing to an all-time low. In the UK, approval for the chemical industry has declined from more than 50 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s to less than 20 per cent last year. The declining popularity of its chemical companies has been mirrored by that of its counterparts around the globe. 'The chemical sector is rightfully cast among the problem industries,' concedes Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman of Monsanto. A consensus has formed that the industry must boost both its performance and image. 'It must improve its environmental performance not because it is being altruistic - although as corporate citizens we do care. It must improve out of self-interest,' says Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals manager for health, safety and the environment. If the industry fails to clean up its act, it runs the risk of being legislated out of existence, argues Mr David Buzzelli, director responsible for the environment at Dow Chemical. 'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive. Planning approvals for investment will be refused, making sites uneconomic. Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, adding further to costs. The chemicals industry could be legislated to the point of economic non-viability,' he says. Ever-increasing volumes of environmentally-related legislation and bureaucracy are adding to costs at a time when chemicals groups can least afford them. Yet the groups plead that legislation is seldom the most effective or appropriate way of improving the sector's environmental performance. 'The answer to the problem is not more regulation. Command and control will fail because regulations seldom achieve what they set out to accomplish. All that happens is that lawyers become involved, taking up time and money, without solving the problem,' says Mr Reding at Monsanto. The industry's riposte is corporate environmentalism. 'We must move from a command and control phase to a voluntary phase,' argues Mr Reding. 'Self-regulation is best because each company knows its own processes and the most effective way of reducing emissions,' says Mr Jacques Puechal, president of Cefic, the European Council of the Chemical Industry, and chief executive of Elf-Atochem. 'That is the most practical approach and the least costly to the business. That also means the consumer will not have to pay more and more for stupid legislation. We have to prove to society that the best way to solve a problem is before it hits the table of the bureaucrats. 'We are trying to be pro-active. We have to show that the sector can make progress by itself,' says Mr Puechal. Around the world, the industry is trying to add some shine to its tarnished image and regain public trust through its programme of Responsible Care. This involves measuring emissions in a credible way, improving environmental performance and then communicating that performance, warts and all, to the public. The programme was initially created by the Canadian chemical industry, was adopted by the US, migrated over the Atlantic to Europe, and has now proliferated worldwide. The path to Responsible Care has not been easy, however. Convincing companies in the industry that it was worth the effort and often considerable expense was far from simple. 'It was agony for the first two years,' admits Mr John Cox, director-general of the UK's Chemical Industries Association. 'But I think the UK is now leading the global movement both on performance indicators and management standards.' The key to the process is measuring and then improving environmental performance. 'We don't want to put out propaganda. There is no point communicating, if you don't have anything of substance to communicate,' warns Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment at Ciba. Most companies responded to increasing environmental pressure during the 1970s by investing in end-of-pipe technologies. Now they are moving towards waste-minimisation. 'Treating waste is expensive. We are trying to avoid the expense of generating the waste and the cost in the first place,' says Mr Eigenmann. Some groups have adopted the concept as their mantra. Dow, for example, has a programme called Wrap - waste reduction always pays. Such measures are not always remunerative, however. 'It would be naive to say that reducing pollution always pays,' says Mr Jurgen Muller, executive board member for the environment at Sandoz. Responsible Care also requires changes in organisational culture. 'It is not just a question of following a set of rules. It's like driving a car. There are a lot of regulations about how to drive, but we still have bad drivers. In the same way you can have companies that comply with regulations, but are not environmentally sound. An integral part of Responsible Care is a change in culture within the organisation,' says Mr Puechal. 'This cultural leap is the biggest problem that companies face,' argues Mr Jacques Salamitou, director of environment at Rhone-Poulenc. 'Site managers are fine because they have to deal with the local community. The problem is the business managers because they are not so exposed to the public.' Much of this historically secretive industry is now trying to become more open in its communications with local communities and the general public. At the end of this month, the Chemical Industries Association will launch a spectacular publicity campaign, highlighting the progress it believes it has made at 400 sites around the UK. The initiative has been cited as a model for other sectors. Indeed, the association believes other industries will have to follow the example of the chemicals industry. However, many groups are still struggling with the amount of information to provide on an individual company basis. BP Chemicals has taken a lead, publishing details of the group's entire emissions. Others, such as ICI, provide details of what they consider the most significant emissions. A few publish only indices of their emissions, insisting that trends rather than absolute figures provide a better indication of performance. Many still do not publish any details at all. The consequences of full disclosure may be less bad than many groups think. 'There were some doubts that we would provide environmental groups with information, but the external reaction has been generally good,' says Mr Reding at Monsanto. Many groups still grapple with how much information to provide on their environmental spending. Mr Joe Draper, health, safety and environment manager at Shell Chemicals in the UK, argues that defining what is related to the environment in a new plant and what is merely best practice is almost impossible. Some groups do not differentiate between spending on health, safety and the environment. 'It's difficult internally to arrive at consistent numbers, but comparing one group's spending with another there's a great deal of inexactitude,' he explains. Compiling such data is useful (see table, next page) because it demonstrates the extent of the industry's spending on the environment. It is far from clear whether present levels of spending are sustainable, given the financial plight afflicting the industry. Even at the beginning of last year, before the full impact of the slowdown of the German economy had become apparent, the three chemicals giants, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, warned the cost of domestic environmental legislation threatened to cripple the German industry. At Ciba in Switzerland, Mr Eigenmann says: 'I think the high-point - at about 25 per cent of all capital expenditure - has been reached. We can't repeat what we have just done. It may be feasible technically, but financially it's just not possible. We will now probably settle at about 15 per cent.' The problem for the industry is that the environmental goalposts continue to move. That is partly because the sector has failed to correct misunderstandings about chemicals. 'People are unfamiliar with chemicals. They call for the banning of chemicals - not even toxic chemicals. We have not done enough to show the contribution of the industry to society,' says Mr LaGraff at BP Chemicals. Given that much of the population perceives only the risk of chemicals and fails to balance that risk with their benefits, every accident brings the threat of yet more legislation, adding costs and aggravating still further the financial crisis gripping the sector. In spite of the cost of improving environmental performance, the industry cannot afford not to clean up its act. There is little doubt that the chemical industry has a long haul before it. 'It's frustrating. There are no overnight solutions,' says Mr Cox at the CIA. 'We have to show that the chemical industry is a responsible part of the community. We still have a long way to go.'</p>

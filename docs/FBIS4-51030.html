			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The United States and  Japan have reached comprise to resume their trade framework  negotiations which collapsed in February, the Clinton  administration announced today.    The talks, which used to include auto and auto parts,  insurance and government procurement, will soon be expanded to  cover such areas as financial services and intellectual  property, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor disclosed.    In the forthcoming talks with Tokyo, Washington will still  seek "objective criteria" to evaluate progress on trade,  although it will no longer seek numerical targets or managed  trade, Kantor said.    "We needed qualitative and quantitative criteria, and we  were  not seeking to manage trade or to seek numerical targets," like  quotas, Kantor said. "We have confirmed we are not seeking  numerical targets."    Objective criteria, Kantor noted, will provide the basis for  deciding if the agreements succeed or fail to meet their purpose  to achieve concrete results.    Meanwhile, Kantor stressed, "I think it's fair to say that  the two countries are moving forward on the economic area as  well as in the strategic and political areas as well."    On February 11, President Clinton and then Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach an agreement on the  trade framework talks, in which the U.S. wanted to set numerical  targets for U.S. sales to Japan.    Kantor stressed that the Clinton administration, in the  forthcoming talks, will still seek to substantially increase  sales and access to Japanese markets.</p>

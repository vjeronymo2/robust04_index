			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Santa Barbara artist Ron Robertson shows assemblage chocked with dizzying  references to the lost continent Atlantis, the Bible, classical myths and  medieval lore, not to mention a few of the soap-opera legends that have  replaced myth for contemporary man. All the info is unified by constant  allusions to political and military power and that age-old force that Marcel  Duchamp said fuels the world, Eros.  </P> <P> Most assemblage artists appropriate junk; Robertson prefers to create objects,  toys, stone and metal fragments that ape the look of wear and tear. "View From  Atlantis" looks like a rusted submarine porthole set in a frame and through  which we see a sea of old rings, oxidized gears and whatnots. In another work,  a metal creature claws on a nude, overripe madonna. Her questionable chastity  is questionably guarded by soldiers and all sorts of artillery. Right next  door, a little toy couple relax numbly in their upper-middle-class pool.  </P> <P> It's almost too easy for Robertson to make all these Barbie dolls, classical  reliefs and war toys; he can free associate and tinker himself into real hokey  ground. But his theme -- that we're an innately bellicose bunch soothing  ourselves with illusions of romantic love -- is provocative. (Heritage Gallery,  718 N. La Cienega Blvd. through May 20.)

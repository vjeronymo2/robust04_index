			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: New team faces old problems - Off the Wall The Arts Council's new team of Lord Gowrie, chairman, and Mary Allen, secretary general, went on show this week and found itself facing the same old problems: inadequate funding and the intractable question about orchestras. With the government committed to reducing its grant to the council by around Pounds 25m in real terms over the next four years, money remains the paramount problem. The council will lobby hard for more cash, but knows that the opening of the National Lottery floodgate next January could, ironically, scupper its chances. The council will have the task of channelling around Pounds 10m a month of lottery revenue into building projects for arts companies. Treasury ministers reckon that this must improve the ability of these companies to boost their incomes, and they will turn a deaf ear to pleas for more annual subsidy. Mary Allen seems to favour fewer, but better funded, Arts Council clients. But she promised this week a 'steady as we go' policy, with plenty of notice for clients who face a chop in their grants. These could well include orchestras, although no announcement is likely until December when the current review of musical life in the provinces, undertaken with the BBC, reaches its conclusion. In the meantime the council must find a new music director to replace Ken Baird, just one of the victims of the council's ill-conceived attempt to cut London orchestras. Favourite is Anthony Sargent, who currently supervises the generous arts and music budget of Birmingham Council. Is rock and roll a dying art? Given that most of the money-making rock artists are now aged around 50, why should not rock, like the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in art and fin de siecle decadent poetry in literature, be an art form that has run its natural course? The fact that those old Krakens, the Rolling Stones, are heaving themselves together for one more tour of the American stadia this summer seems to confirm the fact. They are revivalists of a moribund musical form, like Pink Floyd and the Eagles, now also both playing the US. The clincher is the question: which pop stars under 30 could currently fill Wembley Stadium? None. In fact no pop concerts are planned there this summer. An era seems to have passed. The American giants - Springsteen, Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson (none under 30) - who could take on Wembley are staying at home: perhaps they are doubtful of their pulling power. This is bad news for Wembley, which can make Pounds 3m a concert. Also bad news is that Sony, the entertainment conglomerate, is pouring money into an alternative rock venue, the Milton Keynes Bowl, which it part owns. Not surprisingly it now books its stars, like Springsteen in 1993, there rather than the Stadium. The die is cast. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has committed itself to closing in 1997 for essential re-building work which will, in four years, bring its backstage facilities from the 19th to the 21st century. By an odd coincidence English National Opera at the Coliseum also expects to close in the summer of 1997 for a Pounds 30m facelift. Both companies want to take advantage of the lottery money that will be splashing around then, although Covent Garden is eyeing the Millennium Fund while ENO fancies the cash distributed through the Arts Council. Opera lovers need not despair. Both companies have hit upon the nearby Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as their temporary home and there are already discussions revolving round the ENO popping in for a year, and the Opera House filling it for the remainder of its three years in the wilderness. The problem has been the rental asked by owners Stoll-Moss, and what to do with the current production there, Miss Saigon. But suddenly there is a new player in the game. Apollo Leisure looks likely to acquire the derelict Lyceum, almost opposite Drury Lane. For around Pounds 7m, it is suggested, the theatre could be restored to its late-19th century glory and could become an effective 2,000 plus seater which would suit Covent Garden very well. Or it could house any musical displaced from Drury Lane by the opera companies. The glimmerings of a deal are forming, and one in which the revitalised Arts Council is playing an active role.</p>

Students protesting a government scheme to allow firms to  pay  less than the legal minimum wage to young people also occupied  the railway station at Calais, northern France, for three hours,  causing serious disruption.    In Lyon, eastern France, scene of violent demonstrations  Monday and Tuesday, riot police used water cannon and fired tear  gas to disperse a group of about 100 youths and tried to arrest  another group armed with baseball bats.    Lyon students said most of them were holding meetings to  plan  for major country-wide demonstrations Friday.    In Paris, students in technical universities called a  one-day  strike. About 100 youths laid down on the tracks at  Montparnasse station, holding up high-speed (TGV) trains and  main-line expresses for two hours. Suburban services came to a  halt.    In Calais, the state railway company SNCF bussed stranded  passengers to other railway stations.    In Caen, Normandy, 1,000 students marched peacefully through  the town before heading for the capital, where they held up  trains for 30 minutes. Another group took over a nearby  motorway tollgate, allowing drivers through against a token  payment. Demonstrations were also reported at La Rochelle in  the west and at Reims in the northeast.    Students are demanding complete withdrawal of the  government's pay cut plan.    In its latest form, the plan states that young people with  diplomas or university degrees may be paid 80 percent of an  ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent  of training.    Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths  be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs  (1,000 dollars) a month. Now only unqualified youths may be  paid less than the minimum.    Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study  and  trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older  workers and replacing them with poorly paid youths.    France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of  the  work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.</p>

An article published today in EL FINANCIERO newspaper states  that "the Clinton administration today (1 February) accused its  Mexican counterpart of openly violating election laws and  committing numerous human rights abuses."    Washington's official position surprised local analysts  because Mexico is an important U.S. trading partner. In fact,  these two countries, along with Canada, are part of the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).    This trilateral agreement came into effect on 1 January, and  it created the world's largest market, with more than 350  million consumers and $500 billion worth of worldwide  investments.    As for the apparent inconsistency of U.S. foreign policy by  signing a trade agreement with a country it accuses of violating  civil rights, State Department adviser Timothy Wirth replied  that "nobody is perfect."    EL FINANCIERO cited the U.S. opinion that "Mexico has indeed  strived to eradicate the culture of impunity that surrounds its  security forces through the reorganization of the Attorney  General's Office and through its permanent support for the  National Human Rights Commission."    The Clinton administration also believes that the groups  that  took up arms on 1 January in Chiapas are made up mainly of  Indians. This contradicts the official Mexican report that they  are "lawbreakers linked to violent Central American groups."    National observers recalled that the United States  continuously violates the civil rights of Mexican citizens who  reside there. At least two of them were executed in the last 12  months.    Mexico thinks that its citizens who have been sentenced to  death in the neighboring country are victims of judicial  irregularities. It also believes that Washington violates other  individual rights by encouraging racial discrimination against  Mexicans.    In September and October 1993 the White House staged a  blockade to prevent Mexicans from entering U.S. territory,  claiming that their presence promotes crime and theft.</p>

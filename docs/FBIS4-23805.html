			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 15 SAPA -- Iscor [South African Iron  and Steel Corporation] said on Wednesday [15 June] it was  entering the titanium and heavy metals industry by acquiring 100  per cent of the shares and claims in Natal Mineral Sands from  Shell (South Africa) and Rhoex.    Subject to certain conditions, the effective date of the  transaction would be July 1.    The acquisition involves two quality mineral sands resources  which are located in Natal and Transkei.    By taking over Natal minerals sands and the interests of  Rhoex in Wavecrest (Transkei), Iscor has acquired most of the  remaining South African titanium reserves with low  radio-activity levels.    "This significant resource of high grade chlorinatable  feedstock, low in radio activity, will enable Iscor to enter  this industry," Ben Alberts, Iscor's executive director, mining,  said.    "We are one of the South African organisations with the  technical know-how, infrasrtucture and ability to develop the  required smelting technology. We have already done a number of  successful smelting trials with the mineral."    The take over of Natal mineral sands follows on the  announcements earlier this year that Iscor had successfully  tendered for coal exploration rights near the town of Moranbah  in Queensland, Australia and its investment in the Qingdao port  complex in the People's Republic of China to secure a dedicated  iron ore storage facility.</p>

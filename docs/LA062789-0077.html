			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 2ND MEASLES SHOT URGED  </P> <P> Responding to a nationwide measles outbreak, the American Academy of Pediatrics  has decided that all middle-school-age children should receive a second measles  shot. The decision was a change in position for the prestigious medical group,  said Dr. Milton Schwarz, president of the Orange County chapter. Twenty-four  states, including California, have reported 5,569 cases this year, a 300%  increase over the same period last year, the National Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta said. Among the hardest hit have been children in the Los  Angeles area, where eight have died from complications. The academy recommends  that all children receive a booster "MMR" shot for measles, mumps and rubella  as they enter junior high. The academy also recommended that anyone born after  1957 be re-vaccinated.  </P></p>

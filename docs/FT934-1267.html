			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / LWT presses on with ITV quartet plan London Weekend Television is pushing ahead with a plan to create a quartet of ITV licences under combined ownership, as part of its defence against Granada Group's hostile bid. Only a passing mention is made of the plan in the letter and defence document sent to shareholders yesterday by Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman. The documents concentrate on LWT's record and prospects, adding merely that it is in preliminary discussions with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. There is an undertaking that any proposals would be put to shareholders for approval. Despite City scepticism, talks that might see LWT making an agreed bid for Yorkshire, and Anglia Television taking over Tyne Tees, appear to be making progress. Apart from the possibility of creating the largest ITV company, if the rules were changed to allow it, more immediate agreements are being pursued. These envisage LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Anglia co-operating on everything from cost reduction and programme production to advertising sales. LWT, as a 14 per cent shareholder in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, has access to all board papers and reckons the loss-making company's problems are being dealt with. Senior executives clearly believe further significant savings can be made at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. Sir Christopher said yesterday: 'The LWT management have done well for shareholders and themselves. They can do better and as it happens they like working together as a team. They don't want to bale out now.' LWT management holds around 10 per cent of the company. LWT defence, page 16</p>

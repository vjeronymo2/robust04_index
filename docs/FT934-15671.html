			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Salinas warns of danger to Nafta: Trade treaty would be lost for generations, says Mexican president PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico, seeking to end more than a year of uncertainty about ratification of the free trade agreement with the US and Canada (Nafta), has said that if the treaty is not secured by the beginning of next year it will be lost. The agreement - and related side accords on labour and the environment  - is awaiting ratification in the three countries but is facing an uphill struggle in the US Congress. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Salinas said failure to achieve passage of the agreement by January 1 would mean that 'its chances would be out for several generations'. It was 'self deception' to believe that if it were rejected another could be negotiated soon. In a statement last week, the president said bluntly: 'Neither the reopening of the negotiation of the treaty, nor the postponement of its coming into force are real options at this stage.' The statement suggested that rejection of the treaty would reverse recent improvement in relations with the United States, pointedly noting that a few years ago 'anti-US rhetoric was an easy route to popularity'. However, asked for clarification, Mexican officials said the government would not insist categorically on the deadline if the treaty were put to the vote this year in the US House of Representatives but not voted on by the Senate until the new year. Support for it is more solid in the Senate than in the House, and a House vote to ratify would almost certainly ensure its passage. That should mean that most of the uncertainty surrounding ratification would be settled by early December, they said. While Mr Salinas stressed the 'historic' importance of the trade pact to Mexican-US relations, he said that Nafta was 'not the only thing' going on in Mexico, and that the process of economic reform would continue without it. Echoing the view of senior Mexican officials who believe the tide in the US Congress is turning, he said he was 'optimistic' it would be approved.</p>

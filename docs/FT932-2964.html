			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (2): Exports put the bounce back - The economy / After a difficult decade, lower wage and interest rates are at last creating the conditions for sustained economic improvement HOPES are rising that the New Zealand economy is emerging from the stagnation of the last decade in good shape to enjoy sustained, if moderate, growth through the 1990s. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3 per cent over the 12 months to December, and is widely forecast to remain at about the same level for at least the next three years. Although relatively low by the standards of the Asia/Pacific region, this is nearly triple the average rate of growth in the seven years since the country embarked on a radical economic liberalisation programme. Not everyone believes the worst is over. The Trades Union Council, for example, points out that gross domestic product remains little higher than the level reached in September 1986. 'The National government spent the first year in office (1990/91) converting a stagnant economy into a contracting one, and the second undoing that damage,' the CTU said in a recent submission to parliament. 'The growth . . . is simply a bounce back from the pits of the middle of 1991, when the economy plunged to a seven-year low.' But, for the less pessimistic, there are plenty of positive indicators. Inflation has been below 2 per cent for two years, unemployment has fallen to 9.8 per cent from a peak of 11.1 per cent, retail sales are rising, and business confidence is near its all-time high. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in a recent report, said New Zealand now has 'the best opportunity for many years to transform economic recovery into sustained growth.' The OECD also pointed out that the recovery is taking place against a background of subdued world economic growth and reductions in government spending, which have tended to depress the domestic economy. The growth is being led by exports, reflected in a surplus on the merchandise trade balance of of more than NZDollars 3bn in each of the last two calendar years, compared with an average for the previous six years of about NZDollars 1.3bn. Underlying the recovery is the liberalisation programme, which the OECD once called 'the most comprehensive micro-economic reform programme undertaken by any OECD country in recent years.' But the proximate cause of the improvement is threefold: Falling interest rates: five-year government bonds are down to about 7 per cent from 13 per cent in late 1990, and mortgage rates have fallen from more than 15 per cent to less than 9 per cent. Exchange rate movements: the New Zealand dollar has depreciated by about 8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, delivering a substantial boost in competitiveness to exporters whose domestic costs are static or falling. Lower wages: unit labour costs have declined substantially following labour market deregulation in 1991. A survey by Bancorp, an Auckland merchant bank, suggests that labour costs are now 36 per cent lower than in Australia. Mrs Ruth Richardson, finance minister, says with some satisfaction that New Zealand will have one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD in 1993/94 - a sharp contrast with most of the previous 20 years, when it has generally been one of the slowest. Mrs Richardson argues that the economy is finally overcoming the traumatic effects of economic restructuring, and is reaping the benefits of efficiency gains and fiscal prudence. Nevertheless some dangers remain, principally the possibility of a collapse in the Uruguay Round talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the sluggish performance of most of the other OECD economies - 'they (other countries) also have substantial adjustments to undergo, and New Zealand is a very good demonstration of just how long it takes to get over the adjustment into the growth phase,' says Mrs Richardson. Domestically, the chief danger appears to be the uncertainty which could flow from a hung parliament or an unexpected change of government following the election due by November. There is little concern in the business community about a victory by the opposition Labour party, which began the reform process when it was in office from 1984 to 1990. However, a strong showing by the populist Alliance party would not be welcomed by business or in the financial markets, which fear a relaxation of the prudent fiscal and monetary policies of the last three years. Fiscal policy has, in fact, been one of the government's failures - Mrs Richardson has long since abandoned her election promise to balance the budget by the end of this year. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made, and the financial deficit (which excludes privatisation receipts) is likely to total more like NZDollars 2.5bn in 1992/93 than earlier projections of around NZDollars 3bn. This is equivalent to just over 3 per cent of GDP, which would maintain the downward trend from the peak of 3.6 per cent in 1990/91. The Reserve Bank is forecasting a fall to 2.6 per cent by 1995. Mrs Richardson blames the missed target on 'factors outside our control,' mainly the rate at which the impact of corporate tax losses on government revenue is passing out of the taxation system. She says she is 'leery' of setting a fresh target for the same reason, although the government expects to have been running budget surpluses 'for some years' by 2000. The other potential constraint on economic growth is the current account deficit, which deteriorated to NZDollars 2bn in the year to March after narrowing to just NZDollars 265m in the previous year. However, the deterioration appears to have been caused largely by one-off interruptions to exports, which restrained growth in the merchandise trade surplus, and adverse movements in corporate investment returns, which are expected to be reversed. Ms Brigette Leckie, an economist at BZW in Auckland, says that concerns about the deterioration have been over-stated, and forecasts a small surplus by 1994/95. 'This recovery is different. It has been much harder to achieve than past recoveries, but it has not been underpinned by pump-priming, and we are not likely to see the bottlenecks caused by inflation, interest rates and the current account which have limited growth in the past,' she says.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Call for ban on use of beef hormones in US THE US General Accounting Office has recommended that the government order an end to the sale of food products from animals treated with recombinant bovine growth hormones (rBGH) until it can be determined that they pose no risk to human health. The GAO - the investigative arm of congress - said the risk to people was not directly from the hormones but stemmed from the growing number of cases of mastitis in cows treated with them. 'Increased incidence of mastitis in cows treated with rBGH could possibly lead to the increased use of antibiotics which, in turn, might raise the level of antibiotics found in milk and beef,' the GAO said. 'We cannot conclude at present that the nation's milk supply has not already been contaminated by antibiotics beyond acceptable levels. Yet there has been no effort by either the drug sponsors or the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether there may be higher antibiotic levels in milk associated with rBGH treatment and whether they would be acceptable.' Dairy farmer groups have long urged the FDA to stop the marketing of rBGH milk products. Mr Curt Rohland, president of the National Family Farm Coalition, said the report confirmed what many farmers have found: that treating cows with a synthetic hormone put the animals under more stress, made them more vulnerable to infection and increased the use of antibiotics.</p>

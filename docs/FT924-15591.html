			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Books: Life of Marvin . . . LIVE FROM GOLGOTHA by Gore Vidal Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 232 pages HOT ON the heels of AN Wilson's book on Jesus comes a novel by Gore Vidal on the same subject but with a considerably different tone and intention. Whereas Wilson ferrets earnestly for the 'truth', Vidal treats the whole mish-mash with magisterial disdain. With unerring instinct he homes in not on Jesus himself but on the peripheral yet highly important figure of St Paul. The Gospel According To Gore Vidal opens like Genesis, 'In the beginning . . .' - but it continues, 'was the nightmare and the knife was with St Paul, and the circumcision was a Jewish notion and definitely not mine'. St Paul sends a message from Heaven to his acolyte Timothy, a Bishop in the first century AD. A mysterious Hacker is erasing the story of Jesus as told in the Gospels. Timothy, as the only witness to the Crucifixion that the computer virus cannot get to, is to write everything down as he remembers it. At this point the maid arrives with a television set. Timothy has no idea what a television set is but he is soon to learn. Through the set, as a hologram, there emerges Chester W. Claypoole, vice president of NBC-General Electric, who announces that he is planning to pre-record the Crucifixion 'live from Golgotha'. He wants Timothy to be anchorperson at the event. From this moment on the novel moves backwards and forwards in what is not so much a time-warp as as time-scramble. As Timothy retraces his travels with St Paul it is revealed that 'Saint' is a champion fund-raiser and crowd-pleaser. After his performances he passes round the collection box. He is an astute entrepreneur: it was his idea that the Messiah was too big an enterprise for just the one tribe. It also emerges that Jesus was only five feet tall and enormously fat. This shocking news is linked with the eerie presence of one Marvin Wasserstein, against whom St Paul has already warned Timothy. After travelling to Corinth and Ephesus and being raped by Nero in Rome, Timothy finally meets Marvin himself who - horror of horrors - is not a hologram but a living person: small, thin, with thick glasses, and wearing a yarmulke. A shiver runs through Timothy as he realises that Marvin is the Hacker and that the Hacker is Jesus. A Zionist zealot, Jesus 'fingered' Judas at the Crucifixion, persuading the Roman soldiers that the fat Judas was the Messiah. Jesus escaped, becoming Marvin Wasserstein with the master plan of re-writing the Gospels. Marvin's aim is to persuade the world that St Paul's great invention - that Jesus died on the Cross in order to save Gentiles as well as Jews - is utterly wrong. Jesus, King of the Jews, is to lead a nationalist insurrection and the world will end in nuclear war in the year 2001. Dr Cutler, the brain behind the computer technology which has led to this pretty pass, persuades Timothy that he must denounce Marvin. He does so and the 'real' Crucifixion takes place. Marvin transforms himself into the Messiah and, as the television camera pans upward from the face of the dead Christ to the sun, we see the figure of Amaterasu - the Sun Goddess from whom Japan's holy emperors are descended. Dr Cutler is not put out. Nippon is going to take over anyway, and to say that Jesus was a son of a Goddess and not of a God is a slight matter of gender, highly correct in today's world of triumphant feminism. What will the effect of this outrageously cynical, irreverent book be? Nothing, I should think, except pleasure after the storm has blown over. Vidal has played God with the conflicting facts of the Christian story and established his own triumphant trinity. In the first place, he has had a good old romp with the Academy, showing that he, too, if he cares, can be a post-Modernist, that he can out-Derrida the Deconstructionists with the twists and turns of his fantasy. In the second, he has mercilessly satirised television, whose audiences and commercial values he detests. In the third, he has poked fun at the Christian religion, putting the church of St Paul in line with the church of Oral Roberts. The Fathers will bleat blasphemy, but in the end Vidal will have harmed no one. Christians are not going to put out a contract on him as the Moslems did on Rushdie, and the millions who believe in an ever-loving Jesus will be unmoved in their faith. Gore is sitting pretty. Live from Golgotha is in the tradition of Myra Breckinridge, Myron and Duluth, but more pointed and more daring. At the age of 67 (today is his birthday), Vidal is still going strong. Who says there are no second acts in American lives?</p>

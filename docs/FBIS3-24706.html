Museveni  told a news conference that although Uganda did not have an  extradition treaty with Burundi, the two soldiers will not be  allowed to stay in Uganda. "I have instructed our people to  arrest the officers and expel them from Uganda although we shall  not take them back to Burundi," Museveni said.    Museveni did not name the soldiers, but last month Burundi  was reported to have asked Uganda to extradite Major Lazaro  Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda after the  October 21 coup attempt.    President Melchior Ndadaye was killed when the army,  dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried to overthrow his  popularly elected government.    Ndadaye was from the majority Hutu group and winner of the  small highland nation's first multi-party presidential poll.    Meanwhile, Museveni and visiting Eritrean President Isayas  Afewerki signed an agreement for economic and cultural  cooperation between the two countries. Isayas is scheduled to  leave Uganda later Friday after a five-day official tour.</p>

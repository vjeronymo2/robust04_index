			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Ruling on TV bidding Europe's national broadcasters can go on using their collective power when bidding for the rights to televise big sporting events, the European Commission decided yesterday, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. The Commission has exempted the European Broadcasting Union, which groups 67 national broadcasters, from EC competition rules until February 1998 when bidding for sports events. But the EBU has pledged to allow non-member channels - including purely commercial broadcasters - access to sports programmes on reasonable terms. The Commission had been under pressure to open up the market for TV rights to sporting events, after The European Sports Network (TESN), owner of the Screensport channel, complained about the EBU's privileged position in 1987.</p>

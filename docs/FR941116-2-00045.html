This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant states that the Board previously has approved providing the proposed FCM execution, clearance and advisory services with respect to nonfinancial commodity contracts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P.

Applicant has stated that Company would provide the proposed services in accordance with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , except that Company would provide FCM services to commodity pools that are owned or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, Applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Meetings of the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli  economic committee were concluded in Washington yesterday  evening. Chief Jordanian delegate Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah said  that the talks addressed economic topics listed on the agenda,  including Palestinian-Israeli agreements and the issue of  developing the Jordan Valley. The conferees examined working  papers that addressed a comprehensive development of the Jordan  Valley, as well as future projects, about which the U.S. side  expressed a willingness to chart an overall plan, Dr.  al-Tarawinah added.    Dr. al-Tarawinah went on to say: During these talks, the  Jordanian side underscored the importance of linking these  topics to the bilateral issues contained in the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda signed on 14 September 1993,  particularly the issues of borders, occupied Jordanian  territories, and water. It must be recalled that the agenda is  an indivisible whole, and that all the topics contained in it  must be discussed and negotiated in accordance with the terms of  reference of the peace process, and on the basis of the  provisions enshrined in the joint agenda.    Dr. al-Tarawinah said: A main broad Jordanian-Israeli  committee has been set up to discuss the issues of borders,  security, water resources, environment, and other issues.  Subcommittees will emanate from this main committee. Moreover,  efforts to demarcate and delineate borders will start.  Discussions also touched on other issues that need further  study, such as the issue pertaining to the road that will link  Jordan, Egypt, and Israel, and other issues pertaining to the  projects included in the Jordanian paper on the Jordan Valley.  A subagenda on water resources, energy, and environment, and  another subagenda on borders, occupied territories, and security  have been agreed on. The negotiations will be conducted within  the context of the subcommittees. Discussions of technical  issues will be resumed in the region to achieve the highest  possible degree of accuracy, particularly with regard to the  issue of borders. The talks are scheduled to resume next month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Central America succeeded in securing more than $700  million during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit held in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June, regional  presidents have reported.    Returning from Colombia yesterday, the presidents said  Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez said he would announce Spain's  incorporation into the BCIE [Central American Economic  Integration Bank] as a foreign country member in 30 days.    In addition, the regional presidents secured Colombia's  pledge to become a member and contribute $700 million, to be  disbursed in two installments, one in 1994, the other next year.    Argentina will also bolster the BCIE capital with $60  million, as will Venezuela, with a possible contribution of  $122.5 million.    The idea is to turn the BCIE into a stimulator of  development  and provide it with resources to combat poverty and promote  regional plans for sustainable development.    The presidents said Spain decided to disburse $100 million  of  a $500-million fund earmarked for Central America on the  occasion of the fifth centennial commemoration last year. This  disbursement will be used to reinforce a high voltage electric  interconnection network between the regional countries. The  Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] will support financing of  the project with a $350-million loan.    The presidents said Spain has put a $380-million fund at the  disposal of Central America and other countries of the continent  as a complement to the aid the IDB is offering to Latin America.    The area presidents also spotlighted the unity that prevails  among them.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Powerful dollar AFTER an extraordinary day of trading in currency markets on Friday, dealers will now look for indications that the dollar can push further ahead against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz. On Friday, the dollar convincingly broke through the critical DM1.67 level against the D-Mark, which some technical analysts have seen as the last milestone before DM1.80 is reached. The dollar's rise is mainly due to expectations that Germany will cut short term interest rates soon. And, because of this, the M3 figures for money supply growth, due out today or tomorrow, are important. The M3 figure will indicate whether money supply is falling within the Bundesbank's target range. If it does, the Bundesbank may ease its repo rate on Wednesday for the first time in six weeks - and this will further reduce the premium on holding D-Marks as opposed to dollars. On the dollar side of the equation, Wednesday's durable goods figures for May will show whether the US economy has recovered any further. A second revision of the poor first quarter GDP figure is also due on the same day. On Friday, the Japanese yen fell by around 3 per cent against the dollar following the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government. Japanese political developments will be watched closely, as dealers wait for any reversal in the yen's prospects. The yen may be underpinned by the huge Japanese trade surplus, despite the shock of Friday's fall. The D-Mark's strength in Europe will be tested this week if more European governments cut interest rates. There is strong speculation that the Bank of France could cut its intervention rate today, following the Franc's strong performance last week.</p>

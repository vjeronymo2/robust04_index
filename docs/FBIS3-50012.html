Opinions that the Defence Ministry is ceding its  prerogatives  to the general staff are untrue, Milewski declared.    He described the planned changes as "corrections in the  organizational structure" designed to precisely define the tasks  and improve the work of the Defence Ministry and the general  staff.    According to Milewski the changes are also meant to reduce  the excessively large administration.    Milewski also stressed that it was "indispensable" for the  civilian Defence Ministry's departments at present to employ the  military. "There are not so many military experts among  civilians now," he said.</p>

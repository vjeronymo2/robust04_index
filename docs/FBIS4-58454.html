			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Arab </F> affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari in Cairo on 4 May -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Ya'ari] Beyond the signing of the agreement,  when do you expect the actual transfer of power to take place?    [Peres] We are dealing here with a number of doors which  have to be opened. Some already have been opened, and  Palestinians will enter through them. I believe the formal  transfer will occur within two to three weeks.    [Ya'ari] How do you assess the impact of this agreement on  Israel's efforts to negotiate with Syria? Will it spur al-Asad  on? Will it alienate him and convince him to wait?    [Peres] I will tell you something far-reaching: Without an  agreement with the Palestinians, we would be unable to reach an  agreement with al-Asad, because without that agreement, al-Asad  would view himself as the sponsor of the Palestinian issue. The  fact that the Palestinians are engaged in a process separately  from the Syrians permits us to negotiate and reach an accord  with each of them.    [Ya'ari] With your permission, I would like to address the  most recent discussion you had last night with Yasir 'Arafat and  the cosponsors. Can you tell us what happened with the  remaining unresolved clauses of the agreement?    [Peres] As always happens in negotiations, they were  concluded with a compromise, which is made up of firm pledges on  the one hand and promises and expectations for the future on the  other. All in all, I think the compromise is adequate from  Israel's viewpoint, and from the Palestinian viewpoint as well.    We must not forget that this is a unique process: The  negotiations are not over; a process has been launched, and it  will continue. For instance, we never said the size of Jericho  was final, as the negotiations on the size of Jericho will have  to be resumed within a few months. Therefore, points on which  agreement was achieved should be viewed in a time dimension, and  not only a territorial dimension. I think this makes compromise  easier for both sides. In any event, it was vital to conclude  the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

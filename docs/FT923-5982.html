			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: Sound biter bitten Will the chancellor's hurried appearance on the steps of Her Majesty's Treasury go down as one of those memorable occasions, like Denis Healey's decision to turn back just before he got on a plane to the IMF meeting during the 1976 sterling crisis? It was very much a last-minute decision. It is not the first time that the chancellor has made impromptu statements. He often pops out of his home at Number 11 to give his thoughts on the economy. But standing in front of the Treasury is much more dramatic. It is one thing for the Minister of Fun to make reassuring public appearances. But is it really necessary for the chancellor of the exchequer to stoop to giving soundbites of this sort?  You would never catch a central banker giving such hostages to fortune.  But then he's not a central banker. In terms of his timing he cannot be faulted. If you are going to say something, it is best to say it first thing in the morning. Then people have all day to think about it. However, opinions of Lamont watchers are mixed. One thought he had done the right thing. Another said he wouldn't have recommended it. The markets are looking for actions not words. The TV archives now have plenty of material for 'Lamont's last stand'.</p>

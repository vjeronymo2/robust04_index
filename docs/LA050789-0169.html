			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FETAL RIGHTS FOR DRUG, OTHER BABIES  </P> <P> "Drug Babies Push Issue of Fetal Rights" immediately caught my eye as I picked  up my morning paper (April 25). Fetal rights for drug babies? I thought Roe vs.  Wade guaranteed that no fetal rights -- including life -- could take precedence  over the mother's rights, even her right to kill her unborn child deliberately  through the agency of a doctor and a few tools. Why would inducing drug  dependency in the unborn or subjecting her fetus to the dangerous side effects  of her own drug abuse be considered worse than terminating the fetus' life?  </P> <P> Unfortunately, your article didn't clear up the mystery for me. Too often I  read articles on controversial issues whose authors think they're being  objective because they give an equal number of column inches to each side.  Rarely do I read an article whose author has probed behind the rhetoric to the  root issues of the controversy. It's too bad this article counted inches rather  than arguments.  </P> <P> Why are third parties charged with crimes against fetuses but mothers aren't?  Why can government agencies, including courts and social services, intervene in  prenatal care but not in abortion? Why was Laura Moute (who was 7 months'  pregnant and a cocaine user) wrong to want her unborn child to die from drug  abuse when any California woman has the right (protected by state and federal  courts) to terminate through abortion a pregnancy that is 7, 8 or even 9 months  along?  </P> <P> Could it be that, at least as far as the unborn are concerned, one's value is  determined by whether or not one is wanted? What an idea! One's humanness  increases with the number of people who care! How awe-inspiring to think that  the Bon Jovis and Princess Dianas of this world are more human than I!  </P> <P> GRETCHEN PASSANTINO  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

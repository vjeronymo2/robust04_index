			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Clarke faces cabinet battle over planned spending cuts THE GOVERNMENT was braced last night for a full-scale battle over public spending at tomorrow's cabinet meeting after a committee of senior ministers recommended deep cuts in Whitehall budgets for local authorities, defence, housing and transport. A partial retreat by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, over cuts in the armed services appeared to defuse a threat by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, to demand a fundamental review of Britain's security commitments. But Mr Rifkind will take to full cabinet his opposition to the cuts still being demanded by the chancellor. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has resisted demands for means-testing child benefit, but has accepted tougher rules for invalidity benefit, a squeeze on housing benefit and cuts in mortgage interest payments to unemployed homeowners. He is also battling Mr Clarke over compensation for the elderly and poor to offset the impact of value added tax on domestic fuel. The chancellor has rejected proposals for a generous package and wants to limit compensation to those below income support levels. Mr Clarke finalised yesterday the recommendations of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with reconciling the competing claims for resources from Whitehall departments with a commitment for a freeze on overall spending in real terms. The EDX report meets the remit set in July of an effective freeze in real terms in overall spending for the next three years. Mr Clarke wants an agreement to undershoot the Pounds 253.6bn ceiling for 1994-95 by up to Pounds 1bn. The aim would be to convince backbench Tory MPs that tax increases in next month's Budget were not a substitute for harsh decisions on public spending. But senior ministers said yesterday that two months of discussions within EDX had failed to achieve anything resembling a firm settlement. The final deal will have to be hammered out by tomorrow's cabinet and, possibly, in a second session next week. Mr Rifkind will be joined in a call for more favourable treatment by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary. But whatever the outcome, local authorities cannot expect any real increase in the Pounds 41bn they should spend this financial year, while housing associations will be the main victim of large cuts in the Pounds 8bn a year housing budget. Mr MacGregor faces a sharp reduction in both his road-building and rail budgets. Mr Rifkind is resigned to cuts of around Pounds 1bn by 1996-97 in the Pounds 23bn defence budget.

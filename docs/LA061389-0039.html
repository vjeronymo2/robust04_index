			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Justice Department said for the first time that Rep. William H. Gray III  (D-Pa.) is not the target of a criminal investigation. The statement backed up  what Gray and his lawyer said FBI agents have told them ever since word leaked  out last month that two agents had visited Gray. Gray and two others are  seeking to become House majority whip. Government sources earlier said the  department had opened a preliminary investigation into whether Gray had a  "no-show" employee. Gray from the outset said he knew of none, and staff  members have said since that they had found no evidence of one.  </P></p>

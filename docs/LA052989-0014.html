			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BLOW TO NATURE;  </P> <P> ENDANGERED WETLANDS VANISHING  </P> <P> It was business as usual along the San Luis Rey River.  </P> <P> Like so many property owners before him, H. Von Packard Jr. wanted to make good  use of his land, which cozies up to the river as it winds through Oceanside. So  he hired a bulldozer and plowed down a dense thicket of willows, cattails and  other stream-side vegetation covering part of the 42-acre parcel.  </P> <P> Vic Yoder, a state fish and game warden, didn't like what he saw. No permits  had been issued. No permission had been granted. But before the state could  take action, the bulldozer leveled more than a dozen acres of prime riverfront  habitat that played host to numerous animals and birds, including a tiny,  endangered songbird, the least Bell's vireo.  </P> <P> Packard argued that he simply wanted to farm the land, to plant tomatoes.  Authorities, however, were unimpressed, slapping him with misdemeanor charges  of altering a river without first informing the state. They were even less  impressed when Packard later submitted plans to Oceanside for a 77-house  subdivision on the property.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Settlement Reached  </P> <P> After months of wrangling, a settlement was reached in January. Packard would  spend $30,000 to replant 1,000 trees and native plants in exchange for the  charges being dropped. For the birds and beasts that had called the ungainly  grove their home, peace and order would return.  </P> <P> It was an upbeat ending to a tragic environmental tale, but that small victory  in Oceanside is exceedingly rare. Up and down the arid expanse of Southern  California, the ribbons of green oases stretching along the banks of rivers and  small tributaries are under an unceasing assault by man.  </P> <P> Known as riparian areas, these ecologically valuable acres of river bank  vegetation have increasingly fallen prey to farmers and developers, to  bulldozers and buzz-saws, often making room for concrete channels, shopping  centers and houses.  </P> <P> "They're vanishing rather rapidly, I'm afraid, especially in Southern  California," said Bob Radovich, a state Fish and Game Department biologist.  "And the loss only seems to be accelerating."  </P> <P> In California, only 10% of the riparian areas that once existed still stand  today, authorities said. The destruction is not abating. Along the coast of  Orange and San Diego counties, 40% of the stream-side vegetation that thrived  just a decade ago is now gone, state wildlife officials said.  </P> <P> Examples are everywhere.  </P> <P> Owners of a thoroughbred horse farm and a sod-growing operation in southern San  Diego County have pushed into swaths of riparian vegetation in the Tijuana  River, maintaining they were simply reclaiming land lost to flood waters years  earlier. To the north, a tomato farmer decimated riparian habitat along the San  Dieguito River east of Del Mar to expand his field, authorities said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the destruction is far more vivid, albeit  decades old. From the largest river to the tiniest tributary, concrete channels  long ago replaced river bank vegetation that once brimmed with plant and animal  life. But the streams that remain unfettered by such flood-control projects  increasingly feel the strain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A National Problem  </P> <P> Troubling as it is, the destruction of Southern California's riparian areas is  only one example of a greater problem -- the disappearance of wetlands  throughout the United States. From the vanishing Everglades to the dwindling  salt marshes of San Francisco Bay to the plains of North Dakota, where farmers  are plowing over important wildlife sanctuaries known as prairie potholes, the  hand of man is invariably being felt.  </P> <P> "This is a national issue," said Nancy Kaufman, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service official who headed the outfit's Laguna Niguel office until earlier  this year. "While you can look to San Diego County and Southern California for  examples, it's not as if the region is out of step with other sections of the  country."  </P> <P> But while many of those other areas have attracted a vigilant pack of public  protectors to do battle against transgressors, the riparian areas of Southern  California enjoy few stalwart allies other than a handful of dedicated  environmentalists.  </P> <P> "I don't think people realize what riparian areas are and that they're  threatened," said Sharon Lockhart, an adjunct biology professor at San Diego  State University. "I think it's really tragic."  </P> <P> Indeed, few people seem to grasp the ecological significance presented by a  scruffy thicket of willows and cottonwoods perched on the banks of a babbling  brook.  </P> <P> "They're like a lifeline, particularly in our semi-arid environment," said  Emily Durbin, a Sierra Club leader in San Diego. "Just as much as aqueducts are  lifelines for us, rivers are lifelines for animals and birds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Roles  </P> <P> Aside from serving as pivotal way-stations for animal and plant life, riparian  areas play an important role for man.  </P> <P> Authorities say the streams serve as settling pools to recharge Southern  California's vital ground-water system. Moreover, the vegetation on the river  banks acts like a sponge during heavy rains, holding back heavy flows and then  later releasing the water slowly.  </P> <P> With stands of cattails, bulrush and other plants and trees, riparian areas  contribute air to breath and also serve as Mother Nature's very own sewage  system, helping naturally metabolize certain wastes such as farm runoff and  fertilizers.  </P> <P> "These sorts of wetland areas are important not just for wildlife, but for a  variety of other things," Kaufman said. "Society is going to have to pay a  great deal of money to compensate for these losses. There's a lot at stake, and  it's not just endangered species."  </P> <P> The river stretches also are flush with more animal and plant life than perhaps  any other ecosystem in Southern California, experts say. Opossum, skunks and  coyotes frequent riparian areas. Hawks and other birds of prey roost in the  trees. The pockets of green also serve as stopping-off points and nesting  grounds for a plethora of migratory birds.  </P> <P> "Riparian areas are not as well understood, they're not as obvious," said Dave  Bontrager, an independent biological consultant and avid bird watcher. "It  takes a little closer look. But, boy, once you look!  </P> <P> "Take the Santa Margarita River (on Camp Pendleton). That riparian corridor is  just fantastically diverse. We used to joke that everything in Southern  California nests there, and if doesn't yet, it will."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pointing Fingers  </P> <P> Why are they disappearing? Advocates outline a variety of reasons, but  typically point to the federal agency they feel is the prime culprit -- the  Army Corps of Engineers.  </P> <P> Although the state has some regulatory weapons to go after riparian abusers, as  it did with Packard, the onus for enforcement typically falls on the Army  Corps.  </P> <P> Critics argue that the corps has consistently failed to halt the destruction of  the river bank habitat. Roundly vilified by environmentalists as "the dam  building agency," the corps is philosophically misplaced as a guardian of the  environment, acting instead as a toothless watchdog, they said.  </P> <P> "The blame lies at several levels, all the way from the cities and counties on  up," Lockhart said. "But I think the corps is one of the greatest  disappointments. . . . It's akin to the fox watching the hen house."  </P> <P> Officials with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service said they can point to  more than 200 instances in the last decade where illegal grading and fill work  occured in riparian areas in Southern California, but the Army Corps failed to  do anything. Instead, the agency typically followed up by issuing  after-the-fact permits, they said.  </P> <P> Army Corps officials said such numbers seem to stretch the truth and argued  that their mandate is to carefully balance environmental considerations against  other concerns, among them the rights of private property owners to develop  their land.  </P> <P> "The fish and wildlife people are good folks, but they're a single-purpose  agency," noted Perry Davis, Army Corps spokesman for the Southern California  branch. "Their interests are among many we have to look at. We have to look at  all the environmental concerns, then balance those to some degree with the  economic returns and other things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Pretty Good Job'  </P> <P> Davis said he is aware of "situations where we have issued cease-and-desist  orders on people who were illegally filling and made them not only stop, but go  in and return the land to the condition it previously was in."  </P> <P> "Given the limitations of our staff, I think we've done a pretty good job,"  Davis said. "I suppose there may be cases where things slip through the cracks,  but we try to keep that from happening."  </P> <P> At times, however, the corps has appeared all too cozy with developers, critics  contend. Perhaps the most troubling example occured in Las Virgenes Creek in  northern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> In 1986, the agency issued a cease-and-desist order to a development company  that had ripped out between three and eight acres of riparian habitat to  construct a flood channel near an apartment project. Leaders of other federal  agencies, however, were angered when they later learned that a Army Corps  regulatory official privately told the builder to ignore the order and finish  the project, suggesting a permit for the work would be issued later.  </P> <P> But the corps is not the only agency singled out.  </P> <P> Kaufman worries that the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which helps  oversee the wetlands, has abrogated too much of its regulatory responsibility  to the Army Corps. In only a handful of cases has the EPA stepped in and used  its powers to reverse a corps decision, most notably in 1987 by nixing approval  of a dam that would have inundated the pristine Pamo Valley in northern San  Diego County.  </P> <P> Philip Oshida, regional chief of the EPA's wetlands section, said the agency  has been hindered in the past by staff limitations, but hopes that more headway  can be made with the Bush administration's appointment of William K. Reilly, a  noted environmentalist and wetlands advocate, as top administrator at the EPA.  </P> <P> "It really was a shot in the arm for the wetlands protection program," Oshida  said. "He has already mentioned that wetlands is one of his top priorities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inadequate Regulations?  </P> <P> Radovich, meanwhile, suggests that it is the regulations, and not the  regulatory agencies, that are probably most to blame for the unceasing  destruction.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's the corps of engineers or their staff necessarily," he  said. "I just think there is not adequate regulation placed on development in  riparian areas in California."  </P> <P> The disappearance of the rich river bank groves has occured mostly on a  piecemeal basis, fueled by state and federal laws that put few roadblocks in  the way of landowners eager to clear vegetation on smaller parcels of 10 acres  or less, authorities said.  </P> <P> Although federal rules often call for the replacement of riparian areas lost to  development, such mitigation sometimes falls through the cracks on smaller  projects, officials contend. Even when requirements for replacement habitat are  set out, the regulatory agencies often fail to follow up and ensure the job is  done, Kaufman said, estimating that 80% of the mitigation work is never  performed.  </P> <P> Some destruction isn't even covered under the regulations. A property owner can  typically skirt the rules by clearing trees and plants with a chain saw, taking  care to avoid filling the stream channel, which is protected under federal  guidelines.  </P> <P> Moreover, Lockhart argues that the regulations are biased against the arid  West. Many riparian areas in Southern California, she said, fail to pass "the  wet tennis shoe test" (if the ground is wet enough to squish up around your  tennis shoe, you're in a wetland). In the eyes of federal regulators, these are  not true wetlands, no matter how great their value as environmental  sanctuaries, and are summarily rejected for protection.  </P> <P> Farming is often allowed to encroach on the riparian areas, even though the  rules allow growers to till only land that has historically been in  agriculture. Kaufman said the loophole is sometimes exploited by developers. A  builder clears a river bank for farming, then a few years later can more easily  push through plans for a subdivision or shopping center because the land is no  longer considered a riparian area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasons for Destruction  </P> <P> Property owners offer a variety of reasons for destroying the prime habitat.  Often they contend they're reclaiming land seized by the river, such as the  landowners on the Tijuana River. Others suggest they were simply unaware of the  regulations.  </P> <P> But even landowners who known the rules sometimes go ahead and bulldoze the  trees and bushes, anticipating little more than a slap on the hand from lax  regulatory agencies, critics contend.  </P> <P> "You have people who just don't care," Lockhart said. "Because the corps  doesn't do anything to people like them, they go ahead and do what they damn  well please."  </P> <P> All that grading and filling and cutting can create a variety of problems.  </P> <P> Construction of flood channels, for instance, typically halts the flow of sand  down rivers to replenish Southern California's eroding beaches, many experts  contend.  </P> <P> Moreover, heavy development along a river decreases the land's ability to soak  up rainfall, causing increased runoff into streams. The bolstered flows  dislodge silt that can settle in areas of tangled river bank vegetation,  choking out all life.  </P> <P> "At some point, you will have a failure of these environments if enough of  their component pieces are missing," Kaufman said. "It is true that we will  never know what good something is if it's not around anymore."  </P> <P> Typically, city leaders in Southern California have not been allies in the  fight against riparian destruction, but that may be changing, particularly in  San Diego County, considered by many the last bastion for unfettered river bank  habitat.  </P> <P> Spearheaded by San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner and county Supervisor Brian  Bilbray, officials are gearing up to spend $10 million in state funds to  purchase riparian areas along the Tijuana River.  </P> <P> A special task force is also engaged in an ambitious effort to restore habitat  for the least Bell's vireo, which is on the U.S. endangered species list. In  addition, various officials are pressing an ambitious effort to form a park  along the San Dieguito River Valley in North County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Awareness  </P> <P> What else can be done? Radovich suggests a shift is needed toward increased  public awareness of the problems with dwindling riparian areas and tighter  restrictions on river bank encroachments.  </P> <P> "It boils down to a political process and increasing public concern and  increasing protective capacity for the areas," he said. "It has to be far  reaching. It doesn't mean just drawing a line along the side of a stream. We  have to look at whole watersheds and manage them appropriately."  </P> <P> Oshida of the EPA said the agency hopes to increasingly work with local  governments to plan around riparian areas and have an influence on zoning  decisions, which can affect the development potential on river banks.  </P> <P> Indeed, he suggested that riparian protection efforts don't have to occur just  on the federal level. California could make its own regulations tougher than  federal laws, he said, and the regional water quality control boards that  blanket the state could handle the task of enforcing the new rules.  </P> <P> Lockhart, meanwhile, maintains that the most profound impact could be made by  giving the EPA the responsibility and the staff to regulate the federal wetland  rules.  </P> <P> With riparian areas disappearing fast, changes need to be made soon, experts  contend. The future of numerous species of plants, birds and animals could  depend on reversing the current destructive trend.  </P> <P> "In terms of what good any particular species is, there are all the great old  stories, you know, you don't take your engine apart and say this piece looks  insignificant and throw it away, because your engine probably won't work,"  Kaufman said. "As a human being living in this environment, I know my options  are being extinguished along with these species."  </P></p>

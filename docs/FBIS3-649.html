Good morning,  listeners. Last night, as has been widely broadcast, certain  developments took place in Bophuthatswana. There is a security  firm which has several Boer Commando members in service, and  which asked if we could come and assist them with the protection  of certain industries and personnel. A commando group was then  put together under the command of the Akasia Commando leader,  and they moved in and took positions around the properties  guarded by this security firm. This was late last night. They  remained there as long as they were needed. There were no  incidents there, but then certain other shopping complexes,  about 2 km away, were being looted by a mass of people. This  was typical of the looting in Bisho and also in several parts of  South Africa, where unrest has been instigated by the ANC  [African National Congress] and the Communist Party and has  always ended with such plundering.

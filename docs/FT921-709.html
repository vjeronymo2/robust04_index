			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Talks issue fuels Ulster campaign THE ELECTION campaign in Northern Ireland heated up yesterday over the issue of the Anglo-Irish agreement and the future of inter-party talks, Tim Coone writes. The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist party leader, launching his party's manifesto, said 'the shutters will come down' on talks if any attempt is made to put the union on the negotiating table. 'The union is not negotiable. Full stop.' His remarks run counter to those of Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democrat Labour party, at the launch of his party's manifesto on Wednesday, that 'everything will be on the table', when talks resume after the election.</p>

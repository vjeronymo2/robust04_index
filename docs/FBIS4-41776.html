			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski </F> by Nikolay Mirgorodskiy; place and date not given: "About  Honor, Courage, and Glory"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mirgorodskiy] You mentioned  earlier that the Belarusian Military District [BVO] has tested  new weapons and hardware. Does this mean that currently you do  not test new military equipment? In general, where do you buy  weapons, technology, uniforms, fuel, spare parts, and foodstuffs?    [Kazlowski] I like your question. You should have asked the  same question to some of our deputies who blame all sins on our  Army. Yes, earlier the Armed Forces were centrally supplied.  The BVO was considered the best in the USSR. Moscow supplied  us with everything. Currently, the situation has changed. The  rigid system of centralized supply does not work. We have to  seek bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and  other states to maintain the Army's combat readiness.    Again, we experience difficulties with funds. I wish that  the state would provide us with sufficient resources to fulfill  our needs. However, alas! We have to trade, even though we are  severely criticized for conducting such activities. Sometimes,  this criticism is justified. You must agree with me that trade  is not a top priority activity in the Army.    [Mirgorodskiy] The banner of the unit is sacred to all  servicemen. Its loss is considered a great shame. What about  our old banners? Will you abandon them or exchange them for  "white-red- white" banners?    [Kazlowski] We have filed a petition with the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet to keep the old combat banners, medals, and  unit names. This is our history, our memories. There has still  been no final decision on this issue. The proposal regarding  the national banner of the Belarusian Armed Forces with its  accompanying attributes is under consideration. In our opinion,  two banners -- old and new -- should be used side-by-side in the  ranks.    [Mirgorodskiy] Could we imagine an enemy attacking our  state?  Will the Belarusian Army be able to protect us?    [Kazlowski] Our troops are in a state of combat readiness.  This is unquestionable. The point is in something else. Can  the Belarusian Army alone repulse a potential enemy? Everything  depends on the scope of the conflict. The Army will fight,  however, it is better to fight alongside some other friendly  states. At least, this is more reliable.    [Mirgorodskiy] How much money will the Defense Ministry  receive this year?    [Kazlowski] Some 4 percent of the overall state budget. This  is only enough to keep the Army afloat. By the way, the Russian  Armed Forces receive 20 percent of the state budget.    [Mirgorodskiy] According to you, we are short of military  hardware. However, judging by recently published complimentary  articles, we are successfully dismantling tanks, planes, and  missiles. This is not logical...    [Kazlowski] This is logical if common sense is at all  characteristic of our society. We are implementing the  international agreements. However, we have the right to use  some of the equipment -- subject to dismantlement -- as  exhibits. This is our sore point. Still, there is practically  no one who wants to buy vehicles which have been converted to  civilian use. In addition, we can sell only a specified number  of tanks while the remaining tanks must be dismantled.    [Mirgorodskiy] How do you use the metal?    [Kazlowski] It is further smelted in Zhlobin....    [Mirgorodskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, how do Belarusian servicemen  react to the use of the Belarusian language, which is being  currently introduced in the Army? It would be interesting to  hear how military orders sound in Belarusian.    [Kazlowski] The reactions of privates and officers to this  issue are different. However, the people understand the  importance of this novelty and do not express added emotions.  The language is being taught and we do not want to accelerate  this process. Everything should be done thoroughly. However,  graduates of our military colleges must speak fluent Belarusian.    [Mirgorodskiy] We spoke about the shortage of fuel and  lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition. What about military  training? Have you cut down on this program?    [Kazlowski] This is a separate question in itself. Military  training is being fulfilled according to a program. We use  various types of training equipment, including equipment  produced at Belarusian factories. We only try to restrict the  redeployment of troops.    [Mirgorodskiy] Belarus does not train officers in all  disciplines. Where does the Defense Ministry recruit experts?    [Kazlowski] We are short some 1,500 officers. A national  Academy is being established and some colleges are being  respecialized. In addition, we provide for the training of  experts abroad. One month of training abroad costs us between  $300 and $500. Is this expensive? Of course. We exchange  students with some states, however, so this eases the problem.  Currently, the cadets who entered our military colleges in the  time of the USSR are completing their education. Very few of  them, however, are eager to perform their service in Belarus  because the monetary allowance of an officer in Russia is twice  as high as that in Belarus. By the way, the allowance of a  Belarusian private is half the current minimum wage.    [Mirgorodskiy] What is the price of a cartridge for a  Kalashnikov assault rifle?    [Kazlowski] The cost of one artillery round -- depending on  the type of shell -- is between $100 and $600. A cartridge for  a Kalashnikov assault rifle costs $0.25. So, you can calculate  and compare.    [Mirgorodskiy] We cannot raise all issues in one interview.  Still, we are worried about the hazing of conscripts in our  Army. It would seem that only Belarusian youth are in active  service but this shameful phenomenon does not disappear.    [Kazlowski] Yes, to my regret. Groups representing various  regions -- "Vitebsk," "Grodno," "Minsk," "Gomel," and others --  have been established. Yes, we have conflicts. Please,  understand me: The Army is not separated from the state and all  our conflicts are reflected in the Army. We are fighting  against legal violations in the Army. However, can the Army  reeducate a person, can it break him of his harmful habits? It  is no secret that up to 30 percent of our conscripts have a  criminal record. They are the ones who initiate the hazing of  conscripts. I would like to stress that whatever we used to say  about our former political instructors in the Army, their work  produced definite results. It happens that commanders cannot  fulfill the functions of instructors. They cannot become  fathers to privates....    [Mirgorodskiy] The last question is not very pleasant. At  the coordinating meeting of leaders of law enforcement agencies  dealing with the fight against crime and corruption, the Defense  Ministry faced criticism from the prime minister. For example,  you were criticized for not participating in the strengthening  of public order. What can you say about this?    [Kazlowski] Currently, some 170 servicemen are patrolling  the  streets of Minsk. They have taken some 800 people into custody.  I would like to know what became of these people later.... In  addition, the attitude of some militiamen to us is different.  It is up to experts to define how many servicemen are required  to patrol the streets. Minsk may require more, while Mogilev or  Bobruysk -- fewer.</p>

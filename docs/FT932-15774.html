			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Protests in Dhaka against Indian PM THOUSANDS of angry Moslems took to the streets of Dhaka yesterday to protest against the attendance of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister, at a south Asian summit, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Dhaka. 'Rao, cancel your visit; shame that you are coming here,' the protesters chanted, before being forced to flee by riot police, one eye-witness in the Bangladeshi capital said. Mr Rao was due to arrive in Dhaka today, hours before the eighth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) is to begin in Dhaka. The protesters demanded that Mr Rao allow Bangladesh what they called a fair share of waters from the Ganges river - the subject of a long-running dispute - and that he promise to rebuild the Babri mosque in north India which was demolished by Hindu zealots in December. The protesters were mostly members of two right-wing political groups, the Jatiya Ganotantrik party and National Democratic party, eye-witnesses said. 'India is not only interfering with Bangladesh's independence but hurting the sentiments of the Moslems,' the two parties said in a joint statement. The government imposed extra-tight security in the capital, with 8,000 soldiers and police on round-the-clock duty for the meeting of the leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. It also banned rallies, marches and any sort of protest during the summit.</p>

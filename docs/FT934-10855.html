			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: HK Telecom plans cable TV service HONGKONG Telecom has announced plans to cash in on its existing telecommunications system by setting up a cable TV and video-on-demand service. The move comes two days after the launch of Wharf Holding's HKDollars 5bn (USDollars 647m) cable television network for the colony. Hongkong Telecom attempted to bid for the first cable network franchise awarded in 1989, but the government decreed that it could own only 15 per cent of a cable operator and could not use its telephone network to relay the service, due to its monopoly position. The monopoly on domestic services disappears in 1995, and since Wharf is planning to use its cable system as the basis for a second telecommunications network, Hongkong Telecom expects to be allowed to do the same, once Wharf's three-year exclusivity period expires in June 1996. Hongkong Telecom anticipates that it would invest more than HKDollars 1bn in building up a cable television system. It is expected to be joined by the Hutchison Whampoa group in its application for the licence. Mr Peter Howell-Davies, Hongkong Telecom's deputy chief executive, said: 'It is the right strategic step for us to extend the range of our video services to meet the needs of medium-sized business and domestic customers, as well as the major corporations.' Hongkong Telecom plans to launch a service whereby customers can dial a number and have videos delivered to their TV set through the telephone network. Wharf Cable officials claimed such a service would provide only niche competition, since it currently offers eight channels, of which only one includes movies. The push to launch a cable channel will cause greater concern, since Hongkong Telecom would be in a position to set up a network more rapidly and cheaply than any other company. It has the obvious advantages of its existing network and its business relationship with almost every family in the colony. However, the move does underline the attractiveness of Wharf's new franchise.</p>

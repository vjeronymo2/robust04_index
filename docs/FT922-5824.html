			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Observer: Breaking the bank As Edinburgh muscles into the contest to house the European central bank, the city is at least showing a touch of realism. Unlike Luxembourg - which has dug up an arcane EC law dating from the mid-1960s to support its case for accommodating the new Euro-bankers lock, stock and barrel - the Scots are advocating the break-up of the institution even before it exists. The idea is that if bits of it were scattered around the community, Edinburgh would merit a share. Although the tactic has style, it is alas no satisfactory answer to the Germans - rooting noisily for Frankfurt - who argue that Britain's wishy-washy commitment to full monetary union puts the entire country in a poor position to claim the prize. But the real problem, closer to home, seems to be Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. Far from fighting Edinburgh's corner in cabinet, all he has apparently produced so far is a feeble bureaucratic- sounding letter to the campaigners last month vouchsafing that the government would give Edinburgh's case 'the most careful consideration'  - but only if it was decided to go outside London at all. Indeed the Conservative party as a whole is hardly leading from the front on the issue. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Donald Dewar turned out to be the only politician to speak at yesterday's launch of Edinburgh's campaign. Not a single Tory minister, MP or as much as a councillor was in evidence. Meanwhile, the cooler heads in Scotland are hoping that the campaigning may at least give their capital a leg-up in obtaining some other (unspecified) EC institution as a consolation prize. In the meantime, there is no harm in giving the city's claim to be Britain's second financial centre a further thorough airing.</p>

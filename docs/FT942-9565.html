			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A fragile touch of glass - Heather Farmbrough on a conservatory builder that has survived in a cold climate In the two years he has been running a company producing bespoke conservatories in London, Patrick Byrne has learnt a number of lessons. He has had to curb a natural tendency to over-design and spend too much on the best materials. 'The things which are interesting to design are not often very cost-effective,' he says ruefully. Byrne is a 24-year-old architectural technician from Dublin, although his long flowing red locks and beard lend him the appearance of a Celtic poet. After leaving college, he worked as a site agent and on the production team of a conservatory company. In 1991, he met Henry Cope-Harrison, an architect who was designing conservatories and found that they both thought most of the conservatories on the market were overpriced and under-specified. In June 1992, they set up Cope Conservatories as partners. 'As we were coming into the market in a deep recession we had to offer something different,' recalls Byrne. 'Our idea was to be an upmarket builder offering a comprehensive design and build service. We wanted to be a design driven company, operating at the top end of the market, but from a low-cost, affordable base. We recognised that there was a demand for unusual conservatories which other people could not build.' They wanted to build unusual, hand-crafted conservatories, each designed specifically for the client, rather than standard pre-manufactured 'drop-on' conservatories. They identified their potential market as the more affluent parts of west and south west London, where people often wanted to use wasted space such as side alleys. They found a small office in Chiswick where the landlord agreed to waive the rent until they could pay him back. As employees were initially sub-contracted, start-up costs were low, apart from Pounds 3,800 to buy and refit a Mercedes van and Pounds 1,500 to print 5,000 colour postcards which were distributed around south-west London. Although the response to the cards was low, they generated enough inquiries to lead to the first contracts. 'We won jobs because we could solve difficult problems and get on with people's kids - not necessarily because we were the cheapest. We made a conscious decision not to wear suits when we went to see clients because it made us about as inviting as West End nightclub bouncers.' But costs were too high. The awkward nature of many of the spaces in which they were building meant that each job was technically demanding and the highly individual, often complex nature of the conservatory roof designs meant that they often took longer to build than expected. Finishing touches often took as long as building the main structure. Neither of them, however, was willing to compromise artistic or technical standards. For example, they used substantial mahogany rafters, whereas their competitors made do with narrow strips of aluminium or timber. At the end of the first year, turnover was Pounds 104,000 and they had sold plenty of work. Profits, however, were non-existent. As Byrne says: 'We were so hungry for work, we took on contracts at break-even price in the hope that if we performed it would lead to more referrals. We were selling BMWs at Ford prices.' They were still relying on cash flow to fund the business rather than investing capital in expansion. They wanted to produce a brochure and put ads in the glossy home furnishing magazines, but could not afford it. Byrne was exhausted, having worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week. He felt he was spending too much time on site chasing problems and responding to clients' questions and problems, rather than doing essential administration and thinking about the business. In the last few months, Byrne feels he has turned the corner. Since December, he has employed a full-time foreman and joiner who had previously worked for him as subcontractors. This has made his life considerably easier and cut his working week as well as boosting the two employees' motivation. The company has been reorganised so that it is now Byrne's, reflecting his greater practical involvement, although Cope-Harrison still does all the design and marketing work. In February, Byrne negotiated with the Midland Bank a Pounds 15,000 government loan which will be spent on marketing - a small brochure, more cards and site boards. He intends to buy a second Mercedes truck and eventually to open a joinery workshop which would be owned exclusively by Cope, keeping costs down and eliminating his reliance on suppliers. The first advertisement appeared in March. His objective is to take turnover nearer to Pounds 500,000 which should be feasible given the stream of new business. But the challenge is also to make a decent living from the business, rather than having to plough everything back. He has always enjoyed the challenge of being in charge, and his sense of humour has helped him through the more difficult moments. As he says: 'If you cannot see the funny side of this business, you are lost.' Cope Conservatories, 20 British Grove, London W4 2NL. Tel: 081-741 2200</p>

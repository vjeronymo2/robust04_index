			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: MAGELLAN EXPLORES, ORGANIZES DATA  </P> <P> Some people just don't have the heart to throw out an old computer file. Any  program or data that winds up on their hard-disk storage equipment stays there.  </P> <P> Trouble is, that hard disk can become an unwieldy mess. And when the time comes  to find a file whose name you no longer remember, you're in trouble.  </P> <P> Lotus Development, the publisher of the best-selling spreadsheet program 1-2-3,  has come up with a solution. Lotus Magellan, named after the 15th-Century  Portuguese explorer, helps you sail through the "unchartered territory" of your  hard disk.  </P> <P> Magellan is more than the run-of-the-mill "disk organizer." There are lots of  programs that share Magellan's ability to show directory listings sorted  alphabetically, by size or by date of last change to perform such useful but  mundane tasks as copying, moving, renaming and deleting files. Magellan's  genius is its ability to organize your files based on their content.  </P> <P> When you first use the program, it creates an index of your hard disk by  examining every file and recording information about each file's contents. This  one-time process can take up to an hour.  </P> <P> Magellan's screen is divided into two vertical windows. The left window shows a  list of file names while the window on the right shows the contents of the file  that is highlighted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Junk Files  </P> <P> That right-hand window display is no mere summary. It's the complete file, just  as it looks when displayed by the program that created it. A Lotus 1-2-3  spreadsheet actually looks like a spreadsheet. Same is true with a dBase  database file, a WordPerfect document and other data files that were created  with one of the programs that Magellan works with.  </P> <P> This browsing feature can be enormously helpful. If nothing else, it's a great  housecleaning tool. I was shocked at how many junk files Magellan helped me  discover. Fortunately, you can delete files while Magellan is running.  </P> <P> A program similar to Magellan, called ViewLink, recently was released by  Traveling Software. Like Magellan, ViewLink lets you organize information by  subject rather than by the physical location of your files on the hard disk.  ViewLink also lets you set up links between files so that you can quickly jump  from one related file to another, even if they were created by different  programs. Unlike Magellan, however, the program doesn't let you display the  contents of files, and thus isn't as useful for some people.  </P> <P> (ViewLink has a suggested retail price of $150 and is available from Traveling  Software at 18702 North Creek Parkway; Bothell, Wash. 98011. Phone: (206)  483-8088 or (800) 343-8080.)  </P> <P> Ordinarily, Magellan's left window lists all the files on your disk. Needless  to say, that can be unwieldy. To prevent information overload, the program  allows you to create an "explore path" to limit the number of files listed in  that window. The explore path is set by pressing a function key that takes you  temporarily to a screen where you specify the type of files you wish to see.  </P> <P> The most impressive part of the explore command is its ability to find files  based on any text or numbers that appear in the files. This way, you can locate  data even if you don't know the name of the files or where they are located.  And it's not just limited to word processing. It will find information in  spreadsheets, databases or any other application that it knows about.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Automatically Loads It  </P> <P> The process is amazingly fast. It took Magellan less than 5 seconds to scan my  20-megabyte hard disk to find 26 files containing the words "desktop  publishing." Once the search was complete, only the files that met the search  criterion remained in the left window.  </P> <P> Those files can be browsed within Magellan or you can use the program's  "launch" function to bring up the program that created the file. Magellan then  will automatically load the specified file into memory.  </P> <P> Once you've located a group of related files, you can assign a name to the  group and add that name to a menu. Then, if you need access to files on the  specified subject, you can merely select the menu item and Magellan limits its  file display to the relevant files. This allows you to organize your files by  subject without having to physically move them into a special directory.  </P> <P> A grouping can be created using the search command or by specifying files by  name. And you can always add files later on.  </P> <P> Another useful feature is the ability to gather bits and pieces of information  from various files and turn it into a single file. This can be a very good way  to quickly assemble notes on a subject. You might not be interested in every  detail that Magellan uncovers, but with the gather command, you can pick and  choose. When you're done, you'll have a new file with just the information you  need.  </P> <P> If you're lost in a sea of data, then you need the help of an experienced  explorer such as Magellan. Lotus Development has given the program a suggested  retail price of $195 but is offering it at an introductory price of $139 until  the end of June.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the authors cannot  respond individually to letters.

Magid account on the MCI electronic  mail system.  </P> <P> MAGELLAN: THE SPECS  </P> <P> Features  </P> <P> A disk organizing program that allows you to find, view and organize  information on your hard disk. The program displays the contents of a file  without having to run the program that created it. A find feature quickly  locates files based on any word or phrase in the file. You also can use the  program to create groups of related files and to access these groups through a  menu. Magellan can be used to launch other programs and to rename, copy, move  or delete files and directories of files. Magellan works with files from a wide  variety of word processors, spreadsheets, database management systems and other  programs.  </P> <P> Requirements  </P> <P> IBM PC or compatible personal computer with a hard disk, 512K of memory and at  least one megabyte of free disk space. DOS 2.1 or higher.  </P> <P> Publisher  </P> <P> Lotus Development, 55 Cambridge Pkwy., Cambridge, MA 02142. Phone: (617)  577-8500  </P> <P> Price  </P> <P> $139 through June. After that it will have a suggested retail price of $195.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSES SUPPORTS USOC OFFER TO TAKE OVER DRUG TESTING  </P> <P> Putting the U.S. Olympic Committee in charge of drug testing for all sports  will create a more efficient and economical system, Edwin Moses said Thursday.  </P> <P> The governing bodies of each sport, such as The Athletics Congress for track,  are responsible for testing their own athletes, resulting in disparate  programs.  </P> <P> But USOC President Robert Helmick said this week that his organization will  take over those chores and implement out-of-competition, year-round testing for  any sport that requests it. Moses, who heads the USOC's drug control committee,  supports that approach.  </P> <P> "It'll work," he said at the U.S. Olympic Festival. "There's no need for track  and field or any other sport to have to do this when it can be done by one  group."  </P> <P> Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, said many national governing boards  don't have the staff or money to run a drug-testing program while others, such  as TAC, have long-established programs with large budgets.  </P> <P> Despite those expenditures, TAC has been criticized recently for running sloppy  and selective drug-testing procedures. To head off that criticism, Executive  Director Ollan Cassell has asked the USOC to assume TAC's drug-testing  responsibilities.  </P> <P> Phil Henson, in charge of the track competition at the Olympic Festival, said:  "I think the public perception is going to be that TAC is not policing itself,  that you have an outside body, so they might accept it a little bit more."  </P></p>

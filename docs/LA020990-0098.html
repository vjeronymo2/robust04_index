			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN WHO HIT SEN. GLENN IS FOUND INNOCENT BY REASON OF INSANITY  </P> <P> The man who slugged Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) during a television interview last  October was found innocent by reason of insanity Thursday and ordered to  undergo treatment for mental illness.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson ordered Michael Breen, 31, of Washington, to  remain at an in-patient psychiatric hospital until he can prove in court that  he does not pose a risk to others.  </P> <P> Breen encountered the senator on Oct. 25 at an outdoor television interview,  lunged at him from the side and landed a solid right to the jaw. Aside from  redness and a few days of soreness, Glenn, a 68-year-old ex-Marine, was  unharmed.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Philip Inglima acknowledged that Breen hit Glenn. The  altercation was taped by a television camera and broadcast nationwide.  </P> <P> According to the criminal complaint filed against him, Breen told police that  he was trying to get the attention of Pope John Paul II and prevent a nuclear  war.  </P> <P> A day earlier, Breen had been detained by U.S. Capitol Police and the Secret  Service after breaking through a police line and trying to reach out to Vice  President Dan Quayle's motorcade, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Missed opportunity in new SE Yellow Book Sir, The Stock Exchange's new Yellow Book has finally gone some way to address the scandal of excessive compensation for directors of unsuccessful companies ('Directors face tough SE rules', September 17). However, for most shareholders, it is unlikely to be a practical proposition to make a journey to inspect the relevant documents at the company's office or even during the 15 minutes before, and during, the annual general meeting, at which they have to be on display. What a pity that the Stock Exchange missed the opportunity to require listed companies to set out the details of service contracts and other incentives in the company's annual report and accounts, thus making the information readily available to all shareholders. If the scandals continue, this requirement should surely feature as an item to be considered when the working of the new Yellow Book is reviewed. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see what use the institutions make of the additional information now available to them.

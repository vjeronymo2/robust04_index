			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lindy Course] </F>   [Text] A man was arraigned and sentenced in total secrecy  in the High Court yesterday in an unprecedented move, contrary  to the Bill of Rights. Wong Chi-keung's case was listed before  Deputy Judge Jones on Friday and yesterday for plea to be taken  and sentence passed. However, Friday's hearing was in chambers  and yesterday's was in camera, meaning the press and the public  could not attend.    Counsel for the Crown, Alan Lucas, and the defence lawyer,  Peter Callaghan, would not reveal what had happened except to  say that the judge had been given a good reason before ordering  the unusual course.    Wong was given an undisclosed sentence on an unknown charge  or charges.    Article 10 of the Bill of Rights states that any judgment in  a criminal case shall be made public except where juveniles are  involved or it is a matrimonial case.    According to a list of criminal cases in the Supreme Court  lobby, Wong was charged with two counts of trafficking in  dangerous drugs.    A judge can hold a criminal hearing in camera, under the  Criminal Procedure Ordinance, only if it is in the interests of  justice or public order or if it is for the safety or well being  of a witness or any other person.    In previous sensitive cases, part of the proceedings have  been held in chambers, where the sentencing judge can be  informed of facts which are not revealed in open court.  However, the charge or charges are made public and so is the  sentence.    However, there is a precedent in the English courts where a  case was heard in camera although the sentence was made public.  On appeal the court said it should only be done in exceptional  circumstances and should be avoided if there was any other way  of serving the interests of justice.    Vice-chairman of the Bar Association, Gladys Li QC, said  last  night that the case was a worrying move, especially at this time  in the territory's history and she wanted to find out more about  the case.    A leading constitutional law expert strongly criticised what  he termed a "cosy little arrangement" between the prosecution  and defence saying it undermined the rule of law. "Is this a  foretaste of the secret trials for the future? It is positively  disgraceful. I cannot think of this ever happening in the  Commonwealth since the days of the Star Chamber in the 16th  century. "You cannot have a private arraignment. What is so  sad is that the Attorney-General wanted it to happen," he said.    A number of lawyers with international experience said they  had never come across a similar case. They said the judge  should have appointed a lawyer as a friend of the court if the  interests of both parties before him coincided, which may not  have been in the public interest.</p>

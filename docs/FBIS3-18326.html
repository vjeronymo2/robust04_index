Andreatta and Yusuf, said the communique, agreed on the need  to support national reconciliation efforts and that warring  Somali factions must be the ones to identify acceptable forms of  future contacts.    Andreatta stressed that after Western contingents withdraw  from Somalia, leaving fewer United Nations troops in the  country, international aid efforts will be forced to be directed  to more secure areas where "pacification is more advanced." He  also warned that Italian aid will continue only if guarantees  are given on the safety of Italians.    Yusuf reportedly assured Andreatta that the SSDF, of the  northern Mijurtin clan and one of the two strongest military  forces in Somalia, will provide these guarantees.    The ministry described the talks as cordial. They followed a  tour by Italian Foreign Undersecretary Carmelo Azzara' in the  Horn of Africa last week, when he also met Somali warlord  General Aideed in Nairobi, Kenya.    Although the SSDF has been at war with Aideed's clan since  the fall of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre in January 1991, Yusuf  in May of last year began talks with Aideed, talks which were  not officially sponsored by the political wing of the party, led  by SSDF president Mohammed Abshir.</p>

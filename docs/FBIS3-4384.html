			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Separate Trade From </F> Human Rights"]    [Text] Following U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to China in mid-March, whether the United  States will extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status has  become the focus of attention of the United States, China, and  the relevant countries and regions. Christopher originally  intended to apply the question of MFN to put pressure on China,  urging the country to improve its "human rights" situation. The  Chinese side frankly told him, however, that "China will never  accept the human rights values of the United States." Moreover,  China opposes linking trade with the question of human rights.  As a result, the ball has again reached the U.S. court. What  course should be followed? The United States is indeed facing  an important choice.    On 16 March, the third day after Christopher's visit to  China, U.S. President Clinton made his first response. In  Sino-U.S. relations, he said, "the question of human rights is  important, but so are other issues." He also promised that the  utmost effort will be made to remove the differences between the  two countries and expressed his determination to resolve the  contention with China on the question of human rights. The  Chinese Government immediately pointed out that his remarks  constituted "a positive sign." Following that, calls for  extending China's MFN status were made one after another from  various U.S. circles, and all were opposed to the linkage of  human rights and trade. Former President Bush, former  Secretaries of State Kissinger and Vance, and other major  figures from the political circles personally made appeals,  which were followed by large numbers of entrepreneurs,  economists, parliamentary members, and government officials,  gradually forming a powerful opinion.    The WASHINGTON POST pointed out frankly in an article that  the revocation of China's MFN status would be "a big economic  mistake" by the United States. In addition to harming China's  economic interests, it will also harm U.S. economic interests.  As a matter of fact, China had pointed out long ago that  Sino-U.S. relations are based on common interests rather than  the same ideology and political system. Many Americans also  made estimates of the U.S. economy. The chairman of the  U.S.-China Commerce Committee said that the volume of U.S.  exports to China totaled $9 billion last year. Once China's MFN  status is revoked, the Chinese side will undoubtedly retaliate,  which will in turn affect U.S. trade with China. Another  chairman of the U.S. Shoe Wholesale and Retail Association said  that Chinese shoes account for half of the U.S. market. If  imports from China are ceased, the prices of shoes will soar.  If China's MFN status is revoked, some people predicted,  inflation in the United States will increase by at least 0.15  percent annually.    According to U.S. officials, as Clinton made an executive  order last year, linking China's MFN status to the question of  human rights, the United States had to ask China to accept its  human rights request, though it did not want bilateral trade  ties to be affected. In fact, the United States has gotten  caught in a web of its own spinning. It is true that the U.S.  President's executive order will not work in China. Although  human rights and trade are two different matters, the United  States tried to lump the two together in an attempt to exert  pressure on China. In the end, however, it bound its own hands  and feet. Whoever started the trouble should end it, and it is  unlikely that China will help the United States extricate itself  from this predicament. Since the U.S. President issued an  executive order last year linking human rights with trade, he  must have an option available for separating the two this year.    The status quo of human rights in the United States also  needs to be improved. The poor human rights record of the  United States is known to all. The British weekly the ECONOMIST  has asked: How would the Americans feel if foreign countries  had imposed trade sanctions against the United States for its  poor human rights record in 1955? How could the United States  prove that its human rights situation has improved if the trade  sanctions had continued to the present day? If trade is used as  the method, the weekly pointed out, besides the adverse  influence on China and the United States, it will get out of  control and affect other countries and regions.    The U.S. paper the NEW YORK TIMES said in a report published  the day before yesterday that the economic authority under  President Clinton had reached a common understanding: The U.S.  annual practice of making use of human rights to threaten the  revocation of China's MFN status is outdated and should be  replaced. The report also said that this proposal is making the  rounds at the White House and the State Department. "It seems  that this mentality has taken ground in Congress." Of course,  these moves are worth welcoming. The settling of the MFN issue  once and for all is in conformity with the fundamental interests  of the China and the United States. As the United States has  not yet made a decision, we still have to wait and see. The  question of MFN has great relevance for Hong Kong. As for  China, it is prepared for either of the two outcomes: "It is  hoping for the best result, but is also prepared for the worst."</p>

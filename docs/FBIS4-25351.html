			<p>BFN     [Text] The seventh session of the Standing Committee of  the eighth provincial people's congress held its third plenary  session yesterday afternoon, presided over by Congress Standing  Committee Chairman Yin Jun. The plenary session listened to  Governor He Zhiqiang's report on the Yunnan provincial  delegation's visit to Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma.    In his report, after briefing the current session on the  visit, the governor said: A rare opportunity has emerged for  Yunnan to conduct economic cooperation with Cambodia, Thailand,  Burma, and the rest of Southeast Asia. With its geographical  conditions and existing influence, the province has relative  strong points for expanding cooperation with these countries and  the region. He said: To seize the opportunity, to bring the  strong points into play, expand cooperation, and accelerate  development in the days to come, we should further unify our  thinking and steps. In light of the development of the  situation and their own conditions, all localities and units  should earnestly study and make plans for work with foreign  countries, genuinely focus work on Southeast Asia and South  Asia, and make great efforts to create conditions to develop  trade in a larger-scale sense, turn border trade into part and  parcel of the province's trade with other countries, and enter  the large-scale, higher-grade markets of the vast areas of the  province's neighboring countries and third countries with their  products. In terms of the province's economic and trade  relations with its neighboring countries and the Southeast Asian  and South Asian regions, while developing trade with them, we  should gradually develop the export-oriented processing  industries with stress on expanding economic and technological  cooperation, speed up the pace of establishing an  export-oriented economy and take measures and create conditions  to help enterprises and companies whose conditions are ripe to  go abroad for greater access to the Southeast and South Asian  markets in extensive cooperation with enterprises run by the  state, collectives, and individuals. We should change  small-scale, fragmental, and scattered primary modes of  operation and initially foster a number of effective and  financially strong group companies, set up enterprises and do  more business in the surrounding countries, bring the strong  points into play for the long term, carry out contracting  business with some countries in specific items of cooperation,  bring Kunming's role as a central city into full play so that it  will become a newly rising city which has extensive economic  ties, a certain position, and some strength in Southeast Asia.    He Zhiqiang said: We should put construction of an  international thoroughfare to Southeast Asia in the forefront  and actively carry out cooperation with neighboring countries,  with the focus on the cooperative exploitation of natural  resources, and at the same time, accelerate the reform of the  foreign trade, foreign economic cooperation, and financial  structures, and create conditions for expanding cooperation with  foreign countries.    After hearing He Zhiqiang's report, Yin Jun said: The He  Zhiqiang-led delegation's visit to three Southeast Asian  countries was a success. It will play an important role in  further consolidating and developing the province's friendship  with the three countries and accelerating exchange and  cooperation with them. The visit has enabled us to have a  correct understanding of our province's strong points and a  greater sense of urgency, to better seize the opportunity, open  wider to the outside world, and promote our province's economic  development. He said: According to the plan of the provincial  party committee, people's congresses at all levels should speed  up the pace of legislation, exercise effective supervision, and  create a better environment and conditions for our province's  opening up to the outside world, and particularly, for promoting  exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries.</p>

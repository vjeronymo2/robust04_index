			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Procordia lifted by drugs division PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, yesterday announced a SKr1.47bn (Dollars 181m) pre-tax profit for the three months ended September, up 42 per cent from the same 1992 period. The company, which is controlled by the state and the Volvo motor group, is in the process of being split into two separate companies. The drugs side is likely to be privatised next year. Volvo is bidding for the consumer products operations. The first-quarter results show that it was Pharmacia, as the pharmaceutical and biotechnology operations will be known, that was the main contributor to the performance with a pre-tax profit of SKr911m. Branded Consumer Products (BCP), which Volvo is seeking to acquire as part of a trade-off with the Swedish government, made a SKr563m profit. Analysts said the figures were unlikely to affect the terms of Volvo's bid for the outstanding 26.3 per cent of BCP which it doesn't own. A stronger performance at BCP might have forced Volvo to improve its offer. The terms value BCP at SKr11.9bn. Revenues at Pharmacia soared 88 per cent to SKr6.55bn thanks to currency factors and the inclusion of the newly-acquired Italian pharmaceuticals group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (FICE). The unit more than doubled income from ongoing operations to SKr996m from SKr408m, after FICE made a first time contribution of SKr203m. Revenues at BCP fell 8 per cent to SKr5.47bn and income from ongoing operations was 2 per cent lower at SKr565m.</p>

The CAR agreed to assume  this historic responsibility of peace broker at the request of  Chadian President Idriss Deby. The talks are designed to  restore peace in southern Chad.    To demonstrate the CAR Government's willingness to play its  mediating role, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba made a point of  personally presiding over the opening ceremony which was  attended by the leaders of the two delegations and members of  the president's office as well as cabinet members, officials  from the prime minister's office, the judiciary, the National  Assembly, and representatives of the CAR political parties.  Speaking on this occasion, the prime minister stated that the  time had come to silence arms and give priority to dialogue. He  called for the setting up of a follow-up committee to monitor  the implementation of any accords that will be reached during  the roundtable talks. He pointed out that the CAR and the  Chadian people were interested in seeing these negotiations  yield positive results.    [Begin Mandaba recording] It is with much hope that, at your  request, we have agreed to play the noble task of mediator  between the government of President Deby and the delegation of  the political-cum-military opposition movement based in southern  Chad. The choice of the CAR was not made by chance since we  share a long common border. We have always been a natural safe  haven for our Chadian brothers. Our exchanges and relations in  all sectors have been cordial and frank and our two countries  have always resorted to dialogue in settling any border dispute  in compliance with the OAU and UN principles and ideals.  Chadian and CAR nationals have always worked hand in hand in  their efforts to safeguard their common interests. [passage  omitted] We hope that the two delegations did not come  empty-handed and will not leave here empty-handed. That is why  we strongly appeal to them to ensure that 1994 will be the year  of peace, an indispensable factor for the much needed economic  and political development of Chad.

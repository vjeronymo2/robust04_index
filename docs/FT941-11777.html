			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Jordan hit by scare over food Claims by a minister that most food and medicines imported into Jordan are unfit for human consumption has sparked a health scare there. The health minister, Dr Abdul Rahim Malhas, alleged western countries were dumping unfit produce on the local market through corrupt drug and food merchants. The allegations may damage the kingdom's reputation as an exporter. Saudi Arabia, one of Jordan's largest markets, and Sudan have banned the import of Jordanian pharmaceuticals after the scare; Iraq is said to have turned back a shipment of food. Retailers complain that goods are being left on shelves as panic sets in. European food exporters say containers of perishable goods are stuck waiting for clearance while the government decides what to do. Today, the lower house of parliament is to hold a special session on the issue. In an interview with a local newspaper, Dr Malhas claimed 'the garbage of the industrialised world' was being dumped on Jordan and existing legislation was insufficient to protect the consumer. European exporters and diplomats admitted there were problems with the quality of consumer goods on the market but that existing regulations for food imports are stricter than normal international specifications. The government has said it will look into the issue through committees, but privately is fuming at the minister's allegations. The decision by Saudi Arabia and Sudan to ban imports of Jordanian drugs and the increasing frustration from European exporters trying to bring food in have intensified the debate.</p>

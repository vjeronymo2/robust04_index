			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acorn slides Pounds 1.98m into red as schools tighten spending Acorn Computer Group, the dominant supplier of school computers in the UK, lapsed into the red at the halfway stage as changes in education spending patterns and the cost of new initiatives took their toll. Turnover was flat at Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 23.6m). The deficit amounted to Pounds 1.98m against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 and losses per share came out at 3.2p (0.5p earnings). Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director, said the first half was affected by changes in the pattern of education spending as budgetary control and financial management were devolved to schools. Customers had also delayed purchases in anticipation of the launch in April of the Risc PC, Acorn's new top-of-the-line offering. At the period end there was an order backlog of more than 2,000 Risc PC systems. The USM-traded group now comprises three companies: Acorn Computers, Advanced Risc Machines, designer of the ARM family of low power consumption microprocessors in which Acorn has a 47 per cent stake, and Online Media, a new division established to exploit the emerging market for interactive multimedia. Online Media incurred an operating loss because of start-up costs. ARM made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m in the first half, of which Acorn's share was Pounds 499,000. Mr Wauchope said Risc PC was proving a success and was confident Acorn would return to profit in the second half.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Land buys Pounds 128m portfolio British Land yesterday announced a Pounds 128m acquisition of a property portfolio from Royal Insurance, a composite insurer. The properties will be transferred to the BL Quantum Property Fund, the joint venture that British Land set up with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund last summer. It will bring the total investment of the fund up to about Pounds 400m. The portfolio, known as Sterling Estates, consists of 167 properties, predominately in the retail sector, spread throughout the UK. The rental income from the portfolio, which amounts to 1.8m sq ft, is about Pounds 10.8m a year. British Land said it believed it could extract additional value from the portfolio, which was better suited to the management-intensive style of a property company than an investment institution. 'The portfolio will be beneficial because of its strong freehold and retail content, its Scottish weight and its diversity of management opportunity, including the possibility of trading,' it said. Royal Insurance said the portfolio, which it had owned since the 1970s, was put up for sale last October because the illiquidity of commercial property made it inappropriate for a general insurance fund. The money will be reinvested in equities. The company's remaining Pounds 140m of commercial property is held for its own occupation. The Sterling Estates portfolio is 92 per cent freehold. Over 60 per cent of the properties are in the retail sector; it also includes offices, industrial property and warehousing. More than half of the properties are in the south of England, 10 per cent are in Scotland with the remainder in the Midlands, the north and Wales. The payment will be Pounds 120m in cash and 2m shares in British Land. The company has the option either to procure delivery of the shares to the vendor or to allot new shares. Completion of the deal is expected to take place on April 25. See Lex</p>

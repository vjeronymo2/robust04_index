			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Westland helicopter given approval The EH101 helicopter, developed jointly by Westland in the UK and Agusta in Italy at a cost of Pounds 2bn, yesterday received the civil certification which will allow it to be operated by air transport companies. The helicopter was simultaneously approved for use by the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK, the Registro Aeronautico Italiano in Italy and the Federal Aviation Administration in the US, after a two-year examination. Mr Alan Jones, chairman of Westland, said: 'This is a very important day for us. It marks the successful end of the development phase of the EH101 and the beginning of the marketing and production push.' Mr Jones estimated that there was a potential worldwide market for 750 EH101s over the next 30 years, which would be worth a total of Pounds 25bn to the Anglo-Italian partners. Two versions of the EH101 were approved, a naval passenger variant which is being marketed to oil rig operators, particularly in the North Sea, and a tail-ramp variant for bulky cargo. Norwegian, Dutch and British rig aircraft operators have already expressed interest in the passenger helicopter, which should be in service by 1996. The EH101 can carry up to 30 passengers at up to 167 knots (309kmh). It has made extensive use of new technology to increase safety and reduce operating costs. Westland says the EH101 offers the lowest cost per per mile of any helicopter in production. Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the CAA, said yesterday: 'The EH101 should bring higher safety standards, greater reliability and improved passenger comfort to commercial helicopter services.' Currently the Royal Air Force is considering a tail-ramp version of the EH101 for part of its new fleet of transport helicopters. Westland is locked in tough negotiations with the Ministry of Defence over price, and a decision is expected around Christmas. Provided the gap on cost can be closed, a mixed fleet of 25 EH101s and six US-made Chinooks, or 20 EH101s and 10 Chinooks may be ordered. The Italian government is likely to order 16 of the naval anti-submarine warfare version of the helicopter in the month. An order for 44 of this type has been placed by the Royal Navy. The ASW version may have significant export prospects, particularly to Gulf states.</p>

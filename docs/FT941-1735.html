			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Sinn Fein chief sees little hope of progress The stalemate in efforts to embrace the republican movement in the Northern Ireland peace process was underlined yesterday by Mr Martin McGuinness, a senior member of Sinn Fein, who ruled out progress without face-to-face talks involving the British government, Michael Cassell in Belfast and David Owen write. Mr McGuinness claimed the British government was seeking surrender by the IRA and trying to break the republican movement 'once and for all'. He said on BBC Radio Ulster that direct talks might move the peace process forward 'quite dramatically'. Mr McGuinness stressed that Sinn Fein was not calling for negotiations with British ministers but wanted talks aimed at clarifying the contents of the Downing Street declaration. At Westminster, the creation of a Northern Ireland select committee edged a step closer after a cross-party committee of MPs reached agreement on the new body's party political composition. It is likely to start work soon after Easter.</p>

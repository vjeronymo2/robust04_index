			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Oil tax loophole THE Treasury yesterday announced legislation to close a potential loophole in the taxation of oil companies. In a written reply to a parliamentary question, Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The government intends to bring forward measures in the current Finance Bill aimed at preventing the circumvention of the corporation tax ring fence around profits from North Sea oil by schemes involving the use of 'stapled stock'.' This follows a meeting last month between British Petroleum and Inland Revenue officials to discuss proposals for BP to cut Pounds 150m from its tax bill by issuing shares in its Britoil subsidiary to BP shareholders. It planned to offer shareholders redeemable preference shares with a nominal value in Britoil which would be stapled to BP shares. The shareholders could then elect to receive a dividend payment from Britoil instead of from BP. Under the plan BP would have gained the chance to offset the payments of advance corporation tax it makes on dividends against Britoil's tax liabilities. The proposals take effect for distributions to shareholders on or after yesterday.</p>

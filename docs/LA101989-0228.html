			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHECK-CASHING RULES VIEWED AS FRAUD THREAT  </P> <P> Merchants across the country are handling personal checks and credit card  transactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy, a consumer  group said today.  </P> <P> The organization, Bankcard Holders of America, assailed the practice of many  merchants requiring customers who pay for purchases with personal checks to  provide a major credit card number and expiration date, plus a telephone  number. This information is then written on the check.  </P> <P> "Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their bank card numbers on  personal checks, but these consumers don't realize the potential danger in  doing so," the group's director, Elgie Holstein, told a news conference.  </P> <P> He contended that "mail order fraud and application fraud are increasingly  popular crimes, and placing this information (a card's number and expiration  date) on a personal check enables a thief to make purchases or apply for credit  in the customer's name."  </P> <P> "Requiring customers to present a major credit card as identification, or even  noting on the check that the consumer holds a Visa or MasterCard, can be an  appropriate merchant practice," Holstein said.  </P></p>

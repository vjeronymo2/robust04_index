Brigadier Oupa Gqozo of Ciskei told a meeting of chiefs and  headmen in Bisho that state officials were informed that they  would experience problems if they did not cooperate with the TEC  and that the National Party and the ANC [African National  Congress] had left him no choice. Ciskei, which has been  gradually moving away from its partners in the Freedom Alliance,  said last month that it would participate in the 27 April  election.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE REPORT;  </P> <P> KARROS IN DODGER PLANS FOR NEW DREAM INFIELD  </P> <P> Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey were all groomed in the  Dodgers' minor league system in the late 1960s, brought up within three years  of each other and spent 10 years as the longest continuously intact infield in  history.  </P> <P> A similar foursome could emerge in Los Angeles sometime in the near future with  Dave Hansen, Jose Offerman and Jose Vizcaino as three of the four new  prospects.  </P> <P> The fourth, shooting for Garvey's role, is Eric Karros, a former star at  Patrick Henry High and UCLA now tearing up the double-A Texas League for San  Antonio.  </P> <P> "The way they talk," Karros said, "they're trying to do the same thing they did  in the late '60s. . . . They talk about how they're going to try to bring us up  together. It may be all talk, but who knows? Hopefully, it'll work out like  that, but you never know."  </P> <P> On the field or off, Karros has done little wrong in his part.  </P> <P> At Patrick Henry, he was an All-County selection in 1985, when he led the  Patriots to a near perfect season, their only loss, 7-2, to Mira Mesa in the  title game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Karros says the defeat probably is  his biggest baseball disappointment.  </P> <P> At UCLA, he hit .454 in a limited role his freshman year, .312 with eight home  runs and 57 RBIs his sophomore year and .415 with 17 home runs and 54 RBIs as a  junior.  </P> <P> He was All-Pac 10 as a sophomore and junior and a third-team All-American as a  junior.  </P> <P> Drafted in the fifth round by the Dodgers in the June, 1988, draft, Karros has  progressed up the organizational ladder one year at a time, posting big numbers  and championships at every stop.  </P> <P> At Great Falls, Mont., a Dodger rookie club, Karros hit .366 with 12 homers and  55 RBIs in 68 games while leading the team to the 1988 Pioneer League  championship.  </P> <P> The following year, at Class A Bakersfield, Karros hit .303 with 15 homers and  86 RBIs in 142 games and led the Dodgers to the California League championship.  Karros was also one of six Bakersfield players named to the All-Star team. It  was the most players selected from one team since 1970.  </P> <P> This year, Karros is second in the Texas League with a .338 average. He also  has 10 home runs with 53 RBIs and a league-leading 33 doubles for San Antonio,  which was tied for first heading into Friday's games. In the recent All-Star  game, Karros went three for five with a home run, a double and three RBIs.  Ricky Bones of the Padres' Wichita affiliate edged him for most valuable player  honors by throwing three shutout innings.  </P> <P> "Everything's gone well," Karros said. "I'm happy with the way things turned  out. I think I've got a good shot at the first base job (in Los Angeles) when  Eddie Murray is through."  </P> <P> Out of Patrick Henry, Karros had a number of scholarship offers from four-year  schools, but UCLA was not among them.  </P> <P> "I could have gone to (San Diego) State with (other Patrick Henry graduates)  Scott Middaugh, Kasey McKeon and Eric Martinez. We all had our letters of  intent, but I just wanted to get away. I always wanted to go to UCLA."  </P> <P> So Karros walked on at Westwood with an understanding. "I could be on the team  for fall ball. After that, no promises."  </P> <P> He said the adjustment to UCLA and college life was eased by the help of  another Patrick Henry graduate, Randy Hennis, who is now pitching in triple-A  in the Astros' organization.  </P> <P> Karros worked hard, quickly impressed UCLA Coach Gary Adams and was granted a  scholarship before his sophomore year. But as hard as he had worked for that  scholarship, Karros offered to give up a third of it before his junior year to  help out fifth-year pitcher Mike Magnante, who was not receiving any aid.  </P> <P> "He needed some aid," Karros says nonchalantly, "and I told Adams I'd give up  part of my scholarship. As it turned out, they found some money from  somewhere."  </P> <P> Magnante now pitches in triple-A for the Royals. As for Karros, he hopes to be  the next Garv.  </P> <P> Frank Carey, a graduate of Granite Hills and Stanford, was pictured among a  series of articles titled "Down on the Farm" in the July 23 issue of Sports  Illustrated. The issue devoted 56 pages to minor league baseball.  </P> <P> When the picture was taken, Carey played for Clinton, Iowa. He has since been  promoted to Class A San Jose.  </P></p>

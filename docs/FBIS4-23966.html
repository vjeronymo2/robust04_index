			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "Rwanda: French Pressure"] </F>   [Excerpts] A second meeting of the WEU [Western European  Union] is planned for this Tuesday [21 June]. And the Security  Council still has to decide on France's military intervention in  Rwanda for "humanitarian" purposes. Although the UN secretary-  general is in favor, the proposal has so far met with a mixed  response from the Security Council.    But France has pushed forward without waiting. Different  sources in the Zairian town of Goma, on the Rwandan border,  report on the start of a supervised operation on the Zairian  side by General Baramoto, a regime hard-liner.    A C-130 aircraft has apparently already arrived there with a  cargo of vehicles and other flights were expected during the  evening and night. There are also reports of air activity in  Kisangani. The troops sent to Rwanda have to come from Bangui,  in the Central African Republic, Gabon, and Dijibouti. Other  reports state that the French have apparently already crossed  the border and are now in Cyangugu, where the Kamembe runway has  already been repaired as Kigali airport was considered to be  impracticable. [passage omitted]    This pressure, which threatens to present the Security  Council with a fait accompli, cannot be solely explained by the  desire to end a genocide which has virtually reached its  conclusion. For Paris, it is a question of going to the rescue  of soldiers who are still with the government forces. But in  addition to these "lost soldiers" who should be able to free  themselves from the trap--some of them are West Indian and thus  more likely to pass unnoticed--certain sources indicate that  France is seeking to recover from the field certain experimental  equipment that it was testing in Rwanda and does not want to  fall into the hands of the Rwanda Patriotic Front: Light  mountain tanks and combat helicopters with about a dozen rockets  on each side.    According to a source close to the U.S. State Department,  the  United States is aware that the French operation is a "cover"  operation to conceal the rescue of two French groups, one of  four people and the other of five, who are with Rwandan  Government forces. They apparently want to get these French  soldiers out because they "know too much." This source adds  that the decision to intervene was made at the presidential  level and not by the French Defense Ministry.</p>

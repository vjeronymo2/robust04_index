			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Flying on wheels under the Channel - Nicholas Lander is more interested in the food than the view as Eurostar carries him under the Channel A leisurely breakfast in Surrey, an aperitif 10m under the sea, lunch in Paris and dinner gliding through Kent. How very pleasant. This may not be why Pounds 10.3bn was spent on the Channel tunnel. But since it is there, it certainly offers new opportunities for the determined international gourmand or those who would like to combine business and travel with a little relaxed entertainment. I decided to achieve this with the help of Eurostar. I left London's Waterloo at 8.23am and arrived at 12.23pm at Paris's Gare du Nord, a short trip by Metro to any of Paris's great restaurants. On this occasion I was on a trip to watch the baking process at Cosi's - an exciting venture which cleverly combines opera music and first-rate pizzas. By 1pm I was eating lunch at its branch at 53 Avenue des Ternes in the 17th arrondisement, (tel: 43 80 86 70). The company's other venture is at 54 rue de Seine in the 6th, (46 33 35 36). Although the airlines have spent millions upgrading their in-flight catering and wine lists, few business travellers want to eat or drink large amounts at 33,000ft. However, if one travels first-class on Eurostar, it is feasible, safe and most enjoyable. The first-class ticket includes all meals and all drinks served at your seat - and my dinner was better than any meal I have had on a short-haul, business-class flight. You can easily consume the Pounds 40 difference between the Pounds 155 standard and Pounds 195 first-class return fare. The enjoyment of the food may have something to do with being on the ground rather than in the air and the effects that altitude has on your taste buds. A conversation with Philippe Cyganski, catering operations manager at Waterloo for the Cross Channel Catering Company, a joint venture between Wagons-Lits, Inter-City On Board Services and Sabena, revealed that the food on Eurostar is prepared by the same catering companies which supply large airlines, such as British Airways. Eurostar has decided to beat the airlines at their own game. Certainly, the breakfast benefited from not being served slightly chilled - as is the case in aircraft. I cannot comment on the quality of the cooked breakfast - sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, tomato and mushrooms - because the trolley had run out by the time it reached my seat. But the viennoiserie  -croissants, pains au chocolats and rolls were first class. These are produced by Bridor, a French company with bakeries in the UK and Belgium. Even at 300kph there was no sensation of speed so that, unlike on a jet, I managed not to spill my orange juice or coffee. Breakfast, certainly without the most expensive dish, does not appear to justify the extra cost but the glass of champagne served at 9.30am, as we went under the Channel, was a nice gesture. The dinner menu has an enticing cover and begins with the phrase 'complimentary drinks'. More importantly, it is more than value for money. First, comes a trolley with a free bar followed by another with your first course - slightly over-salty smoked salmon (not a clever move when you are giving drinks away) or salade Nicoise. A charming, bilingual stewardess takes your main course order, beef fillet or grilled lamb noisettes, both served with vegetables, and places a small, sticky piece of paper with a letter 'B' or 'L' on to your headrest to enable her colleague to serve the correct main course. With all this comes wine, two whites and two reds, in quarter bottles. After your main course plate has been cleared, you are offered impressive cheeses: Cheddar, Fourme d'Ambert and Camembert, cut in front of you and served with bread, crackers and dried fruits. Dessert could be gateau moka, fresh strawberry flan or fruit. Coffee and liqueurs and a box of two Godiva chocolates follow. Service is professional and obliging. The only difficulty for all concerned came when a trio from customs wanted to see passports and tickets as the main course was being served. Combined with the cost of breakfast, it was certainly worth more than the Pounds 40 difference in the ticket price particularly when compared with prices in the rather soulless, modern buffet range. As the train pulled in to Waterloo I considered several points about the style of service. First, its quality is good but the staff were visibly finding the effort of serving so many courses to 210 first-class passengers (a short-haul, business-class flight normally seats 21) in less than three hours, a strain. Will they be able to cope when the number of trains per day increases from 1995? Second, will quality be maintained? Eurostar's troubled financial past will undoubtedly mean that operating costs will be closely scrutinised. I hope that ingredients and menus do not suffer. Third, I wish Eurostar's management had taken a more adventurous approach to catering. This is undoubtedly the train of the 21st century but the catering is simply the best of the mid-1990s. If the same quality of food were supplied in a less structured manner, perhaps by a top traiteur or delicatessen from Paris, Brussels or London, would Eurostar offer an even greater gastronomic, as well as a travel, alternative to the airlines and the ferry companies? However, I would recommend Eurostar travel and accept the challenge to eat, drink and enjoy the difference between the first and standard-class fares.</p>

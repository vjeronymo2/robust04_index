			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> IDEQ utilized an attainment demonstration for Pinehurst based upon proportional rollback modeling supported by a complete emission inventory, receptor modeling and WYNDvalley, a non-guideline dispersion model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The receptor modeling consisted of using the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) version 7.0 air quality model to analyze for days during 1988&hyph;1990 when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 concentrations were either elevated or exceeded the NAAQS. CMB results from ten PM&hyph;10 filters showed that on the average residential wood smoke and fugitive dust were responsible for 77 and 18 percent, respectively, of the PM&hyph;10 on high concentration days. The CMB percentages for residential wood smoke and fugitive dust are greater and lower, respectively, than those that were determined from the emission inventory, but the CMB analysis still confirms that residential wood combustion is the major source of PM&hyph;10 on worst case days in the Pinehurst nonattainment area. Therefore, these results support IDEQ's reliance on wood smoke control strategies to attain the PM&hyph;10 standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IDEQ used version 3.06 of the WYNDvalley dispersion model to simulate PM&hyph;10 concentrations in Pinehurst during a wintertime stagnation episode. WYNDvalley was chosen because of the model's ability to handle both the light wind conditions and complex terrain that significantly help trap PM&hyph;10 air pollution in the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area. Also, the WYNDvalley dispersion model was used because Pinehurst is dominated by area sources (wood smoke and fugitive road dust) and lacks any major point source impacts. The modeled stagnation event began on January 20, 1988 and continued through January 30, 1988. Pinehurst's design value exceedance of 183 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was measured on January 28, during this stagnant period. The WYNDvalley model showed that the maximum PM&hyph;10 values occurred at or near the Pinehurst school, agreeing with results found in the January-March 1989 CMB/saturation study. Therefore, the model helped verify that the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 monitor is situated in the area of maximum PM&hyph;10 impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The attainment demonstration indicates that Pinehurst will attain the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994, with the maximum 24-hour concentration predicted to be 143 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (which is the result of the proposed control measures reducing the projected 1994 maximum PM&hyph;10 emissions from 484.8 to 375.9 lbs/day).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to EPA's review, which identified incomplete quarterly data in 1986 and corrected for the use of non-reference PM&hyph;10 data in 1986 and 1987 (i.e. Hi-Vol SA321A gravimetric PM&hyph;10 sampler), Pinehurst has never violated the annual arithmetic mean PM&hyph;10 standard. The highest valid three-year annual average at Pinehurst is 46 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , during 1987&hyph;1989, while the lowest three-year average is 36 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , during 1990&hyph;1992. Therefore, IDEQ and EPA believe that because the annual PM&hyph;10 standard has never been violated at Pinehurst, and the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 controls have helped reduce annual concentrations (as evidenced in the downward trend in the annual average concentrations), it is reasonable to predict that the area will continue to meet the annual standard and the standard will not be violated in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is finding that the modeling analysis is adequate to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in Pinehurst. The control strategies used to achieve attainment are summarized in the section titled ``RACM (including RACT).'' A more detailed description of the attainment demonstration is contained in the TSD accompanying this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the 1997 maintenance demonstration, supplied by IDEQ, shows that Pinehurst will remain in attainment for both the 24-hour and annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS through 1997. According to IDEQ's calculations, which were partially based on a 1994 Washington Water Power residential heating survey for the Pinehurst area, the maximum 24-hour PM&hyph;10 concentration in 1997 will be 127 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This 1997 24-hour value is equivalent to a PM&hyph;10 emission rate of 332 lbs/day. Furthermore, the annual arithmetic standard will be maintained from 1994&hyph;2000, with the maximum annual average value of 47.2 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (occurring in the year 2000). This aforementioned concentration is equivalent to a PM&hyph;10 emission rate of 47.0 tons/year. This 1997 maintenance demonstration satisfies part of the quantitative milestones/reasonable further progress requirement (see CAA section 189(c)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the CAA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first three-year period or how many milestones must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting the three-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas) (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittal to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must demonstrate that two milestones will be achieved (First milestone: November 15, 1991 through November 15, 1994; Second milestone: November 15, 1994 through November 15, 1997).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

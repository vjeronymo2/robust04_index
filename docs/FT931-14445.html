			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Opposition to Saddam forms a perplexing mosaic - There are many rival groups, and the west is not sure about any of them FOR THE US and its Gulf war allies the most desirable outcome of the renewed military pressure on the Baghdad regime would be the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein. But that, too, would pose another acute dilemma for Washington as it tries to assess the Iraqi opponents of the regime and their chances of coming to power. A Middle East analyst advising the incoming Clinton administration admitted yesterday: 'US policy (on the Iraqi opposition) is that we have no policy, basically because we don't know any of these guys.' The complex divisions and rivalries within the ranks of the Iraqi opposition reflect the frustrations of exile, the influence of regional powers and Iraq's multi-cultural nature. Iraq is an ethnic and religious mosaic. Since the days of Ottoman rule its elite has been drawn from the Sunni Arabs who today occupy most high posts in the ruling Baath party. Living mainly in the centre of the country around Baghdad, they make up barely one fifth of the population. A quarter of Iraqis are Kurds, who are Sunnis but not Arabs. Some 55 per cent are Arab Shias, who share their religious traditions with Iran. The principal holy cities of Shi'ism, Najal and Kerbala, are in southern Iraq, where Ayatollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of the Iranian revolution, spent many years in exile. During the eight-year war with Iran the Shias fought alongside fellow Iraqis, but Mr Saddam, Saudi Arabia and the US all fear links between Iraq's Shias and Tehran. Iraq's two biggest Islamic umbrella groups, al Da'wa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri), form the backbone of resistance to the regime in the southern provinces of Nazariya, Amarah and Basra. Other than the Kurds, they are Saddam's only opponents with armed militias inside Iraq. Both groups are Tehran-based and not natural allies of the US. The London-based Iraqi National Congress (INC), founded in June last year, is more palatable to the west and was able to claim a degree of de facto recognition when a deputation met Mr James Baker, then US secretary of state, last July. The INC is a coalition of Kurds, liberal Shias and some moderate Arab nationalists including former Baathist leader Mr Hani Fakaiki. Its programme promises a single, democratic, multi-party Iraq but with Kurdish aspirations recognised. The INC wants wider western involvement in Iraq. It called last week for a UN security zone in south Iraq, a tribunal to try Mr Saddam for crimes against humanity, and direct UN responsibility for all humanitarian assistance. The INC's support within Iraq remains hypothetical. Iraq has changed since many of its leaders were forced into exile, and a large part of the population has been born since Mr Saddam became president. The INC has tried unsuccessfully to co-opt the Islamic groups, who because of their operations inside Iraq are unwilling to be marginalised in any unified structure. Discussions are continuing but INC leaders remain sceptical of the Islamic groups' commitment to pluralism. The Islamic groups equally doubt the extent of concrete western support on offer to a unified opposition. Saudi Arabia and Syria have both derided the INC. Although hostile to Mr Saddam, they fear the influence of the Shias and are suspicious of democracy. Both governments have resisted the creation of a unified opposition and sponsor small groups of Iraqi Arab nationalists whom they would like to see in power. In the north of Iraq some 50,000 sq km have been administered by Kurdish guerrillas since autumn 1991, when Mr Saddam withdrew his administration and imposed an economic embargo. A coalition of Kurdish parties has created a fledgling state, elected a parliament, and hosted an opposition conference in 'liberated Iraq'. But the Kurds are short of food, fuel and spare parts. The Iraqi government channels UN relief from Turkey through a checkpoint which according to the Kurds allows only about 10 trucks a day to pass. Mr Saddam has suggested resuming negotiations with the Kurds, which broke down in 1991. He has offered to accept Kurdish autonomy with jointly supervised elections within six months, and promised a share of revenue from the Kirkuk oilfields. Armed with only light weapons, the Kurdish guerrillas are in no position to confront the 100,000 Iraqi troops in the region, and depend on allied air cover above the 36th parallel. With Mr Saddam still in power and the prospects for wider opposition co-operation at best uncertain, they face an uncomfortable stalemate. 'Western policy towards Iraq is not comprehensive, it reacts to events,' said Kurdish spokesman Mr Hoshyar Zebar last week. Initial pleasure among the exiled opposition groups at renewed western military action was already giving way yesterday to frustration that the Baghdad regime had barely been scratched.</p>

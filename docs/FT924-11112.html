			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources suspended pending negotiations on board ALLIANCE RESOURCES, the Louisiana-based oil and gas company, was yesterday suspended at 9 1/2 p pending the outcome of negotiations with Manx Petroleum over the reinstatement of former Alliance chairman Mr John O'Brien. The company is likely to announce the appointment of administrative receivers if the negotiations fail. The suspension comes just a day before a winding up order presented by Alliance's former broker, Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, was to have been presented in court. The petition, which claims Alliance owes the broker Pounds 38,346 in flotation fees, has been postponed for a week. Mr O'Brien, who is also managing director and a substantial shareholder in Manx Petroleum, was ousted from his position as chairman of the struggling USM-quoted resources company just two weeks ago. Manx, which is chaired by resources entrepreneur Mr Algy Cluff, claims that in seeking to get rid of Mr O'Brien, Alliance defaulted on a management agreement signed in May. As a result, Manx is demanding immediate repayment of loans to Alliance totalling Dollars 770,000. Alliance is disputing the amount claimed by Manx. The management deal agreed in May, which resulted in Mr O'Brien becoming chairman, set out terms for a Dollars 200,000 loan to the cash-starved Alliance and management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month be paid to Manx. The fees were to have been paid in arrears beginning in April 1993. A letter sent to the Alliance board by Mr O'Brien before he became chairman also set out conditions for his acceptance of the post, which included an eventual all-paper bid by Alliance for the unlisted Manx Petroleum. The compromise being negotiated last night is likely to result in the reinstatement of Mr O'Brien. At least two of the three remaining board members are expected to step down.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (13): Down-to-earth treasurer - Profile, Richard Desmond Richard Desmond, group treasurer of BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group, sees a lot of bank presentations in his London office. When, during a presentation earlier this year, one banker airily talked about 'the client's views' on foreign exchange movements, Mr Desmond interrupted him. 'We don't have views, we have exposures,' he said. 'And if we don't have an exposure, we don't have a view.' That epitomises the down-to-earth conservative approach of Mr Desmond, who lectures on foreign exchange management and was a former president of the Association of Corporate Treasurers. Mr Desmond points out that, at BAT, which had sales of Pounds 13bn last year, 'the size of the organisation is large in relation to the size of the foreign exchange risks'. This, he believes, leads to a couple of advantages in risk management. 'We don't have to keep pressing for the last farthing in savings. And we can often take more conservative risk management approaches.' The treasury department may be centred in the UK but Mr Desmond has only a small team of five professionals at headquarters. Nevertheless, he claims that 'the quality of our treasury staff is as good as any in London'. His team both deals and devises the foreign exchange strategies. The group reports to shareholders in sterling but is a worldwide operation, with costs and revenues in many different currencies. 'We tend to be long dollars, yen and Deutschemarks' says Mr Desmond. Exposures across the group are netted so that a subsidiary which has, for example, dollar costs can obtain dollars from the head office at a budget rate. As the BAT treasurer points out, there are four potential elements of a company's foreign exchange risk: the third party transactions of operating groups; non-remitted profits of subsidiaries; dividends and other financial flows to the core; and foreign currency assets. On third party transactions, Mr Desmond says that 'every subsidiary should be managing its foreign exchange exposure' although he points out that most subsidiaries' exposures should not be large, since they have local cost factors. The subsidiaries are not without guidance on how they should handle their foreign exchange dealings. BAT runs a course in which all financial staff are trained in the style of the group. The head office also has a range of policies which cover what the subsidiaries can do, and substantial transactions have to be approved at the sub-operating group level. Non-remitted profits, which are being retained by subsidiaries for future growth, are not hedged. They are recorded by the parent company after having been translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Dividends and other financial flows are managed actively but conservatively, according to Mr Desmond. 'When volatility goes up, our strategy gets more conservative; when it goes down, we become slightly more active. If volatility goes down a bit, we use an option strategy. The cost is lower if the volatility is lower.' For much of the time, BAT makes straightforward transactions in the spot and forward markets, or using stop-loss strategies, with the target of achieving the average exchange rate for the year. However, Mr Desmond says the company is quite prepared to use sophisticated techniques, but on strict conditions. 'We take a practical approach' he says. 'We don't aggregate risks, we like to retain our flexibility. When we use a product, we make sure we understand the potential out-turn. 'Furthermore,' he adds, 'before we buy a product, such as a zero cost collar, we will run a programme to see not only what our strategy will achieve but also the cost of unwinding it half-way through.' When it comes to dealing with the exchange risk created by foreign currency assets, Mr Desmond says there are three possibilities. The first is make it abundantly clear to shareholders that the group has foreign currency assets, which are not hedged, and let them assess the attractions of the shares on that basis. This approach would mean that all the company's borrowings would be denominated in sterling, the currency in which the results are reported. The second strategy is to match the debt exactly with the assets in currency terms so that when foreign exchange markets bob up and down, the value of the group's reserves stays the same. Mr Desmond says BAT uses a third approach. 'We are a little bit more sophisticated. We look at the currency ratio of the future cash flows as well as of the assets.' He explains that this means that 'when currencies move our debt/equity ratio and interest cover ratio will tend to be stable.'</p>

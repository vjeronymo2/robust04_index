			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Economics: Hints on UK recovery prospects THE LAST rush of UK figures for this year will provide further hints on whether the economy is emerging from recession. Another rise in the retail sales figures - out on Wednesday - would add to evidence that a recovery in consumer spending is underway. Expectations are for a 0.2 per cent increase on the month. The bad news will come with the unemployment figures on Thursday. Economists are forecasting another big month on month rise. Most economists do not expect unemployment to stop rising until at least the end of next year. The very pessimistic do not see it peaking until 1996. Thursday's unemployment figures will include the latest quarterly labour force survey which measures unemployment through a household survey rather than by adding up the total number of people claiming benefit - the method used to provide the monthly figures. Many argue that the labour force survey gives a more accurate picture of the jobless total. Other economic events this week follow.

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): Change for the sake of success CORPORATE TAKEOVERS AND PRODUCTIVITY by Frank LichtenbergThe MIT Press Pounds 26.95 CULTURAL, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS by Sebastian Green and Dean F Berry Macmillan Pounds 45 ORGANISATIONAL CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE edited by Charles Harvey and Geoffrey Jones Cass Pounds 24 IN SPITE OF the apparently diverse subjects suggested by the titles of these books, corporate capability, productivity and change are their interlinked themes, and all three books take a historical perspective. Corporate Takeovers and Productivity revisits the question of whether takeovers are worth the fuss. It examines the United States Census Bureau and other data to investigate the effects of the explosive takeover activity (in M&amp;As as well as LBOs) of the 1970s and 1980s on the productivity and market share of manufacturing plants, on fixed investment and R&amp;D, on the employment and wages of blue- as well as white-collar workers, and on corporate diversification. Lichtenberg finds that the least productive plants are the most likely to change owners, that takeovers do not significantly reduce the employment and wages of blue-collar and R&amp;D workers, but do significantly reduce the employment and wages of white-collar workers; and that the effects of US mergers and acquisitions are different from the effects of foreign mergers and acquisitions, and different again from the effects of American LBOs. Confirming Lichtenberg's findings, Green and Berry's Cultural, Structure and Strategic Change in MBOs examines six case studies from different industries, concluding that MBOs have succeeded as outstandingly as they have principally because of the social, cultural, behavioural and strategic changes which they were able to put in place. Most of the changes could easily be implemented by any organisation which was so minded. The puzzle, therefore, is not why MBOs did accomplish such changes, but why do not the normal run of organisations manage it? Is it merely a question of size, so that giantism defeats the best of its children, who need to be liberated from its thrall in order to demonstrate what they can accomplish? Berry and Green do not attempt to answer those questions. Organisational Capability and Competitive Advantage does. And what a stunning collection of essays it is, looking at managerial enterprises, marketing, industry structure, the influence of the trademark on the rise of the modern corporation, the relationship between corporate strategy and accounting systems, the relationship between America's Graduate Business Schools and American business, and regulatory responses to the market for corporate control. The essays in this book help clarify and develop our understanding of how firms and nations compete successfully or fail in an increasingly competitive world. If the message of the first two books is relatively simple and clear, the message of the third is more difficult to summarise. Though Porter's work has recently somewhat overshadowed Chandler's, his concepts of organisational capability and Porter's concept of competitive advantage are potent and valued tools in the analysis of modern business. Chandler's conclusion regarding the British economy, which is described elsewhere as 'the most unsuccessful advanced economy of the twentieth century,' is that it is both short-termist and oriented toward financial manipulation - and that this orientation has depleted the economic strength of the country as well as of individual firms by directing attention away from the underlying economic logic of corporate growth.</p>

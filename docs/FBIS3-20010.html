			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has stressed that  our country insists on its firm position on the criteria  governing the composition of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.  Papoulias made his statement before leaving for Ioannina, where  the European Union's General Affairs Council will meet on 26  March. Kostas Papadhakis has the following report.    [Begin Papadhakis recording] Before leaving, Papoulias said  that in addition to other topics, the Yugoslav and Bosnian  issues will also be discussed at the meeting and that Greece  will brief the delegates on its positions. No decisions will be  made. The foreign minister described as an unpleasant  development for the Turks the UN decision on the dispatch of  Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia. He also noted that this  decision was dictated by logistics without considering any  historic foundations [katavoles] or psychology; instead of  helping peace it might ultimately make things worse.    Referring to the Greek positions, Papoulias said that  Greece's principle is that no blue helmets be sent to Bosnia.  [end recording]    Papoulias described the UN Security Council's decision as  wrong.    [Begin Papoulias recording] They made a mistake. We pointed  this out. Often, I think, the historic foundation of problems  is ignored and while we aim to satisfy the needs of logistics,  we ignore a very significant element in human psychology,  especially when it comes to the framework in which the Turkish  troops will move in Bosnia. Instead of helping peace, I believe  we are harming the peace process. [end recording]</p>

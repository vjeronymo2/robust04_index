			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> WE HAVE THE MEANS; WE NEED THE WILL;  </P> <P> SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS BEEN GIVEN EVERY CHANCE TO WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT. IT IS TIME  TO ENSURE HIS DESTRUCTION.  </P> <P> Three months have passed since President Bush announced his decision to send  American troops to the Persian Gulf. Forces from a dozen states have now been  assembled in and around the region. The President said last week he was sending  200,000 or so more troops to supplement the 230,000 U.S. forces already there.  But not one move has been made to end the devastation and plunder of Kuwait, or  to defend its beleaguered people from daily abuse.  </P> <P> We may even have lost sight of the reason Bush sent all those men and all that  materiel to the gulf in the first place. They were dispatched under Article 51  of the United Nations Charter, he explained. The article provides that all  states have the right to defend themselves against aggression and to seek help  from others in that defense.  </P> <P> Kuwait sought American help and U.S. forces were sent in response to that  request. It is simply a fact that no progress has yet been made toward  achievement of the goal to which Bush committed the United States -- even  though great progress has been made in the accumulation of forces required to  restore Kuwait's independence, and Saddam Hussein has been given ample notice  of the seriousness with which the United States and others regard his  aggression.  </P> <P> He has made no use of the generous opportunity provided to withdraw his troops  from Kuwait as he once disengaged from war against Iran. Now, senior U.S.  diplomats have conveyed through intermediaries solemn warnings to Hussein that  the remaining time to withdraw from Kuwait is very short -- perhaps only two  weeks.  </P> <P> Thus far, his belligerence and tenacity have been unaffected by the  accumulation of force against him. His assertions of sovereignty over Kuwait  have grown louder and, if possible, more intransigent.  </P> <P> By his policy of invasion, devastation and annexation, Saddam Hussein has  identified himself as an implacable enemy of Kuwait's independence. For this  reason, it is clear that any "solution" that leaves his military capacities  intact will be no solution. Otherwise, he will simply wait until international  forces have gone home to continue his plans for regional dominance. To be  deterred, Saddam Hussein must be effectively disarmed.  </P> <P> What then must the United States do?  </P> <P> "If we desire to defeat the enemy," wrote Karl von Clausewitz, "We must  proportion our efforts to his powers of resistance. This is expressed by the  product of two factors which cannot be separated; namely, the sum of available  means and the strength of the will."  </P> <P> George Bush must demonstrate will equal to Saddam Hussein's. He must also use  force to compel Hussein to abandon the use of force. Iraq is no superpower so,  if the wills are equal, there is no doubt that the United States and the  associated coalition will prevail.  </P> <P> No law of war compels the President to choose between a strategy of appeasement  and a Vietnam-style ground war. Viable alternatives exist between the two  extremes.  </P> <P> There are good reasons for not using American ground troops against Iraq. If  such forces are required, there are Egyptians, Saudis and other Arab troops  from the region who can and should ensure the departure of Iraqi forces from  Kuwait.  </P> <P> The United States could make its contribution by highly selective aerial  bombing designed to disarm Hussein. Should Hussein make the mistake of striking  a counterblow against Israel, that government will know how to respond.  </P> <P> The goal must be to disarm the megalomanic who has used force and the threat of  force against all of his neighbors.  </P> <P> Presumably, the entire coalition could later oversee the emergence of a new  Iraqi government committed to respecting the rights of states in the region to  live within secure borders.  </P> <P> As Eliot Cohen noted in his probing analysis in the current issue of Commentary  magazine, "The longer (Saddam Hussein) has to fortify Kuwait, to prepare his  armies and people for war, and to lay the groundwork for a campaign of terror  and subversion overseas, the harder he will make it for us."  </P> <P> Obviously, it is time to begin the defense of Kuwait.  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Zimbabwe moves on rates Zimbabwe's central bank, facing an outcry over punitive interest rates, has cut its lending rates to financial bodies, but economists yesterday said the action was too little, too late to bolster growth. The central bank said late on Tuesday it was lowering its rediscount rate - the benchmark rate at which it lends to financial institutions - to 29.5 per cent from 30 per cent. Citing a fall in annual inflation, it also cut the overnight accommodation rate - the punitive rate charged to financial bodies for overdrawing - to 35 per cent from 38 per cent.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Law Lords turn down Maxwell MR KEVIN Maxwell has lost the final round of his legal battle to remain silent about the whereabouts of Pounds 450m missing from Maxwell pension funds. Three Law Lords, sitting in private, yesterday unanimously dismissed Mr Maxwell's written petition for leave to challenge last week's Appeal Court ruling he must answer investigators' questions. Mr Maxwell now has until 'close of business' on Wednesday to comply with a High Court order made before Christmas requiring him to swear an affidavit giving information about transactions involving pension fund money to Mr Neil Cooper, provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), which managed Maxwell pension funds. The order requires Mr Maxwell to tell Mr Cooper all he knows of any transaction involving property funds or assets of BIM or of the common investment fund managed by BIM from October 1989 to date. Mr Maxwell had argued that he had the right to remain silent because of the risk that he might incriminate himself in the face of possible criminal charges. The Appeal Court ruled that, as a director of BIM, he was not entitled to rely on the privilege against self incrimination when facing a reasonable request for information under the terms of the 1986 Insolvency Act. It was clear that Parliament had by implication intended that the privilege against self incrimination should not be available to people facing questioning under the act, which greatly extended the investigative powers available to liquidators and expressly placed company directors and others under a duty to assist them.</p>

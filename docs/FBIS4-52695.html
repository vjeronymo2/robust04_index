			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by reporters Masayuki Tamura </F> and Toyomiki Sakata, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo Securities  Department]  <H5>  [14 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] There has been an increase in the number of  stockholders suing corporate management. Since the Commercial  Code was amended last October, the cost of bringing a class  action suit on behalf of stockholders has been substantially  reduced. Managers are beginning to realize that they may be  personally responsible for huge damage payments if they lose  suits. The prevailing corporate culture has been severely  shaken. Until recently, stockholders meetings and corporate  auditors were considered mere formalities and the system of  checks and balances is widely believed not to work. While  managers complain that the amendment is "bad law that will erode  managerial autonomy," just how will stockholder litigation  change corporate management practices?  <H5>  Damage Payment Bonanza </H5>   "We have no statement to make at this time." Shingo  Ariyoshi,  the former president of Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd., did not have  much to say after the Supreme Court handed down a guilty verdict  against him in a shareholder suit last fall--the first such  ruling in its history. After agreeing to buy out major  shareholders opposed to a joint venture, he forced group  companies to purchase the shares at a low price. The corporation  sustained a loss and was sued.    One of the six defendants has died since the case first went  to court 14 years ago. It appears as though the 100 million yen  in damages--including 80 million yen in interest--will become  the responsibility of Mr. Ariyoshi and the remaining four  defendants. A family member of one of the other defendants in  the case, a former company director, could barely conceal his  disappointment. "We'll do our best to pay the damages," he said  as his voice trailed off.    Earlier this month, Mitsui Mining announced a net profit of  100 million yen for the fiscal year ending 31 March 1994. In  order to pay the damages and avoid going into the red, the  company will have no other choice but to sell some of its  assets. Ironically, the damages paid by the old management team  will erase the profits they managed to generate for the company  and its stockholders.    A stockholder litigation procedure was first introduced in  the 1950's. Under the Commercial Code and the Civil Code,  company directors are responsible for corporate performance. As  members of the board of directors, the highest decisionmaking  body in the company, they are obligated to oversee the conduct  of the president and other top executives. They are not only  accountable for corporate losses, they are also liable for  damages should they allow company executives to conduct  corporate affairs recklessly.    However, one major obstacle to those seeking redress was  very  high court fees in proportion to the size of damages. For this  reason, there were few lawsuits. These court fees were reduced  to 8,200 yen under the recent amendment to the Commercial Code.  With this change, litigation activity has increased against a  backdrop of continuing disclosures of corporate wrongdoing.    There have been more than 10 suits in the past year alone,  including the ones brought against the directors of Janome  Machine Co. and Hazama Co. An official in the Civil Affairs  Bureau at the Ministry of Justice believes that there have been  many more undisclosed cases. According to officials at the  Supreme Court, 84 cases were still pending as of the end of  1993. At the present time, lawsuits are reportedly being  prepared against company directors at Kagoshima, Obayashi-gumi,  Daiwa Securities, and the Industrial Bank of Japan.    Lawsuits are also proliferating against small and  medium-sized companies outside of the major metropolitan areas.  At the end of last year, Hisashi Oda and two other shareholders  in the Otaru-based Sekiyu Kaiun Co. Ltd. sued the company  president for 110 million yen. Mr. Oda is a former managing  director of the petroleum marine transport company. "The  president purchased a personal membership in a very expensive  golf club without the permission of the board of directors,  causing the company to post a loss."  <H5>  Oversight Group Formed </H5>   Now, a group has come forward with a proposal advocating the  formation of an organization called the kebiishi  (sheriff magistrate) council. During the Heian era (AD  794-1185), an official by this title maintained social order in  Kyoto. According to the proposal, an oversight council comprised  of legal scholars and lawyers would monitor corporate behavior  under this same name. Last December, an organization called the  Tokyo Municipal Ombudsman was founded as a first step toward the  creation of this council. It was formed to facilitate the  formation of class action suits on behalf of major stockholders  in listed corporations. Lawyer and founder Toshiaki Takahashi is  leader of the group which also includes Waseda University  professor Hiroyuki Ikejima.    Professor Ikejima was careful to explain the purpose behind  the kebiishi council: "Our goal is not to hassle  company directors but to facilitate stockholder lawsuits as a  means to bring about sound corporate management." He is  currently studying the possibility of bringing suit against  Tokyo Electric Power and Kansai Electric Power. The Electric  Utilities Association is alleged to have made illegal  contributions to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) under the  guise of advertising fees.  <H5>  Lawyers Take Initiative </H5>   Attorneys representing plaintiffs in stockholder cases have  traditionally worked pro bono. However, lawyers who  view such cases as a "business" are beginning to appear. This is  because the legal fees in victorious suits are substantial.    In early April, a seminar entitle "How To Bring Suit" was  held in Tokyo. Many of the lecturers were heard saying the law  was "just another industry" and that shareholder suits  represented a "big market." Hidehito Ida, a lawyer who handles  shareholder lawsuits for clients such as Nomura Securities,  spoke with great candor. "First, there is the sense of justice  that corporations should behave properly. Second, there are  economic merits."    The president of a petrochemical company raised his voice in  anger: "During the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative  (SII) talks, the United States demanded that shareholder rights  be strengthened, but the quiet passage of such laws would have  caused the chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] to commit harakiri." While Keijiro  Koyama, managing director of Keidanren, agrees that "a  constructive effort is needed to reform the litigation system to  ensure proper management of corporations," he privately worries  about "frivolous lawsuits."    Recently, Keidanren has been busy gathering opinions on  shareholder lawsuits from various industries. It submitted a  proposal to the Ministry of Justice calling for 1) establishment  of "managerial decisionmaking principles" not based on results  and liability, in order to aid in the creation of a rational  managerial decisionmaking process, and 2) a legal amendment  putting U.S.-style time limits on stockholders who wish to  initiate lawsuits.    Koichiro Kurasawa, a Keio University professor and member of  the Legislation Advisory Council, wonder why there is a "sudden  interest" in time limits. He believes that there could be a  large number of lawsuits concerning criminal behavior and  managerial indiscretion dating from the bubble era. A wave of  lawsuits would indeed serve to remind managers of their legal  responsibilities.  <H5>  [15 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] "We are still studying whether to seek damages  against the former president of a company subsidiary...." The  words of Yasumasa Koshiba, the president of Isetan, trailed off.  The corporation had announced losses of 71.6 billion yen for  FY1993 due to an error in the futures market made by an overseas  financial subsidiary. Nobuo Nakanishi, the former subsidiary  president responsible for the loss, has since moved on to Sega  Enterprises. The hesitancy over seeking damages stems from the  fact that the case could implicate the founding family, which  had appointed Mr. Nakanishi.  <H5>  Statements of Intent Change </H5>   However, some of the directors at Isetan privately worry  that  if the company does not at least make an effort to recover the  losses in a lawsuit, the board may be sued by stockholders for  breech of duty. Japanese-style management, which places great  value on "consideration", is being undermined by stockholder  class action suits.    "I've really been quite busy lately." Shigeru Nakajima, a  corporate lawyer, serves as legal counsel to approximately 30  companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. He receives requests  almost daily to serve on company boards.    At a corporate board meeting in early April, Mr. Nakajima  was  bombarded with questions from directors after giving a  presentation on shareholder lawsuits. "I would like to see us  increase funding to one of our subsidiaries in order to bail it  out of its current financial difficulties. Should we worry about  a potential shareholder lawsuit?" "What are the legal  implications of voting against a measure at a board meeting?"    Proposals are often voted upon at Japanese corporate board  meetings without much opposition raised. However, if there is no  record of any opposition to a given venture in the corporate  minutes, and it is not clear which of the directors favored the  venture, then all could be held liable in a shareholder lawsuit  should the venture lose money.    Masami Hashimoto is the president of Shin-Etsu Polymer Co.  "Those opposed to any proposal must speak out and make sure that  their opposition is recorded in the company minutes." More and  more top executives are making such statements at the beginning  of board meetings.    Last May, Fuji Bank created a legal affairs department.  Tokai  Bank established one in January, with Sakura Bank following suit  a month later. Sumitomo Bank organized a legal affairs office  last October. As a legal affairs specialist at a city  [money-center] bank explained, "the number-one priority is  shareholder lawsuits." The nature of the position is changing  rapidly. "Soon everything with legal implications, including the  results from casual meetings, will be forwarded to us  automatically so that we can get it in writing."    Toshiaki Hasegawa is a lawyer. "Requests from banks and  securities houses for my legal opinion have doubled over the  course of the past two or three years. They are seeking input  from outside specialists in order to compile more accurate  records."  <H5>  Solid Bailout Policies </H5>   Nowhere is this caution more evident than in the number of  bailout requests from struggling companies that are being  rejected by banks. Money-center banks such as Tokai Bank are  turning down requests from nonbank lending institutions to  postpone interest ayments. Such requests were routinely accepted  as recently as two years ago. Excessively generous bailouts have  increased the amount of bad credit at the bank, making it  vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits.    "That was absolutely the wrong thing to say." Commenting on  the importance of public relations, a lawyer criticized the  remarks made by a board member at Shinoji Paper in a magazine  article on the speculative financial losses at the now defunct  Kanzaki Paper. The director denied any knowledge of the matter,  claiming that he had "trusted those in charge of the matter."  The lawyer shook his head. "This indicates a complete abdication  of oversight responsibilities as a company director. His remarks  would work to his disadvantage in a shareholder suit, especially  when the appropriate company records are disclosed." In fact, a  shareholder lawsuit has been brought against the Shinoji  director since these comments were made.    "The company is in the same industry, and we increased our  investment after receiving a request from public authorities."  In mid-March, Nomura Securities announced that it had decided to  increase its stake in Sanyo Securities.    Twenty billion yen will be invested in Sanyo Securities in  order to help restore it to solvency and reform the nonbank  lending institution system. Of this total, the Nomura group will  provide 6 billion yen. Sanyo Securities is deeply in debt and is  not expected to recover. Nomura has been strongly criticized for  the move. Unlike banks, which have bad loans to protect, Nomura  has no direct stake in supporting nonbank lending institutions.    Because there are limits on the amount of money the Bank of  Tokyo and other commercial banks can invest in nonbank lending  institutions because of stock ownership restraints, the Ministry  of Finance has put strong pressure on Nomura to participate in  the bailout. A company official, however, is worried.  "Stockholders have criticized this bailout as excessive. Despite  the fact that the request came from public authorities, such  comments make it clear that stockholders may consider filing a  lawsuit."  <H5>  Insurance Applications Soar </H5>   Given the cost of court fees and potential damages, company  directors are rushing to apply for liability insurance. AIU has  been selling liability insurance since 1990, but applications  doubled after the amendment to the Commercial Code was passed  last October. Currently, over 300 corporations have applications  pending. Toshishige Katsuwaki, who heads the office in charge of  corporate insurance, expects the number of company applications  to increase once again after June stockholders meetings."    Not only is there a sense of crisis brewing at corporations  over stockholder lawsuits, corporate directors are becoming  obsessed with protecting themselves. Masanori Yajiro, the  Citicorp representative in Japan, believes that better  documentation of proceedings, liability insurance, and the  opinions of lawyers may not be enough to prevent stockholder  lawsuits. "Directors must behave more responsibly towards  shareholders. I believe they should improve daily oversight by  bringing in outside directors."    During the excesses of the bubble economy, many directors  lost sight of the fact that they were in business to provide a  reasonable return on investment to those who invest money in the  company's common stock. That is why corporations are called  "common stock companies." May the increase in lawsuits serve as  a warning to those managers who neglect the interests of the  stockholder.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Foreign Ministry communique -- place and date of </F> issue not given]    [Text] On 20-21 May 1994, U.S. Assistant Secretary of  State Winston Lord on behalf of the U.S. Government and Deputy  Foreign Minister Le Mai on behalf of the SRV Government  exchanged letters of agreement on the establishment of liaison  offices in the capitals of the two countries.    According to the agreement, the initial form of official  representation of Vietnam in the United States and of the United  States in Vietnam will be liaison offices, and the heads of  these offices will be called head of the liaison office. The  two offices will work within the framework of the 1963 Vienna  Convention on Consular Relations, to which both sides are  signatories.    The opening of liaison offices in the capitals of the two  countries marks an important developmental step on the path to  the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United  States, thus creating favorable conditions for the two  governments to continue to resolve issues of common concern and  meeting the interests of the two peoples and the interests of  peace, stability, and development in the region.</p>

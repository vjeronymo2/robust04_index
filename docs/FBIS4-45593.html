But as soon as the Surrey lorry driver  pulled out of the factory gates near Malaga, Spanish police  officers descended on him.    They asked him to open the container he had just picked up,  pounced on the concrete bollards and started to break them up  with crowbars and pickaxes. Inside they found two and a half  tons of cannabis--with a street value of &pound;7 million.    Roy Clarke was arrested for smuggling Spain's biggest ever  haul of drugs. He has now been in Malaga prison for nearly four  months awaiting trial. But he says he is innocent, arguing that  he knows nothing about the contents of the bollards.    His British employers say they received instructions for  this  job from a third party, who has disappeared.    Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer with Fair Trials Abroad says:  "There  is no way Roy Clarke could be guilty. It would be impossible for  him to see the drugs; and he was clearly not involved in the  planning because he didn't know he was going to take this load  until the day he picked it up. The faxes confirmed that. But the  police wanted an arrest. This is a typical case of a lorry  driver who never had a chance."    Roy Clarke is not the only one. The Foreign Office knows of  nine cases of lorry drivers charged with smuggling drugs. David  Higginbottom, general secretary of the United Road Transport  Union says: "We're only now seeing the tip of the iceberg. It's  a big problem now and it's set to get bigger. Drivers are being  treated as scapegoats.    John Barber, a driver from Wales, was stopped on the  Franco-Spanish border on September 30 last year. His load of  tangerines, heading for Britain, was found to contain 240 kilos  of cannabis resin. Although he said it was nothing to do with  him and he had not been present when the load was packed, he was  arrested and put into Bayonne prison for three months.    He was eventually freed on a technicality, but French  customs  have impounded his truck and, unable to make a living, he has  been declared bankrupt and is about to lose his house. His MP  [expansion not given] Cynog Dafis campaigned for his release  because, he says: "I've known John Barber for a long time. He's  transparently honest."    Roy Clarke's MP, Sir Archibald Hamilton, who has written to  the Spanish Justice Minister about his case, points out that the  real villains are elsewhere. "Clearly the people who are much  more guilty are those who loaded the pipes on to the lorry. The  driver is the easiest person to get hold of, but this is an  incomplete way to smash up the drugs ring."    Drivers say they cannot be held responsible for their loads  because they cannot be certain what they contain.    "Our job is to get the stuff from A to B," says Stephen  Murray, who has been driving trucks around Europe for six years.  "It's impossible to check what's in the container--they're  either sealed or packed so tightly that you can't see in."    David Higginbottom of the URTU [expansion not given] says:  "Drivers are like postmen. Nobody would ever dream of arresting  a postman who delivered a package containing drugs. A driver has  no more idea what's inside his truck than a postman has what's  inside a letter."    Since European integration made movement around the  Continent  free and easy, police and customs officials have become  increasingly concerned about the traffic of drugs by road.  National forces have co-operated more closely to clamp down on  it. The crackdown has led to more arrests and the number of  Britons being held on drugs charges in the rest of the Continent  jumped from 604 in 1992-93 to 753 in 1993-94.    But the problem, according to campaigners, is that the  police  are not just being conscientious, they are being over-zealous.    "I'm perfectly aware that in nine out of 10 cases the people  are guilty," says Mr Jakobi of Fair Trials Abroad. "But I'm  becoming increasingly aware of cases where they're not."    Lorry drivers are not the only victims of the crackdown. Car  passengers have been made to answer for the contents of a car  they do not own. Stephen Jakobi has 11 such cases in France  alone.    Raymond Bickley, 50, a travel agent from Brighton, was  released on bail last week after 18 months in jail. He was  travelling as a passenger on his way back from a business trip  to Torremolinos in Spain when customs officers in St Malo found  45 kilos of cannabis in the car. "I was guilty only of being  naive," he says.    Janet Johnston, director of the charity Prisoners Abroad,  says: "Hardened drug smugglers are out to sell a product.  They're always looking for new ways to get through and they  don't care who gets into trouble so long as it's not them. At  the same time, the police are really sharpening up."    The problem seems set to increase. "Drugs are emotive," says  Stephen Jakobi. "But if you're wrongly accused, it doesn't  matter what you're innocent of--what's important is that you're  not guilty."</p>

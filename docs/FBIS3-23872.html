			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres: "Local Elections"] </F>   [Text] The "red revenge," which according to general  opinion will crown the upcoming local elections is, first of  all, inevitable and, secondly, not deadly.    The crux of the matter is in that difference which  commentators for some reason prefer to omit in their  presentations: In most cases, the "revanchists" will not be  representing either the party of Zyuganov, or the party of  Zhirinovskiy, no matter how one extrapolates the December  breakdown of sympathies of the population onto the future  voting. Nevertheless, if we recall the past, the December  figures are sooner reflected in the regional elections not by  the votes for one or another party list, but by the results of  the race for seats in the Federation Council. This race, as we  know, was triumphantly won by the local leadership.    The current pre-electoral landscape is unusually monotypic  throughout all of Russia: The "party of the communists" and the  "party of the democrats" are trying either to agree or to oppose  the "party of the administration." The henchmen of the  former--either leaders or businessmen surrounding the  leaders--are not difficult to recognize even in that amorphous  bunch of candidates which is today gathering signatures for  registration. (We might add that rarely are there less than  about 20 aspirants for one mandate. Usually there are more). We  need not explain that they have all the advantages in gathering  signatures as well as in the pre-electoral propaganda. Moreover,  as the recent letter from "DemRossiya" to Boris Yeltsin states,  "at each new election, there are more and more falsifications."    Specific party structures, hastily outfitted for the past  all-people's expression of will, will not help either the LDPR  [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] or "DemRossiya." As for the  former, according to the astute expression of the ex-head of the  Krasnoyarsk Kray Soviet, Vyacheslav Novikov, "everyone who is  relatively healthy has already been elected to the State Duma."  And as for the units of the latter, as the "Demoross" activists  themselves admit, "the farther we go, the less we are capable  of." The PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] may expect a  certain success for one reason: Where this party exists, it is  firmly rooted in the "party of the administration." "Choice of  Russia" cannot expect such a fate in most cases. From the moment  of Yegor Gaydar's dismissal from the office of vice prime  minister, the loyal sentiments of the governors do not extend to  him.    The winners in the local elections will be those who have  been fated to be victorious in them. In the Fall, Boris Yeltsin  increased their chances even more by farming out the  organization of the local elections to the provincial  administrators. It is interesting how, in his opinion, they  intend to exercise these rights.    However, the most important thing in this entire matter is  the fact that the described "revenge of the party active  membership" will not radically change anything in the current  situation. The local dumas in their present variant will become  amusing appendages of the administration not only because of  their personnel make-up, but simply because of their  construction. Moreover, their powers and authorities are rather  notably truncated. Not in one of the new parliaments will there  be more than two-fifths of the deputy corps working on a  permanent basis. That is only about 10 people.    We may expect that the goals of the dumas are already clear,  and the tasks have been defined. Their decisions will give  "representative weight" to the intentions and actions of the  administration. The parties will not be able to influence even  one of the parliaments, but the clans will dictate their will to  all--just as the clans of agrarians, defense men or, say, raw  materials exporters today dictate their will to the  administrations. As for the effectiveness of their pressure on  the government--it is defined not by the make-up of the  re-elected Soviets, but by the readiness of the government to  submit to this pressure.    This constitutes the most important and inevitable result of  the new elections. The nomenclature past of the new deputies,  perhaps, hinders them in the eyes of the politicized public.  However, it is not the former ideological (or career)  obligations which define the consciousness, but only the present  day subsidy-oriented (or, on the contrary, export-profit)  existence. By the way, those who are generally considered to be  reformers also were not members of the White Guard in their  lives before perestroyka.    The above-described "red revenge" merely reproduces the  current state of affairs in the country. If we assume that  everything is not yet lost for reform in Russia, then this  revenge is not deadly. If we believe that everything is  over--then everything was over even before the local elections.  If the efforts of the Kremlin to re-schedule the elections are  evoked by a desire to avoid these results, they are in vain. One  way or the other, no matter how long they are postponed, the die  comes up a winner for the "revanchists," because this die has  only one side.</p>

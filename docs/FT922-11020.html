			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Sharon attacked over push for homes ISRAEL'S frantic drive led by the hardline Mr Ariel Sharon to provide housing for a flood of immigrants from the former Soviet Union was attacked yesterday for being ill-planned, sometimes illegally executed and for wasting millions of dollars of public money. A report by the State Comptroller, which severely embarrassed the ruling Likud party two months ahead of a general election, also accused senior housing ministry officials of abusing personal expenses, channelling contracts to companies run by Likud members and throwing a party for Likud activists. Mr Sharon has long been a controversial figure who has used his position as housing minister to spearhead a big increase in Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. He said in his defence that he had achieved the priority of overcoming a housing emergency caused by the arrival of 400,000 immigrants since late 1989. Any instances of corruption or wrongdoing would be investigated. But the report fuelled criticism that special powers given to Mr Sharon had led to excessive building and gross overspending, inflating overall budget deficits at a time when the economy was stagnating. The report said: 'From the economic and financial point of view, it seems the use of public money was not made subject to the proper checks and balances, and considerations of efficiency and savings were not the guiding line for decision makers.'</p>

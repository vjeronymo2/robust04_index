			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Robbing Peter to pay Peter - Serious Money City stockbrokers are too often mealy-mouthed. So, it is a pleasure to see Credit Lyonnais Laing's investment trust team biting the hand that feeds it. 'Many investment trusts are over-priced at the moment. Buy the equivalent unit trust,' is the gist of its message*. The argument is compelling. Traditionally, most investment trust shares have sold at substantially less than their underlying asset value - unlike units in unit trusts where the price is pegged to the asset value. But a long bull market and heavy marketing have cut the typical investment trust discount from around a quarter in the mid-1980s to under 5 per cent in February and around 8 per cent now. In a few cases, shares have actually sold at a premium to the underlying assets (for example, the Japanese trusts discussed on page III). The near elimination of the discount has had two consequences. First, trust shares have risen faster than the stock market, making it simple to sell the concept of investment trusts to the public. Second, it has been easier to launch new investment trusts on to the stock market. (While other trust shares were still selling at big discounts, any new issue promptly plummetted.) In theory, trust managers should be exempt from the normal commercial pressures on new issue promoters. But it is easier to pull in money for a fund operating in a fashionable area of the stock market. Hence Laing's second criticism: managers launch funds in markets and sectors which have the best of their growth behind them and are now over priced. Like its rival, NatWest, Laing believes that substantial investment trust discounts will return, sooner or later. So, shares in most trusts are likely to do worse than the underlying stock market; and those which are still selling at a premium to asset value, or operating in over-priced sectors, are likely to do worst. We would add one point to Laing's charge sheet, however. Even if the discount itself returns only in a small way, many of the newer trusts now have a small time bomb ticking away: warrants. Free warrants - the right to buy shares in the trust at a pre-set price for a certain period of time - have been one of the main baits used to encourage investors to buy new trust issues. The warrants acquire intrinsic value only when the share price rises above the subscription price. But they tend to be priced quite highly by the stock market, even when new, in the hope that they will in due course acquire intrinsic value. So, even if the shares of a new investment trust droop below the issue price, the managers can point to the market price of the warrants and argue that the 'package' is holding its value. What they do not point out, though, is that the investor is being bribed with his own money - or, to be more precise, the future proceeds of his existing investments. Assume the trust's investment portfolio and its own shares do well. This makes it certain that warrant-holders will eventually take up their right to buy shares cheaply. So, the net asset value of the investor's existing shares at that time will fall because of these new claims on the underlying assets. In effect, the discount which used to eat into share prices at the beginning of the trust's life has now been replaced by a levy later on. And if, in the intervening period, substantial discounts to asset value have again become the norm throughout the trust sector, there will be a second bite on the value of his shares. Do these Cassandra-like musings mean that all holders of investment trusts should immediately sell the lot? Laing argues that anyone with trusts trading close to, or above, asset value should switch. This could be costly for private investors, quite apart from any gains tax implications. But we do endorse the broker's warnings against buying into shares which are trading near asset value, particularly those of fashionable new issues. How suitable that this week was the centenary of the birth of Benjamin Graham, the father of investment analysis. His sceptical comments on new issues have been quoted here before. Here he is on warrants: 'We consider the recent development of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing menace and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate dollar 'values' out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence except to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors. They should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a minor part of the total capitalisation of a company. '. . . Why, then, are these subscription warrants created as part of the original capital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial matters. They don't realise that common stock is worth less with warrants outstanding than otherwise.'** Happy birthday, Ben. Seven weeks ago, this column commended the attractions of fixed-rate mortgages at 7.5 to 8 per cent. This week, we note that equivalent mortgages cost 9.25 per cent. How satisfactory. *The Credit Lyonnais Investment Trust Yearbook 1994, price Pounds 19.95. Details: 071-588 4000. **Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor; Harper &amp; Row, New York.

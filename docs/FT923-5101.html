			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Budget fears drive down Italian shares: Comit index at lowest since September 1985 THE Italian stock market fell 2.5 per cent yesterday, partly owing to fears of an even tougher budget for 1993. The Comit index fell 9.65 to 375.34, its lowest level since September 1985. The government said in July that L83,000bn (Pounds 38.9bn) would have to be found in increased revenues and spending cuts to hold the public sector deficit to L148,000bn next year. However, it emerged this week that at least a L10,000bn extra would have to be found to cover the increased cost of higher interest rates which are in force to protect the lira. As the government of Mr Giuliano Amato begins work on the 1993 budget, which must be presented to parliament by the end of the month, the senate has resumed its study of the four main structural reforms - in pensions, public health, regional administration and the civil service - proposed by the government in July. It is planned to raise some L32,000bn next year through streamlining the civil service, delegating the first real powers to regional administrations to raise taxes, shaking up the inefficient health service and curbing Italy's exceptionally generous pensions system. Parliament is being asked to approve the broad principles of the reform and, by the mechanism of special delegated authority, permit the government to work out details. Already, some 800 amendments have been tabled, 500 by the breakway communist grouping, Reconstituted Communism. Thus, if the end of the month deadline is not met or parliament fails to endorse the reforms, the 1993 budget risks being undermined. This possibility unnerved the stock market as did fears about the effect of austerity measures on an already stagnant economy, combined with the lira's continued weakness. Fiat shares, also reflecting the drop in European car sales, fell 3.6 per cent to below L4,000 per share for the first time since 1985. The stock market appeared to pay little regard to the one piece of positive news: preliminary inflation figures for August showing consumer prices up only 0.1 per cent. Inflation is now running at 5.3 per cent on annualised basis, and if the rate continues its steady fall since May, it could be below 5 per cent by the end of the year. See World Stock Markets</p>

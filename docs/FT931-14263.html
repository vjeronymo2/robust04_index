			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (15): Deferrals and omissions make progress patchy - Andrew Hill probes sensitive areas where unity is elusive THE single market was always going to be a patchwork. Nobody ever expected a flawless barrier-free area to take shape at midnight on December 31, 1992, however much the politicians like to say that it has. Instead, the single market has been an evolutionary programme of measures, with different elements coming into force at different times. Many of the most important changes have already happened. For example, exchange controls were lifted in eight countries - all except Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain - by July 1990. The first legislation to open up the market for public procurement, worth 15 per cent of the European Community's gross national product, came into effect as early as the beginning of 1989. Graduates' qualifications have been recognised across all 12 member states for the past two years. But in spite of the surprising speed with which the European Commission and member states have worked to adopt and enforce single market legislation there are still some notable gaps, which it will take many years and much political negotiation to fill. Broadly, they divide into three areas: delays, deferrals and omissions. Delays: These are the measures which have not taken full effect, even though they have been adopted by member states, because they have yet to be properly implemented or transferred into national law. Such delays are occurring in all areas of single market law. According to some analyses, less than 50 per cent of Lord Cockfield's 280 or so measures have been transferred into the national law of all 12 member states. Commission officials play down this figure. They point out that the original legislation makes clear that all adopted measures come into force on January 1, 1993, even if they have not been transferred into national law. Thus, consumers or traders who believe that they are being deprived of the benefits of the single market by their government's sluggishness can take the national authority to court. More worryingly for the barrier-free market, efficient member states - such as Denmark, which has transposed more than 95 per cent of the relevant legislation - could theoretically block the import of goods manufactured under rules which had not been altered to conform with single market law. Deferrals: The single market is riddled with deferrals - or 'derogations' in EC jargon - usually written into legislation to ease a political agreement, or because it will take time to implement a measure. Frequently they apply only to one or two member states, sometimes to a specific industry. The most obvious example is the 'transitional' system for collection and administration of value added tax (VAT). Member states agreed a system which allowed border controls to be abolished on January 1. But this is, in theory, only a temporary measure, and the Commission still envisages the installation of a permanent VAT system in 1997. Under this permanent system businesses would benefit from the same advantages as consumers, who can now buy all goods, except cars and mail-order items, at local VAT rates. In practice, EC business is already upset about the burdens allegedly imposed by the transitional system, and may resist another change as early as 1997. Other important derogations include: freedom for insurance companies to set up and do business across the Community (July 1994); the 'single passport' for stockbrokers and banks to deal shares across the EC (January 1996, with banks' access to exchanges in Spain, Portugal and Greece delayed still further); and open competition for airlines, which have been able to set any fare they want from January 1, but will not be able to fly any route they choose (including 'domestic' flights in one member state) before April 1997. Omissions: These are areas which are usually so sensitive that member states have been unable to agree. In most cases they were not even part of the single market programme: Energy. Energy liberalisation was excluded from the 1985 Cockfield white paper, and recent discussions on how to open up gas and electricity markets have led nowhere. Member states have already, albeit reluctantly, agreed to allow some cross-border transit of electricity and gas, and some countries favour linked proposals to improve the transparency of companies' accounts and end monopoly rights over electricity production and the construction of energy networks. But they balk at the idea of giving consumers the right to buy their energy from any supplier in the EC. Commission proposals should have given large users the right to 'third party access', as it is known, from January 1, with the possibility of small users being granted the benefits from 1996. But the UK, the EC's strongest advocate of energy liberalisation, ran up against heavy opposition during its presidency of the Community and the measures have not been agreed. Telecoms. The Commission, often using special powers to override EC members' objections, has already pushed through measures to liberalise the EC market in telecoms services and equipment. But it has fought shy of putting pressure on member states to liberalise the most obvious area - ordinary phone calls. A long-awaited review of the sector, published by the Commission in October, pointed out that the cost of cross-border telephone calls in the EC was excessive but said there would have to be yet more consultation with the industry and consumers before legislation could be introduced. Postal services. Moves to open up mail services to competition are lagging behind liberalisation of the telecoms sector, but the story is roughly the same. A discussion paper produced by the Commission last May stepped back from suggesting immediate liberalisation of mail services, although in due course Brussels may produce legislation to open up direct mail, cross-border and express postal services. Company law. This is the area of the single market white paper where progress has been slowest. That is not because the measures under consideration are particularly sensitive - although Britain, among others, objects to clauses on worker participation - but because member states seem to have decided that such legislation is less essential than Lord Cockfield and his colleagues originally thought. Even moves to agree a voluntary European Company Statute for multinationals have stalled over the last year, while a measure to harmonise takeover procedure across the Community has been dropped altogether. (See separate article.) A single currency. This is so obvious that it is often overlooked. EC leaders agreed at Maastricht that a single currency would be in place by 1999 at the latest, but that 'deadline' is subject to ratification of the treaty by national parliaments and to strict economic criteria. Logic says that the Ecu would be an indispensable part of the single market; politics - notably in Denmark and the UK - could mean that it ends up the most important omission of the lot.</p>

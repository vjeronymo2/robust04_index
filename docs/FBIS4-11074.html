			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a brief conversation on the morning of 19  April between the U.S. ambassador to Port-au-Prince and three  officials of extreme-right organizations of lesser importance,  including the Convergence of Mass Organizations, the Haitian  Front for Democratic and Nationalist Organizations, and the  Haitian People's Alliance. Those officials asked the Americans  on 18 April to defend the honor of Haiti in view of France's  arrogance. We are but a few minutes from the biggest power. We  cannot tolerate our humiliation by France, they said during a  sit-in. They were not admitted to the office of the ambassador  on the morning of 19 April.</p>

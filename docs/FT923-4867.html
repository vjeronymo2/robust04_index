			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Move to end deadlock in Tajikistan OPPOSITION leaders in Tajikistan made plans yesterday to end a month-long political impasse by dissolving the presidency, a day after demanding the resignation of hardline President Rakhmon Nabiyev. The plan, which the opposition intended to put before a special parliament session today, came amid fresh fighting in the streets of the southern regional capital Kurgan Tyube. The city has been the centre of violence between Mr Nabiyev's supporters and his opponents, in which more than 2,000 have died and 100,000 have fled. Observers say the proposed parliamentary move amounted to a political coup d'etat. 'They'll declare him non-president tomorrow, either legally or not, and the diplomats are going to have an interesting time. Whom do we listen to?' asked a senior diplomat in Dushanbe. Mr Nabiyev remained in hiding yesterday and protesters kept possession of his palace. A senior KGB official said Mr Nabiyev had taken refuge in a Commonwealth of Independent States garrison in Dushanbe. Mr Nabiyev, Tajikistan's former communist party boss, has steadily grown weaker since taking power in an election last year. In May he ended a 51-day protest by handing over eight of the most powerful seats on his 24-member cabinet to the opposition. But last month he had to fight off yet another attempt to unseat him in parliament. In its declaration on Wednesday, the opposition stopped short of stripping Mr Nabiyev of power. But in effect its plan achieves the same end. Mr Nabiyev has not surfaced since protesters stormed his palace on Monday, saying he refused to stop his supporters from attacking opponents in Kurgan Tyube. The protesters were comprised mostly of refugees from fighting in the city. Opposition leaders have severed television broadcasts from neighbouring Uzbekistan and one of two Moscow television channels, which they believe are hostile to Tajikistan. The move further isolated this nation of 5m people, who share a 1,100-mile border with China and Afghanistan. In July, Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov cut all aircraft services to Tajikistan, fearing that weapons from the fighting could be smuggled in. A severe fuel shortage has limited trade to a trickle.</p>

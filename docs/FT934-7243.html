			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Murdoch tones down super-vote plan MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday toned down key features of its proposed 'super voting share' issue, in a bid to win approval for the controversial scheme from the Australian Stock Exchange and fund managers. The media company said it would place a 'cap' of 40 per cent on the aggregate number of votes which could be exercised by the holders of the super shares. In addition, new shares would be transferable without any loss of voting power, and they would be quoted on the ASX. 'It is also probable that quotation of the super-voting shares will be sought on the London Stock Exchange and, in the form of American depositary shares, on the New York Stock Exchange,' a letter from News Corp's lawyers said. Despite the concessions, the Australian Investment Managers' Group - representing most of major fund management groups - said its members still strongly supported 'one share-one vote' and had 'grave concerns' about the plan. Differential voting rights do not feature in Australia, and the News Corp plan would require an amendment to the ASX's listing rules. News Corp had never formally revealed details of the original scheme. However, it was understood shareholders would have been granted one new share for every 10 ordinary held, and each new share would have carried around 25 votes. Critically, the 'super' voting rights under the first plan would only have attached to the new shares as long the original owner did not sell them. This structure could have allowed Mr Murdoch - who owns around 32 per cent of News Corp's equity, either directly or through his family company - to achieve 'creeping control' as other investors sold their super shares. He, and other family interests, could also have sold their ordinary shares without significantly diluting their voting rights. News Corp's justification for the plan was that the company might need to issue equity to fund deals and joint ventures, and did not want to endanger management's security of tenure. Under the revised scheme, the super voting shares would still be distributed to shareholders by way of a one-for-10 bonus issue. However, the 40 per cent cap would ensure the number of votes conferred by each super-voting share would be much lower than 25 - more like six and two-third votes per share. If, over time, new ordinary shares were issued, the 40 per cent cap would remain and votes attached to the super shares would change. For example, if a further 900m ordinary shares were issued, the super-voting shares would confer 10 votes a share. The process would continue until the number of votes per super share was effectively 25. The ASX recently released a discussion paper dealing with the principles of differential voting rights and is seeking comment.</p>

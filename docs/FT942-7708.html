			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poland may revise bank disposal plans Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, has suggested that the government's bank disposals programme could be revised. 'The first question which we will be answering by the end of next month will be whether we consolidate the state-owned banks or privatise them,' he said in a newspaper interview. The finance ministry has been planning to sell several more state-owned banks, including the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) which was due for privatisation by the middle of this year. It then planned to consider merging the remaining state banks, either with those already privatised or with each other, before privatisation.</p>

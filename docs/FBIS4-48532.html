			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- Thirty-two right-wingers  facing charges including murder and attempted murder arising out  of pre-election bombings in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] were granted bail on Friday by the Johannesburg  regional court.    This follows an unsuccessful application by the state on  Friday morning to re-open its case. State prosecutor Mr Koos  Pretorius wanted to recall the investigating officer in the  case, Col Neels van Wyk, to lead further evidence on why the  accused should be denied bail.    Magistrate C J van Heerden dismissed the application because  the provision in the Criminal Procedures Act relied on by the  state was for criminal proceedings and not for bail  applications. He said, in granting the accused bail, the state  had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities the men's  release would not be in the interests of justice.    Mr van Heerden said the state had not proved that any of the  accused were directly involved in the bombings. He said the  state's submission that no further bombings had taken place  since the men's arrest was not necessarily indicative of their  guilt.    Proceedings were adjourned for discussion of bail terms.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS BACK PLAN TO CONTROL SPEEDING  </P> <P> A plan to put radar guns into the hands of citizens concerned about speeding  along their neighborhood streets was strongly backed by planning commissioners  and residents this week.  </P> <P> About 30 residents attended the Planning Commission meeting Tuesday night to  voice their support for the Neighborhood Speed Watch program, a city-backed  proposal that would place radar and an electronic speed display board in  communities with traffic problems.  </P> <P> "I was very impressed by the program," said Planning Commissioner Howard Revie.  "It's probably the best way to control speeding in San Clemente."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission unanimously supported the proposal, which city  officials said should go before the City Council for approval next month.  </P> <P> Neighborhood volunteers would be trained to use the radar guns and display  boards placed in highly visible locations on residential streets. The  volunteers would take down license plate numbers of speeders and send them to  City Hall, which would then mail warning letters to the offenders.  </P> <P> City officials emphasized that no citations will issued by either the city or  the residents.  </P> <P> Mehran Sepehri, a city traffic engineer, said the program will be relatively  inexpensive, costing about $3,000 for equipment and publicity.  </P> <P> "Several of the residents (Tuesday night) said they wanted us to buy more than  one unit," Sepehri said. "I think we would want to wait and see how this one  does."  </P> <P> The traffic engineer and several police agencies say this is one of the first  times they have heard of the program being used in California. The idea was  brought over from Renton, Wash., by City Manager Michael W. Parness.  </P> <P> Sepehri said several traffic engineers from other cities and private firms have  contacted him about the Neighborhood Speed Watch since the program was  publicized.

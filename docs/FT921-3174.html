			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (10): Unfinished business - Privatisation has slipped behind the timetable ANY SUGGESTION that Nigeria's ambitious privatisation programme is stalled is hotly denied by the national privatisation agency, the Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC). Its spokesman says firmly: 'We are on track to finish the programme by the end of the year.' But there is no getting away from the fact that the programme has slipped way behind its original timetable and should have been completed by now. Nigerian Airways, for instance, should have been sold by mid-1991 but officials now say it will definitely have gone by the third quarter of 1992. To date, 78 enterprises have been privatised  - compared with 71 a year ago  -and N1.6bn raised from the sale of state-owned enterprises. The target is to sell off another 30 before the end of 1992 which, if all goes to plan, will push privatisation proceeds over N3bn. The real test is yet to come in three respects; first, with the 'easy' sell-offs behind it, the TCPC now has to tackle the heavies such as Nigerian Airways, the federal government's stake in six vehicle assembly plants, the Nigerian National Shipping Line, the National Paper Manufacturing Co and the three steel rolling mills. In an effort to speed up the process and improve the prospects of selling off large, often highly unprofitable enterprises, the TCPC has changed its strategy. Three of the most recent sell-offs, including the Dollars 50m sale of the Lagos Federal Palace Hotel, have been on a deferred public issue basis. This technique is being used where a parastatal has a strong asset base but poor operational results that preclude it being offered to the public through the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The TCPC identifies 'core group' investors to whom it sells the equity on the understanding that a substantial shareholding will be offered to the investing public within a stipulated period. In the case of the Federal Palace Hotel complex in Lagos, five interested buyers, including Daewoo of South Korea submitted bids, but the hotel went to the Nigerian-owned Ikeja Hotels which agreed to pay Dollars 26m before the end of March 1992 with the balance, plus interest at 1 per cent above the minimum lending rate, payable over five years. The buyer has agreed to sell 40 per cent of the equity in the Federal Palace within five years by way of a public offer to Nigerian investors. A similar technique was used in the sale of the 60 per cent government-owned Nigerian Engineering Construction Co (NECCO), though in this instance the National Provident Fund, which is about to embark on a large home-building programme with an initial investment of N100m at the new capital, Abuja, bought the government's stake for N25.9m. Within five years, it is to offer 20 per cent of the shares to local investors. The second looming challenge is that of commercialisation where very little visible progress has been made. A year ago, the TCPC said it expected to sign management contracts with 30 state enterprises during the first quarter of 1991. The target date for the signings is now March-April 1992. A TCPC spokesman says: 'We are fine-tuning various reform packages and five-year corporate plans' for a broad range of public utilities, including the Nigerian Railway Corporation, the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), the NNPC and the telecommunications authority, NITEL. Telecommunications are to be deregulated to allow private sector companies to compete with the state-owned NITEL, NEPA's electricity distribution activities are to be privatised and the Nigerian Mining Corporation has been instructed to stick to its knitting and sell off non-core activities, such as brickmaking and ceramics. NITEL is expected to retain control of telecommunications switching and transmission equipment along with the existing infrastructure, but specific business services, (such as cellular phones, satellite-paging networks, digital overlay networks) will be opened up for private sector participation. Another possibility is that of allowing equipment suppliers to take some of the equity in telecommunication activities in those regions where the supplier's equipment is dominant. This would open the door to equity participation by international groups such as Siemens, ITT and Marubeni, though just how keen they are to take an equity stake is unclear. There are several other parastatals where there is scope for core group investor participation by either foreign or domestic investors, including Nigeria Airways, the Nigerian National Shipping Lines and the Nigerian Railway Corporation. The TCPC, which is to disband at the end of the year, has recommended the creation of a successor body in the form of an Enterprises Monitoring Bureau. This would operate as an independent regulatory authority monitoring the performance of those parastatals which the state will continue to own. The third challenge arises from the uncertainties surrounding the return to civilian rule at the end of the year. Given past slippage, it seems almost certain that a number of significant privatisations will be left to the next administration to handle. But if the TCPC does disband, there can be no guarantee that the incoming government will complete the programme. However the civilians play their cards, it will be some years before a realistic assessment can be made of the contribution of public sector restructuring to enhanced economic efficiency. Nearly six years into SAP, the public sector continues to be a drag on development. The TCPC's initial success in selling the government's minority holdings in commercial and industrial businesses managed by joint-venture partners was the easy part of the exercise. The hard part will be finding core group buyers for the likes of Nigerian Airways, the steel mills and vehicle assembly plants. Similarly in commercialisation, signing management contracts is the easy part - getting them to stick will be another matter altogether, especially with a civilian administration tempted to treat parastatals as a vehicle for political patronage.</p>

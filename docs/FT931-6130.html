			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Wyatt calls for list of freelance BBC executives MR WILL WYATT, managing director of BBC Network Television, has called for a list of BBC executives who are freelances, whether or not they have their own private companies. The action follows the revelation that Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, was a freelance consultant from the time he joined the BBC six years ago until Monday, when he applied to join the staff. Bectu, the broadcasting union, will ask BBC management for a list of private companies operating within the corporation. Even senior BBC executives do not know how many executives are not on the staff. Virtually all members of the drama department have been freelance for many years. Apart from some executives of London Weekend Television, private companies for broadcasting staff seem to be rare. Mr Vernon Lawrence, former head of drama at Yorkshire Television and now head of drama and entertainment at the ITV network, explained yesterday why he went on Yorkshire's staff when he became a department head. 'When you have a company car and a company TV and a company video, how can you be anything else but an employee?' Mr Lawrence asked. 'I've paid through the nose but I can sleep in my bed at night.' Mr Marcus Plantin, the ITV network director who had a private company when he was at LWT, declined to discuss whether he was now paid through a private company. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, said yesterday he was concerned at the 'dual standards ' involved in the Birt case. The BBC had become increasingly strict about who it accepted as a freelance. Mr Lennon said that even categories of production worker recognised by the Revenue as freelance had tax deducted under pay-as-you-earn. Mr Andy Egan, Bectu's tax specialist, said yesterday the Revenue's usual test was: 'Are you part of the organisation or are you autonomous?' He added: 'Clearly the director-general is part of the organisation, only more so.' Mr Birt last night rebuffed reporters' questions about the controversy after he had spoken at a public meeting in Cardiff about BBC finances. The audience did not ask about his own finances. The accounts of Mr Birt since he joined the BBC as deputy director-general show steadily rising turnover and equally rising administrative expenses. In 1987, for instance, turnover was Pounds 93,599 and administrative expenses were Pounds 77,833 including remuneration and National Insurance for the two directors, Mr John Birt and Mrs Jane Birt. By 1989 turnover had risen to Pounds 136,234 and directors' remuneration was Pounds 82,399. In 1991 directors' fees were Pounds 80,604 out of total administrative expenses of Pounds 159,174.</p>

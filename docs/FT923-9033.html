			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Phasing out is predicted for company car perk THE BEGINNING of the end of the company car as a perk was forecast yesterday in a report that found evidence that employers are offering cash instead. Only a few companies have axed the company car, but many others are planning to follow suit or offer cash instead because of diminishing tax benefits and the recession, according to the report by Incomes Data Services. Cash allowances instead of cars are being offered at City companies such as Nikko Europe, Citibank, Morgan Grenfell and Merrill Lynch as well as high-street banks such as Midland and TSB. Companies that have stopped providing cars to staff entirely include Bankers Trust, which made its decision because of the popularity of the allowance alternatives and a desire to reduce costs. Mr Ray Storry, one of the report's authors, said yesterday that employers would continue to provide company cars when they were essential tools for jobs, as in sales. However, the Inland Revenue's proposals to increase tax for status cars, generally those provided to senior managers as a perk, would lead to more companies revising their policies. The widespread use of company cars in the UK has always been anomalous, the report says. UK managers traditionally earn less than their counterparts in other countries but they are provided with better cars. However, the climate is changing. Providing cash alternatives to cars can be an attractive recruitment tool. Cars Or Cash, Research File 23.

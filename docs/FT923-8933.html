			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Judge chastises NY Daily News A FEDERAL bankruptcy judge in New York yesterday chastised the unions, management and creditors of the Daily News, the New York tabloid, and warned them that the newspaper's survival could be in doubt unless they can agree on a plan to obtain fresh cash. The two bidders for the paper are Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News and World Report magazine and The Atlantic Monthly, and Mr Conrad Black, owner of the Daily Telegraph in London. There is also a so-called 'stand-alone' plan under which Silver Screen, a group of film financiers, would join forces with the management. Although she extended to August 17 the deadline under which the newspaper must submit a reorganisation plan to emerge from its present bankruptcy status, Judge Tina Brozman said the paper was 'teetering on the brink of a very large precipice'. She said the Daily News must obtain new financing soon it if is to survive. A progress report by the newspaper's managers and union leaders was greeted with derision by the judge, who said she did not like what she heard. 'You may be jeopardising my ability to keep this newspaper alive. It appears to me you are still all going in different directions,' Judge Brozman said. The judge, who appointed her own representative to monitor the Daily News bid talks, warned that the paper was in danger of 'dissipating all its assets'. The judge's representative will meet this morning with key aides to the prospective bidders. Before she issued her rebuke, a series of contradictory reports were offered by two unions and the management of the newspaper.</p>

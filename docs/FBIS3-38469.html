Kashmir figured prominently during the  talks the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, had with the German  leaders in Bonn. The prime minister explained to them the  problems faced by India due to Pakistan's abetment of terrorism  in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Mr. Narasimha Rao also  apprised the German leaders of the serious threat posed to the  country's unity and integrity from cross-border terrorism. The  prime minister said Pakistan is deliberately creating conditions  for not having a meaningful dialogue. He also informed them  about the confidence-building measures his government had taken  in the past toward good neighborly relations with Pakistan.    The issue also figured prominently during the foreign  secretary-level talks in Bonn. The Indian side told the Germans  about the setting up of the commission to look into the  allegations of human rights abuses and permission given to the  Amnesty International to visit the country. Attention was also  drawn to the threat by Pakistan to move an anti-India resolution  at the Geneva session on human rights. New Delhi sought  Germany's help to thwart the attempt. Bonn assured that the  anti-Indian motion on Kashmir will not serve any useful purpose.  Both countries also called for wider representation in the UN  Security Council to ensure the political effectiveness of the  collective will of international community. Both India and  Germany are aspirants of a permanent seat in the council.</p>

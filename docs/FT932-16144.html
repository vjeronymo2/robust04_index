			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Scrip dividends The fashion for enhanced scrip dividends risks getting out of hand. The tax efficient nature of the scheme - especially for companies writing off unrelieved advance corporation tax - does not disguise what is in effect a mini-rights issue. The market should thus apply the same tests as to a conventional cash call. Companies which can make a convincing case for re-investing the dividend are worthy of support. All credit to Coats Viyella for yesterday pin-pointing specific investments on which it looks likely to achieve a decent rate of return. By asking shareholders to forego a cash dividend to shore up its balance sheet, Ladbroke is stretching the point. Altering dividend arrangements after shares have gone ex-dividend equally sets a poor precedent. Both Ladbroke and RTZ transgressed in this respect. Investors buying either share after the ex-dividend date, only to find the dividend subsequently increased, might justifiably feel aggrieved. True, the companies benefit from lower tax and interest charges. They may also have been reluctant to announce tax-driven arrangements before the Budget. Such pragmatic arguments are no excuse for the risk of creating a false market. If shareholders approve, Coats may issue shares in place of its next interim dividend. It should be wary of coming back next year as well, even if the reinvestment case is strong. Finding cash for the dividend is a valuable discipline. Companies which print shares rather than meet such obligations are no more deserving of support than governments which monetise deficits.</p>

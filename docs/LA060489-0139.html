			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DITCHING THE BORDER DITCH  </P> <P> Why is the U.S. government going to dig a ditch to protect us from the waves of  immigrants washing across our southern border? What will this really solve?  </P> <P> While it is clear that the Otay Mesa area is experiencing the stress of a large  influx of migrants, building a ditch will only drain the community's pasture  lands, not stay this insurgent tide.  </P> <P> The vast majority of immigrants come to the United States because of their  experience of poverty and war. Until this bitter reality is removed, the flood  across our borders will only pour in at another point.  </P> <P> The United States could help the reality of poverty in Mexico, Central, and  South America by assisting these countries to develop job opportunities within  their own borders.  </P> <P> The aim of U. S. assistance should be to bring about economic self-sufficiency.  The ultimate goal should be to improve the quality of life for people whose  only crime in coming to the United States is wanting to survive.  </P> <P> Further, U. S. assistance to these nations should be based upon the clear  understanding that those nations that receive such aid operate in the  democratic tradition which allows free elections and does not subject its own  citizens to torture and government by terror.  </P> <P> Such policies, though slower and more difficult to implement, will have far  more effectiveness in the long run to stay the tide of illegal immigration than  the rather simplistic solution of digging a ditch.  </P> <P> CHARLENE McCARTNEY  </P> <P> Ramona  </P></p>

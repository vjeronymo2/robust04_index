[passage omitted]    The Fatah statement warned against a war being waged by the  Shin Bet in a bid to "prepare the climate for a prolonged civil  war." The statement said that "the Shin Bet aims to create  suspect bodies that raise the national slogan and operate under  different names within Fatah." It called on the movement's  supporters "to act with alertness and high responsibility and  not deal with these unofficial and illegitimate organizations."    The statement stressed that "organizational statements"  signed by Fatah in the West Bank and Gaza Strip "are approved  officially by Fatah's supreme organizational committee in the  occupied territories." Other statements are considered  "unofficial," including those by "Fatah's organizational offices  in the territories."</p>

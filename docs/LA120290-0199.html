			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FIRM TO STUDY FIRE ASSESSMENT COST;  </P> <P> PALOS VERDES ESTATES: COUNCIL'S HIRING OF A CONSULTANT IS A STEP TOWARD  REPLACING TWO PARCEL TAXES WITH AN ASSESSMENT DISTRICT TO FUND CITY PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates council members last week approved a $25,000 contract with  San Diego-based BSI Consultants Inc., which will determine how much homeowners  would have to pay for fire services if a special assessment district is formed.  </P> <P> The council's move is aimed at eliminating two parcel taxes that residents now  pay to help fund emergency services and parks and street improvements. Council  members have expressed concern that should the taxes ever be voted down by  residents, the city would find itself strapped for funds.  </P> <P> The two taxes, known as Propositions A and B, are staggered and voted on every  four years. This fiscal year, the taxes are expected to generate $1.9 million  in revenue, about one-quarter of the city's budget.  </P> <P> Most of the $1.9 million goes to pay for fire services under a contract with  Los Angeles County. Although forming an assessment district and letting the  parcel taxes expire would raise about $50,000 less, the difference could be  made up by belt-tightening moves, city officials said.  </P> <P> "The notion (behind the assessment district) is that you have some  predictability and some stability in your funding structure," City Manager  James Hendrickson said.  </P> <P> Under its contract with the city, BSI will determine precisely how much  individual property owners would pay to an assessment district. The average  homeowner would probably pay less than he or she presently pays in parcel  taxes, Hendrickson said.  </P> <P> However, because assessments would be based on property size, some homeowners  would pay more than others, he said.  </P> <P> The city plans to mail the individual assessments to property owners within the  next few months, city officials said. A public hearing on the matter will then  be held in March or April.  </P> <P> If fewer than 5% of the city's property owners file written protests, the  council could move ahead and form the assessment district. If more than 5% but  less than 33% protest, the city is required by state law to put the matter  before voters. If more than 33% protest, the council must abandon the plan.  </P></p>

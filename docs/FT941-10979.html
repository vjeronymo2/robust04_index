			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Probe into flight of capital from former Soviet Union abandoned An international investigation into the flight of capital from former Soviet Union - currently running at an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) a month  -has been shelved because of lack of support from the Russian authorities. The inquiry by Kroll Associates, US corporate private investigators, was set up by the Russian government amid wide pub-licity in 1992. It had strong support from the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, which were formulating aid plans for former Soviet republics. Russian officials proclaimed it as showing their commitment to cracking down on criminal activity and curbing the flight of capital. But with the IMF in Moscow again considering further Russian demands for help, Kroll has confirmed the investigation was never completed because of a lack of support. One investigator said: 'We spent months talking to western companies and banks which have been dealing with Russia . . . the file we gathered raised our suspicions about certain players and institutions (in former Soviet Union). Our problem is that when we sent it to Moscow it was never followed up.' He added: 'Undoubtedly our report turned out to be more political than was anticipated.' News of the abandoned investigation has emerged at a time when cash-rich Russians are reported to be spending heavily in western capitals. According to Mr Boris Fyodorov, until recently the Moscow government's finance minister, Russians are moving into the UK property market. Exclusive London retailers and auction houses also say there is a keen interest in artwork and jewellery. While a substantial part of the funds is legitimate, Whitehall officials and UK regulators are increasingly concerned that London is becoming a centre for Russian flight capital of dubious legality. The Institute of International Finance, which represents 175 international banks, has drawn up the estimate of at least Dollars 1bn leaving Russia each month, although a significant part of this includes foreign currency legally deposited by Russian companies into Russian banks which then place it overseas.

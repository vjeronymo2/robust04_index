			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOSCOW CITY COUNCIL DEFIES BAN ON RED SQUARE PROTESTS  </P> <P> Moscow's radically minded City Council said today that it will defy Kremlin  pressure to prevent anti-Communist protests during Red Square parades to mark  Revolution Day next week.  </P> <P> A spokesman said the council agreed in an emergency session Thursday night to  allow two protest demonstrations next Wednesday, including a march past KGB  headquarters.  </P> <P> The decision clashed with a decree issued earlier Thursday by parliamentary  Speaker Anatoly Lukyanov, an ally of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, declaring  counterdemonstrations "inexpedient."  </P> <P> Lukyanov warned on television of the possibility of clashes disturbing  celebrations of the 1917 revolution -- an event now seen by many Russians as a  national tragedy.  </P> <P> Moscow City Deputy Vladimir Bokser said the Soviet Parliament has no powers to  enforce its will.  </P> <P> "The only effect this will have is to anger people and bring thousands more  onto the streets to protest," he said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, eager to avoid humiliation for the beleaguered Communist Party and  the armed forces' general staff, issued an unprecedented presidential decree  last month ordering military parades to go ahead in the capitals of all the  nation's constituent republics.  </P> <P> But a constitutional commission recently robbed him of his right to ban  unofficial demonstrations in central Moscow.  </P> <P> In the southern republic of Azerbaijan, the military commandant, who rules  under emergency orders, has called off his parade to avoid disturbances. But  the military are resisting pressure to cancel in the restless,  independence-seeking Baltic republics.  </P></p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Economics: Hope of pointers on UK policy from Clarke's first Mansion House speech MR KENNETH Clarke, the new British chancellor has picked a busy, and potentially awkward, week to deliver his first pre-budget Mansion House speech. Economists are hoping tomorrow's speech will help them form a clearer idea of what the so-far reticent Mr Clarke has in mind for the UK economy. He will be speaking after the release of May's industrial production figures. Manufacturing output is forecast to have risen marginally on the month. Another fall - following a 0.3 per cent month-on-month fall in April  -would increase pressure on the new chancellor to ease monetary policy. But unemployment data later in the week is forecast to show only a slim rise in the May jobless total following three successive monthly falls. Other economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International.

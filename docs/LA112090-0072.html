			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TUNA CANNERS SEND BUYERS A MESSAGE WITH 'DOLPHIN-SAFE' LABELS  </P> <P> The three biggest players in the nation's tuna-canning industry are now  shipping their product in cans with labels that describe the contents as having  been caught through techniques that do not kill or injure dolphins.  </P> <P> The "dolphin-safe" labeling is prominently featured on labels of cans shipped  by San Diego-based Van Camp Seafoods, which packages Chicken of the Sea brand  tuna, and San Diego-based Bumble Bee Seafoods. StarKist, the Long Beach-based  subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Co. also is shipping tuna in cans bearing the  "dolphin-safe" label.  </P> <P> Each of the manufacturers' labels now includes a variation on the  "dolphin-safe" theme as well as a drawing of a dolphin. Van Camp, Bumble Bee  and StarKist account for 75% of the tuna sold in the U.S., and the U.S.  accounts for about half of the worldwide market for tuna. Cans with new labels  are gradually replacing older cans on supermarket shelves, according to  spokesmen for the companies.  </P> <P> Van Camp, Bumble Bee and StarKist pledged in April not to buy or sell fish that  were caught using methods that kill or injure dolphins.  </P> <P> The canners' agreement to ship only "dolphin-safe" tuna followed years of  pressure from environmentalists, who estimated that then-current fishing  techniques were killing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 dolphins a year.  </P> <P> The three canning companies have pledged to no longer process tuna that is  caught with gill or drift nets, which indiscriminately kill large numbers of  marine animals, including dolphins.  </P> <P> Officials at the San Diego-based American Tunaboat Assn. earlier this year  argued that the ban was not needed because of improved fishing techniques that  have dramatically reduced the number of dolphins killed by the U.S. tuna boat  fleet.  </P> <P> ATA member boats, which use giant purse seiner nets to catch tuna, killed  12,643 dolphins during 1989, far below the 20,500 quota that had been set by  the federal government, according to ATA statistics.  </P> <P> Bumble Bee "initially began packaging and labeling the (dolphin-safe) tuna back  in mid-summer," said spokesman Tim Larrick. Cans bearing the new labels, which  feature the "Bumble Bee" and a dolphin, are being shipped to all San Diego  retail outlets, Larrick said.  </P> <P> San Diego-based Van Camp Seafoods has designed a new label for its Chicken of  the Sea brand. The new, red-on-white logo includes wording that alerts  consumers to the fact that the tuna was caught without injuring dolphins.  </P> <P> "We selected this new logo so consumers can quickly recognize they are  selecting the right (tuna)," said Don George, Van Camp's marketing director.  "Our research shows consumers strongly prefer our new design, and that it  enhances the product's image."  </P> <P> George said consumers are aware of the "dolphin-safe" label. "There are some  consumers who are concerned if (the dolphin-safe language) is not on the  label," George said.  </P> <P> "But it's been communicated that Van Camp" won't process tuna caught in a  manner that injures or kills dolphins, George said.  </P> <P> StarKist began shipping its "dolphin-safe" cans June 19, said Erik Bloemendaal,  the company's general manager of product quality and communications. "Our label  bears a symbol of a dolphin leaping across water with the words 'no harm to  dolphins.' "  </P> <P> "The general public has been very much supportive of our dolphin-safe policy,"  Bloemendaal said. "They've sent us a lot of letters, postcards and things  commending us for our leadership on this issue."  </P></p>

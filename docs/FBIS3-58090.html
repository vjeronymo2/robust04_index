			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Childhood Diseases of Direct </F> Elections"]    [Text] Eleven candidates finally succeeded in capturing  slots in the first direct presidential elections. Based on the  game rules currently in effect, the number could easily have  been even larger. This makes one think of tightening the rules.  It is very simple to fulfill the requirement of needing the  signatures of 20,000 supporters, if they can be collected in the  same manner as one fills out a lotto ticket at a service  station. Signing for someone else or for an imaginary person  constitutes fraud and deception of the authorities. A person who  engages in such behavior, or the candidate's election  representative, could be brought up on criminal charges.    The right of popular movements to appoint candidates should  not, in itself, be made too difficult in connection with direct  popular elections. If we end up having as many candidates as we  have now, the notion of giving all candidates equal treatment in  the media becomes absurd. The media, including the Finnish  Broadcasting Company, must, to a greater extent, rely on their  journalistic judgment. Otherwise, we would end up in a situation  where the media publicity resulting from the status as a  presidential candidate could be used as a front for various  ulterior motives.    Some obvious weaknesses have become evident in the parties'  preliminary election procedures. Remedying these shortcomings  should mainly be up to the political parties. In particular, the  experiences that all the parties involved have had with the open  preliminaries should give us food for thought. The appointment  of a candidate for the Social Democratic Party moved away from  the party to outsiders. The Center Party's preliminary  elections, in Helsinki and suburbs, attracted a large number of  people from other areas who only wanted to protest against the  appointment of the party's sure candidate.    In its current form, the presidential election campaign,  including preliminary elections and party summer congresses,  will last almost a year. As the preliminary elections have come  to stay, the role of the party congresses in appointing  candidates becomes insignificant and a formality. The  preliminary elections and the naming of candidates could easily  be moved to early fall, which would mean that the election  campaign could be shortened to only a few months. If some  parties want the party congress to give a candidacy its  imprimatur, they could arrange for an extraordinary party  congress once every six years.</p>

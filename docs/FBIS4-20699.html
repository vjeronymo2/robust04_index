Introduction </H5>   The NUCLEN Nuclear Power Information Database (NUCLEN File)  was constructed and its services are provided by the Japan  Information Center of Science and Technology (JICST). JICST, at  the behest of the national government, developed this database  for the purpose of promoting an understanding of nuclear power  and its usage by making available to as broad a segment of the  populace as possible information on nuclear power-related  policies, technologies and educational programs.    Services are provided in the online mode using the JOIS  information retrieval system, which JICST developed on its own.  In addition to NUCLEN, the following database services are also  provided via JOIS: JICST Science and Technology Bibliographic  File (JICST File), a broad-based collection of scientific and  technological data in bibliographic form obtained from science  magazines, conference proceedings and reports generated around  the world; JMEDICINE, a Japanese medical bibliographic file  comprised of medical-related documents; and the medical  bibliographic file MEDLINE.    The NUCLEN File was constructed around a core of nuclear  power-related data extracted from the JICST File, to which was  added government and public relations data. The NUCLEN File is  an accumulation of data dating back to 1981, and as of June,  1993, contained roughly 300,000 data elements. This file is  updated once every six months. The principal fields covered and  number of data elements for each field are shown in Table 1.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

And a gratuitous translation service is also offered  for foreign-language documents accessed via NUCLEN.  <H5>  2. Accessing the NUCLEN File </H5>   The NUCLEN File can be accessed online using a personal  computer equipped with a modem connected to a telephone line.  Table 2 lists 10 JICST branch offices that serve as access  points for NUCLEN, plus the system can also be accessed from  anywhere nationwide via the DDX and INS-P systems. Three baud  rates -- 300, 1200 and 2400 bps -- can be used to access NUCLEN  via JICST and INS-P access points, and two baud rates -- 300 and  1200 bps --are used to access it via the DDX system. The method  for accessing NUCLEN differs depending on whether you use  commercial off-the-shelf communications software or the  dedicated retrieval software provided free of charge by JICST.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Dial the number to the access point.    2. Check to make sure the modem data lamp is ON, then press  RETURN.    3. The message ``JICST NETWORK PLEASE ENTER  (JOIS,STN,JOISF):'' will be displayed. Enter ``JOIS'' and press  RETURN.    4. The message ``CONNECTED.. ENTER TERMINAL ID'' will then  be  displayed, at which time you simply press RETURN.    5. The message ``JICST ON-LINE SERVICE'' is then displayed.  Input ``&yen;JOIS 000-5454, (your name),'' and press RETURN.    6. The message ``Password please U:$$$$$$$$'' will be  displayed, at which point you input ``NUCLEN,'' and press RETURN.    7. Then the message ``S: Commence dialog U:'' will be  displayed, and access is complete. After the ``U:'' input  ``&yen;FILE 610'' to commence retrieval.  <H5>  (2) Accessing the System Using JICST Dedicated Retrieval </H5> Software    The NUCLEN dedicated retrieval software is menu driven, and  selecting ``G. Library Guide'' from the menu screen will bring  up the retrieval screen. (It will take a little time for the  menu screen to change to the retrieval screen since auto log in  and auto dial operations must be carried out first.)    And those who do not own personal computers can come in to  any JICST branch office or cooperating agency and make free use  of the dedicated software-equipped personal computers installed  in those locations. Table 2 provides a list of addresses and  telephone/modem numbers of JICST's branch offices nationwide.  <H5>  3. Example of NUCLEN File Retrieval Operation </H5>   Figure 1 provides an example of a retrieval operation in  which a Japanese-language NUCLEN file was retrieved on the  subject of ``Nuclear Power Generation Safety.''   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-012A>      Figure 1. Sample Retrieval Operation </FIG>   <H5>  4. Methods of retrieving NUCLEN Files </H5>   Retrieval items are divided into primary and secondary  retrieval items, and the methods for retrieving these differ.  The number of data elements are displayed in the retrieval  response together with the SSno. (retrieval step number).  <H5>  (1) Primary Retrieval Items </H5>   Primary retrieval items consist of (1) all keywords, (2)  category codes, (3) authors' names and (4) document titles. Each  item has its own retrieval code, to which colons (:) are  attached in order to retrieve them.  <H5>  [1] All Keywords </H5>   Words contained in titles, abstracts, control words and etc.  are compiled into what is called ``All Keywords.'' The retrieval  code for all keywords is AL, but this code can be omitted.    Sample input: U:Nuclear power generation    When retrieving data on an item-by-item basis, then the all  keyword code needn't be used. Use the individual retrieval codes  for those items instead.    The retrieval code for Japanese-language titles, as well as  those which have been translated into Japanese from foreign  languages is TI.    Sample input: U:TI:Radiation    The retrieval code for abstracts that summarize the contents  of a document in 150-300 words is AB.    Sample input: U:AB:Computers    Control words, which make use of thesaurus terms to manifest  the contents of documents, are used to minimize retrieval gaps.  The retrieval code for control words is KW.    Sample input: U:KW:Radium isotope    Free term refer to important words that express the contents  of documents, but which are not contained in the thesaurus.  NUCLENSUB is provided as the free term for documents other than  those extracted form JICST files. The retrieval code for free  term is FT.    Sample input: U:FT:NUCLENSUB  <H5>  [2] Category Codes </H5>   Category codes are used when you want to make an  all-inclusive retrieval of general concepts or when you can not  obtain satisfactory retrieval results using all keyword  retrieval operations. The principal category codes are provided  in Table 1. The retrieval code is CC.    Sample input: U:CC:NB03060 Z  <H5>  [3] Authors' Names </H5>   When retrieving Japanese-language documents by authors'  names, input these names in katakana last name first.    When retrieving foreign-language documents in this way,  input  the author's last name first, followed by his first initial.    The retrieval code for authors' names is AU.    Sample input: A:AU:OKANO SHINJI  <H5>  [4] Document Titles </H5>   Document titles are written in English (the titles of  Japanese-language documents are written in roman letters) and  are retrieved by inputting the individual titles.    Sample input: U:JT:ENERUGI    To increase the efficiency of retrieving primary retrieval  items, you can make use of forward agreement retrieval, logic  operations and proximity operations.    You can use forward agreement retrieval operations when you  want to retrieve other types of information related to your  retrieval word, such as ``inspections'' or ``protection'' in  relation to the retrieval word ``radiation.'' Simply input  ``&amp;''  after the retrieval word.    Sample input: U:Radiation &amp;    Since there is always a lot more information available than  you are able to find using a single retrieval word, ordinarily  you retrieve information using two or more retrieval words. This  is called a logical multiply or AND operation, and uses the word  ``AND'' or an asterisk mark (*) to connect the retrieval word  and SSNo. (retrieval step number).    And when your retrieval word has a number of synonyms, you  use a logical add or OR operation. The OR operation uses the  word ``OR'' or a plus sign (+) to connect the retrieval word to  the SSNo.    Sample input: U:Nuclear reactor*non-destructive  examination    When you wish to carry out more precise retrieval operations  than are possible using logical multiply (AND) operations, then  you can specify the proximity relationship of retrieval words  using a proximity operation. With a proximity operation, you  input so that the proximity operator links the retrieval words  together. There are four (4) kinds of proximity operators, [W],  [N], [S] and [F].    The [W] retrieves information in the order that the  retrieval  words in front and back of it are input.    The [N] proximity operator retrieves information associated  with the retrieval words in front and back of it, but does so in  no particular order.    The [S] retrieves information that contains the input  retrieval words in the same paragraph. For this purpose, titles  are considered one paragraph.    The [F] proximity operator retrieves titles, abstracts,  keywords (control words) and other such items that contain the  specified retrieval words (in which the retrieval words exist  together).    The proximity operators [W] and [N] cannot be input in  Japanese (kana).    An example of a proximity operation input would be  ``U:JT:ENERUGI[W]KEIZAI''  <H5>  (2) Secondary Retrieval Items </H5>   When you want to focus the results of your primary retrieval  efforts further by language, publication dates and such, then  you conduct secondary retrieval operations. You always conduct  primary retrieval operations before carrying out secondary  retrieval operations. In secondary retrieval operations, you  input the retrieval code followed by an equal sign (=).  <H5>  [1] Language Information is Written In </H5>   When you want to limit your search to the language that the  document is written in, then you specify that language code  after inputting ``LN=''. The language code for Japanese is JA,  and for English is EN.    Sample input: U:LN=JA  <H5>  [2] Year of Publication </H5>   When you want to limit your search as to the year documents  were published, you input a four-digit year after the codes  ``PD=''. You can also specify in or after a certain year by  inputting a hyphen (-) after the four-digit year.    Sample input: U:PD=1990-  <H5>  [3] Terms Found in Titles </H5>   When you want to limit your search to documents with titles  that contain specific words, then you input ``TI='' followed by  a pair of ampersands (&amp;) bracketing the specific word you are  searching for.

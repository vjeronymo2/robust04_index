			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: US broker to sue Kleinwort PAINEWEBBER, the Wall Street securities firm, will file a lawsuit against Kleinwort Benson today, five days after three senior managers of a PaineWebber asset management unit defected to the UK investment bank, allegedly with confidential information. The suit, to be filed in New York by PaineWebber unit Mitchell Hutchins Institutional Investors, alleges that three former MHII executives conspired to misappropriate proprietary and confidential information belonging to MHII, and wrongly provided Kleinwort's US affiliate with that information. Among other allegations outlined in the suit, PaineWebber charges that the three executives - former MHII president and chief executive Mr Stephen Canter, former chief investment officer Mr Emad Zikry, and former vice-president Mr Thomas Goepfert - solicited MHII clients, disparaged MHII, and solicited MHII employees to join them at Kleinwort Benson International Investment, the London bank's US subsidiary. Ultimately, seven other MHII employees left to join Kleinwort. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Kleinwort, and an injunction from the court barring the defendants from soliciting or accepting asset management business from MHII clients, from using MHII information, from soliciting MHII employees and disparaging the company. PaineWebber will also ask the court to set up a trust to hold any fees earned by the defendants from their activities related to MHII. Today's actions follow last Friday's defection by the three MHII executives, who helped manage Dollars 4bn of clients fixed-income investments. PaineWebber says that by Saturday the three had already begun contacting MHII clients, writing to them on Kleinwort letter-headed paper. Officers at Kleinwort Benson's New York office were unavailable for comment last night.</p>

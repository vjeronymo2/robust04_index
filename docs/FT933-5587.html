			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Silvermines mounts sharp turnround SILVERMINES, the Dublin-based electrical and property group, announced a turnround in the six months to June 30 from losses of IPounds 479,000 to pre-tax profits of IPounds 251,000 (Pounds 235,000). There were losses of IPounds 3.23m for 1992 as a whole. The result was achieved on reduced turnover of IPounds 12.3m (IPounds 20.8m). Mr Bob Morton, chairman, said the policy of tight control over costs and overheads was enabling the group to trade more profitably. He added that the anticipated improvement from the electrical division was being realised. Norcroft Dynamics had been added to that division in June and other acquisition opportunities were under review. There was also an improvement in property profits arising from upward rent reviews and lower interest charges. The directors have decided to dispose of all the group's investment properties and financial investments when market conditions permitted. Earnings per share were 0.32p (2.13p losses). There is no interim dividend (1p). But the directors are seeking approval to reduce the share premium account to eliminate the deficit on reserves and allow the resumption of dividends.</p>

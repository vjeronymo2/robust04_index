			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPIEGEL GETS STAY AGAINST ORDER TO DEPOSIT ASSETS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE EX-COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF IS GRANTED A TEMPORARY REPRIEVE FROM  PUTTING $19 MILLION OF RESTITUTIONS AND PENALTIES INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT.  </P> <P> Thomas Spiegel, former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan chief executive, won a  reprieve Friday from immediately depositing $19 million of restitutions and  penalties into an escrow account.  </P> <P> But in granting the reprieve, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los  Angeles froze the assets of Spiegel and his wife, and required him to post a  $1-million bond by next Wednesday.  </P> <P> In a two-hour hearing, Spiegel's attorneys successfully challenged an order  issued Thursday by the Office of Thrift Supervision that would have required  Spiegel to place the funds and his Columbia stock in an escrow account by noon  Friday.  </P> <P> The order was part of the largest civil complaint ever filed by S&amp;L  regulators against an individual. In that administrative complaint, the OTS on  Thursday charged Spiegel with improperly diverting $19 million of the thrift's  funds to pay himself hefty bonuses, buy luxury planes, a gun collection and  condominiums, among other allegations. The OTS also moved to levy a $5-million  fine against Spiegel for burdening the Beverly Hills-based S&amp;L with losses.  </P> <P> Spiegel's attorneys challenged the applicability of the laws on which the OTS  based its complaint. They argued that those laws apply only to current S&amp;L  officers. Spiegel resigned as Columbia's chief in December and since then has  severed all direct management ties to the thrift.  </P> <P> Spiegel's attorneys also argued that regulators failed to give the former  executive a fair hearing.  </P> <P> "They've been conducting an investigation for more than seven months and  they've provided no explanation as to why it was necessary to act as  precipitously as they did," Spiegel attorney Dennis Perluss said after the  hearing. "They filed their charges without giving us any advance notice. They  provided no justification for the cease-and-desist order."  </P> <P> In granting Spiegel a temporary restraining order, Wilson said the balance of  hardships in the case "tips strongly" in favor of the former Columbia chief.  Wilson said Spiegel must notify the government 48 hours in advance of any  expense he incurs of more than $5,000, excluding attorneys' fees or  "reasonable" living expenses, and that such expenditures can be challenged in  court.  </P> <P> The judge said Spiegel and his wife could not "transfer, sell, encumber or  otherwise dissipate" assets, including transferring them outside the country.  </P> <P> Wilson scheduled a July 30 hearing to explore regulators' charges. Both sides  are required to file court papers in the case no later than July 16, he ruled.  </P> <P> Harris Weinstein, chief counsel for OTS, said after the hearing that "the OTS  is pleased the judge has placed significant constraints on the ability of Mr.  and Mrs. Spiegel to use and move their assets while the matter is under court  consideration."  </P> <P> However, the judge denied an OTS request that the Spiegels file with the court  a statement disclosing their assets. Weinstein said that denial could hinder  efforts to enforce the freeze.  </P> <P> "It's always harder when you have to go back and reconstruct assets as of a  certain date," Weinstein said.  </P> <P> Spiegel, in a written statement, called Wilson's order "fair and reasonable."  </P> <P> Spiegel and his family control about two-thirds of Columbia stock. But those  securities are virtually worthless, as the thrift has posted huge losses during  the past year, in part because of the decline in value of its $3-billion  portfolio of risky junk bonds.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 3 Mar (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, said in a statement upon  returning from Moscow that the settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would from now on "take a completely  different turn." During a news conference, the Srpska republic  president said Russia's complete involvement in efforts to  settle the crisis and the establishment of a balance of forces  in the international scene were of paramount importance.    "Russia," said Karadzic, "is returning to the international  scene not to confront the West, but as a very active factor in  the process of seeking a solution to the crisis."    Asked whether a new concrete initiative can now be expected  on the part of Russia in connection with the conflict in Bosnia,  Karadzic said the Russians "will act in coordination with the  others." He also said at least two of Russia's moves -- the  settlement of the crisis in Sarajevo and the opening of Tuzla  airport -- have surprised Western circles.    "It seems to me that Russia gained considerable advantage  points on the basis of which it can now take part in the efforts  to resolve the crisis on an equal footing. I expect and I  suppose that meetings will now take place in Moscow similar to  the ones in Washington," said Karadzic.    Commenting on the Washington agreement, Karadzic said it was  still being analyzed in the Srpska republic and it was not yet  certain whether the agreement was being drawn up to the  detriment of Serbs or it was a partial step toward peace.    "If they form a joint state, we also have to take care of  our  territories and borders. They have to be easy to defend in the  event our neighbor becomes hostile," Karadzic stressed.    "In principle it is not good that America has taken over the  UN's role and it has replaced international institutions with  the great ambition to work out an agreement only between the  Croats and Muslims," Karadzic said.    He added: "I am afraid that America is losing yet another  opportunity to show itself to be impartial. Therefore, the  impression that it is biased and that it is against Serbs is  being confirmed."    He specified that the next step by the Srpska republic would  be to strengthen peace on all front lines in order for  negotiations to take place in the best possible atmosphere, and  that the Srpska republic would not allow the formation of a  Croatian-Muslim coalition and their joint state at the Serbs'  expense.    Talking about the decision to open Tuzla airport, Karadzic  said the Serb side had never opposed the opening of the airport  for humanitarian purposes, and the deal agreed with the Russians  ensured that the airport would not be abused.</p>

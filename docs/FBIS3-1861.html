According to Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics  Bureau (SSB), the value-added returns from the agricultural  sector for the whole year amounted to 665 billion yuan, up 4  percent over the previous year.    Statistics released by the SSB here today showed that among  yields of major farm products, the output of grain and  oil-bearing crops recorded an all-time high. A notable increase  was also made in the production of vegetables and fruits.  However, the output of cotton and sugar crops declined.    The output of grain was 456.44 million tons in 1993, a 3.1  percent increase over the figure for 1992. The output of oil-  bearing seeds was 17.61 million tons, up 7.3 percent compared  with 1992.    According to Zhang, new progress was made in forestry. The  new afforested area in 1993 was 5.89 million hectares, with  improved quality. The state key forestry projects made  noticeable headway, and measures against forest fires and forest  diseases were reinforced. Both the forest area and forest stock  increased, resulting in a continued rise in the forest coverage  rate.    Animal husbandry developed steadily, and the production of  meat, poultry, eggs and milk and the number of livestock  continued to grow, Zhang said. The output of meat was 37.8  million tons in 1993, up 10.2 percent compared with the figure  for 1992.    Further improvement was made in the conditions for  agricultural production, according to Zhang. By the end of  1993, the aggregate power of the country's farm machinery  reached 318 million kilowatts, a growth of 4.8 percent over the  figure at the end of the previous year.    Rural consumption of electricity in 1993 was 125.3 billion  kilowatt-hours, up 13.2 percent compared with that of 1992.  Meanwhile, irrigation and water conservancy facilities in rural  areas were further reinforced, with a newly added acreage of  924,670 hectares of farmland under effective irrigation systems.    However, Zhang said, the unauthorized use of cultivated land  for other purposes still prevails, thus posing a threat to the  stable growth of agricultural production.</p>

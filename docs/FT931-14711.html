			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CONFLICTING signals about a rate cut, as the equity account drew to a close, led to a volatile session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Good demand at the outset for the March contract on the FT-SE saw it squeezed up to 2,797 within the first hour of trading, as speculation of a cut in base rates was heard. But the rumours diminished as new figures showing a rise in the underlying rate of inflation were announced, sending March drifting lower. By 2.30pm it was at the day's low of 2,767 and looked set to fall further. However the firm opening on Wall Street and renewed speculation that there might just be a cut in rates after all, helped the contract regain momentum. March finished at 2,785, around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 14, with turnover reaching 8,311 lots. Strong activity in two stock options accounted for the day's high turnover of 47,202 contracts in the traded options. Some 19,412 lots were dealt in Asda, while Barclays traded 4,960 contracts.</p>

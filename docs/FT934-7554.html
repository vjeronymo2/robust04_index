			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Ministers step up Ulster efforts THE GOVERNMENT is poised to step up efforts to secure agreement on a form of devolved government for Northern Ireland by holding new talks with the province's leading politicians. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, plans to use a new round of bilateral meetings to pave the way for the government to table its promised outline of the most likely route for reaching a settlement. The aim of the new round will be to gauge how the province's four constitutional parties can be coaxed closer to consensus on the form that devolution will take and how relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin are to be managed. The eventual outline would form a large part of the proposals promised by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday. One possibility would be the revival of an assembly for Northern Ireland with the rights of the Roman Catholic minority protected by mechanisms such as weighted majority voting and a right of appeal to Westminster. It is unlikely that any assembly would have powers to draft legislation, at least initially. It is unclear whether such an outline could secure the backing of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. Whitehall officials know they only have one chance to devise an outline that the parties would be prepared to use as a basis for negotiation if the prospects of a settlement are not to be set back. Mr Ancram's initiative follows his completion of a series of exploratory meetings at which the four constitutional parties mapped out their positions. The move underlines the government's determination to press on with the talks process in spite of doubts over the participation of the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party. The DUP has said it will not return to the talks until Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, calls a halt to his meetings with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. But DUP officials indicated privately this week that they had not ruled out further meetings with the government if they focused on the party's Breaking The Logjam peace plan. Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein yesterday insisted he had spoken with UK government representatives in a series of meetings ending last summer. He said he hoped the dialogue - which the government has bluntly denied - would be renewed 'now that the ice has been broken'.</p>

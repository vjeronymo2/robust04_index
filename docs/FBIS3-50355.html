			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fadil Smajic] </F>   [Text] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived late this afternoon for a four-day  visit to Slovenia. Zhirinovskiy calls his visit a vacation, and  after a series of bombastic statements, he has chosen Portoroz  and Bled as the places for his vacation. The controversial  Russian politician arrived accompanied by six bodyguards,  although his headquarters consider that there will be no  excessive scandals during Zhirinovskiy's stay in Slovenia.  Zhirinovskiy will hold a news conference for domestic and  foreign journalists in Bled tomorrow.    Zhirinovskiy is otherwise in contact with the  National-Socialist Alliance of Slovenia, an extreme right party  from Velenje, at whose invitation he has actually arrived. Via  the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, he has told them that he would  not be able to attend this party's congress, which will be held  on 12 February. However, he will be represented by Alexey  Ivanovich (?Lepenkin), who is at the same time also an official  of the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana.    As the prelude to his visit in Slovenia, since it was  questionable whether he would get a Slovene entry visa,  Zhirinovskiy issued a message to the Slovene Government, the  Foreign Ministry, and the Slovene public. In this message he  says that he considers Slovenia to be a highly developed and  highly cultured central European country that, following the  disintegration of Yugoslavia, broke off with its Balkan past,  even though it now influences considerably the outcome of the  crisis in the Balkans. Zhirinovskiy, among other things, further  says, I quote: Myself and the party are interested in dialogue  with the official representatives of your country regarding an  as quick as possible end to the bloodshed in Bosnia and the  recognition of the new reality on the Yugoslav territory. End  quote.    In his message to the Slovenes, Zhirinovskiy favors the  recognition of the states that have emerged in the Balkans  within their internationally recognized borders and then adds a  sentence that certainly will not go unnoticed in Slovenia. The  message is: We favor that Russia becomes a guarantor of the  security, stability, and independence of Slovenia.</p>

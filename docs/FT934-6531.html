			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal continues record run Bank of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, has posted its fourth consecutive year of record earnings, thanks to a 7 per cent rise in interest income, and growth in fee-based services and securities trading. Kicking off the Canadian banks' annual earnings season yesterday, it said net income rose to CDollars 709m (USDollars 545m), or CDollars 2.59 a share, in the fiscal year to October 31, from CDollars 640m, or CDollars 2.38 a year earlier. Fourth-quarter earnings climbed to CDollars 201m, or 74 cents, from CDollars 160m, or 59 cents. Return on equity for the year was unchanged at 14.1 per cent, but rose in the fourth quarter to 15.4 per cent from 13.4 per cent. Revenues benefited from the receipt of CDollars 106m in overdue interest from Brazil during the year, including CDollars 30m in the fourth quarter. The bank also ascribed the rise in interest income to strong growth in residential mortgages and loans to smaller businesses. Year-end assets grew by 7.2 per cent to CDollars 116.9m. The fourth-quarter return on assets improved to 0.70 per cent from 0.59 per cent. Non-interest income advanced by 20 per cent in the fourth quarter, including a 53 per cent jump in earnings from investment and securities business. The bank said the quality of its assets was essentially stable. Bad-debt provisions totalled CDollars 675m last year, against CDollars 550m in 1992. The latter figure includes a CDollars 244m reverse of the general country risk provision. Non-performing loans amounted to 2.9 per cent of total loans and acceptances on October 31, down from 3.1 per cent a year earlier. The ratio of total capital to assets improved to 10.3 per cent (11.1 per cent based on US rules) from 8.9 per cent last year. This is well above guidelines set by the Bank for International Settlements. BMO this year unveiled plans to capitalise more aggressively on its presence in the US, through Harris Bankcorp, its Chicago-based subsidiary.</p>

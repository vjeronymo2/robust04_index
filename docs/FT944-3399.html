			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR/Hanson switch Diversified industrials BTR and Hanson comfortably headed the Footsie activity charts with volumes boosted by a certain amount of switching out of Hanson. Turnover in the two stocks totalled a combined 26m shares. BTR saw 15m shares change hands, including a 1m deal at 279 1/2 p. The shares closed marginally lower on the day at 278 1/2 p while Hanson shed 2 1/2 at 228p in 11m turnover. Dealers said BTR was subject to something of a two-way pull with the shares gaining from the Hanson switching but meeting with some equally determined sellers. BTR, which has underperformed the market by almost 10 per cent over the past three months, hosted City lunches last week in what was seen as an attempt to repair damage to information flows between the company and analysts.</p>

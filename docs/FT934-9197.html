			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tiger Oats increases net income by 7% A LOWER tax bill helped Tiger Oats, South Africa's largest food group, record a 7 per cent increase in attributable income to R357m (Dollars 106m) in the year to September, up from R335m last time. Low levels of consumer spending continued to place pressure on margins. Turnover grew by 9 per cent to R10bn, but operating income fell by 3 per cent to R659m. Earnings per share rose by 3 per cent to 237 cents and the dividend was increased to 82 cents (79 cents). The management is not expecting improvements in its markets in the year ahead, but expects to post better results on the basis of improved operating efficiencies. Mr Robbie Williams, executive chairman, forecast 'reasonable earnings' for 1994. Although still regarded as a blue chip stock, the share has fallen out of favour recently, falling to a current level of R41.50 from a high earlier this year of R50. Mr Williams said Tiger Foods had suffered from recession with both sales volumes and prices under pressure.</p>

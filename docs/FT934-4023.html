			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Holvis-Holzstoff warns of loss Holvis-Holzstoff, the Swiss non-wovens and paper distribution group, said it could record a net loss this year because severe price erosion in non-wovens markets was forcing it to make large revaluations of assets. The group, in which two British institutional investors hold large minority stakes, also revised its 1993 trading profit forecast down from SFr42m to about SFr35m (Dollars 23.4m). Last year, its trading profit was SFr47.3m. Pedro Reiser, Holvis chief executive, at a press conference in Zurich, said the board would decide when the 1993 results were in whether or not to pay a dividend. Holvis paid an unchanged SFr11 per share dividend on 1992 results. Mr Reiser said prices of non-wovens, which are used in nappies, tampons and a growing number of medical and surgical garments, had slumped about 20 per cent since 1990. This was due partly to suppliers expanding capacity in anticipation of rapid growth, partly to competitors in weak currency countries undercutting prices and partly to pressure from big customers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble. Mr Reiser expected prices to continue to weaken in 1994 as competition in the nappy market intensified. The group's cash flow would be negative both this year and next because of a high level of investment to secure its position in the medical and other high-margin segments of the non-wovens business. The group said in August it was reassessing the competitiveness of some of its production units in countries with strong currencies, but expected to meet any costs from existing reserves. It said yesterday this reassessment 'might lead to extraordinary write-offs'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The oval pigtoe was described from the Chattahoochee River,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near Columbus, Georgia. Historically, this species was one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most widely distributed mussels endemic to the Apalachicolan Region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It occurred throughout the mainstems and several tributaries of both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Flint (16 sites) and Chipola (10 sites) river systems, at 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites in the Chattahoochee River system including one mainstem site,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all associated with the Fall Line in Alabama and Georgia, at 6 sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Ochlockonee River mainstem above Talquin Reservoir in Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Georgia, at a single site on the lower Suwannee River and 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites in the upper Santa Fe River system, its major tributary, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> north Florida, and at a site in Econfina Creek, in northwest Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). Fifty-four total historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites are known. Existing populations have been verified from 21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites, including 5 scattered tributaries (7 sites) of the Flint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River system and a single mainstem site, 4 Chipola River sites and 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in its tributary Dry Creek, 6 upper Ochlockonee River mainstem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites, and single sites in both the New River in the upper Santa Fe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River system, and in Econfina Creek (Butler 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent surveys have documented the extirpation of the oval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigtoe from approximately two-thirds of its historical range, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no populations persisting in Alabama. Once a species of localized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundance (Clench and Turner 1956), oval pigtoe populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sometimes numbered in the hundreds (van der Schalie 1940). However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent collections of the oval pigtoe are generally small, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rarely exceed a dozen individuals at any one site. The Service in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its recent survey located only a single specimen from the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flint River mainstem. It is not known whether existing populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sufficient in numbers to sustain the species. The oval pigtoe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not tolerate impoundments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chipola slabshell (Elliptio chipolaensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is a medium- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sized species reaching a length of about 85 mm (3.3 in). The shell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is ovate to subelliptical, somewhat inflated and with the posterior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ridge starting out rounded but flattening to form a prominent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biangulate margin. The shell surface is smooth and chestnut in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color. Dark brown coloration may appear in the umbonal region and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remaining surface may exhibit alternating light and dark bands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The umbos are prominent, well above the hingeline. Internally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> umbonal cavity is rather deep. The lateral teeth are long, slender,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and slightly curved, with two in the left and one in the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve. The pseudocardinal teeth are compressed and crenulate, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two in the left and one in the right valve. Nacre color is salmon,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becoming more intense dorsally and somewhat iridescent posteriorly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service considers  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unio chipolaensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to be a synonym of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elliptio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chipolaensis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chipola slabshell was described from the Chipola River in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida. Clench and Turner (1956) restricted the type locality to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Chipola River, 1 mile north of Marianna, Jackson County,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida. Until recently, this species was considered endemic to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chipola River system, occurring in the mainstem above Dead Lake and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a few of the larger tributaries, all in Florida (van der Schalie  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1940, Clench and Turner 1956). A single record of this mussel from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a tributary of the Chattahoochee River in extreme southeastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alabama has been verified by Butler (1993). These localities bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total number of historic sites the Chipola slabshell inhabited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to nine. The Chipola slabshell is known to persist only at four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chipola River mainstem sites and in Dry Creek, with the populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Spring Creek (Chipola River system) and the Chattahoochee River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system apparently extirpated. The numbers of specimens from recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collections indicate that populations are generally small, except at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one site in the lower mainstem where three dozen specimens were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently observed (W. McCullagh, pers. comm.). The Chipola  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slabshell has the most restricted range of the Apalachicolan Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mussels. This species does not tolerate impoundments, but is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerant of silt than the other species of mussels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purple bankclimber ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elliptoideus sloatianus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is a large,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy shelled, strongly sculptured mussel reaching a length of about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 200 mm (8.0 in). A well developed posterior ridge extends from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> umbos to the posterior ventral margin of the shell. The posterior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slope and the disk just anterior to the posterior ridge are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sculptured by several irregular ridges that vary greatly in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. Umbos are low, extending just above the dorsal margin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the shell. Internally, there is one pseudocardinal tooth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right valve and two in the left valve. The lateral teeth are very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thick and slightly curved. Nacre color is whitish near the center  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the shell becoming deep purple towards the margin, and very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iridescent posteriorly. The Service recognizes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unio sloatianus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unio atromarginatus, Unio aratus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unio plectophorus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as synonyms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Elliptoideus sloatianus. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purple bankclimber was described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Chattahoochee River and its type locality is restricted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia (Clench and Turner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1956).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by ROSSIYSKIY VESTI editorial collegium: </F> "ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Is Back With You, Readers!"]    [Text] After an enforced one-month break, ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI is being published in a print run of 650,000. This means  that not only all its subscribers in Russia, but also readers in  114 world countries will receive the paper.    The suspension in publication of the paper was not the  editorial board's fault but the result of interruptions in  budget funding. Nevertheless, the journalistic collective  believes it is responsible to readers and apologizes to all for  the resultant loss of information. Naturally, the information  that you failed to receive during this period is irreplaceable,  but we will try to repay our debts by other means: The break  provided an opportunity to better consider and prepare a number  of innovations.    Now each week, on Thursdays, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will publish  a  16-page issue. This will make it possible to widen the range of  reports on the most important aspects of the federal  authorities' activities. The content of the newspaper's  official section will also be enriched -- in addition to legal  and administrative acts of the Russian Federation president and  government, we will begin to carry the main Federal Assembly  documents concerning the vital interests of the state, the  population, and entrepreneurs.    We feel a special debt to those who have been unable  recently  to take advantage of the advice provided by our RETSEPT  [Prescription] supplement. A consultative health center is  being set up under the editorial board and the best medical  forces are being recruited, and we hope that with their help we  can be useful to those who bring their questions to us. We will  tell you, Esteemed readers, about the work of this center and  about how to use its services at a later date.    Pages 2 and 3 carry features under the rubrics "In Russia,"  "In the World," "Subjectively Speaking," and "Official." This  has made it possible to give considerably broader coverage to  events in our country's regions and throughout the world and to  more fully present the spectrum of opinions on urgent problems  of society's life while at the same time, as it were, putting  the official position of state figures and institutions together  in a special section.    Our other, traditional supplements, sections, and pages  "Money," "Economics," VEKHI [Milestones], "Culture," "Leisure,"  "Sport," and so forth are also being updated.    With the help of professional lawyers and parliamentary  deputies the editorial office wants to organize consultations on  the most difficult and acute questions of protecting human  rights.    We hope that there will be no more interruptions in  publication. Stay with us!    [Signed] ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Editorial Collegium</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Shorts wins Pounds 65m order from US SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, has won a Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) order to supply 20 C-23 Sherpa military transport aircraft to the US National Guard. The contract includes an option for a further 10 aircraft worth about Dollars 44m. The three-year programme will involve converting FD360 commuter aircraft into C-23B Sherpa military aircraft. Their primary role will be transporting army aviation spares and components between National Guard bases. But it is envisaged that the aircraft will also be used for transporting passengers, the dropping of paratroops, freight-carrying and other air-dropping roles. Shorts, part of the Canadian transportation group, Bombardier, will be responsible for managing the programme. They will also undertake all engineering design, planning, procurement and the manufacture in Belfast of sheet metal and machined components. Conversion of the aircraft will be carried out at the West Virginia Air Center at Bridgeport, West Virginia. Mr Roy McNulty, Shorts president, said it was yet another strong endorsement of the Sherpa's capabilities from the National Guard. Shorts also welcomed the announcement of Lauda Air of Austria and Air Littoral of France for up to 14 Canadair jets for which they supply the fuselage and engine housings. If all the options are taken out, the work will be worth Pounds 15m.</p>

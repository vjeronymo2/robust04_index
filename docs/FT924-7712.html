			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee gets back into bullish mood THE WORLD coffee market's bullish sentiment was re-emphasised this week as the March arabica futures position in New York moved above the psychologically-important 70 cents-a-lb mark and London's robusta futures established fresh nine-month highs. These rises justified the view expressed by most traders that last week's fall, which took the January delivery price in London down Dollars 31 to Dollars 910 a tonne, was a 'technical correction' following the sustained upsurge that had lifted the January price by Dollars 120 since the beginning of October. The upward trend was resumed in New York on Monday, after FO Licht, the German statistics agency, predicted that world coffee production would fall by 8.67m bags (60 kg each) to 93.32m bags in the 1992-93 season. It was quickly followed up in London, fuelled by covering purchases by operators who had sold the market short last week. The prospect of a small Brazilian coffee crop has been the main factor driving the market higher; ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, recently forecast that the country's 1992-93 crop would total 19.15m bags - at the low end of recent predictions. And this gloomy view of the outlook for the world's biggest coffee supplier was supported this week by news that it exported only 1.36m bags in October, 810,000 less than in the same month last year. The market remained bullish yesterday morning, when London's January futures position reached Dollars 980 a tonne, but it slipped back to Dollars 959 a tonne up Dollars 49 on the week and Dollars 283 above the 20-year low reached in the summer. Traders thought further gains were possible, although modest producer selling was likely to appear as prices rose. One sounded a note of caution, however. 'Probably you've a little bit of resistance from these levels up to the Dollars 1,000 level,' he told the Reuter news agency, 'and the Dollars 1,000 on January is always going to be a psychological barrier'. London cocoa prices also touched fresh nine-month highs in mid-week, but the gains were quickly surrendered, with traders arguing that the market was in need of 'consolidation' following last week's sharp gains. The March cocoa futures position ended at Pounds 758 a tonne, up Pounds 6 on the week. The market impact of the two-week international cocoa agreement negotiations in Geneva, which finished yesterday, was negligible. Nothing conclusive was expected to emerge from the producer-consumer talks - and nothing did. There was progress in narrowing the gaps between the two sides on the price range to be defended by a new agreement and the amount of stocks to be withdrawn from the market, but they remained wide. These questions, together with the knotty problem of financing price support efforts, will be tackled again at the next negotiating session between February 22 and March 5 next year. That will be the last chance to agree a replacement pact before the present one, which operates no price-support arrangements, expires next September. At the London bullion market the gold price, battered in recent months by central bank selling and 'panic' hedging sales by producers, came under further pressure from Middle Eastern sales and slumped to a seven-year low of Dollars 329.30 a troy ounce at one point. But with analysts arguing that the market had become heavily oversold, trade and speculative buyers were quick to come to the rescue and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 336.45 an ounce, up Dollars 2.40 on the week. Platinum also rallied sharply after a heavy fall in the first half of the week, but the price was still Dollars 12.85 down on balance at yesterday's fixing level of Dollars 353.65 an ounce. The recovery from Wednesday's Dollars 347.25 an ounce was encouraged, dealers said, by a mildly bullish Interim Review from Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. JM forecast that the metal's price would average Dollars 370 an ounce in the final quarter of this year and Dollars 385 an ounce in the first quarter of 1993. Silver displayed a similar pattern to the other precious metals, ending 10 cents down on the week at 379.5 cents an ounce. Base metals prices see-sawed at the London Metal Exchange. Early losses were generally recovered in a mid-week rally but fresh falls yesterday left most prices lower. The biggest loser was nickel, which ended Dollars 170 down on the week in the three months position at a five-year low of Dollars 5,497.50 a tonne after another big rise in LME warehouse stocks was announced.  ------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +9,875   to   1,438,925 Copper     +1,950   to     321,100 Lead         -375   to     195,000 Nickel     +1,470   to      59,790 Zinc         -825   to     376,750 Tin        unchgd   at      14,345  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Navy yards to be sold in defence savings drive: All-party committee warns on danger of further cuts THE GOVERNMENT plans to sell the navy dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth to the private sector by 1996 as part of a drive for defence savings. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced yesterday that tenders for the two refitting yards, currently run by private companies under contract, would be invited early next year. He also confirmed that the government was abandoning plans for an air-launched nuclear missile for the Royal Air Force. However, in the midst of a growing row about expenditure cuts, officials made clear that neither measure would bring early savings to the defence budget. Mr Rifkind's announcements at the start of a two-day Commons defence debate coincided with a strong warning from the all-party defence committee about the impact of further cuts. A committee report said the armed forces' capabilities would be reduced to 'below the minimum necessary for the security of the UK'. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, its Tory chairman, said there was no room for more reductions. The warning came as Mr Rifkind remained locked in a cabinet battle to fend off Treasury demands for billions of pounds worth of spending cuts during the second half of the 1990s. Backed by warnings from senior Tory MPs about the dangers of further cuts, Mr Rifkind said that provision of sufficient resources was 'fundamental' to confidence in the armed forces. He told the Commons 'arbitrary' cuts in defence spending would undermine Britain's ability to meet its security commitments. Earlier a ministerial meeting chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, failed to bridge the gap between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence despite the mediation of Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. Mr Rifkind has demanded a full-scale review of all of Britain's military commitments as the price for any significant cuts in his Pounds 24bn budget. But Mr Major is concerned that such a review would provoke a storm of criticism from backbench MPs and Conservative supporters. Ministers said that the main battle focused on Mr Rifkind's budget for the 1996-97 financial year, which would provide the effective baseline for defence spending into the next century. The Treasury and MoD were said to be 'billions of pounds apart'. Cancellation of the missile plan had been expected due to a reduced need for nuclear weapons. Defence officials said a 'notional' provision of Pounds 1.8bn had been made for the missile and its warhead in future budget plans, but the anticipated expenditure was some years away. Instead of an air-launched weapon, Britain will use its Trident submarine missiles both as a strategic and as a more limited sub-strategic weapon. Officials said the Trident could be adapted to the sub-strategic role for 'almost nothing'. However, they said the government would maintain the Atomic Weapons Establishment's capacity to design and produce warheads. The move to outright privatisation of the dockyards follows the government's controversial decision in June to carry out all navy submarine refits at Devonport. It aims to transfer ownership of the two yards to separate bidders in order to maintain competition. But Mr Rifkind said yesterday the government was committed to a 'substantial programme' of allocated work for Rosyth. Defence cuts anger, Page 14</p>

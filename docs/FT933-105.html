			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster agrees Dollars 600m investment in Viacom VIACOM, the cable television company, yesterday gained a new ally and additional financial muscle in its battle to take over Paramount Communications when Blockbuster Entertainment agreed to invest Dollars 600m in Viacom. The deal will give Viacom greater flexibility to increase its agreed offer for Paramount, which is trailing a rival, hostile offer from QVC Network, the cable TV home shopping business headed by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure. Viacom, with interests ranging from cable systems to the MTV pop music TV channel, declined to comment yesterday on market speculation that it had been talking to two other companies - regional telephone company Southwestern Bell and cable systems group Cox Enterprises - in an effort to secure additional funding. Blockbuster is a fast-growing Florida-based company which is by far the largest home video retailer in the US and also runs two large chains of music stores. It owns the Cityvision video rental company in the UK. It has also been moving into film production, buying large interests in the Spelling Entertainment and Republic Entertainment film companies, which are in the process of merging. Its investment in Viacom - and thence, it hopes, in Paramount - reinforces this trend. Paramount owns one of the last large Hollywood studios not part of a conglomerate. Blockbuster is buying Dollars 600m of cumulative convertible preferred stock which is convertible into Viacom's class B, non-voting common stock at a price of Dollars 70 a share. If the Viacom-Paramount merger does not go through by next August, either Blockbuster or Viacom can reduce the investment to Dollars 300m. Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, who will join the Viacom board, said the new 'strategic relationship' between the two groups would allow both to capitalise on their highly complementary businesses. It was, he added, a strong vote of confidence in the Viacom/Paramount merger. Wall Street analysts view Blockbuster's move into production partly as defensive action to protect the company from a potential loss of video rental business when new technology allows consumers to call up movies on demand over inter-active home entertainment systems. Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, said the two companies would pursue potential ways to benefit from the new relationship after the merger with Paramount. Yesterday's deal had a modest impact on the shares of companies involved in the Paramount battle. On Wall Street, Viacom's A shares closed Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 59 1/2 while its B shares dropped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 valuing its bid at Dollars 7.7bn. QVC rose Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 59 5/8, valuing its bid at Dollars 9.8bn. Paramount closed Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 79 1/2 on growing hopes of an improved Viacom offer, while Blockbuster fell Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 29.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. TO LET JAPANESE BUILD THEIR OWN VERSION OF F-16  </P> <P> The Administration has decided to go ahead with plans to allow the Japanese to  build a version of the F-16 fighter plane, but President Bush has yet to make a  final decision on terms of the agreement, the chief White House spokesman said  today.  </P> <P> Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said "there are at least three or four basic  issues regarding the agreement that we would want to sign" with Japan that  still must be resolved.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, speaking with reporters on Air Force One as Bush flew here for a  speech, said a final presidential decision on the so-called FSX fighter may not  come until sometime next week.  </P> <P> He said Bush was "reviewing documents today and reading through position  papers" on the plane on his way to Houston.  </P> <P> Once the President decides on safeguards, "then we would be able to announce  that we are prepared to go ahead with an agreement," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "What he's deciding are the terms of the agreement that we would want to strike  for the co-production of the plane," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Supporters say the deal is the best the United States can arrange with Japan,  which opposes buying U.S. F-16s. Opponents say the technology transfer will  help Japan further develop a civilian aviation industry that will compete with  U.S. companies.  </P> <P> The conflicting views were aired at a National Security Council meeting  Wednesday evening called to help resolve differences within the Administration  over the controversial FSX warplane, which Japan wants to deploy in the late  1990s.  </P></p>

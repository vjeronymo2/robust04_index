			<p>U.S.   <F P=102>   PA2004175894 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 20 Apr 94 p 56 </F> <F P=103> PA2004175894 </F> <F P=104>  Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Although National Congress President Carlos Roberto  Flores has explained that any action involving the military  treaty signed with the United States in 1954 concerns the  president of the Republic, he stated on 19 April that it is  important for the treaty to be discussed, because it may no  longer reflect the current situation.    Flores revealed that so far he has only received unofficial  information regarding the intention of General Discua, commander  in chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Supreme Council of  the Armed Forces, to seek a rejection of the treaty.    Flores said, "The president is the one who has jurisdiction  and responsibility for negotiating international agreements and  treaties, and any action in this regard concerns him."    Flores explained that the matter is being discussed by the  executive branch and will not be taken up by the legislative  branch until the executive reaches a decision and informs  Congress officially. He also said the correct term in this case  is to reject [denunciar] the treaty -- an action that includes  discussing possible disagreements and conveying any criticisms  to the other nation.    Flores added: "The Armed Forces are part of the executive  branch, and any idea must be discussed with the constitutional  president and other branches such as the legislative branch."  Asked whether the treaty is truly obsolete, as argued by Gen.  Luis Alonso Discua, Flores replied that circumstances that  prevailed years ago no longer exist.    Flores noted: "In the past decade, Central America was  subject to different pressures, conflicts, and domestic  problems. Governments outside the realm of de jure states,  political disputes, and related situations no longer exist at  this time, because all of the governments have been elected by  popular vote."    He concluded: "The situation has changed radically."</p>

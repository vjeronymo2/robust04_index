			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian saw mill workers reject 6% offer Members of the IWA-Canada walked out at a big International Forest Products saw mill at Coquitlam, BC saying they were angered by the forest industry's offer of a 6 per cent pay increase over three years. The luggers and saw mill workers last week lodged a demand for 18 per cent over three years. IWA-Canada negotiators said this was a bargaining position and demanded a serious counter offer this week. Talks are now expected to restart on Thursday. The union is armed with a strike mandate and more mill walk-outs are possible this week.</p>

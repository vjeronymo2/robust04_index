			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, which  announced it would quit the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) on Monday, has yet to officially notify the agency of the  decision, IAEA officials said.    In addition, Pyongyang has not sent written notification to  the United States, the depository country for the IAEA  statitutes.    North Korea's withdrawal does not take effect according to  international law unless the country sends written notification  to the United States and then the IAEA Secretariat gives an  authoritative interpretation to effect this notification.    But since North Korea's nuclear safeguards agreement holds  unless it leaves the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), its  announced withdrawal from the IAEA carries symbolic meaning of  defying the IAEA sanctions resolution rather than any practical  significance.    The IAEA Board of Governors passed a sanctions resolution  against North Korea on Friday with overwhelming support. The  resolution provides for an immediate halt to IAEA technical  assistance totaling 500,000-600,000 dollars a year to Pyongyang.    The agency is studying North Korea's reason for announcing  its withdrawal and will monitor the stalinist state's follow-up  steps.    The North has apparently not restricted the activities of  the  IAEA inspection team currently in Yongbyon, but is likely to act  soon after announcing it can no longer guarantee the continuity  of nuclear safeguards, according to IAEA officials.</p>

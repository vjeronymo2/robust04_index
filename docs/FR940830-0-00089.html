For cost reasonableness, the IHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach (the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions and the IHA's own recent procurement experience. The IHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable cost determinations of each major work item (e.g., kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness as part of its review of the Annual Submission and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will review the IHA's documentation in support of its cost reasonableness;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of non-viability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where an IHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the identified improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development at a reasonable cost, the IHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The IHA shall specify in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development (e.g., demolition or disposition under 24 CFR part 905, subpart M).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Five-Year Action Plan_(i) General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Comprehensive Plan shall include a rolling Five-Year Action Plan to carry out the improvements and replacements (or a portion thereof) identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. In developing its Five-Year Action Plan, the IHA shall assume that the current year funding or formula amount will be available for each year of its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the IHA is using for planning purposes, plus the IHA's estimate of the funds that will be available from other sources, such as State, local and tribal governments. All activities specified in an IHA's Five-Year Action Plan are contingent upon the availability of funds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedure for maintaining current Five-Year Action Plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHA shall maintain a current Five-Year Action Plan by annually amending its Five-Year Action Plan, in conjunction with the Annual Submission; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aboard special plane en route to Tashkent, 4 June  (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam said on Saturday [4 June]  South Korea and the United States stand fully prepared against  any contingency over the North Korean nuclear question.    While meeting with reporters aboard his plane en route to  Tashkent following his official visit to Russia, President Kim  said the two countries have a full grasp of all North Korean  movements through an around-the clock surveillance system.    "A war should be forestalled by all means," Kim said. "But,  South Korea and the United States possess enough force of arms  to cope with any contingency."    The president said he fully discussed in a telephone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton a possible  sanction against North Korea and the issue of national security  for 35 minutes on Friday.    "Cooperation between our two countries is perfect. I  understand the telephone conversation between Presidents Clinton  and Boris Yeltsin, too, was satisfactory," he said.    Saying that all things seem going well with regard to the  issue of taking a sanction against North Korea, President Kim  said, "Our people may be relieved at conditions that may develop  over the nuclear issue."    He also said President Yeltsin promised not to supply any  weapons either offensive or defensive to North Korea.    "Given the fact that Russia had in the past been the main  supplier of weapons for North Korea, this pledge of Russia has a  very important bearing," President Kim said.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Stars judged by their on-field feats - The tournament's dominant personalities are beginning to emerge The name on America's lips this week is OJ Simpson, the former gridiron star accused of murdering his former wife and her male acquaintance. It is impossible to turn on the TV or open a newspaper without hearing or reading someone pontificating on this great national 'tragedy.' On the one hand, the vox pop generally speaks of its 'love' for OJ and its disbelief that he could have committed such a crime. On the other, the pundits pronounce - as, typically, did Anna Quindlen in a New York Times column headlined 'Remember Nicole Simpson' - that 'this is not the story of a fallen idol' but of a man who went beyond wife-beating, bad enough, to murder. Throw in some media angst about overkill and the cup of talk shows is filled to overflowing. The great blessing for the soccer stars gathered here for the World Cup is that all, except possibly Argentina's Diego Maradona, are closed books to Americans. Profiles delve into Jurgen Klinsmann's engaging wanderlust, which the German likes to exercise in this country, or Roberto Baggio's un-Italian Buddhism, but they are really only the coloured wallpaper behind the reality that, for 31 days and assuming they do nothing egregious, the players are going to be judged only by how they perform on the field. So, after nearly a week, the question logically arises: who are really stamping themselves on the cup, rather than the opposition's calves, who have egg on their faces, and on whom is the jury still out? The simplest criterion is goals. By that yardstick, the star so far is Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina. With a hat-trick against Greece, he looked fast and incisive, though no more so than his team-mate Claudio Caniggia, of the stringy hair, who failed to score. But both of them - and Maradona, who scored and had a half-way decent game - were up against the poorest team yet seen, whose coach afterwards complained that his players were more interested in being photographed with Maradona than actually competing with him. Four players have two goals - Klinsmann, Juan Andoni Goicoechia of Spain, and Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Raducioiu of Romania. All have benefitted from goalkeeping mistakes, with the Spaniard freely admitting that his goal against Germany was unintentional, a slightly mis-hit cross ending in the net courtesy of Bodo Illgner's leaden-footed miscalculation. But Raducioiu, who could easily have had two more against Switzerland but for fine goalkeeping, has looked a complete attacker. Klinsmann has been sharp in two games as well, capable of sprinting past defenders on either side. He also falls more dramatically than any other player yet observed, which is saying something since just about everybody here is capable of scoring 5.8 for artistic interpretation. Other strikers who have looked the part and found the net once include Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria and Francois Omam-Biyik of Cameroon, confirming all the good impressions he made four years ago in Italy. Both are big, strong and direct, but leavened with finesse. Brazil's Romario, who scored once and won a penalty, and Bebeto (conveniently No's 7 and 11 for Americans weaned on convenience stores) are small, quick and dangerous, with excellent rapport. Lothar Matthaus, the German sweeper and captain, has chosen so far to play his cards close to the chest, as have, mostly, his team. His speed is ample to vacuum up any defensive problems, but the lacerating long passes and rapid forward rushes in two games can pretty much be counted on the fingers of one hand. He is not yet playing as Franz Beckenbauer once did, but then he has not needed to. Rai, the more ponderous but still elegant Brazilian mid-fielder, and Hagi consider themselves mid-field artists who play far enough forward to create and score goals, which both have. Hagi, though, can disappear from games, as in the second half against Switzerland, while Carlos Valderrama, the Colombian engine room, is firing on even fewer cylinders than four years ago. The virtues of more conventional hard-running counter-attack from mid-field have been amply displayed by Andy Townsend and Ray Houghton for Ireland, John Harkes for the US, and, best of all, Alain Sutter of Switzerland. Wim Jonk and Ronald Koeman of Holland have different sorts of calling cards: hard-nosed defence mixed with thunderous shots from way beyond the dyke. Jonk's strike from a good 30 yards against Saudi Arabia ranks as the most spectacular (a la Sir Robert Charlton) goal of the tournament to date, but Koeman could match it if he sets his range-finder right. Goalkeepers have experienced mixed fortunes. There have been fine saves a-plenty, none greater than Michel Preud'homme of Belgium palming a close Moroccan header on to his crossbar, Erik Thorstvedt of Norway and Spurs at full stretch to deny an inter-continental Mexican missile, and Dmitri Kharin of Russia and Chelsea, beleaguered all day by a magical Brazil, incredibly flicking a short-range certainty over the top. But there have been horrors from the last line of defence, too. It is indecent in a family newspaper to identify offenders by name, but the 'keepers from Colombia, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Greece and Germany (all right, the German's name is Illgner, heretofore mentioned) have all cost their sides a point or two or three. (In fairness, some of them, like the Saudi Al Deayea, had done yeoman duty beforehand). But all their glories and mistakes still remain ephemeral, because all have played only one game or two. They can all improve or recover or flatter only to deceive (there's a cliche for the ages). It will take a much larger hand  -of God or a jury - and far more time for OJ Simpson to disappear from the national consciousness.</p>

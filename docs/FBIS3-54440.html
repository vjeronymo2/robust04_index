During this session, both the president and the Majles  speaker spoke about the views and stances of the cabinet and the  Majles on the most important political, economic, and social  problems.    The remarks by the heads of the executive and legislative  branches focused on efforts to ensure the public welfare by  compiling and executing laws, in accordance with the line of the  founder of the Islamic Republic and the esteemed leader.    These two points, which were jointly stressed by the  president and the Majles speaker, speak of the common objectives  of the executive and legislative branches in the Islamic  Republic. In view of these common objectives, which pave the  way for understanding between the Majles deputies and the  cabinet members, contacts between the members of the two  branches can help bring their views on the implementation of  plans closer. With these contacts, which allow the exchange of  expert views between the Majles deputies and the cabinet  members, and more careful help in listing priorities in the  compilation and implementation of programs, the approval and  implementation of laws are further accelerated.    Under the present conditions when discussions on the Second  Five-Year Plan are under way and when the cabinet and the Majles  have the approval of the 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994]  state budget in front of them, the joint session of the  executive and legislative branches is of significance. With the  exchange of views between the Majles and the cabinet, modes of  implementing the Second Plan as well as the 1373 budget bill  will be further clarified, and the two branches can--in view of  existing potential--compile a more applicable program that can  overcome existing problems and fulfill the objectives of public  welfare.</p>

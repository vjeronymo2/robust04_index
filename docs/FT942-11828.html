			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Murdoch shuffles team Three months after the Sun editor, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, moved to satellite television, Mr Rupert Murdoch has made further changes to his top team at News International. Eleven years after Mr Andrew Neil was offered the editorship of the Sunday Times, he too is moving to television - at least for the next seven months. At the same time the gradual disengagement of Mr Andrew Knight, once identified by Mr Murdoch as his successor in the event of accident, went one stage further. For Mr Neil there is a stint as executive editor and 'star reporter' of a new weekly current affairs programme on Mr Murdoch's Fox Television network in the US. As a new door opens for Mr Neil, there is, for Mr Knight, an end to full-time employment at the newspaper group that owns five of Britain's national newspapers. Last November Mr Knight gave up the executive chairmanship of News International and became chairman. Now the former chief executive of the Daily Telegraph is stepping down as chairman of both News International and Times Newspapers. He will be succeeded in those two posts by Mr Murdoch. Mr Knight, a successful editor of The Economist, will remain as a non-executive director of both companies and of their parent, News Corporation. Mr Murdoch has produced a 'no lose' offer to tempt Mr Neil, who has long made no secret of his desire to make some serious money away from his editor's chair. During the seven months that he is in New York, Mr Neil will remain editor of the Sunday Times - although he will not edit the newspaper. If the new show, which is designed to rival CBS' 60 Minutes, is a success, Mr Neil is likely to sign a multi-million dollar contract. During Mr Neil's absence, Mr John Witherow, currently managing editor (news) will be acting editor. Mr Ivan Fallon, the present deputy editor, gives up his executive role but 'will continue as a major columnist and writer'.</p>

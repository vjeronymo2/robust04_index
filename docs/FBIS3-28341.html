			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A failure to agree on  funding for tax cuts in talks between the seven ruling coalition  parties has made it difficult for the government's Tax  Commission to announce a tax reform plan for fiscal 1994 by  Wednesday, a senior Finance Ministry official said Monday [7  February].    "We are facing the final time limit," the tax bureau  official  said in a brief exchange with reporters after Monday's talks  failed. The comment came after the coalition party leaders left  the negotiation table without agreeing on the key issue of how  to finance the proposed tax cuts of 6 trillion yen.    Due to lingering political wrangling over the tax issue, the  release of the next year's tax reform outline has already been  postponed from Tuesday, as originally scheduled.    It is not technically impossible to announce the tax outline  on Wednesday, if a consensus is reached at resumed talks  Tuesday, the official said. But he added that it has become  "very difficult" to do so in view of the likely revisions in the  original tax proposal by the Tax Commission, the official said.    The commission, an advisory body to the prime minister,  recommended in a report presented to him last November linking a  tax cut with a tax hike to finance it in a single law.    A further delay in outlining the next year's tax reform  would  affect political and economic schedules that follow, including  the government's announcement of Japan's economic growth target  for fiscal 1994, formation of the Finance Ministry's draft  budget for the year and the Japan-U.S summit in Washington on  Friday, the official said.</p>

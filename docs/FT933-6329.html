			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Defined capability to confuse Sir, Rupert Morris's article on good business writing ('Clearly, concisely and with feeling', August 11) reminded me of an example of verbosity I experienced some 20 years ago. Answering a question on whether his branch could maintain a central registry of relationships (customers) for an American Banking Group, the manager started to say 'we can'. He managed to stop four-fifths of the way through this clear answer and said instead 'it is within the limitations of our defined capability'. Fortunately, I had got the gist of his reply from his first utterance. John MacKenzie, Venture Factors, Sussex House, Perrymount Road, Haywards Heath, West Sussex RH16 1DN</p>

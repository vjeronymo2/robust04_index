			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Private View: An ally's estimate of Britain's worth - Raymond Seitz, US ambassador to Britain, explains his view of the 'special relationship' WHEN HE was posted back to Britain as US ambassador in 1991, the first professional diplomat ever appointed to the job, Raymond Seitz made two resolutions. 'The first was that I would never use the phrase 'special relationship' and the second was that I would never quote Winston Churchill,' he said. Have you stuck to them? I asked. 'And I have stuck to both of them. I have no objection to 'the special relationship'. I just think it's a little shopworn. It's become a code in some respects to make people teary (tearful). But we're moving into a new phase in a very new world and it kind of obscures what I think are harder realities. It is the hard realities of life and of international affairs that make this relationship unusual, effective, productive, coincident . . . ' Does the expression signify less these days to ordinary citizens? 'Well, I don't know exactly what it refers to. Does it mean that every time we say 'frog' you jump or every time you say 'frog' we jump? Do people go to Andrew Lloyd-Webber plays in America? Yes. Do we go to see Howard's End, do we give Anthony Hopkins an Oscar? Yes, we do. Do we listen to the same rock and roll? Yeah. Is that the special relationship? Sure, you have Americans - and they don't have to be of British stock - who love to see the Changing of the Guard and who read Christopher Robin to their children.' He gestured towards the window of his big office in Grosvenor Square. Raymond Seitz was back in London after helping smooth the way for John Major's unexpectedly cheerful first encounter with the new US president. But the question at the back of my mind was whether Bill Clinton was merely being polite when he reassured an apprehensive British prime minister that the relationship was 'special to me personally and special to the United States and I think will be as long as I am sitting here.' Seitz agreed that the phrase is more a British than an American pre-occupation. He also observed the familiar, self-denigratory flavour of much British press comment in advance of the summit - 'as if almost hoping that somehow it wouldn't work.' This week, John Major rounded on what he called the gloomsters. If the special relationship exists, what can a demoralised Britain bring to it? I asked the ambassador what he thought of the present mood of doubt and drift. 'There is a black dog that wanders around Britain worrying about its future,' he said, 'about its sense of decline, of what it relates to. Is it to an empire, to the Continent, or across the Atlantic?' The present crisis of morale, he went on, could be explained by the insecurity of living in a post-Cold War world and by the persistence of the UK recession, 'a feeling that the dawn never quite comes, that the green shoots don't quite press high enough. I think you can even add what's happened to the Royal Family or the Church of England. And I think what happened in Liverpool (he was referring to the murder of two-year-old James Bulger) acted as a kind of flashpoint, somewhat in the way the coalpit closures did.' There had been much the same gloom in the air in 1979, when Seitz completed the first of three tours of duty in the London embassy. He came back in 1984, as second in command to Charles Price II, bringing two family dogs: Topsy, a Brooklyn pooch which he later described as 'smart as hell' and Scarlett, an English labrador, 'as thick as two planks.' He found that Margaret Thatcher had instilled new confidence and assertiveness in the country. 'One felt that Britain had a firmer grip on its destiny. It's that which seems to have loosened a little.' I suggested that John Major has made little or no impression on Americans. Seitz smoothly sidestepped the invitation to a faux pas and talked instead of Thatcher's impact. It was not the Falklands war which had impressed Americans, he said. 'What really crystallised it was not the grand sweep, the Cold War struggle. It was the clarity with which Mrs Thatcher said Yes to the raid on Libya. Her willingness to take tremendous domestic political flak really lifted the American image of Britain.' The ambassador manages to combine cool analysis with a winning lack of pomposity. He is the typical Yale preppy, you would say, a man of Republican tendencies and of no visible eccentricities - unless you count as eccentric the fact that he is twice married, smokes, and keeps a collection of old locks on his office window-sill. 'I've been told it's Freudian', he said, smiling. Seitz is so much admired ('the most capable American in Europe,' according to one diplomat) that a campaign developed on both sides of the Atlantic to keep him in London in spite of the change from a Republican to a Democrat Administration. When I asked Seitz this week whether he would be recalled he said he had not been told he was staying, but nor - and here he looked insouciant - that he would be going. Raymond GH Seitz was born in Hawaii at the end of 1940 where his father, later a major-general who took part in the Omaha Beach landing in Normandy, was then stationed. At Yale, he was president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, apparently known as 'the animal house'. His State Department career included Canada, Kenya and Zaire before London, with spells in Washington under Kissinger, Vance, Haigh and Baker. George Bush put him in charge of European and Canadian affairs: he was the leading US official for German unification talks and helped persuade Moscow to accept a united Germany in NATO. Today, he is occupied with Anglo-American policy towards Bosnia. I asked him whether Britain had anything any more to teach the US - a question to make a diplomat squirm. He hedged a bit, and replied: 'Well, I find this a very civil society. One of the things I find most appealing here is the little transactions of everyday life, whether it is buying the newspaper at the newsagents or taking a taxi-cab or bumping into somebody.' What could Britain contribute to the relationship? Seitz launched fluently into his exposition. The three broad bases, he said, were geography, language and common attitudes and values. 'From these deeper things comes a greater likelihood that the US and the UK are going to identify their interests internationally in a roughly similar way. 'If that's the case, what do you bring to the game? The independent nuclear deterrent is the most obvious example.' Formerly there existed what might be called a 'comfortable balance of terror'. Today the danger was nuclear proliferation. This, and the unpredictability of events in the former Soviet Union, could make Britain's bomb strategically as important as before. 'So I'm not prepared to draw the conclusion that Britain's nuclear role is anachronistic.' Another asset was the historic exchange of military intelligence and other information, now extending into law enforcement, drugs and terrorism. Third, there was Britain's seat on the Security Council of the UN (a status today being challenged). The UN's new-found authority as world peacekeeper could make Britain's role here more important. 'One final point - and I think this could be a critical one in the world ahead: there will always be a few issues or challenges where the US is prepared to act alone to protect what we regard as our vital national interest. However, I think there will also be a much bigger category of issues where the willingness of the international community or the US to act will depend very much on the degree to which other nations are prepared to act and take risks. 'And when you look around the world, you can count on the fingers of one hand - and that may be an overestimate - those nations which are prepared to act and which have a capability to act, and to act even beyond their own region of interest.' I turned to the question of Britain in Europe and Seitz confirmed that the US attaches the highest importance to Britain's active membership of the EC. But, I asked, do you get the sense that Britain is drifting somewhere in mid-Atlantic and doesn't know where to put the anchor down? 'My impression is Britain does not put as much ideological and emotional weight into the concept of a European union. That kind of rhetoric, those kinds of ideals and goals are very important on the Continent.' What about this British ambivalence? 'I watch the debate every day. If Britain is determined to isolate itself from Europe then the nature of our relationship is of course going to be different.' Are they compatible alliances? 'Oh, I don't think they're mutually exclusive at all. I know there's a zero-sum proposition: the analogue is America's preoccupation with the Pacific. While that zero-sum calculation is analytically attractive, I don't think that's how in fact it works.' He would not agree that the Conservative Euro-rebels were necessarily defending the old alliance: they might simply be Gaullist nationalists. What difference does it make to have Bill Clinton in the White House? 'On the basis of five weeks, it's a little early to make that judgment. But I have not seen anything that would make me revise what I have just said.' You mean the pragmatic underpinnings are strong enough to make the ideological or moral differences relatively unimportant? 'I don't think there is a great ideological gulf,' Seitz replied. But in political terms a big change has occurred. 'Yes, it's a big change but its happened before. I mean, you had Margaret Thatcher and Jimmy Carter. In the end it is the degree to which there is this coincidence of strategic interests, whether it's trade issues or Bosnia or Iraq or dealing with the former Soviet Union. My argument is that, uniquely, our interests are going to be far more likely to coincide than not.' Would Labour be less sentimental about the special relationship? 'It's not so partisan. I'm glad to see that the Labour party, perhaps because of the Clinton victory, in many respects is anxious to resume a dialogue with the US.' The relationship would fare much better without excuses or hype, the ambassador said. 'If one scrapes away some of the rhetoric we'll be able to deal with this relationship in a much healthier way. 'It's unusual to have to appear to defend the value of all of this. It's wrapped up a bit with your earlier question. There's almost a psychic wish here to say, 'Well, there's another thing that's gone] Well, we blew that one too] Well, we're no longer important or relevant.' It's this return of the hangdog.' Would he prefer to call it something boring like the 'reliable relationship'. 'No, I prefer to call it a strategic relationship.' But is there any other country with which the US has it? 'Not that I can think of. It's not all harmony, and it shouldn't be because interests will clash from time to time . . . But no, not that I can think of.' The Special Relationship, in other words, is not special, merely unique.</p>

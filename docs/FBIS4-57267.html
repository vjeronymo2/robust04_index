			<p>BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi  became the third Radical politician to throw his hat into the  presidential ring yesterday, just one day after Federal Capital  Senator Fernando de la Rua confirmed that he too would seek the  nation's top elected office.    Massaccesi said during an appearance on the lunchtime  television talk show "Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand" that his  goal was "to make a contribution to society and the party."    The governor also told Rio Negro leaders gathered in the  Federal Capital that he planned to open a round of talks with  party officials beginning on Wednesday in Catamarca and Jujuy.    Massaccesi followed closely in the footsteps of De la Rua,  who announced on Thursday night that he would seek to replace  President Carlos Menem in 1995.    "This is one of the (Radical Party's) most critical moments  in its long history of service to the country," the senator told  members of his Participation Movemement. "I am willing to assume  the responsibility of being a candidate."    Meanwhile, Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who has already  expressed interest in running next year as he did in 1989, said  he was sympathetic to the ruling Justicialist determination to  retain the Constituent Assembly's presidency and first  vice-presidency.    Angeloz said that the Justicialists would not want to leave  a  Radical delegate in charge of the assembly if the head of state  were to leave the country and his brother, Senate Provisional  President Eduardo Menem, had taken over the national presidency  as provisional Senate chief.</p>

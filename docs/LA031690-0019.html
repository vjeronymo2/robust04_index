			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE  </P> <P> Bones found scattered in thick brush at the end of Big Rock Road in Santee may  be those of a retired Navy man who disappeared in 1987.  </P> <P> Deputy Coroner Robert Grubb said the human bones were found last week and that  an initial examination by a forensic anthropologist has determined they  belonged to an elderly male. He said investigators believe they may be the  remains of Abe Pikelny, a retired Navy chief petty officer who went out for a  walk on Sept. 25, 1987, and never returned home. Pikelny lived in a mobile home  park on Mission Gorge Road with his sister about a mile from where the bones  were found.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLYMPIC CHAMPION EVANS GETS SULLIVAN AWARD  </P> <P> Six years ago, Janet Evans was churning through a preliminary heat during the  Mission Viejo Swim Meet of Champions when Mark Schubert, then coach of the  Mission Viejo Nadadores, turned to a reporter and said, "She's the tiniest  thing I've ever seen and she's got a funny-looking stroke, but keep your eye on  her."  </P> <P> Evans, then an 80-pound 12-year-old, looked like a wind-up bathtub toy with her  almost-straight arms paddle-wheeling through the water. But Schubert, now the  women's coach at the University of Texas, knew a prospect when he saw one. And,  indeed, the whole world has had its eye on Janet Evans ever since that windmill  stroke propelled her to three gold medals in the 1988 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Monday night at the Westin Hotel in Indianapolis before a black-tie crowd of  1,300, the Placentia teen-ager added yet another accolade to an already  bursting trophy case when she was awarded the James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy  as the outstanding amateur athlete of 1989.  </P> <P> It was third time she had been nominated for the award. Last year, Evans lost  out to Florence Griffith-Joyner despite setting a world record and an American  record during her triple-gold performance in Seoul, Korea.  </P> <P> Evans came back strong in 1989, however, breaking her own world record in the  800-meter freestyle, establishing American marks in the 1,000- and 1,650-yard  freestyle events and running her unbeaten streak to 27 consecutive races.  </P> <P> "I'm going to miss coming back here every year," she said, flashing the  infectious grin that earned the reputation as "America's Sweetheart" during the  1988 Summer Games. "Just being a finalist is quite an honor and this is an even  greater honor. I'm pleasantly surprised."  </P> <P> Evans, apparently just as at ease in a pink, off-the-shoulder taffeta gown as  she is in a lycra swimsuit, said the award helped reaffirm that she had made  the right choice by deciding to continue her swimming career at Stanford rather  than accept a number of lucrative endorsement deals.  </P> <P> "Everyone told me after the Olympics how hard it was to come back the next year  and do well," Evans said. "It was a difficult decision, whether to swim  collegiately or take the money. Now I'm really glad I decided to keep  swimming."  </P> <P> So is Richard Quick, coach of Stanford's defending NCAA champion women's team.  But he isn't exactly overjoyed that Evans, his star freshman, decided to come  here for the award presentation just three days before the NCAA championships  begin in Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> "Richard wrote up some workouts and I swam three times in the (Indiana  University) Natatorium," said Evans, who is no longer dwarfed by the  competition at 5-7, 116 pounds.  </P> <P> "I think this little break will help me. I'm swimming faster than ever in  training, so we'll see what happens."  </P> <P> Evans, 18, is the 10th female and the second-youngest athlete to win the  Sullivan Award. Swimmer Tracy Caulkins won in 1978 when she was 16.  </P></p>

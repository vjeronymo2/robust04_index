			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Janusz Zablocki: "On the Center Right Program: </F> Why `Center'"]    [Text] Five months have passed since last September's  parliamentary elections that resulted in the decisive victory of  the leftist forces. Has anything important happened within the  center-right bloc in the meantime? As we recall it, after  getting over their first shock in response to that disaster, the  center-right parties had declared that they would draw the  proper conclusions from that experience and begin to build a  common program and rally round it all their forces, so as to  defeat the Left in the next elections. What have they done about  it so far? What shape is being acquired by that common program  with which the united center-right intends to court the society?    On observing what has been happening in that domain in  recent  months, a characteristic shift in emphasis should be pointed  out. The formula of the center-right, adopted and propagated  before the elections, presupposed a kind of coalition of diverse  forces, both rightist and centrist, erected on the soil of joint  acceptance of democracy, the free market, and patriotic and  Christian values. Yet this precarious balance between the  rightists and centrists is being upset by their nascent  postelectoral programs. The rightist parties, certainly  exploiting that radicalization of attitudes so natural for  defeated political parties, are becoming more active than the  centrist ones, seizing the initiative, setting the tone, and  offering the most catchy programs. This impression is  strengthened by their language. Nowadays, they hardly ever speak  of the "center-right"; instead, they stress more and more "the  integration of the Right." Thus, in the public's eye, the  center-right is increasingly often reduced to its right wing and  viewed as the Right alone.    The rise of such an image of the center-right has been  greatly promoted by the entry of the Union for Real Politics  (UPR), formerly a a party that went it alone, in that coalition  after the elections. The "Constitution of the Right," drafted by  UPR, is a set of cohesive program planks influencing the  political thought of other parties. One example of such  influence may be the "Program Declaration of the Right," adopted  on 17 December 1993 by a coalition of four parties--namely, the  Party of Christian Democrats (PChD), the Conservative Party  (PK), the Christian Peasant Party (SLCh), and UPR, which was  published in LAD on 9 January 1994. Thus, the existing bloc of  parties championing the antileftist alternative has developed an  explicitly rightist orientation in the absence of an offsetting  centrist orientation so far (since the latter is not represented  by the program of the PC-PL-ZChN [Center Accord, Peasant Accord,  Christian-National Union], a coalition that still cannot decide  whether to adopt a rightist or a centrist orientation). This  tilting of the balance within the center-right in the rightist  direction, many portentous consequences, both for that bloc of  parties and for its future electoral chances.  <H5>  What Is Rightist and What Centrist </H5>   Since we employ the concepts of the right and the center, it  is high time to define them. The principal and extremely clear  criterion for their differences is, in my opinion, their  attitude toward the counsel offered by John Paul II to the  postcommunist societies in his "Centesimus Annus." Addressing  these societies, which after 1989 had regained the freedom to  choose their own road, the pope states, as known, that man's  present-day problems, in various countries and even more so for  the planet as a whole, can be solved neither by real socialism  nor by capitalism such as it exists in the modern world. Hence,  neither of these ready-made models is acceptable. While  distancing itself, in accordance with the entire tradition of  the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, from the  errors made by both sides, this encyclical encourages exploring  a socioeconomic model that, whether called capitalism or another  name--this really is not the issue--would most fully merit the  name of a system of society tailored to the measure of human  beings. It would combine the values of private ownership,  private enterprise, and the free market, with respect for the  common good and the dignity of working people, placing the state  and the economy in the service of the whole man and everyman.    The attitude toward this fundamental tenet of "Centesimus  Annus" may differ among the political groupings of the  postcommunist world. Those meriting the appellation "centrist"  are the ones that, in the spirit of the encyclical, distance  themselves from both the "real socialism" risen on the soil of  Marxism and "real capitalism" risen on the soil of liberalism  and lacking respect for the human dimension. The rightist  groupings, on the other hand, are those that, evading the  simultaneous condemnation of both these errors, confine  themselves to criticizing "real socialism" alone. They readily  support the pope's criticism of collectivism and communism, but  they gloss over and fail to draw conclusions from the criticism,  offered by the present as well as previous popes, of  individualism and liberalism, from the warnings against "...the  peril of the spread of a radical ideology of capitalism"  ("Centesimus Annus," 42), and against blind faith in the  solution of all problems through the free interplay of market  forces ("Centesimus Annus," 42)--that is, against the adoption  of "an `idolatrous' attitude toward the market, in disregard of  the fact that material boons are by their very nature mere  chattels" ("Centesimus Annus," 40).    Thus, in this sense, the parties who signed the "Program  Declaration of the Right" have to be viewed as rightist (and  that is how they define themselves anyhow). In the preamble to  that document, they declare, "Poland can no longer be a  laboratory for socialist experiments," but, at the same time,  they fail to add that it should not be a laboratory for liberal  experiments, either. This omission is not, of course, fortuitous.  <H3>  The Right and the Social Teachings of the Roman Catholic  Church </H3>   The issue of the attitude of rightist groupings toward the  basic tenets of "Centesimus Annus" reflects a general pattern:  The stance of rightist parties, even those that include the  adjective "Christian" in their appellations, toward the social  teachings of the church is ambivalent. Even when they refer to  these teachings in their programs, they always do so in a  selective manner, stressing those aspects of the teachings that  are convenient to them and glossing over the others. This  clearly undermines the credibility of their "Christian"  declarations because it is reminiscent of the churchgoer who  follows only those parts of the sermon that suit him.    But this applies to only a few of the rightist parties  because most do not even refer in their programs to the social  teachings of the church. At most, they mention among their  highest values, next to the free-market economy, the desire to  preserve the Christian heritage and the traditional moral  standards, as expressed, for example, on behalf of the  Conservative Party, by Aleksander Hall (RZECZPOSPOLITA, 17  November 1993). This also applies to the ideologists of UPR.  Similarly, the aforementioned "Program Declaration of the Right"  avoids, perhaps owing to the impossibility of reaching a  consensus on this matter, any explicit reference to the social  teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. At most, that coalition  "affirms the Christian nature of our civilization, whose  elemental aspect is tolerance," and the consideration, in public  life, "of the good of the family and the protection of human  life and moral order." This is, we must admit, much less than is  required of Christians by the social teachings of the church.  <H5>  Shortcomings of "Symbolic" and "Antiabortion" Christianity </H5>   Let us be fair. We bear in mind and appreciate the fact that  nearly all of the rightist deputies, including those belonging  to UPR and to the subsequently established Conservative Party,  did manage, at difficult moments facing the Sejm, to support the  inclusion of the provisions on Christian values in the [laws  passed concerning] radio and television, and they also  championed the teaching of religion in schools and prolife  values. They deserve to be praised for it. But Christian  humanism in public life cannot be confined to just a symbolic  championing of Christian values. A genuine Christian presence is  something more than displaying a cross in the Senate  deliberating room or including an appropriate provision in a  law. It is achieved chiefly through being present in men's  attitudes, through a Christian humanism that is inseparably  linked to sensitivity not just to symbols but to the fate of  living human beings. Catholicism, as declared by Cardinal Suhard  in his famous pastoral letter of 1947, is either social  Catholicism or no Catholicism at all. Similarly, the prolife  attitude, although highly important, does not exhaust in its  entirety that testimony that Christianity demands of those  professing it because Christianity commands caring not only for  the fate of the unborn but also for that of our neighbors who  may suffer and need our help. In the language of the modern  church, this refers to "the preferential option for the sake of  the poor." But the "poor," whom it is our duty to be aware of  and help, are those who are poor not only in the material sense;  they also include the homeless, the incapacitated, and people  deprived of human rights and of hope for a better future. They  include as well those threatened by unemployment, those who  already lost their jobs and cannot support their families,  school graduates who have no prospects for a decent life, and  ill-paid pensioners who cannot afford the rising rents and the  prices of medicines. They include all of the social groups that,  during the current transition era, are unable, through no fault  of their own, to make a living and need assistance from others.  Solidarity with their fate should be expressed not only through  private charity (as desired by 19th-century liberals) but also  as a behest of social justice (as demanded by social Catholics  [as published] in discussions with them). Hence, this requires  state interventionism and a deliberate social policy of the  state; this requires such institutional reforms as will assure  for all an adequate social safety net.    Reducing Christian humanism in public life to a struggle for  symbols or to antiabortion efforts without, at the same time,  showing sensitivity to the fate of the social strata and groups  expecting our assistance makes a travesty of that humanism. It  causes public opinion to form a distorted and false image of the  Roman Catholic Church, which the public views as standing behind  the rightist politicians, because the church is being accused of  focusing on the fate of the unborn and ignoring the fate of  those already living. We know that this accusation is painfully  unjust. But don't we Christian politicians somehow warrant it,  owing to shortcomings in our own Christian testimony?  <H5>  Attitude Toward the Social Rights of Citizens </H5>   Thus, one issue dividing the rightist and centrist groupings  is the attitude toward the social rights that should be vested  in citizens in the legislation and the Constitution. Unless it  is analyzed more thoroughly and leads to a reasonable  compromise, this issue may complicate the center-right consensus  in the debate on the [new] Constitution. The aforementioned  "Program Declaration of the Right" views freedom, ownership, and  respect for national traditions as the sole foundations of  social order and does not mention such fundamental aspects of  the Christian vision of social order as social justice or  solidarity.    It is significant that the declaration in question makes no  mention of such problems as unemployment; it is as if the  signatory parties are blind to it. The declaration limits state  interventionism solely to "what is indispensable to the  protection of life, freedom, or the property of others," and  makes no provision for any social policy to be pursued by the  state. (That is certainly due to the influence of UPR, mentioned  in SLOWO by its spokesman, Rafal Ziemkiewicz: "We are resolutely  opposed to the pursuit of any social policy whatsoever by the  state. UPR also demands the privatization of health care and  education, meaning their profitable operation." How is this to  be reconciled with the concern for "the good of the family"  mentioned further on in that declaration?)    The declaration supports the elimination of the progressive  tax system. While it champions [protection for] farmers, which  is an exception (and certainly the sole concession made to Mr.  Slisz's SLCh), the declaration does not support tariffs  protecting domestic manufacturing; instead, if supports "the  free flow of people, capital, and goods, free international  trade." Along with rejecting state interventionism, the  declaration is also opposed to trade union privileges. And, in  opposition to the postulates of Polish crafts guilds, it  champions the principle that business and professional  activities should not be restricted by the requirement of  compulsory membership in associations of businessmen and  professionals.  <H5>  Final Conclusions </H5>   The above evolution of the center-right bloc into  essentially  a rightist bloc is pregnant in grave consequences to it. There  is the threat of the narrowing of its political stance and  social base of support. There is also the threat that its  program is diverging from the road outlined by the latest  [papal] social encyclical, which is bound to result in losing  the support of a substantial segment of the Catholic electorate.  Guiding itself by the social teachings of the church, that  electorate sees no reason that it should support parties that  treat these teachings selectively. The rightward shift of the  programs of the existing center-right bloc also harbors the  threat that broad public opinion will view it as a force  oriented toward one-sided support of the interests of employers  and propertied strata. This is bound to result in losing the  support of the other segments of the bloc's electorate, such as  employees facing the threat of losing their jobs, welfare  recipients, trade union sympathizers, and those championing  state interventionism.    Thus, instead of turning away from the needs and demands of  these segments of the society, as is being done in the Right's  program, these problems should be faced and their constructive  and effective solutions explored. Only this approach reflects  genuine Christian testimony in public life. Only this approach  will enable the center-right to establish ties to broad segments  of the world of work and groups seeking social protection, and  thus prevent their exploitation by the Left in future elections.  In Poland, where nearly 3 million people are unemployed, where  1.5 million lack housing of their own, and where 40 percent of  families live below the social minimum, these segments of the  electorate are very large and decisive, as demonstrated by the  elections of 1993.    Thus, if the center-right camp is indeed to deprive the Left  of votes and defeat it in the next elections, it will have to  get rid of its "rightist" program. It needs the living presence  and proactivism of a sociopolitical "center," formed chiefly by  Catholic-social and trade union forces deriving from Solidarity.  By analogy with the "Constitution of the Right," a "Constitution  of the Center" should be drafted and presented to broad public  opinion. At present, this is an unusually important and urgent  task because only the coexistence of both these currents,  differing in their sociopolitical postulates but inspired by the  same Christian and patriotic orientation and the desire for  mutual compromise, can lay the foundations of electoral victory  and turn Poland away from its present crooked road.</p>

Government radio reported that the committee of deputies was  set up following a meeting of representatives from the main  opposition party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and  Integral Development [MCDDI] of Bernard Kolelas, and President  Pascal Lissouba's party, and the Pan-African Union for Social  Democracy, UPADES.    The MCDDI activists are mostly from the Pool Region, around  the capital, while those from UPADES are from the regions of  Niari, Bouenza, and Lekoumou. The committee, which is headed by  Simon Diassakoula, an MCDDI deputy, is charged with initiating  peace efforts in the four regions and the capital, where their  citizens are fighting in the southern district.    Those regions were affected by acts of violence, mainly in  June and July 1994 during the first round of the early  legislative elections, which were challenged by the opposition.  At least 30 people were reportedly killed during those events.  In Brazzaville, about 115 deaths were reported in the fighting,  which took place from mid-December 1993 to early January between  the militias of the opposition and presidential camp.</p>

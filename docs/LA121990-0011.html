			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPARATIONS FOR BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> The federal government will not have undone the racism that was embedded in the  Constitution until it formally makes restitution for the slavery that it  legitimized and protected for 87 years. The social inequities of that system  will continue to debase and cripple our country until we can own up to the  horrors for which we as a society were responsible.  </P> <P> Our health as a nation -- and quite possibly our survival -- depends on our  ability to do justly before God and toward the victims of our past crimes.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H. DUBAY  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arben Karapici] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] The armed attack by the Greek military  unit on the Albanian barracks in Peshkepi village have not only  caused deep outrage in the country but also strong reactions  from international organizations, high-level European officials,  and the governments they represent. On the basis of these  reactions, correspondent Arben Karapici prepared the following  report:    [Karapici] The unprecedented act of official terrorism that  Greece was finally able to exert against the national  sovereignty of our country and the victims caused by the  Hellenistic adventure of Sunday [10 April] do not seem to pass  so easy in the international arena.    In a UN Security Council meeting on 12 April, President  Colin  Keating briefed the permanent council members on the letter from  Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi. Reports from the UN Security  Council Presidency state that none of the members had any  objections, which has encouraged the observers to think that the  Albanian protest will be the object of serious analysis. The  meeting decided to follow the normal procedure, according to  which the president gathers information from all sides, reports  it to the council, and the latter decides on the president's  report.    The representatives of the European Union troika, Germany  and  Belgium, energetically condemned the armed attack by the Greek  military unit by fully supporting the protests by the Albanian  Government and state to the international security  organizations. The representatives of Germany and Belgium  particularly warned of the danger that the event on the  Albanian-Greek border presents, which, according to them,  infringes not only upon Albania's stability but also that of the  Balkans.    That is why Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock reacted  toward the Hellenistic adventure with serious consequences for  Albania and the Albanians. Mock harshly condemned the terrorist  act by the Greek unit. The chief of Austrian diplomacy  expressed Vienna's readiness to seriously consider the Greek  armed attack.    On the other hand, the British Government pronounced that it  strongly condemns all terrorist acts of this kind and other  similar actions that, according to London, lead to the  destabilization of the situation in the Balkans. The Major  government commits itself to support all efforts by the Albanian  Government's to continue to preserve stability and security in  the Balkans. The British Government considers Albania's stance  toward the Greek act of terror to be fair.    Meanwhile, the harsh protests of the Albanian Government and  state were the subject of special consideration in the U.S.  National Security Council and the Department of State in  Washington. They informed our ambassador that the U.S.  Government denounces this act, while Washington suggests  dialogue between both sides so that the situation does not  escalate any further.    Meanwhile, representatives of the French Foreign Ministry  expressed their deep regret over Sunday's event and the victims.  Paris considered as fully legitimate the Albanian Government's  demand to the Greek Government that Athens find those  responsible for the terrorist attack as soon as possible and  convict them. The French Foreign Ministry considers the finding  and conviction of the culprits as an important condition in  normalizing Greek-Albanian relations.    Finally, it should be said that the official reactions of  the  chancelleries in Europe against the armed attack have been  accompanied by comments and articles in the most powerful  European newspapers. You will be acquainted with these comments  in our future broadcasts.</p>

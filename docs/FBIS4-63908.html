			<p>BFN     [Text] Six State Duma deputies gave official notice  Wednesday that they were leaving the Liberal Democratic Union of  December 12. This decision was taken by five former members of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party -- Viktor  Kobelev, Aleksandr Pronin, Vladimir Novikov, Vladimir Borzyuk  and Tatyana Bulgakova as well as Deputy Andrey Volkov.    Aleksandr Pronin told INTERFAX they had decided to leave  because of disagreements with the line taken by the Union's  leader Boris Fedorov and also the desire not to be in the same  group as Andrey Makarov.    Another serious reason for the exit of the six was the fact  that the leadership of the "Decembrists" had kept secret from  ordinary members the fact that the leadership had met recently  with President Boris Yeltsin and were therefore representing  no-one but themselves.    "If Zhirinovskiy is openly practicing deceit, then the  leaders of the Decembrists are doing it behind people's backs,"  said Pronin.    He said that the six deputies would not join any other  factions but rather form an autonomous deputy group.</p>

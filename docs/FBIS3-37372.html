"The (Communist) Party hated Mikhail Gorbachev the way he  hated it", Oleg Shenin, former secretary of the CPSU Central  Committee, told the trial which probes the coup on Tuesday.    "The tragedy of the Soviet Union was that head of state  Mikhail Gorbachev lost the reigns of control over the country",  he added.    This was the subjective reason for the collapse of the  Soviet  Union, according to him.    "There were no major objective reasons for the collapse of  the USSR -- there were only subjective reasons", Shenin said and  added that the coup was organised in order "to save the union  state".    He added that he had for long advocated extraordinary  measures to improve the deteriorating economic situation in the  former USSR.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sales at Fiat unit improve 13% Net sales at Magneti Marelli, the Italian automotive components group which is controlled by Fiat, rose 13 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period of 1993. Mr Luigi Francione, Magneti Marelli's chairman, told shareholders at their annual meeting yesterday that turnover had increased to L1,473bn (Dollars 910m) between January and the end of May, in spite of the gloomy outlook for European car production. In 1993, net revenues rose only 1.9 per cent to L2,935bn, and the group returned a net consolidated loss of L157.4bn after financial and restructuring charges. However, Magneti Marelli said that it had experienced 'notable increases' in sales of fuel systems, engine control and temperature control units this year. 'The growth in sales volume and the implementation of rationalisation, foreseen and undertaken in 1993, has allowed (the company) to realise a positive operating result and to break even before taxes,' the group said. Yesterday's meeting granted the Magneti Marelli board a five-year authority to increase capital by a maximum nominal value of L1,000bn and to issue bonds for the same amount. About 42 per cent of Magneti Marelli is owned directly by Fiat, and a further 21.5 per cent by other group companies. In terms of sales it is the fourth largest company in the Fiat stable.</p>

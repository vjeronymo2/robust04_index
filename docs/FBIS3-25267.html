			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister George Bartlett  says the accusation by ANC [African National Congress] President  Nelson Mandela that the state transferred its mineral rights to  mining companies was devoid of all truth.    Mr. Bartlett explained that mineral rights in the country  had  always belonged to the state or the private sector, and that  recent legislation had brought no change in terms of ownership.  He said that with the implementation of the Minerals Act of  1991 the state's provisos concerning certain mineral rights had  lapsed in order to give recognition to the lawful owners of the  mineral rights involved in terms of common law. He stressed  that there had not been any change of ownership.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television Unless you are already immersed in the mini-series A Woman Named Jackie about Jackie Kennedy/Onassis (8.00 with more at 10.40, ITV) this is not a night for fiction lovers. Bags of fact programmes, though. Out Of Darkness is the first in a series which promises a 'critical' look at the efforts being made to re-shape African societies, opening with Angola (7.50 BBC2). The Velvet Claw is another new series (8.30 BBC1), this one using animation and computer graphics to illustrate the sort of carnivores which dominated the earth once the dinosaurs disappeared. This week's programme in C4's Travellers' Tales shows comedian Jimmy Tingle driving from Canada to Mexico in a Ford convertible (9.00). Panorama (9.30 BBC1) considers the decline of British racing, asking whether the crisis stems from lack of business sense or the unwillingness of bookies to pay their share. This will need to be good to match BBC2's recent excellent series on the same subject. Barry Norman returns with Film 92 (10.10 BBC1) and BBC2's arts magazine The Late Show comes back (11.15) with a profile of novelist Jeanette Winterson.</p>

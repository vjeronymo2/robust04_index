			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dragan Cicic: "The Road of Petroleum: Showdown </F> in No-Man's Land"]    [Text] Why the price of gasoline in Belgrade jumps  whenever some Bulgarian mafioso in Sofia kills a Bulgarian  policeman.    Armed conflict on the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, which both  sides tried to hush up, occurred on Tuesday, 21 December.  Fortunately, the fighting was not between the armed forces of  the two states. The targets of the attack by Bulgarian special  police were criminals from Sofia who were in the "no-man's land"  between the Gradina border crossing on our side and the Kalotina  border crossing on the Bulgarian side.    The criminals had retreated into our territory, but the  special police followed them and in so doing crossed onto our  side of the border. However, since this obviously involved a  chase, the only visible consequence was the posting of Yugoslav  special police along the border. Or to be more precise, the only  consequence as far as Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations are concerned.    The second consequence will affect a significantly larger  number of people. The battle on the no-man's land was at the  same time a battle at the biggest gasoline market supplying the  citizens of Serbia under the weight of sanctions.  <H5>  Market </H5>   Days after the showdown, there are dozens of canisters  scattered about the land between the two border crossings, while  the asphalt is so oily and slick from the spilled gasoline that  a great deal of caution is called for in walking across it. A  market has existed at that site for the last two or three  months. Seeing that the citizens of Serbia often have problems  taking out large quantities of fuel, the resourceful Bulgarians  began to cross their part of the border and sell gasoline on the  no-man's land. People from Serbia would cross only the Yugoslav  border, buy gasoline, and return home without contact with  Bulgarian customs officials. It is true that the Bulgarians were  selling the fuel at twice the price--1.5 to 1.6 German marks  [DM] per liter--of the fuel at the pump only several kilometers  away (between DM0.8 and DM0.9 per liter). To the Serbs, even  this increased price was preferable to the endless waiting at  crowded pumps and to the problems, often based on "material"  considerations, with Bulgarian customs officials concerning  "export" permits.    Everyone was satisfied, and an increasing number of cars  registered with our eastern neighbor were trying to quench the  thirst on this side of the border. Sales were made primarily  from tank to tank until some strong men realized that big money  was changing hands between Gradina and Kalotina. The ordinary  citizens had to go, and complete control over the "market" was  assumed by people whom the local population calls the "mafia."  They arrived in convoys of 10, 20, and even 30 vans full of  gasoline, unloaded canisters, and started pouring. The din of  voices and throng of commerce flowed among hundreds of barrels  and siphon tubes for nearly 24 hours a day. All of this took  place a few dozen meters away from the Yugoslav and Bulgarian  customs authorities. "It's not like they did not benefit from it  as well," says one of the old gasoline barons from Nis.  <H5>  Kolo </H5>   The idyll was suddenly disrupted by the aforementioned  showdown. One of the bosses of the petroleum business killed two  policemen in Sofia during an attempt to arrest someone else. The  Bulgarians received information indicating that the person in  question could be found at the border market, and on Tuesday  before last, between 1930 and 2000, special forces conducted a  raid in which several persons were injured. The mafiosi  retreated into FRY territory, the special police rushed in after  them, and our police apprehended several of the fugitives,  together with one Bulgarian colleague. The latter was released,  the criminals were turned over to the Bulgarian authorities, and  the market was shut down.    However, that is not the end of the road for gasoline. Nor  is  it the beginning. Ever since it became almost impossible to  import petroleum in tanker trucks, it has been brought in from  Bulgaria on organized bus tours. Logically, the "safest" ones  have also been the most expensive ones. For DM200 per person,  the organizers guaranteed that passengers would return to Serbia  with 200 liters of gasoline each in canisters. Naturally, the  largest part of the money went to "unofficial duty," which ended  up in the hands of Bulgarian customs agents. Still, there was  always risk involved. Inspection teams occasionally managed to  replace bribable officials, and to change the shifts of those  simply under suspicion. In that case, a bus would park in front  of the crossing while the unfortunate passengers waited for  eight or even 16 hours, over night, until "their man" arrived.  Fatigue, torment, and the fear of loss pushed nerves to the  limit, after which incidents were not out of the question. One  of our passengers poured gasoline through a window onto an  industrious Bulgarian customs agent who would not let the tour  pass and tried to set him on fire.    Once they finally managed to cross the Bulgarian part of the  border, the people got 200 liters of gasoline for which they  paid around DM0.9 per liter in Bulgaria, plus DM1 per liter as  the transaction cost. Just on our side of the border, they met  up with the local financial police, who collected a fee of DM0.6  per liter. Thus, upon entering Serbia the gasoline already cost  DM2.5. Nevertheless, the passengers were content, and despite  all the difficulties they could rest easy. "When we passed Nis,  the kolo dancing would begin," one of them says. Music from  cassette players accompanied dancing around the tightly packed  bags and canisters, while cigarettes burned in the darkness of  the bus, the scent of their smoke mixing with the smell of the  gasoline fumes. These traveling lakes of gasoline often  comprised a whole metric ton.  <H5>  "Mixing" </H5>   Besides the buses originating in Belgrade, the residents of  towns close to the border have also been doing business through  private deals, primarily with their own vehicles. This means  that gasoline for them is significantly cheaper, so that the  resale price in southern Serbia has been around DM2 to DM2.2.  Given the various additional methods for improving profits, this  has paid off. Clearly the best-known method is "mixing" the fuel  with water. But there are others as well. At one of the "sales  points" (cans with tubing and funnels set up beside the  highway), a man sells 12 liters of gasoline, pouring it from a  canister with a clearly imprinted label reading "10 liters."    The stricter controls since last week's incident have  drastically reduced the quantity of fuel that these "private  businessmen" are able to move, to say nothing of the buses.  Besides the mounds of abandoned plastic at the former market, a  similar pile is building up at the Bulgarian crossing. Upon  entry into Bulgaria, local customs agents now confiscate not  only empty canisters, but also practically any container into  which fluid can be poured, including plastic  one-and-a-half-liter cola bottles. Periodically, forklifts  arrive to carry all this off somewhere. Those who attempt to  pass without having the trunk of their car checked are pulled  from their car in the middle of the crowd by a large customs  agent with a pistol in his shoulder holster, yelled at, and then  thrown like a sack of flour back behind the steering wheel and  told to get back in line.    The procedure seems unnecessarily harsh, and the search for  empty containers seems excessively stringent unless the same  crossing is made in the evening in the opposite direction,  toward Yugoslavia. The crowd no longer even knows how many  parallel lines there are, people walk around in all directions  as if taking their evening stroll, so that the customs agents  have no choice but to wander among the jammed vehicles and ask  individuals whether they are carrying gasoline, and possibly  conduct a superficial check of every 10th car. But the reason  that even the smallest containers are confiscated upon entry  becomes clear only when one sees the pump in Slivnitsa, a town  15 km from the border, which the Serbian army at one time  attempted unsuccessfully to occupy.  <H5>  War </H5>   Plastic containers for cooking oil or antifreeze, the volume  of which is never more than a liter, are removed from various  hiding places in the cars. A tall fellow with an earring pours  into a cola bottle that is so battered and twisted that it is a  wonder that it does not leak. Once it is filled, he wraps it up  among part of the engine and hides other containers in the gaps  as well. Additional liters of gasoline are placed in the rear,  in a gas tank that is no longer used for its intended purpose.  While he gets into his old car, which could now be almost as  dangerous as the vehicle of a Hezbollah kamikaze driver, he  shrugs: "So what, I'm 23 and have no other prospects."    Smuggled gasoline is often camouflaged by other goods, the  "export" of which is perhaps viewed more favorably. The rear end  of the car is almost dragging the asphalt under the weight of  rice, salt, toilet paper, meat, oranges, and whatever else in  the trunk. "You have war in your country, nothing else," says a  young Gypsy Zoja with concern and understanding at an improvised  booth in Slivnitsa.    However, the small quantities of fuel hidden under piles of  third-rate goods or in engines do not meet the demand by a long  shot, which raises the prices when controls are tightened. Thus,  we are learning here to what extent the market is a sensitive  mechanism. A Bulgarian mafioso kills two policemen in Sofia, and  the price of gasoline rises in Belgrade.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Quek unit buys OTB from HK government GUOCO Group, the Hong Kong-based company controlled by the Malaysian Quek family, has completed the HKDollars 4.46bn (USDollars 577m) acquisition of the Overseas Trust Bank (OTB) from the Hong Kong government. The deal was announced in July, but the price agreed to was a HKDollars 420m premium to a subsequent asset valuation of the bank. The OTB will be linked with Guoco's wholly owned subsidiary, Dao Heng Bank, to form Hong Kong's fourth-largest banking group. Guoco announced that it would complete the flotation of the enlarged Dao Heng Bank before the end of the year. Guoco's purchase of OTB was partly funded by a HK2.8bn issue of preference shares, which will be convertible into Dao Heng shares once it obtains a separate listing. Following the Dao Heng flotation, Guoco will become an investment holding company with interests which will include a majority stake in Singapore-based First Capital Corporation, and several property developments. The sale of the OTB completes the government's successful turnround of several banks which collapsed during the mid-1980s. At the price paid for OTB, the government will recuperate the costs of its 1985 rescue of the banking group.</p>

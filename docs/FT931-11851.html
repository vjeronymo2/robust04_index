			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Mozart &amp; Walton - Concerts in London For its regular London visits the Chamber Orchestra of Europe is careful to ring the changes with conductors. Inevitably the founder of the orchestra, Claudio Abbado, appears less regularly nowadays, and the range of guests continues to widen. But the COE's concerts with Nikolaus Harnoncourt have retained a special cachet, an unfailing sense of anticipation. Harnoncourt manages to bring to every performance an element of invention and discovery. His approach may be founded upon the most impeccable of stylistic considerations, but working with an orchestra of such refinement and intelligence he sets aside period-instrument point-making and concentrates upon making invigorating music. On Friday he conducted the COE in Mozart, coupling the Haffner Serenade K250 with the D Major Haffner Symphony K385. All were joyously inventive, full of rhythmic life and airy, sparkling textures. The symphony carries its own charge, but it was an enormous achievement of both conductor and the orchestra to give the Serenade a similar vitality. Prefaced by the March K249, as at the premiere in 1776, the performance lasted an hour but Harnoncourt found fascinating detail and allusion in every movement, setting its public display of extrovert good humour against the flashes of darker, deeper feelings. In the three-movement violin concerto that lies at the heart of the serenade the soloist was the leader of the COE, Marieke Blankestijn. In keeping with the corporate solidarity of the orchestra her playing was not at all spotlit or assertive but carefully dovetailed into its surroundings, which is not to deny the musicality or the technical assurance with which she invested every line. * A violin concerto of very different temper was the centrepiece of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's Walton programme on Saturday, conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy. It was Joshua Bell's first attempt at the work, and an enviably convincing one. Bell brought to the solo part a wonderful easy lyricism without the self-regarding brilliance of, say, the famous Heifetz recording or the sweet-toothed sentimentality that has characterised more indulgent performances. Bell's tone is relatively lean, never overblown, and beautifully inflected. He made the opening movement intimate without becoming maudlin, and dispatched the virtuosity of the remainder with relaxed ease. There is a naturalness about his playing that belies his scrupulous preparation and sets him apart from most of his contemporaries; by any standard this was a remarkably convincing performance. Ashkenazy was always at pains to buoy up the violin line with careful instrumental support, but there was no further evidence that he conducts Walton with instinctive flair and understanding. Both the Scapino overture and the First Symphony had great technical brilliance; the brass especially was on excellent form. But any spark of humour was lacking from the overture, while the symphony had a machine-like inevitability. COE, Barbican Hall; RPO, Royal Festival Hall</p>

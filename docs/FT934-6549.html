			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Readicut advance 12% to Pounds 6.73m A continuing cost reduction and investment programme helped Readicut International lift interim profits by 12 per cent in spite of difficult markets. The household textile, carpeting and yarn company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.73m for the half year to September 30, compared with a previous Pounds 6.01m. The latest figure included a currency benefit of Pounds 212,000. Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, described market conditions during the half year as 'far from ideal'. In the US recovery was proving sluggish, continental Europe was still in recession, and there were only irregular signs of recovery in the UK. Profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 6.84m to Pounds 7.39m. Last time's pre-tax figure included Pounds 517,000 from discontinued operations, reflecting the group's sale of Russells Rubber in February. Turnover increased to Pounds 113.4m compared with Pounds 106.7m last time, when there was a Pounds 5m contribution from discontinued operations. About Pounds 3.1m of the rise in turnover reflected currency exchange benefits. Turnover improved in all four divisions. But operating profits were down from Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.5m in the furnishings and household textiles division, reflecting a fall in sales of car carpeting, and from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.79m in the yarns and fibres division, reflecting lower sales to the Middle East of fibre making machinery. Profits were ahead in all three of the carpet companies, which contributed Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.62m). The industrial products and services division boosted profits from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 2.02m on the back of a big rise at Hoyland Fox, which makes umbrella frames. The group had continued to cut costs and invest. It had shed 79 jobs in the half year at a cost of Pounds 459,000. Capital expenditure was Pounds 6.8m, compared with depreciation at Pounds 4.4m. Net interest payable fell by just over 50 per cent to Pounds 665,000 (Pounds 1.35m). Net borrowings were Pounds 14m at the end of September, giving gearing of 18 per cent. The comparable figures last time were Pounds 22.3m and 33 per cent respectively. Earnings per share rose from 2.12p to 2.36p. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.63p.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON WILL SEEK TO BLOCK CHEESEBORO CANYON SWAP  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Friday announced his opposition to a  controversial land swap in Cheeseboro Canyon that would allow entertainer Bob  Hope to begin commercial development of his Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura  County.  </P> <P> Cranston is the first California official to oppose the land transfer involving  acreage in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> In a statement issued by his office, Cranston said he will urge a Senate  Appropriations subcommittee to block the use of federal funds for the land  swap. Federal money is needed to pay for an environmental review of the land  exchange, a Cranston aide said.  </P> <P> "The denial of federal funds would effectively block the deal," Cranston said  in his statement.  </P> <P> Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would get 864 acres of  Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. In return, the service would give up 59 acres  in nearby Cheeseboro Canyon so that developers could build an access road to a  planned golf course and 750-house subdivision on the ranch.  </P> <P> If the proposal is approved, Hope would sell 5,700 acres of land in the Santa  Susana and Santa Monica mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for  $20 million, an amount that is considered lower than Hope could get from  developers.  </P> <P> But Cranston said that "instead of permitting the land exchange . . . the Park  Service should be seeking to acquire" the Jordan Ranch property to protect it  from development. He said he would seek an appropriation of $33 million to  enable the Park Service to purchase more land in the Cheeseboro Canyon area.  </P> <P> Neither Hope nor developers interested in the property could be reached for  comment Friday.  </P> <P> Cranston's announcement was applauded by environmentalists, who said it will  force other California officials to take a stand on the land-swap proposal. So  far, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and  Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) have not taken a position on the issue.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled," said Siegfried Othmer, a member of the environmental group  Save the Open Space. "It's the breaking of the dam we've been waiting for."  </P> <P> Elois Zeanah, another member of the group, agreed. "This is a significant  step," Zeanah said. "This is the first time a federal official has come forward  and taken a stand. They've all been hiding behind an Iron Curtain of  neutrality. This will open the curtain for others. People can't hide anymore."  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, who has supported the land swap, said he was surprised and  disappointed by Cranston's announcement.  </P> <P> "I'm somewhat shocked" that Cranston didn't talk to conservancy officials  before making his announcement, Edmiston said. "I think he's been misinformed.  I imagine that his position will change when he gets fully informed."  </P> <P> Edmiston, who has been the target of criticism for supporting the land deal,  said the arrangement with Hope would free $10 million in conservancy funds that  could be used to acquire thousands of acres of other environmentally sensitive  property.  </P> <P> Edmiston said he was not certain what effect, if any, Cranston's announcement  would have in swaying other officials.  </P> <P> Cranston said he will ask the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on interior to  triple President Bush's budget for buying land that should be protected.  </P> <P> "I am dismayed that the National Park Service is opening the door to commercial  development of Jordan Ranch, which should one day be national parkland,"  Cranston said. He accused the agency of "acting directly contrary to and  subversive of its mission."  </P></p>

Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, made a  speech at the conference. He stressed that we should  conscientiously understand the situation, grasp favorable  opportunities, exert great efforts to attend to the local  foreign affairs work, promote the opening of the municipality to  the outside world, and quicken the development of Tianjin's  economy.    In his speech, Gao Dezhan first extended regards to the  comrades who have diligently been working on the foreign affairs  front. He said: The work relating to foreign affairs is of  extreme importance and influences the overall situation. We  should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the sixth  national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, further  strengthen the local foreign affairs work in the new year,  promote the opening of the municipality to all directions,  promote economic development, and ensure the smooth progress of  work relating to foreign economic relations and trade. He  pointed out: At present, Tianjin has further expanded the scale  of opening to the outside world, improved the investment  environment, and quickened the pace of using foreign capital.  Therefore, the comrades engaged in the work relating to foreign  affairs must undertake important duties. This year, we should  extensively expand the scale of opening to all directions;  expand contacts with foreign countries; make foreign friends  extensively; strengthen external propaganda; improve the  investment environment; attract increasingly more foreign  businessmen, personages of banking circles, and entrepreneurs to  come to Tianjin to invest, conduct cooperation, make trips, and  pay visits; introduce international human, material, and  financial resources to Tianjin; and promote the acceleration of  Tianjin's economy.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should pay high attention to  foreign affairs work and strive to create a new situation in  Tianjin's foreign affairs work. The local foreign affairs work  is an important component part of the whole country's overall  foreign affairs work. The leaders at various levels and all  departments should further improve the understanding about  foreign affairs, pay high attention to the foreign affairs work,  and strive to achieve local foreign affairs work in the new  situation. He stressed: The foreign affairs departments should  persistently take economic construction as a key link.  Simultaneously, the foreign affairs work has its own special  features and tasks. We should grasp foreign affairs policies,  strengthen macroeconomic management, and serve the expansion of  opening up and economic development. While related to foreign  economic relations and trade, foreign affairs work is also  different. Both supplement and promote each other. We should  unite with all forces, form cohesive power, and achieve foreign  affairs work. In doing foreign affairs work, we should pioneer  new ways of thinking, suit the demands of the situation of  reform and opening up, and make new breakthroughs in the new  year.    Gao Dezhan urged: We should strengthen the macroeconomic  management of foreign affairs work and exercise centralized and  unified leadership over foreign affairs work. Different  departments should assume different responsibilities and make  concerted efforts to bring their functions into better play. We  should realistically strengthen the foreign affairs work and  ensure the smooth progress of foreign contacts. It is necessary  to further strengthen the construction of foreign affairs  workers contingents, strengthen training and education, and  comprehensively upgrade the quality of contingents. We should  strictly conduct education on the discipline governing foreign  affairs, foster a good image of foreign affairs cadres, achieve  the foreign affairs work, and make contributions to further  expanding the opening of Tianjin to the outside world and  developing the economy.    In his speech, Ye Disheng, vice mayor of the municipality,  delineated expectations on foreign affairs work departments in  the municipality. Geng Jianhua, chairman of the foreign affairs  office of the municipal government, relayed the guidelines of  the national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, summed  up the 1993 foreign affairs work, and arranged the work tasks  for 1994.</p>

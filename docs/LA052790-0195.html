			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ROAD EXPERT HITS ONE OF LIFE'S LITTLE BUMPS  </P> <P> Some call me Dr. Chuckhole. Others prefer simply Stick Shift. Whatever the  moniker, I often suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous colleagues, all  because I write a weekly question-and-answer column about traffic and  commuting. It's dubbed "Street Smart" and appears Mondays in the Orange County  edition. You've seen it. Some of you may have even read it.  </P> <P> The good-natured ribbing from my peers hardly bothers me. Lord knows I deserve  it. And along with the kidding come some serious queries about life on the  roadway. One staffer wanted to know if an out-of-state ticket would catch up to  him. Another asked me about a troublesome railroad crossing. Still another  pestered me about when that darned car-pool lane is going to open.  </P> <P> Warranted or not, it seems some of my colleagues view me as their trusty  transportation consultant. Even my neighbors occasionally pop a question when  I'm out front mowing the lawn. If I don't know the answer, I at least know  where to get it. Ask good old Dr. Chuckhole.  </P> <P> Recently, however, the good doctor's reputation took a tumble. We're not  talking malpractice, just a teensy-weensy oversight. And this one hit very  close to home.  </P> <P> I was talking with a county transportation official who happens to live a few  blocks away from my house on the northern flank of Santa Ana. We were  exchanging small talk when we got on the topic of the flood of commuters who  chug through the neighborhood each day. I wasn't taking notes, but as I recall,  the conversation went something like this:  </P> <P> Transportation expert: "Well, things will get lighter when Caltrans closes the  Flower Street off-ramp."  </P> <P> Dr. Chuckhole: "Flower Street off-ramp? What Flower Street off-ramp?"  </P> <P> Expert: "You don't know about the Flower Street off-ramp? It's been there  forever. Dumps cars right onto Flower."  </P> <P> I could hear it in his voice, the sort of veiled derision saved for only the  truly uninformed. I was, of course, aghast. Profoundly embarrassed. Humiliated.  </P> <P> Here in Southern California, one must know one's off-ramps, especially around  one's home.  </P> <P> Clinging to the faint hope that the expert was mistaken, I set out to  investigate. I pulled out my trusty jalopy and headed north on the freeway.  Swinging south again, I steamed toward the moment of truth. Say it ain't so.  </P> <P> It took several passes to find the proper route along the knot of overpasses,  transition roads and cloverleafs. But, alas, it was true. There it was, a neat  little slice of asphalt that conveniently slips traffic virtually into my back  yard.  </P> <P> The discovery has been weighing on me ever since. Indeed, this has been the  first time I've come clean. Admitting my faux pas will undoubtedly subject me  to abuse from friends and colleagues. "Doc! Where have you been?" I can see  them now, gleefully tittering in the corner, pointing my way.  </P> <P> It was a humbling lesson. Never again would I assume to have mastered all the  nooks and crannies of the Southland freeway system, let alone the streets  outside my front window.  </P> <P> But let's face it. I'm not alone. In this land of endless asphalt, keeping  track of the twists and turns of the freeways and thoroughfares that make up  our dizzying transportation network is downright impossible. Indeed, I surveyed  several of my neighbors, and none but the most veteran residents had set a set  of tires on the cursed Flower Street off-ramp.  </P> <P> Thank God Monday is a holiday. On Tuesday, I will return to work, tail between  my legs and resume my duties as Orange County's transportation answer man.  Perhaps by baring my soul I have compromised my hard-won credibility on traffic  matters. Perhaps this sad little episode will have cost me my title.  </P> <P> I'm a doctor no more. Call me Chuckhole.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ECOLOGICAL DISASTER PERILS EAST EUROPE, PRINCE CHARLES SAYS  </P> <P> Britain's Prince Charles today praised East Europeans for casting off communism  but warned that the region faces an "ecological Armageddon."  </P> <P> Speaking in the shadow of a statue of Karl Marx at a Budapest university that  until recently bore the name of the father of communism, Charles was strident  in his condemnation of Stalinism.  </P> <P> "In the name of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin charted a course that divided  Russia from Europe and then, after the Second World War, forcibly removed  Hungary from Western Europe, turning half of Europe into a form of Marxist  prison camp," he said.  </P> <P> Europeans can now "reshape the moral and political future of our continent,"  Charles said.  </P> <P> But he warned that the future is in danger from the grave ecological damage  wrought by developed industry in the West and centralized planning in the East.  </P> <P> "Central Europe has itself been the victim of ideological experiment and the  worst follies of a command economy," said Charles.  </P></p>

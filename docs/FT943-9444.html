			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Arts: Maxwell Davies' new Fifth - The Proms At Tuesday's Prom, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies conducted the Philharmonia in the premiere of his Symphony no. 5. He will be 60 next month. The Prommers received it with warm, vociferous enthusiasm: quite rightly, I thought. Yet one might have expected otherwise; for Max's atonal idiom is as uncompromising as ever, whereas popular post-modernist fashions in 'new music' have clutched back at tonality as to Nanny's apron-strings. Max learned early that advanced, theory-conscious music went down better with lacings of Expressionist drama: hence the 1960s Mad King songs, and the inspired Revelation and Fall. Then he moved to Orkney, where his fascination with the seascape and the light turned his palette toward neo-Impressionism  -though the detailed workings-out of the music were formally rigorous, even arcane. Embracing Sibelius was a natural next step (Nordic is Nordic, after all). It was not surprising that Max's First Symphony (1978) should declare inspiration from the Sibelius Fifth, in respect of large-scale form - not to mention its stark, long-sighted vistas. When asked why he should call his latest work a Symphony, Max allowed that it contained nothing like traditional 'development', just like the later Sibelius, but earned the title in virtue of hard-wrought density. Fair enough: this new Fifth, in a single movement, is dense, but also transparent and accessible. At well under half an hour it is less than half the length of his First, but it is superbly compact, and exercises a relentless symphonic grip. A near comparison would be a late- or post-Romantic Passacaglia, where a repeated ground-bass ensures the unity of disparate variations which may trace their own dramatic trajectory. (Earlier Matthias Bamert conducted Webern's early Passacaglia, which is just such a piece, with rare, sensuous subtlety.) Max's symphonic sections succeed one another like close links in a consecutive chain. From the bated-breath prologue for two flutes and a clarinet, many things expand in parallel and in contrast: brass chorales, soft wind-dialogues, frenetic tuttis (with brilliant surges from trumpet and horn) and introspective solos. It ends with a long, elegant, dying fall, from pianissimo strings and a moving cello line to formulaic high winds and a final, measured string-droop, barely audible. One reason why it all tells so strongly is that Max has adapted himself to a more consonant vocabulary. Not tonal, of course; but far less profligate than before with minor seconds and major sevenths, which in dissonant profusion confound the ear. Where we used to need the big theatrical effects as guideposts through his scores, the Fifth Symphony says quite directly what it means - which does not preclude knowing evasions, bursts of formal rhetoric, or gravely honest solo utterances. It works, and I look forward to hearing it again and again.</p>

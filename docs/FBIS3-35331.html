We need your  assistance in finding our way in the maze of contradicting  pieces of information. We hear there was a serious setback in  Paris, where the Palestinians reneged on several earlier  understandings. At the same time, very good progress was  reportedly made in Cairo, and Qol Yisra'el even announced that 5  May has been set as the date for the beginning of the withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho and that Yasir 'Arafat has been notified  of it and has accepted the date. Where do things really stand?    [Peres] Look, first, Yasir 'Arafat has not been notified of  any date; neither has a date been set. Therefore, although that  report is full of goodwill, it is inaccurate. The real  information is that progress was made in Taba. Important  progress was made last week. Additional progress was made  yesterday. If indeed this pace is kept up, there is a good  chance that an agreement will be reached in the negotiations  within a few weeks, and it could be implemented in a short time.  We cannot yet provide a specific date because there are always  surprises during negotiations.    [Friedman] You have recently said that there are no sacred  dates but only sacred time frames, allowing us to understand  that the four-month span between the day the agreement with the  PLO is signed and the beginning of the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] withdrawal will be observed in any event. Do you still  insist on those four months?    [Peres] I said four months after the agreement is signed.  It has not been signed yet. At the same time, I believe that  if it is signed -- and I believe it will be in a few weeks -- we  will not need four months; we may require only four weeks or  even less. That is, I do not know whether it will take place in  April; it could take another month, if everything works well.  Still, the time span was properly set.    As for the Paris talks, one must realize that negotiations  include many surprises, tricks, changes of position, and  setbacks. There is no need to get overly excited about this. We  have experienced this in other negotiations. In general,  however, I believe that the PLO today is more pragmatic and  that, like us, it wants to end the negotiations as soon as  possible. I do not underestimate the many details that have to  be dealt with, but in general, very satisfactory progress has  been made.    [Friedman] It seems, however, that the PLO is trying to get  in Paris what it failed to attain in the Cairo and Davos talks  in which you participated: symbols of sovereignty, such as  their own currency and customs, which is the source of the  crisis in Paris.    [Peres] I believe this is a mistake. The time of  nationalist economics is over. Economy today is based on free  markets not national markings, because you cannot feed children  flags for breakfast. This is a bit old-fashioned. Everyone is  making efforts today to have economy influence politics and not  the other way around. We do not want to cater to the leaders'  egos but to the people's needs.    [Friedman] Finance Minister Shohat said, however, that if  the Paris talks fail, we will opt for nationalist economies and  separate the economies of the territories and Israel.    [Peres] Look, the Palestinians will suffer from this, not  us. Things must be kept in proportion. Israel's national income  is $70 billion; the national income in the territories is $2-3  billion. The territories need Israeli jobs and markets. For  example, where will they export their farming produce? You know  that 50,000 Palestinians working in Israel make a very large  income. I know that there are two schools of thought in the  PLO: the national and the economic. That is, some of the PLO  officials still believe that nationalism is more important than  the market, but many of them are university graduates who are  familiar with the modern world. They are aware of what would  benefit both the Palestinians and Israel.    I suggest that we do not present this issue as something  Israel needs. The territories need a free economy,  possibilities of finding work and selling goods, and a stable  currency more than we do. Our economy is based on three or four  agreements: the free trade agreement with the United States;  associate membership in the EEC; and a free trade agreement with  EFTA [European Free Trade Association]. Furthermore, we have  bilateral agreements with the whole world. Israel exported  $4.5-billion worth of high-tech, sophisticated electronic goods  to the United States last year. We always present this as if  someone is doing us a favor. We need no such favors, and no one  is doing us any. We want the economic situation of the  territories to be good.    [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I would like you to comment about  today's top story on the front page of DAVAR, which says that  Israel planned to free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners as a holiday  gesture and to mark the progress in the Cairo talks, but changed  its mind in the wake of the killing of Tzipora Sason and the  unrest in the territories.    [Peres] There is no doubt that the killings significantly  affect national morale. The report itself, I believe, is not  accurate. We must wait and see about the date and scope of the  prisoner release.</p>

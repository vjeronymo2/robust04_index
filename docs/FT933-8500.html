			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Mexican stocks in strong rally MEXICO'S stock market rallied strongly yesterday as news that negotiations had been successfully concluded to the side agreements on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The bellwether Telefonos Mexicanos, which accounts for about 30 per cent of the market's value, leapt by almost 5 per cent, with other communications and transport stocks leading the way. In Washington, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, talked of a 'historic agreement', which could 'reform a trade relationship with Mexico that has been driven more by accident than design'. Only brief details of the agreement were outlined in an early statement by Mr Jaime Serre Puche, Mexico's trade minister. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was expected to talk at greater length in a speech planned for later in the day. According to President Clinton, speaking at a naval supply station in Oakland California, a pledge by President Salinas to make minimum wage standards part of Nafta had paved the way for an overnight breakthrough. It was clear Mexico had in late stages of negotiation bent over backwards to accommodate US demands that the side agreements should have 'teeth'. Mexico will be liable for trade sanctions in the event that its companies fail to comply with national labour and environmental laws. Negotiators emphasised that the side agreements would not require Mexico to strengthen existing labour and environment laws - at least not immediately. Instead, sanctions would be triggered if Mexico fails to enforce existing laws. The US and Mexico have agreed to create a commission to finance environmental and infrastructure improvements along their 2,000-mile border, but early statements left it unclear how these improvements will be funded.</p>

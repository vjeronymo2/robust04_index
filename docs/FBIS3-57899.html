			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Rebirth Pact leader Mario Segni, by </F> Federico Guiglia; place and date not given: "`Ciampi Must Say  Whether He Supports Democratic Party of the Left'"]    [Text] Rome -- On the eve of the presentation of his  "Pact," Mariotto Segni issued a challenge to [Prime Minister]  Ciampi and [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary]  Occhetto: "The prime minister must stop acting as the PDS'  candidate to the premiership," Segni said in this interview with  IL GIORNALE. "Occhetto? We will never form an alliance with  him, neither before nor after the coming elections."    [Guiglia] According to a recent opinion poll, businessmen  have more confidence in the "Pact" than in Occhetto's  progressive alignment. Do you consider that a confirmation or a  surprise?    [Segni] I consider it extraordinary that a mere month after  its establishment almost one-third of the businessmen  interviewed name the Pact as their favorite electoral grouping.  But it does not surprise me: The much vaunted and presumed  support from industrialists for the PDS is absolute nonsense,  fabricated by a few journalists and promptly publicized by  Occhetto's party. In any case, you do not need opinion polls to  see that the whole of Italy's industrial sector identifies by a  large majority with the liberal-democratic alignment.    [Guiglia] But industrialists would prefer Ciampi to Segni as  prime minister. How do you explain that?    [Segni] Ciampi deserves confidence, and this is obviously a  possible result when an opinion survey is carried out in the  financial and business environment -- that is, the very  environment from which the former governor of the Bank of Italy  himself came. However, leaving surveys and forecasts aside, the  time has come to make things clear. For several weeks Ciampi  has been presented as the ideal candidate of the PDS and the  Democratic Alliance for the premiership. Hitherto the prime  minister has said nothing about this suggestion, thus giving the  impression that he might accept it and effectively playing into  Occhetto's hands. But a prime minister that is the result of a  majority different from that envisaged by Occhetto and that has  a duty to remain impartial cannot remain silent. Before the 12  January parliamentary debate Ciampi has a duty to clarify  whether he considers himself the candidate of the front headed  by the PDS. And whether he considers his own political position  compatible with that of the left-wing alliance. His silence on  this point is no longer acceptable: It would be tantamount to  believing that Ciampi has become Occhetto's "shadow candidate."  A reply from the prime minister is crucial to the imminent  parliamentary debate and the subsequent election campaign.    [Guiglia] Actually Ciampi has already said that he does not  want to stand as a candidate. Why is it so important that he  repeat it?    [Segni] Just a moment: Ciampi stressed that he does not want  to stand as a parliamentary candidate, but he did not say that  he does not want to be put forward as prime minister by one or  another of the fronts. I would add that this clarification is  essential for one simple reason: A possible "yes" to the PDS  would bring about an unacceptable situation, because a prime  minister brought in by a particular majority would become the  candidate of the opposite font. I do not believe that Ciampi  accepts this possibility. But he must say so.    [Guiglia] One clarification deserves another: Who will  guarantee that your "Pact" will remain an alternative to the PDS  not only before the elections, but afterwards too?    [Segni] I guarantee it, and we all guarantee it  unequivocally  in the very manifesto of the Pact, which was created as an  alternative to the PDS and not in order to help Occhetto or with  a view to governing with him. If we are victorious, we will  govern. Otherwise we will engage in opposition and plan for a  victory in the next elections. The Pact is the only national  force that represents an alternative to the PDS.    [Guiglia] Why is it that the PDS can ally with Communist  Renaissance but the "Center" cannot do the same with the MSI  [Italian Social Movement], which is in any case evolving into  the National Alliance?    [Segni] Because we are responsible, and the PDS is not. The  first-past-the-post electoral law is not enough to make profound  political and ideological differences disappear by magic. It is  up to Occhetto to explain why his alliance with Communist  Renaissance is supposedly modern and progressive and in what way  he and [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta differ from the  old PCI [Italian Communist Party]. I urge the friends of the  Democratic Alliance to remember the inalienable principle -- no  agreements with Communist Renaissance. Will they at least have  the courage to break away? I hope that they will realize that  the only reformist and liberal-democratic reality is that of the  Pact.    [Guiglia] But even the Pact is not immune from  contradictions. You are in favor of national unity, but in  Friuli you have "opened up" to the League. The League's Maroni  has said that "an alliance is possible" with Segni. Is this a  turnabout?    [Segni] No, it is no turnabout. Perhaps some representatives  of the Northern League are beginning to realize that their most  extreme political stances are untenable. I hope that this will  be understood first and foremost by the voters.    [Guiglia] [Christian Democratic Party (DC) Secretary]  Martinazzoli, Segni, [MSI Secretary] Fini, and [Northern League  leader] Bossi say: Berlusconi can talk about politics, but it  is better for him not to engage in politics personally. Are you  afraid that "Rooting for Italy" could win over copious support  from your moderate voters?    [Segni] Frankly, no, I do not fear any problems of  "competition," so to speak. I think that he can do a great deal  for the liberal-democratic front -- but only if he keeps out of  the arena. However, if he decides to become personally  involved, he will ultimately increase the fragmentation.    [Guiglia] Now that you are no longer a Christian Democrat,  tell me honestly: Do you have the feeling of founding, as  Martinazzoli is doing, a "People's Party" at the very time when  the electoral law is prompting Catholics to divide between the  progressive and moderate fronts?    [Segni] I have always maintained that the presence of  organized Catholics is essential. This presence will largely be  oriented, almost automatically, toward the liberal-democratic  area. The People's Party makes full sense within the broader  alliance of the Pact.    [Guiglia] Can President Scalfaro stay on after the elections  or would it be better to replace the last figurehead of the  First Republic?    [Segni] According to the Constitution, the chief of state  remains in office for seven years. I am in favor of full  observance of our Constitution.    [Guiglia] You have criticized Ciampi's latest economic  package. Do you really think that the economic policy pursued by  the prime minister could some day coincide with that advocated  by Occhetto?    [Segni] As governor of the Bank of Italy, Ciampi did a great  service to the national economy -- apart, perhaps, from his  desperate defense of the exchange rate in autumn 1992, which  cost us a huge amount of currency. His international prestige  has facilitated the recovery of Italy's credibility. But there  are several points to be made about economic policy. First, we  must not forget that the government that had the courage to  reverse the trend toward the explosion of the public deficit was  Amato's, which made sharp cuts, thus risking unpopularity.  Ciampi could, and should, have continued along this path,  reducing public spending. Has he done so? Frankly, not enough.  The Finance Bill was presented to us in this light. But here  we have another package worth 7 trillion lire and the  announcement of another financial package after the elections,  despite the reduction of interest rates. Clearly the promised  reduction of expenditure has not happened, as confirmed by the  interventions to salvage RAI [Italian State Broadcasting  Corporation] and the administrative bodies of the government  holding agencies. It is difficult to know to what extent this  was the result of objective difficulties or of a decision in  favor of a soft Finance Bill that could win Occhetto's approval.  The Pact's philosophy is the opposite of this: The constraint  on reducing public spending is that taxes must not increase by a  single lira.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum producers complain of market distortion SA MR MICHAEL McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, the world's second largest producer, yesterday launched a strong attack on 'industrial concerns' which he accused of manipulating the platinum market. His comments follow a week in which two announcements, both later shown to be at least partly inaccurate, caused the platinum price to plummet from nearly Dollars 370 to about Dollars 340 a troy ounce. The rhodium price fell in sympathy, reaching Dollars 1,450 an ounce, the lowest for nearly five years. The first false alarm, which caused the initial price crack, was a story last week suggesting that Japanese car makers were selling off their stocks of platinum group metals (PGM), which include palladium as well as platinum and rhodium. The price fall was then exacerbated by the release of a report by Allied-Signal suggesting that it had developed a new catalytic converter using only palladium. In a statement entitled 'Is this fair play?' Mr McMahon said the latest announcements were further examples of incidents during the past few years that had adversely affected platinum producers' revenues, profits and working capital. 'I am deeply concerned at the common thread which runs through most of these announcements, which initially overstate a position, causing severe downward pressure on the PGM markets and are followed a day or so later by a retraction, withdrawal, or considerable watering down of the original message.' This view has been endorsed by Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, which said yesterday that some of its shafts were losing money and if current price levels continued, Rusplats would have to consider closing shafts. Mr Todd Bruce, marketing director of Rusplats, the world's largest producer, said there was no factual support for the claim that car companies were selling stocks. Allied-Signal followed their initial announcement with a statement saying that although its new catalyst system would become an important part of its new business, it would not replace traditional platinum or rhodium based systems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F> and guest Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES, and Osvaldo Rodriguez  from JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live]    [Text] [Roque] Good afternoon, this program could not  ignore Cuba's presentation of a document by the U.S. Interests  Section [USINT] in Havana to the UN Human Rights Commission in  Geneva on the so-called human rights group in Cuba. You know the  background. The information has been reported by the media.  Today we will discuss this.    [Recio] It is, first of all, one more confirmation that the  U.S. policy toward Cuba on this much-haggled issue of human  rights is based above all on a fallacy. It is founded, above  all, on a fictional script that they wish to impose on Cuba to  continue a policy of maintaining the blockade and doing  everything possible to prevent the Cuban people from fulfilling  its dream of sovereignty and independence.    This case seems to come straight from the movies. It smells  of the movies. Friendly hands have given Cuba a document which  proves that SINA [USINT] has sent a letter to the State  Department, the CIA -- listen closely now -- the CIA [repeats],  and the Immigration and Naturalization Service clearly  acknowledging that in Cuba there is really no evidence of human  rights violations and that those who request U.S. refugee  program protection must invent stories to prove that they are  objects of persecution by Cuban authorities or have been victims  of human rights violations.    [Rodriguez] I also believe it is good to point out something  I was reading in a news agency dispatch that confirms the ties  between these groups, these minuscule groups as we Cubans call  them, and the CIA, and how -- through USINT in Havana -- these  groups are encouraged, financed, and promoted. Recently, thanks  to my journalistic work, I had an opportunity to meet with  several members of one of these small groups. I pointed out to  them in my conversation that they are puppets of Yankee  diplomacy because they had also told me they have free access to  USINT. Every member of these groups, or at least their leaders,  have free access to USINT. What they are truly seeking is the  establishment of a biographical record in order to eventually  emigrate to the United States.    [Roque] The document itself is entitled: Actual Situation of  the Cuban Refugee Program. The document states that the visa  request process keeps encountering dubious cases mostly provoked  by economics. I believe we must comment on this because that is  the way it is.    [Rodriguez] That is very interesting because the  international campaign the United States wages against Cuba is  precisely that the emigration of a significant number of Cubans  to the United Stated is rooted in politics. However, Cuba has  always maintained that those leaving do so above all for  economic reasons. There is a difference between emigres and  refugees. It seems completely normal for Cubans here to admit  that they emigrate for economic reasons. However, the United  States maintains that they are not emigrants, but refugees, or  dissidents, or persecuted, etc.    This document proves... [changes thought] They acknowledge:  We cannot find a way to prove that there are cases of human  rights violations. What we actually find is that people ask to  leave Cuba for economic reasons. This is very important.    [Recio] I believe this proves once again that those Cubans  who wish to move to the United States are held hostage to that  policy. I believe this has been a habit of U.S. policy since the  beginning of the Revolution.    [Roque] You spoke earlier of fallacies. In this case, I  believe that the entire U.S. policy toward Cuba is full of  fallacies, from beginning to end. Today we are talking about new  evidence of the fallacy of U.S. policy toward Cuba based on the  document which USINT sent to the U.S. State Department, the CIA,  and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As mentioned  earlier, friendly hands delivered this USINT document to Cuban  authorities.    [Rodriguez] I would like to reevaluate this. We describe  that policy as fallacious. However, I consider that adjective  very mild because we are speaking of infamy. We are speaking of  complete infamy because Cuba is accused, and has always been  accused, of violating human rights. They want to place Cuba, in  comparative terms, in a category with those places in the world  where great human rights violations occur.    It is truly offensive to be placed in this position, for  them  to accuse a country which, like any other, has made mistakes;  but something that has never occurred in this country is  continuous, massive violations of human rights, as a policy.  Rather, the contrary is true. We can say this because the people  know this better than anyone. They are witnesses that in Cuba no  one is persecuted, tortured, or missing; no one in Cuba is a  victim of police repression.    Everyday, you can turn on the television and see how police  organizations around the world massively violate human rights.  You do not see this in Cuba. Nevertheless, the United States not  only uses this argument against Cuba, they fabricate  circumstances. Be aware that these groups, or so-called human  rights activists, had been receiving privileges from, were  living off, the USINT. They even had what we call here in Cuba  that purpose [esa busca]. But not anymore.    According to this document, they are even selling fraudulent  claims. Through these sales, they are providing individuals with  fraudulent human rights claims so they can present themselves  for visas.    [Roque] Renato, I believe we could even quote that paragraph  of the USINT document addressed to the U.S. State Department,  the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service that reads: Over the past months,  accusations of fraudulent requests by activists and [words  indistinct] testimonials by human rights leaders have been  persistent. Due to the lack of documented and verifiable proof,  as a rule, USINT officials and members of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service consider cases on human rights most  liable to fraud.    [Recio] Juan Carlos, I believe it is important to reiterate  this about the CIA: Remember that just a few months ago, the CIA  disclosed or acknowledged for the first time ever that it had  conducted several attempts against Cuban leaders, especially  against the commander in chief. In other words, they publicly  admitted that they have been behind the policy of trying to do  away with the Cuban Revolution and making it disappear.    Once again, the CIA appears here as an element that unites  these groups that we could call Cuban opposition -- as they call  it abroad, or as they present themselves abroad. Once again, the  CIA uses various methods, but these so-called stupid children  [hijitos bobos] have not been what they expected, have not been  everything they thought they could be. I noticed that in the  document, they made reference to 225 cases analyzed by U.S.  officials. Of course, I am talking about the original document.  The secret document that we were talking about was disseminated  by the international press agencies.    Of these 225 cases, they say that 47 claim to have carried  out human rights activities. Nevertheless, only 19 of them were  finally approved by the USINT. By this you can see that there is  a generalized fraud behind this. They were taught to commit  fraud. The CIA, which is unquestionably behind all these  activities, was showing them ways to commit fraud.    [Roque] I believe we have left out one important factor: the  special rapporteur.    [Recio] Juan Carlos, that is precisely why Cuba viewed the  report presented by this so-called UN special rapporteur at the  UN Human Rights Commission as interference because as all of  you, and all the listeners may remember, Cuba never admitted the  physical presence of that individual into our country. This man  has been able to fabricate a report that adheres to the U.S.  policy toward Cuba that has to do with the brutal efforts and  brutal pressure the United States exercises to make the UN  condemn Cuba. This document we have spoken about, its discovery  -- in quotation marks -- or its appearance undoubtedly weakens  the U.S. intention to harm Cuba.    This demonstrates, once again, that Cuba does not even  remotely violate human rights and that the United States is the  main violator of human rights in Cuba; above all, by its  persistence and the feats or brutality with which it imposes an  economic blockade on the Cuban people. That is a form of  harassment. As a matter of fact, this rapporteur includes  recommendations in his report that to prevent the violation of  human rights in Cuba, the blockade be lifted. Of course, it is a  politicized way of seeing the problem.    [Rodriguez] Renato, I have no doubt that the speech  presented  by the Swedish rapporteur was drafted and written and given to  him to be read in Geneva by the CIA in the United States. He is  working with a set standard that is being sponsored by the U.S.  policy, and which has its actors.</p>

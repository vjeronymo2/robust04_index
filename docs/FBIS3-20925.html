In addition, DTB [Digital Television Broadcasting] will  acquire an interest in SES "within the next three to four  weeks," the objective being for DBP Telekom to eventually hold  "15 or 16 percent" of the Luxembourg company capital, people at  the SES head office in Betzdorf (near Luxembourg) indicated.    Luxembourg will remain the largest shareholder, through two  public companies, the State Savings Bank and the National Credit  and Investment Company, each retaining one third of the voting  rights. The future company "will promote the development of  digital satellite and cable transmission techniques for TV and  radio programs and interactive services."    The SES intends to use digital compression on its two future  satellites, Astra-1E and Astra-1S, to be launched at the  beginning of 1995 and 1996 respectively. With 40 repeaters each,  these two satellites will broadcast up to 400 TV programs. This  range of new services will enable consumers to pay only for what  they choose, or even to place orders directly by telephone  through a modem.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT has no age limits I RECENTLY sold my house, which I bought in 1969. It consisted of four flats, one of which I occupied. The Inland Revenue has indicated I might have to pay capital gains tax, based on its value as of April 1982 and the price at which I sold it. As a pensioner, I thought I would be exempt from CGT. How can I obtain a 1982 valuation? There is no maximum (or minimum) age limit for CGT. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988).* It is a pity you did not ask your solicitor about your CGT position before the house was sold. Even at this late stage, it will probably be best to go back to him for help since he knows (or can readily establish) the relevant facts and figures as well as the relevant CGT law and practice (or, at least, will probably have a colleague who does). In particular, he can (presumably) help you in your negotiations with the district valuer over the market worth of the house at March 31 1982, taking into account the terms on which each of the flats was let on that day. You are likely to need the services of a surveyor (or other land agent). Perhaps the estate agent who acted for you in the sale will be prepared to co-ordinate the negotiations with the district valuer. The cost of ascertaining the March 31 1982 value will be deductible in calculating the chargeable gain. If the conversion into flats was done after you bought the house, give your solicitor the details, as this could reduce significantly the prospective CGT bill. You should also let him know if you have lived in any of the other three flats because this, too, could reduce the prospective CGT bill. (The rules of CGT are quite arbitrary). *The pamphlet CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) might also be helpful - but do not place too much reliance upon it as it tends to over-simplify the rules laid down by parliament. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

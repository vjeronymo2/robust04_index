			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities scale new peaks in very heavy trading - Market report The London stock market surged to new peaks yesterday in the most successful trading session of the year as investors welcomed a UK Budget seen as sustaining economic recovery and opening the way for further cuts in UK base rates in the new year. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 66.3 points up at a new closing peak of 3,233.2, showing the biggest daily advance since September 1992 when the stock market was celebrating sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. Buying across the wider range of the market took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 80.7 to 3,565.6, also a new peak. One seasoned trader described trading volume as 'phenomenal - the heaviest I've seen in 17 years.' European and US investment funds were heavy buyers of UK equities, spurred on by upgradings of the London market by two of the largest US investment banks. Seaq volume of 1,235.1m shares dwarfed Tuesday's 576.4m. The absence from the Budget of the feared attack on pension fund tax and dividend status played a significant role in the hurried reversal of some bearish positions taken in the equity futures markets during the week before Budget day. Dealers arrived in the City early yesterday morning and the market broke through to new peak territory before the official opening, and without waiting for the futures sector to provide a lead. Between 8.00am and 8.30am, when screen prices are 'indicative only', the FT-SE Index touched a nominal 3,202. The Index dipped back to 3,197 but quickly rose again when the December future contract opened at a substantial premium. Footsie 3,200 was quickly recaptured and from then on, shares forged ahead strongly, pausing only briefly as the premium on the December contract ebbed and swayed. London was also sharing in the general advance in other European bourses and benefited from a firm start on Wall Street, which gained 18 Dow points in UK trading hours. At best, the Footsie was 83.2 points ahead at 3,250.1 and the drift downwards towards the close was ascribed to little more than the expected profit-taking in a market which, at yesterday's peak, had risen by nearly 6 per cent since the eve of last week's cut in UK interest rates to 5.5 per cent. There was no lack of encouragement from the market strategists. Mr Nicholas Knight, the bull from Nomura, heads predicted a rally of 200 - 400 Footsie points 'in the next eight weeks,' which would bring it to his celebrated year-end forecast of 3,500. At Goldman Sachs International, believed by some dealers to have turned bearish ahead of the Budget, yesterday raised its Footsie forecast to 3,600 'in a year (3,250-3,300 at year-end). Salomon International, another heavy presence in derivatives markets, raised its year-end target to 3,350, with its June 1994 target at 3,500. Two weak spots in the market were GEC, after a disappointing interim report, and Ladbroke which confirmed intentions to take advantage of foreign dividend rules. Among the strongest sectors yesterday were building and construction issues, cheered by Budget decisions to proceed with major projects, and banks, which benefit both from interest rate optimism and active stock markets. Brewery stocks advanced on the absence of Budget changes in beer duties.</p>

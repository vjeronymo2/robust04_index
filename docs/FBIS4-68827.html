The impression is  created that it is being influenced by the old Soviet compass  whose arrow always deviated toward abstract globalism and a view  of foreign policy as a kind of chess game in which the moves and  the maneuvers themselves were more important than the end  result. In any case, it is impossible not to see that the  magnetic lines of force of the past continue to hold us in the  field of an artificial world view that has a rather weak  association with the realities of our situation.    Russia is an absolutely new country even in its physical  parameters: in the size and composition of the population,  territorial configuration, and resources and capabilities. It is  in another geopolitical position, and it has new neighbors  virtually along the entire land perimeter. There has also been a  fundamental change in the architectural outline of the rest of  the world. Structures of force do not protrude as much, and are  increasingly being pushed into the background by a complex  economic framework.    It is precisely for this reason that it seems that the very  first task of foreign policy is to realize the changes that have  occurred and are occurring, and to understand their significance  and consequences for the national interests of Russia. In turn,  these national interests must be deduced not mainly from the  past but from the future of the new Russia, in which it should  occupy a worthy place in the higher league of world powers.  There can be only one path to this objective--utmost realism in  foreign policy. In the meantime, unfortunately, we have not yet  set foot on this path.    The politicians are saying, to the point and not to the  point, that Russia is a great power. The importunate invocations  on this subject reflect not only a certain inferiority  complex--which, however, is fully explained by the current  unhappy state of affairs in the country--but, what is worse,  this slogan is used to cover loss of face in the international  arena, uncertainty of action, and lack of consistency, not to  mention integrity of policy.    Moreover, I am more than convinced that the problems in  foreign policy are associated first and foremost not so much  with the situation in the economy of Russia as with the still  unrepaired mechanism for making decisions in the state, the  obvious muddle in the higher echelons of authority, and the lack  of normal cooperation between departments. Russian diplomats are  compelled to work in a mode of reducing damage to the country's  interests. From this stems the desire to stand on the stilts of  "great Russia." Although it is perfectly obvious that there is  no sense to this. Russia does not need anything in recognition  of its status as a world power. It has had such during the  course of centuries. No one is refuting this now either. But  whether it will be retained in the future is a question whose  answer depends on us alone.    But our current behavior bewilders me, and at times arouses  a  sense of shame. It vacillates, as it did in the old Soviet  times, between two poles--threats and ingratiation. Previously  we were intimidated with nuclear war, now--with the collapse of  Russia, a result that will be bad for everyone. Yesterday we  were prepared to pay dearly for "class enemies" to receive our  "general secretary" on a visit and show him first-class honor,  today we are seeking membership in the G-7. Why? Probably in  order that they show respect.    Is it necessary to think about this now? In my opinion, it  is  far more important for Russia to transform the CIS into a  likeness of the Western G-7, to arrange real cooperation with  the leaders of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and  other Commonwealth states. It is with this that we should be  occupied most of all, and not soliciting special status in the  "Partnership for Peace" program. Unquestionably, we should join  this program and set ourselves up there in such a way that  Russia will be considered and its interests taken into account.    One is struck by the insensitivity of professional diplomats  toward the falsity of the formula of conducting affairs with the  United States "on equal terms." But, for example, relations with  Lithuania or Burundi will not be built on "equal terms?" There  is the generally recognized principle of reciprocity, which lies  at the basis of normal interstate relations, and our inferiority  complex is evident here. After all, we are not talking about  reaching agreement with the Americans on a "treaty in which no  one wins." Such things simply do not happen in international  relations.    It is enough to look at how affairs are conducted in the  West. What a sharp dispute arose quite recently between the  European Union and the United States, especially between Paris  and Washington about trade in agricultural products. The United  States is not averse to establishing quotas on the import of  Japanese automobiles and literally breaking into the  communications equipment market in Japan with force. But we  frequently see political discrimination where generally a normal  fierce struggle is going on for markets. And it must be  understood that no one will just simply yield their share of  sales to Russia, especially in the arms market. Whining and  complaining will not produce anything in this regard.    What we must persistently try to achieve is that the field  on  which the competition is being played is even for everyone and  that the rules of the game for Russia are the same as for  others. This, incidentally, will also show the true interest of  the West in the success of our reforms and democratic  reorganization. Symbolic charitable assistance not only does not  produce anything, it casts a shadow on the purity of the  intentions of our "benefactors," and, I fear, can even cloud  mutual relations.    If by virtue of objective reasons we are not now prepared to  compete with the West in some markets, then it is at least  necessary for us not to give markets in CIS countries to others  and also to fight for markets of the states of Eastern Europe  and the Baltic countries. This is not a question of economics.  It is only part of the main task of Russian foreign policy--the  construction of a new system of mutual relations of states on  the territory of the former Union. Herein lies the really  vitally important national interest of Russia.    The priority of this specific direction is recognized by  everyone, but unfortunately nothing of substance has been done,  or is being done. Modern history does not know of cases in which  any state would end up in a situation where there was a complete  lack of regulation of its relations with a dozen contiguous  countries, each of which was connected with it by a thousand  threads--historical, political, economic, and purely human. The  broken-up family was left to live in the same home, dividing it  with plywood walls into separate apartments. But what about  sewers and gas, electricity, and a common television antenna?  Well, just as in normal life--sit down and come to an agreement:  Who is responsible for this, how much, and who has to be paid...    The initial confusion can still be explained somehow. None  of  us were psychologically prepared for the new realities. Russian  diplomats discovered that they knew New Zealand better than  Ukraine or Armenia. Another psychological barrier arose: How to  conduct affairs--according to kinship, or as with everyone else.    In principle, we now find ourselves in this position of  diplomatic imponderability, although embassies have already  appeared and relations have been somewhat formalized. Of course,  they are far from the classical diplomatic forms. But it is  already clear now that Russia will only be able to regulate  affairs with its new neighbors within the scope of political  negotiations in accordance with established world practice and  on the basis of international law.    If all the unresolved problems with all the "old" countries  are placed on one scale, and on the other, for example, only  Russian-Ukrainian problems, the latter will turn out to be much  heavier than the former. It is necessary to start here not just  from zero but with big negative quantities. Only resentfulness,  suspicion, and distrust remain from living in the Union  community. Extreme nationalism, ethnic intolerance, mutual  vindictiveness, and open hostility have come to the surface.  This does not happen by itself. It is necessary to oppose the  process of estrangement with a calm and patient search for  normal cooperation on those questions that constitute mutual  interest and provide a benefit to both sides. They lie almost  completely in the sphere of economics. It must be said clearly  that there can be no question of returning to anything similar  to the old "communal life." The objective is the same:  cooperation in the sphere of economics, without which neither  Russia nor other states will pull themselves out of the crisis  condition quickly. We are all linked to what was created as a  monolithic economy. For the present, none of us have any other,  and none other will appear soon. It is necessary to show common  sense here and come to an agreement on the principles and  specific variants of cooperation in both the sphere of  production and in the sale of products. There can be only one  basis for such cooperation--mutual interest.    However, if one is to be a realist, it is necessary to  recognize also that Russia will have to be a donor in relations  with at least some of its partners for some time. To what extent  this is possible and expedient is another question. It is not a  question of charity: Russia, possibly more than anyone else, is  interested in the restoration of economic ties, in the creation  of markets for its products, and in arranging broad trade with  its immediate neighbors. It must also take the initiative in  formulating questions of economic cooperation. Perhaps there is  no more important task today.    Therefore, one can only be amazed when we lack not only our  own initiative but we also do not have time to respond to the  initiative of others. During his visit to Moscow, Kazakhstan  President Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed the idea of creating a  Euro-Asiatic union, an idea that is undoubtedly interesting and  moves in the direction of developing the integration process. Of  course, quite a few aspects arise here that require elucidation  and further study. But to react to this important initiative  with complete official silence--this is not simply  incomprehensible, it is also ignorant. This kind of approach  will cause us enormous damage, and casts a shadow on the  readiness and desire of Russian diplomacy to conduct affairs  with our most important partner respectfully and properly. There  is a need here, I would say, for significantly more tact and  attention than in the mutual relations with traditional  participants in diplomatic exchanges.    Relations with the rest of the world can today be entrusted  to the "autopilot" in significant measure--nothing will happen  with them. Russia has a reliable treaty basis for the conduct of  affairs with Europe, the United States, Japan, and other  traditional partners, especially in the political sphere. There  is experience, tradition, and professional personnel. Almost  everything here is predictable, and it is most unlikely that  there will be any big surprises. Russia is a permanent member of  the UN Security Council, and this means that important  international problems cannot be decided without it. Of course,  it does not follow from this that activity must be lessened in  the Western direction. Not in the least. Russia cannot help but  participate in the most active way in worldwide problems: It  cannot fail to work on disarmament problems, the settlement of  regional conflicts, etc. Although here as well it is impossible  to forget our own national interest--concerning integration into  the world economic system.    The CIS countries are another matter. Here it is necessary  to  roll our sleeves up and display the maximum tact and attention  to our new neighbors and partners. To be engaged in general, as  is customary for us, but personally at all levels--from the  president of the country to the most humble official in every  department that has a bearing on these problems. It is fitting  to talk here about cooperation on equal terms, demonstrating as  much patience, understanding, correctness, and respect as  possible.    Experience says that even small problems in international  relations are not resolved immediately, and that time and  persistent negotiations are required. But how difficult it is to  build relationships essentially in a blank space.    I admit that I am intimidated by a package of documents that  are being signed on the results of two-three meetings of experts  and hour-long negotiations at a higher level. It is most likely  that they will not produce results, and we already have been  witnesses as to how documents that are formally prepared and  hastily signed are quickly forgotten.    It is clear that Russian diplomats should defend Russia's  interests firmly, but it is necessary to understand that their  partners will act in the same way. An agreement can be born only  as a compromise, as a balance of interests that are acceptable  to each side. This cannot be done in an offhand way.    It is important now to begin negotiations on a whole  spectrum  of bilateral relations with each of our neighbors. To select  competent negotiating teams and supply them with initial  directives and instructions--and this will require competent  interdepartmental consultations and agreements--to establish a  procedure for interaction with the Federal Assembly, and to  assign, naturally, the people and resources for all of this.  Organized in this way, the negotiations will soon create their  own inertia of movement, and will begin to produce results.    Time will decide the question about how, in the final  analysis, we will begin to live further. But if Russia does not  set an example and does not propose a settlement with its new  neighbors according to international standards, then the  centrifugal forces of history and the inertia of chaos will  scatter us all in such a way that it will become simply  impossible to maintain normal relations and communicate in a  human way. I do not want to talk about worse and more  frightening variants, but it is necessary to think about them,  otherwise it is they that will come to pass.    I am very troubled by the leisurely manner and certain  aloofness with which our politicians relate to what could  determine the fate of Russia--to finding a safe, mutually  beneficial, and humane method of life under new realities. It is  necessary to remember that Russia's greatness is in its mission  of reconciling the East and the West. The success of this  mission will depend on the capability of Russia to play a  constructive role in arranging new equal partnership relations  in the Eurasian space.</p>

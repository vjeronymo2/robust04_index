			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown 'achieves all goals' with Pounds 162.3m Hillsdown Holdings' profits bounced back in 1993 from the provision-hit Pounds 63.7m recorded in 1992 to Pounds 162.3m. The group used most of the Pounds 70.9m provision made in 1992 to cover its exit from abattoirs and property trading. Sir John Nott, chairman, said the group had achieved all its goals in 1993, although trading conditions had been increasingly competitive. He said there was no improvement in markets so far in the present year. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 6.6p for an unchanged total of 8.8p. Group sales were Pounds 4.6bn (Pounds 4.41bn), with those from continuing operations up 14 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn. Operating profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 199m (Pounds 165.4m), before a net interest charge of Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 30.8m). Earnings per share were 13.6p (losses 0.3p) or 12.5p (10.7p) before exceptionals. Five of the group's six divisions increased profits. The odd one out was beverages and biscuits, where a sharp drop in the first half was partly made up in the second to give operating profits of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 21.4m). Ambient and chilled foods made Pounds 37m (Pounds 36.4m) while meat and produce contributed Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 18.5m). Poultry profits jumped from Pounds 17m to Pounds 28.5m as rationalisation benefits came through. In Canada, Maple Leaf Foods made Pounds 62m (Pounds 53.4m) in spite of suffering meat imports from the US which will necessitate the closure of the Toronto plant at a cost of CDollars 50m (Pounds 25.5m) covered by a provision made when Hillsdown bought Canada Packers. Non-foods, furniture and housebuilding, made Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 25.8m). Capital expenditure was Pounds 98.8m, while Pounds 74.9m was spent on acquisitions, with Pounds 35.1m raised from disposals. Borrowings fell over the year from Pounds 313.5m to Pounds 291.7m, giving gearing of 34.5 per cent. COMMENT Hillsdown's shares fell 8p to 166p amid some criticism about the use of provisions. This was somewhat strange since provisions are made to be used, but Hillsdown must feel it can never get it right with the City. On an unchanged dividend for 1994, the yield is 6.6 per cent, which is a measure of the Hillsdown credibility gap. Much has already been done which deserves credit. Some almost intractable problems, like slaughtering, have been tackled, admittedly at considerable cost. And new financial controls are cutting into the working capital and overhead fat. In a sense, though, putting the business straight is the easy part of the job. The harder part will be to make Hillsdown grow, though that can be left for a couple of years yet. Profits in 1994 are likely to rise about Pounds 10m, to give a p/e of about 12. The yield should hold the shares up, even if it is a little early to hope for outperformance.</p>

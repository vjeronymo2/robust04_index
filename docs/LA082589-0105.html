			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kenyon to Rule on Lucky Merger: U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles  has scheduled a hearing Tuesday at which he will consider what size bond  California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp should be required to post to pursue  his case against American Stores' merger of Lucky and Alpha Beta. The matter  was left up to Kenyon by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who  this week granted Van de Kamp's request to continue the prohibition against the  supermarket chains' merger, on the condition that Van de Kamp post a bond. Last  month, Kenyon set bond at $16.3 million to cover any losses that American  Stores might incur during the appeal process. Since Van de Kamp challenged the  merger last September on antitrust grounds, American Stores has argued that  delays in integrating the chains have cost it about $1.5 million a week.  </P></p>

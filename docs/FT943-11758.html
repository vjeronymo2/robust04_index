			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel shares dive 8% Shares in Bethlehem Steel, one of the best-performing big company stocks in the US earlier this year, fell about 8 per cent to Dollars 20 3/4 by midday yesterday, as the company's second-quarter results failed to match expectations. After-tax income of Dollars 26m, or 14 cents a share, marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which the big steelmaker has been in profit, and compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 27 cents a share, a year ago. However, most analysts had predicted that stronger demand for steel from automotive manufacturers and the construction industry, together with a series of price increases in the past year, would push earnings per share in the quarter up to around 30 cents. The year-on-year improvement stemmed from 'higher realised steel prices and increased shipments,' the company said. Sales were 10 per cent higher than a year before, at Dollars 1.23bn. However, profit growth was held back by higher operating costs. The company blamed this in part on the need to buy in supplies of steel to feed its mills, and of coke to keep its furnaces running. The latter was needed because the coke oven in its Burns Harbour plant is being rebuilt. The company has also faced higher capital spending, which rose by more than three-quarters to Dollars 223m in the first half of the year and is projected to reach Dollars 450m for the year as a whole, up from Dollars 327m in 1993. Mr Curtis Barnette, chairman and chief executive, forecast continuing strong demand for steel 'through 1995'. For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 39m, compared with a loss of Dollars 54m a year before.</p>

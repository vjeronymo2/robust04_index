			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- Four independent lawmakers  announced Tuesday they have joined the United People's Party  (UPP), raising the number of UPP representatives in the National  Assembly from 12 to 16.    In a press conference at UPP headquarters, Reps. Yang  Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik and Kim Chin-yong said they  made the move in order to respond to the people's desire to see  a third political force emerge.    They claimed that since the inauguration of President Kim  Yong-sam, the nation has witnessed "wasteful politicking" in the  polarized political sector.    They vowed to realize a new form of politics by forming a  powerful third force and by liquidating the "two Kims era" and  regional hegemonism, referring to the domination of Kyongsang  Province by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party led by President  Kim Yong-sam and Cholla Province by the main opposition  Democratic Party once headed by Kim Tae-chung.    Rep. Chong Chu-il, who had been rumored to join the UPP, has  apparently decided against it as his aides informed reporters  that Chong had told them not to make any political announcements  while he is visiting the United States.    With the four new members, the United People's Party hopes  to  form a parliamentary negotiating group in the assembly, which  requires 20 or more lawmakers, by absorbing additional  independent lawmakers and merging with the New Political Reform  Party as announced earlier.    Rep. Kim Tong-kil, head of the UPP, said his party plans to  hold a national convention on June 29 and a convention of the  merged party to complete the merger process.</p>

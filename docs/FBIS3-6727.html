We cannot accept it." He then pointed out:  "Independent efforts by the private companies are necessary.  Even if we decide not to accept it, the United States will  accept our decision in its own way." As for the fact that  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, criticized the stand of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], which demands that  private industry draw up independent plans, the minister of  international trade and industry said, "The government is not  in the position of giving compulsory guidance to private  industry."</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EX-SCHOOL CHIEF NAMED TO HOSPITAL DISTRICT BOARD  </P> <P> James Riewer, a Redondo Beach resident and former superintendent of the South  Bay Union High School District, was appointed Friday to the board of the South  Bay Hospital District.  </P> <P> He was named to fill former board member Mary Davis' unexpired term, which runs  until November, 1992.  </P> <P> Davis, a board member since 1983, resigned in January. The district grants  money for public health programs in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan  Beach.  </P> <P> A hospital board member during the 1970s, Riewer was a compromise choice after  the board failed to break a deadlock between candidates Dick Fruin, a former  board member who was defeated for reelection in 1984 and failed in a 1986  attempt to return to the board, and Jeremy Evans, a former legal counsel to the  hospital district.  </P> <P> Riewer, who was appointed on a 4-0 vote, said the action "came as a complete  surprise. . . . It kind of tickles my funny bone." Currently a member of the  Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, he headed the high school  district from 1970 until retiring in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Oslo rally shows No camp's strength Opponents of Norwegian membership of the European Union yesterday organised a rally of some 25,000 people in Oslo, one of the country's largest ever political demonstrations. 'This shows the strength of the No side - people came from all over the country. If this support continues next week, we will win,' said Mrs Anne Enger Lahnstein, head of the main opposition Centre party and leader of the No campaign. Norway holds its national referendum on joining the Union next Monday. The No campaign, nervous that recent approval by neighbouring Finland and Sweden could help swing opinion, has been encouraged by waning support for EU membership following an earlier spurt after the Swedish Yes vote on November 13. Surveys at the weekend showed opinion stabilising after a five or six point surge by the Yes camp early last week. Two polls gave the No side 54 per cent compared to 46 per cent for the pro-EU campaign, after eliminating undecided voters, who still account for around 12 per cent of the electorate. Police estimated that 20,000-25,000 people attended the rally. Demonstrators carried signs which read 'Yes to Democracy, No to the EU'. The organisers chartered 300 buses and four trains to bring people from as far away as Finnmark in northern Norway. The No movement has also fielded seven prominent Norwegians opposed to EU membership. They included Mr Jens Heyerdahl, president and chief executive of Orkla, one of Norway's top five listed companies, which produces a wide-range of consumer goods and which is one of the country's biggest employers. Most senior business and industrial figures are strongly backing EU membership, saying it will benefit Norwegian companies. But Mr Heyerdahl said that competition from outside would damage local manufacturers and cost jobs. Finland's parliament finally ratified the October 16 referendum result in favour of EU membership at a session on Friday. The vote had been delayed by anti-EU members until after Sweden had voted in the hope that Swedish rejection would help them block Finnish accession. But the two-thirds majority for ratification was easily achieved.</p>

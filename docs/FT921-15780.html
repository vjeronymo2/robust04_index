			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Violence marks Russian Christmas VIOLENCE prompted by soaring food prices and fresh rumblings in the armed forces marked yesterday's first Russian Orthodox celebration of Christmas as an official holiday since the Bolshevik Revolution, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Tass news agency said people in the southern town of Stavropol smashed shop windows in anger at the explosion of prices triggered by the abrupt end of seven decades of price controls last week. Shops in the agricultural centre were forced to reduce their newly-liberated prices for meat and sausage. In Ukraine, the deputy chief of the Black Sea Fleet said the 300-ship force could not go along with an oath of allegiance demanded by the Ukrainian government. Admiral Ivan Kapitanets explained the fleet was part of the strategic forces which are supposed to remain under the unified command of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, has given servicemen until January 20 to decide whether to take the oath or go back to Russia. Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: Germany and Russia signed an agreement yesterday to allow up to 11,000 Russian contract workers to find jobs on the German labour market every year, as well as offering training for a further 2,000 young labourers and apprentices.</p>

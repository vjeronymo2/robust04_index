			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mahmud Sharif, minister of local </F> administration, by Majdi Abd-al-Ghani; place and date not given]    [Text] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    [Sharif] We should all believe that the defendant is  innocent  until he/she is condemned. The verdict is the right of the  appropriate court only. Personally, I say that local leaders are  honest and, on the whole, make those decisions that serve  citizens' interests and solve their problems. I appeal to my  colleagues in the press not to rush in making accusations until  all investigations are done and judges announce their verdict.    When dealing with building violations, we encounter numerous  and lengthy obstacles. In the latest governors' council meeting,  we decided to control these obstacles...and eliminate those  negative trends that put limitations on fighting obstacles.  These obstacles are:    First: As demolishing buildings is an administrative  resolution, it could only be resolved in administrative courts.  In the past, those committing building violations could file  complaints in different kinds of courts in order to be  acquitted. This process delayed the decision to execute  demolition resolutions.    As the phrase "security does not permit" was an obstacle  that  governors and district heads faced and which stopped the  demolition of buildings for years, I made an agreement with the  minister of interior to the effect that this phrase no longer be  used with regard to building violations that have to be reviewed  by security personnel before they execute their demolition.  Major General Hasan al-Alfi, minister of interior, promised  that, starting at the present time, this phrase would no longer  be used as an obstacle.    Moreover, building violations will be changed from  violations  to felonies that would be punishable by law. This means that  culprits, besides paying fines, will receive prison sentences.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Where were the local councils during the past  years when buildings were being erected? How is it that those  councils have now reappeared demanding--with raised  voices--quick trials for district heads and district engineers?    [Sharif] True, local councils are considered the primary  instruments for the supervision of district heads' resolutions  and any permits issued or actions executed by district offices  which effect the people. Local councils should have spoken up,  posed questions, and investigated building violations, because  these councils hold monthly conferences with district heads and  question them about every big issue as well as every detail  related to all matters that concern the district. The councils  should have completely performed their duty with regard to these  issues.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Does this mean that the Local Councils Law  will be changed?    [Sharif] Yes. We will consider seriously the idea that the  members of local councils take part in both inspection patrols,  together with district engineers, in order to detect building  violations, and in reporting these violations. Therefore, local  councils would be carrying full responsibility with regard to  building violations, and subsequently, for the people's benefit,  will play a role in fighting corruption and negligence.    [Abd-al-Ghani] What are the bases for nominating local  leaders? How could this nomination be regularly supervised and  monitored?    [Sharif] In order to nominate local leaders, we have started  resorting to press ads, in which we allow all government  officers who have reached either grade-level one, or the  grade-level of general director, who wish to be promoted to the  grade-level of under-secretary, to apply for posts of local  leaders. I attend, in person, the interviews of applicants.  Those who are selected are required to attend a course in local  administration and then do some field research. The candidate is  then given a trial period before he/she resumes the leadership  post. Subsequently, all through the period when the candidate is  in office, he/she is placed under our daily supervision and  monitoring in order to assess his/her adaptability with regard  to decisionmaking.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Why are local leaders left in their posts for  long periods? Because of their many acquaintances across the  years, when they have to find solutions for peoples' problems or  attend to peoples' interests, are they not subjected to  embarrassment?    [Sharif] A resolution has been issued that does not allow  any  local leaders, however successful they may have been and though  they may have had many achievements, to remain in office more  than five years. This is so that this local leadership would not  feel embarrassed when dealing with problems and interests of  those acquaintances whom it might have known for a long time.  Another reason for this resolution is to renew the leadership,  in action and in thought, at the local district level.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Some hypocrites address the governor as: "Mr.  Minister Governor." Similarly, some media personnel in the  governorate write big sign-posts that are placed on the  Governor's desk having as a title: "The Minister Governor."  Which of these is right and which is wrong?!    [Sharif] A governor should not be addressed as "Mr. Minister  Governor." The financial status of a governor is the same as  that of a minister. However, this fact does not mean that a  governor should be addressed by the title "minister." Therefore,  governors should not allow anyone to address them by this title,  because this kind of address reflects flattery and hypocrisy.  Personally, I do not allow that. All the ministry's  correspondence with governors does not include this title.  Governors should observe this regulation and put it into effect  immediately.    [Abd-al-Ghani] How powerful is a governor's endorsement? I  pose this question because citizens believe that this  endorsement is the right path to heaven!    [Sharif] A governor's endorsement is one that gives the okay  for execution; it is completely valid. However, a governor  endorses only those documents that he is empowered to endorse.  For example, according to local government regulations, a  governor has the right to allot a percentage of public housing  at his discretion. However, a governor would first endorse the  allotment of houses for the rest of the cases before he endorses  allotments for any special cases.  <H5>  No to the Oral! </H5>   [Abd-al-Ghani] What about an oral endorsement that a  governor  gives to his subordinates either over the telephone or by  meeting with them?    [Sharif] On the one hand, an oral endorsement is sound and  needs quick action if it is given for the general benefit, such  as when the governor gives oral instructions or gives those  instructions over the telephone in order to repair a damaged  road or a burst water pipe. On the other hand, the endorsement  is unsound if it is given by an employee, and the governor does  not carry responsibility for it; this latter case would be  unsound according to the work plan and its legal and sound  venues. In addition, in case the endorsement carries any  responsibility, the governor must endorse it instantly.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Because some previous district heads made  some  mistakes, a big number of current district heads have started to  refer documents that need endorsement to the legal department  for getting their view in fear of making the same mistakes made  by their predessecors. What do you think is the solution?    [Sharif] I do not deny this truth. However, the local  leadership should have confidence in its resolutions--and in its  honesty. This state of affairs has delayed the issuing of  building permits; currently, this delay has been overcome.  Self-confidence and confidence in one's country provide district  heads with complete validity to make the right decisions.    [Abd-al-Ghani] Has the cleaning organization for Cairo and  al-Gizah achieved its goals?    [Sharif] Yes. Since the state provided equipment worth 3  billion pounds, the cleaning organization for Cairo and al-Gizah  has achieved its goal. Private cleaning (the private sector) has  a good future in this activity. Resolutions will be issued to  encourage such companies. Shortly, the door will be opened for  private sector companies to contribute to other aspects of  public services such as garbadge collection, its sorting, and  classification.    [Abd-al-Ghani] In case a citizen fails to get what he/she is  entitled to get from either the district head or the engineers,  what does the citizen do and to whom does he/she have recourse?    [Sharif] Currently, I do not believe that this situation  will  occur because, the law is clear and provides every citizen with  his/her entitlement. However, should this situation occur, the  Governor's office is opened; governors hold weekly conferences  with citizens. No citizen will find any difficulty in solving  his/her problems.</p>

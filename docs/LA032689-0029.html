			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER NOMINATION  </P> <P> I nominate "Rain Man's" producers and studio (United Artists) for best  non-supporting performance of the year.  </P> <P> The movie is about an autistic man. Great. And a big Beverly Hills benefit  premiere was held. Wonderful; but wait: In an insensitive move, the premiere  proceeds, more than $250,000, were given not to one of the severely underfunded  efforts to unlock the mystery of autism but to a unrelated charity.  </P> <P> Obviously, nobody involved with the benefit recognized the irony or, if they  did, they didn't care enough to correct it.  </P></p>

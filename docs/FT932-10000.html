			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Marzotto 8% sales fall disappoints MARZOTTO, Italy's second-biggest clothing and textiles group which controls Germany's Hugo Boss, yesterday deflated expectations of soaring exports on the back of lira weakness. Mr Pietro Marzotto, chairman, said first-quarter sales in 1993, adjusted for currency movements, had fallen by about 8 per cent. Unadjusted turnover rose by 4.7 per cent to L601bn (Dollars 411m). The fact that volumes have fallen at a leading exporter in one of Italy's most competitive sectors will disappoint analysts forecasting an export-led boom in corporate earnings this year. Mr Marzotto said demand for textiles and clothing remained depressed. Although first-quarter group sales had been swollen by the lower lira, notably against the D-Mark - swelling Hugo Boss revenues in lira terms  - market conditions remained 'very difficult'. In D-Mark terms, Hugo Boss sales had fallen by 2.7 per cent, he said. The gloomy outlook came against virtually static group earnings for Marzotto in 1992, the first year in which Hugo Boss has been fully consolidated. Net profits were L40.1bn against L39.8bn,while group sales, swollen by the acquisition, jumped to L1,952bn from L1,280bn. Adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, sales fell 2.4 per cent last year. Mr Marzotto gave no earnings forecasts for 1993, but said sales should approach L2,000bn. Parent-company results differed markedly, reflecting the full impact of financing charges for the takeover and write-downs on the Hugo Boss stake. The parent company lost L44.7bn, compared with net profits of L25.2bn in 1991. Interest payments rose L12bn to L39.4bn, while a L79bn write-down was made on the Hugo Boss stake. However, Marzotto is maintaining its dividend at L280 per ordinary share. Mr Marzotto defended the Boss takeover, which has greatly broadened the group's international exposure and reduced its dependence on textiles and threads. After the purchase, clothing accounted for almost 66 per cent of Marzotto sales, compared with 47.6 per cent in 1991. The group, which bought 63.8 per cent of Boss's ordinary shares in late 1991, and has an option on a further 13.8 per cent, has been increasing its stake by buying further Boss shares. Marzotto's stake in Boss's total share capital rose to 41 per cent at the end of last year from 32.5 per cent and now stands at 43.3 per cent.</p>

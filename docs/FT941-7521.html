			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK banks aim to sell off a third of their 3i stake The UK's high street banks are aiming to sell about one third of the shares they own in 3i, Europe's largest supplier of venture capital to unquoted companies, the group has confirmed. Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive, estimated yesterday that the sale would raise between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. 3i is expected to produce a pathfinder prospectus before its preliminary results are published in early June, ahead of a summer flotation. The group said the impetus came from the active shareholders - the four UK high street banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland - and not from the other shareholder, the Bank of England. Two years ago 3i postponed a flotation after disagreement among the shareholders over the value of their investments. Since then, 3i's value has risen and the discounts at which venture capital investment trusts are trading to their net asset values have fallen to historically low levels. The move was greeted with mixed feelings within the venture capital industry. Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director of Electra, the investment trust, welcomed the news. 'It will be a FT-SE 100 stock which people will have to hold in their portfolios,' he said. 'We are always happy that more people should understand what we are trying to do.' However, some smaller venture capital providers, which compete more directly with 3i in providing equity and finance packages, recognise their access to capital may be squeezed. Some fund managers say institutions may choose to take an exposure to the unquoted sector through an investment in 3i rather than through an investment in a relatively small venture capital fund. Mr Macpherson dismissed the argument that 3i's shareholders would be selling at the top of the market. 'It is rather like buying a house. Good houses just don't come along that often,' he said. Since 3i last raised funds from its shareholders in 1986, its shareholders' funds have risen by more than 15 times. Baring Brothers is adviser to the flotation. Details, Page 28</p>

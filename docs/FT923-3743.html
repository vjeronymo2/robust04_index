			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: AMP arm refinances debt AMP Asset Management, the fund management arm of AMP, the Australian insurer has refinanced its short-term debt through a Pounds 290m syndicated loan, one of the largest such loans this year. The deal, arranged solely by Fuji Bank, will refinance equivalent borrowings raised in 1989 to buy Pearl Assurance, the UK insurer. The borrowings are on behalf of AMP UK. The transaction consists of a Pounds 140m revolving credit facility and a Pounds 150m 364-day commercial paper facility. It is priced to yield 20 basis points over London interbank offered rates (Libor) and there is a 10 basis point annual commitment fee. AMP will issue up to Pounds 300m of sterling commercial paper using the loan as a backstop credit facility and the securities are expected to carry credit ratings of A1-plus/P1. NatWest Capital Markets will act as lead dealer.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE SALE DISCUSSED FOR MONTHS, PLANT WORKERS SAY  </P> <P> As Ford Motor Co. officials remained mum on reports that a sale of its defense  division is in the works, employees at the firm's Newport Beach plant said  Saturday there has been widespread talk of a sale for months.  </P> <P> The Times reported Saturday that Ford Motor Co. is preparing to put its  aerospace division up for sale and that Ford's board of directors would  consider the move as early as this week.  </P> <P> Reports of a possible sale come at a time of thawing tensions between the  United States and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shrinking Pentagon  budgets and uncertainty over the future of the defense industry.  </P> <P> "It isn't only this 'I love Gorby stuff,' " said a gray-bearded 57-year-old  technician as he left the sprawling 2,700-employee Ford Aerospace Corp. plant  Saturday morning. "Anyone with half a brain knew that things were starting to  change.  </P> <P> "Contracts have been harder and harder to get," said the technician, who asked  not to be identified. "Competition was the name of the game, and we were  getting beat."  </P> <P> But Ford Aerospace officials continued to downplay reports of a pending sale of  the Newport Beach-based company, which employs 17,000 worldwide and 10,000 in  California.  </P> <P> "There are rumors now and there have been rumors about this kind of thing  before," said Susan M. Pearce, Ford Aerospace's vice president of public  affairs.  </P> <P> "The company is doing well, certainly in the context of the industry  situation," Pearce said. "We have a significant (order) backlog. We've won some  major contracts in the past year."  </P> <P> Some industry analysts said the sale would follow a recent trend among large  conglomerates to sell off small defense businesses now that the Cold War is  winding down. Chrysler Corp., for example, recently sold its defense division,  Chrysler Technologies.  </P> <P> "When you have a downturn in military spending, as we do now, these companies  just don't want to put their money into the defense business," said Paul  Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Bache Research. "I can understand an auto  company saying, 'We can get a better return on investment.' "  </P> <P> One sign that Ford may be shifting from defense to focus more heavily on its  bread-and-butter business is its $2.5-billion purchase of Jaguar, the British  auto maker, in November, some analysts said.  </P> <P> Analysts suggested that several major aerospace companies may be interested in  purchasing Ford Aerospace. Among the potential buyers are Martin Marietta,  Rockwell International, Boeing Co. and General Dynamics, analysts said.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace has had a major presence in Orange County for three decades. In  1960, Philco-Ford, a division of Ford Motor, moved its defense operation from  Glendale to a 200-acre site in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Today, Ford Aerospace is best known as a manufacturer of missiles,  electro-optics systems and satellites, with annual sales of about $2 billion.  </P> <P> In recent years, Ford Aerospace has had its share of successes -- and setbacks.  </P> <P> In September, NASA awarded Ford Aerospace a $500-million contract to upgrade  the Mission Control facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston for space  shuttle flights. And last month, the company won an additional $150-million  contract for work at the space center.  </P> <P> The awards helped soften the blow of Ford Aerospace's unsuccessful bid to win a  $3-billion contract to build a portable, bazooka-type weapon for the Army a  year ago.  </P> <P> Three years earlier, Ford suffered a bigger embarrassment with the cancellation  of a multibillion dollar Army contract to build the controversial anti-aircraft  gun known as the Sgt. York.  </P> <P> Despite spending nearly $1.5 billion on the Sgt. York, the Pentagon abruptedly  dropped the program in August, 1985, after critics charged that the weapon was  unreliable. The cancellation forced Ford Aerospace to lay off 1,200 workers  locally.  </P> <P> The Sgt. York debacle is still fresh in the minds of many longtime workers at  the Newport Beach plant.  </P></p>

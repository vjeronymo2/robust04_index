			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>   [Excerpt] At the end of the First World Telecommunications  Development Conference (WTDC/94) on 29 March, Brazil will sign a  letter of principles on the expansion of international  communications services. The Brazilian delegation that will  attend the conference will be headed by Communications Minister  Djalma de Moraes. Moraes, however, will not be present at the  WTDC/94 opening ceremony on 21 March.    The conference will be opened by Argentine President Carlos  Menem at the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires. During the  ceremony, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and ITU [International  Telecommunications Union] Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne will  deliver speeches. The conference's goal is to develop an overall  strategy for telecommunications development for the year 2000.    The letter of principles, which already has been approved at  the technical level by 183 member countries, is one of the ITU  projects for the future. The ITU is a specialized UN agency that  already has formed an international working group that deals  with the reformulation of the international frequencies chart.  Diplomat Flavio Sapha -- head of the communications minister's  office -- reported that another of ITU's concerns is to organize  the frequencies chart for cellular and satellite communications.  He will leave for Buenos Aires this weekend accompanying the  delegation comprised of Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications,  Inc.] President Adyr da Silva and members of the Foreign  Ministry's Division for Transportation, Communications, and  Services.    The Buenos Aires meeting will be in preparation for the  Kyoto  (Japan) plenipotentiary conference to be held in September.  Brazilian entrepreneurs, including members of the Alcatel and  Motorola companies, also will attend the Buenos Aires meeting,  but only as observers, Sapha said. [passage omitted]</p>

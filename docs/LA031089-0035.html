			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> New York newcomer Alfonse Pagano debuts in Los Angeles with inoffensively  decorative works that combine canvas painting, sculpture and ideas from  collage. He begins with oil on linen canvases painted with gestural royal  blues, salmon pinks, rusts and grayed or acid teals frothed up and layered to  look like New York School abstraction at its most light handed and romantic. To  these canvases Pagano adds clusters of narrow, foot-long lengths of wood (like  those scraps you use for stirring paint), their edges jagged as if cut to size  with a quick blow over someone's knee. Painted in the same style and hues as  the two-dimensional canvas grounds, the wood embellishments have an engaging  way of both merging with flat forms and standing away as independent sculptural  components.  </P> <P> Whether scattered on works like 3-D versions of all-over gesture ("Rush to  Relics") or bundled at one side of canvases like wheat sheaths tied and ready  for market ("Spent Time Wasted Time"), Pagano's wood (and occasional barbed  wire and copper) accents serve expressive and formal ends. In "Heros," wood  takes the form of vaguely anthropomorphic cutouts mounted some distance from  the slapdash canvas field and coiled in thin metal tubing to suggest fettered  bodies or a literal shape overrunning the surface only to be contained by line.  Initially Pagano's high-relief metallic looking finishes, colliding bits of  rough-hewn wood, encaustic, copper and barbed wire concoctions look like  distant cousins of junk sculpture, but they're too prettified and tamely  wistful to be industrial art.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Army Chief General Humberto Ortega said he is  willing to show the national and international public that the  death of young Jean Paul Genie is being used in an effort to mar  Ortega's image and that of the Army. Gen. Ortega said that the  fact that he responded to a summons to testify at the Judge  Advocate's Office shows respect for the law and an interest in  the thorough clarification of the case.    [Begin Ortega recording] An effort is being made to tarnish  my image and that of the Army by taking this case to the OAS  International Court. They are trying to see how they can do  something (?adverse). On the contrary, the law is being  respected in this case. We are complying with the law.    The Genie case first went to the civil courts, then it was  sent -- as the law stipulates in Nicaragua -- to the Judge  Advocate's Office. The case was then passed on to the Supreme  Court of Justice, which confirmed the civil judge's ruling that  the case should be reviewed by the judge advocate. So I am here  today, and my presence is evidence of the fact that we are  responsibly complying with Nicaraguan law. I think that is what  is most important. It has also allowed us to ratify our  commitment to the Army in the public letter I signed. The  letter clearly stated my position on the fact that this case has  been politicized. The goals being pursued have nothing to do  empathy for the Genie family. It is really an effort to use the  family's sorrow to harm the Army and to mar our image. [end  recording]</p>

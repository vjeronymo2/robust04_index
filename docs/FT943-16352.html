			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Fraudbusters' unsure future - Robert Rice on the possible merger of two UK prosecution organisations Six years after the UK's Serious Fraud Office was set up to tackle serious and complex fraud, its future is in the balance. A government review has recommended the merger of the SFO and the Fraud Investigation Group (Fig) of the Crown Prosecution Service. No decision will be taken until feasibility studies into whether the SFO and CPS should become executive agencies, outside the civil service, have been completed. Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, will then decide whether the SFO should be expanded to incorporate Fig, or whether the merged body should be placed under the control of the Crown Prosecution Service. His decision will determine whether responsibility for the fraudbusters should remain with Mr George Staple, current director of the SFO, or pass to Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions and Mr Staple's predecessor. The review, chaired by Mr John Graham, a Treasury official, and published last week, favoured subsuming the SFO into the CPS. If the government opted for that solution, it would raise questions about why the SFO was established as a separate body in the first place. Mr Paul Phippen, a fraud lawyer at City solicitors Macfarlanes, pointed out the SFO had been set up as a discrete office because Fig was considered incapable of providing the specialist service required. But a number of high-profile failures by the SFO, such as in the Blue Arrow, Levitt and Nadir cases, means many lawyers now believe Fig is doing the better job. The review, which was set up to investigate the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the two organisations, carried out a comparative study. The SFO and Fig have different powers and approaches to combating fraud: the SFO was set up to investigate and prosecute serious fraud; Fig advises the police on investigations and handles subsequent prosecutions. Both deal with complex or serious fraud, although the SFO handles only cases involving at least Pounds 5m. The SFO's budget for the current year is Pounds 21m and it employs 21 lawyers. Fig has a budget of Pounds 10m and employs 30 lawyers. At the end of November last year, the SFO had 51 cases on its books and Fig had 450. However, more than 40 per cent of Fig's case load was not considered serious or complex by the group's own lawyers, and the review concluded that such work should be devolved to the CPS. The review also found considerable overlap in the work of the two bodies - so much so that it said it was anomalous to apply such different methods to what in many instances were similar cases. This similarity has increased in recent months, as the SFO's case load has declined and it has taken on smaller cases that it might otherwise leave to Fig. The Maxwell prosecution is the only large case now on the SFO's books. The review warned that, unless this issue was addressed quickly, the SFO would have increasing spare capacity. The review found scope for improvements in management information and case management systems. Fig had few useful systems in place, while the effectiveness of the SFO's systems was not being fully exploited. Some SFO investigative work had been undermined by the absence of clearly defined responsibilities for the investigation. In both organisations, there was no formal management overview of important prosecution decisions, and in the SFO no overview of vital investigation decisions. The SFO's powers under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 to compel those under investigation to answer questions, removing the right to silence, had proved effective, said the review, and should be extended to the police and to Fig. It also noted the SFO had expressed concern about the lack of effective control over the police officers seconded to work on cases, and endorsed a review of current arrangements between the police and the SFO. Both organisations needed to make better use of outside barristers to improve efficiency. They could make greater use of in-house lawyers for pre-trial work, and generally bring in counsel to advise at a later stage than at present. Overall, the lack of consistent comparative data about case loads, costs and results meant the review was unable to draw firm conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of either body's approach. However, the available evidence suggested that, although the SFO dealt with the largest and most complex cases, its superior resources and section 2 powers had not produced a consistently better conviction rate than Fig. The review recommended short-term improvements in management and organisation, and in the longer term a merger of the two bodies. In spite of its finding that section 2 powers had not improved the SFO's success rate, the review said the chief advantage of merger would be the extension of these powers to all serious fraud cases. Establishing the new body under the SFO could be done immediately, but subsuming the SFO into the CPS would require primary legislation, which would be impossible until 1996. Nevertheless, the review team felt that placing the SFO within the CPS would offer most benefits. These included the support structure in the CPS, reduced administrative costs and greater ability to vary resources to meet changes in case load. It recognised, however, that establishing a new body with an investigative role as part of the CPS would be a big departure from present policy. The new body would need to be 'ring-fenced' in a separate group within the CPS to prevent any further extension of such powers to the prosecution of other crimes. Do these recommendations provide the answer to the present difficulties of the SFO? Most fraud lawyers are sceptical. Mr Phippen said he could not see them making any difference to the issue of how to prosecute substantial frauds efficiently and cost-effectively. 'If I was very cynical, I would say it was a way of getting rid of the SFO 'tag', which has been an obvious target for poor publicity,' he said. Mr John Clitheroe, senior partner of Kingsley Napley, said the proposals might produce efficiency improvements, but he was alarmed by the proposal to give section 2 powers to the police. 'I think that would be a very material step in the wrong direction,' he said. The original purpose of the section 2 powers was to enable the SFO to obtain information on the background to a case. They are very different from the procedures followed by the police under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes, which had been designed to ensure fairness in interrogations, he said. 'I fear this is part of the seemingly inevitable process of diminishing the protections given to the citizen in criminal investigations,' he said. 'It would establish a momentum towards compulsory interrogation as a matter of course. The police will say: 'Why can't we have section 2 powers?' I would have thought the dangers of that have been amply demonstrated by the miscarriages of justice we have seen over the past 20 years.' Whatever happens to the SFO, the real question is whether it will make any material difference to the battle against serious fraud. Lawyers remain unconvinced. Much may depend on the outcome of the Maxwell trial this autumn.</p>

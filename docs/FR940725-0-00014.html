			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 723 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inspections that were previously required by AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, and retained in this AD, take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910, or $770 per airplane, per inspection cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional new inspections that are required by this AD will take approximately 82 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825,330, or $4,510 per airplane, per inspection cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The modification required by this AD will take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,248,060, or $6,820 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,214,300, or $11,407 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the modification will require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 20,000-landings compliance time specified in paragraph (j) of this AD should allow ample time for the modification of all countersunk fasteners locations to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

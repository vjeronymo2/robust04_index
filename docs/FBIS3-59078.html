			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adelino Cunha: "Less Demogoguery Without </F> Federalism"]    [Text] In the campaign for the European elections, social  democratic candidates wish to teach the Portuguese people what  the European Union really is, demystify the role of the European  Parliament and strengthen the idea that Europe is not just a  faucet that drips money. As our newspaper has ascertained from  Social Democratic Party (PSD) "European" strategists, federalism  is an issue that will be clarified within the context of  European construction to explain to the electorate that "what  exists is a mixture of federalism, confederalism and  intergovernmentability." Thus PSD deputies will tell the  Portuguese people that if elected, they will fight for "this  dosage never to be exceeded so that small countries will not be  jeopardized. We cannot let Europe slide into a model with  excessively federal characteristics."  <H5>  Thinking of Money </H5>   "Even while defending socioeconomic cohesion and the grant  of  structural funds to poor countries, the PSD must tell the  electorate very clearly that Europe is not only money," party  sources told our newspaper. "European" social democratic  deputies believe that it is bad strategy to "`beckon' the voters  over with money." In other words, "as the funds are already  guaranteed, the party must (re)introduce issues such as  subsidiarity and the role of the European Parliament."    On this last issue, the governing party wishes to prevent  the  opposition from making unfulfillable promises, "since  Eurodeputies can only emit opinions, which are just that,"  according to a PSD official.    Meanwhile, there is little probability that even with the  talk about subsidiarity, the fields of competence of the  European Parliament, the flow of money into Portugal and the  federalism that the PSD rejects, social democratic candidates  will succeed in significantly propagating the party's message.  That is why, "within the context of our enlightenment task, we  must say clearly that we are the best, providing concrete  examples of what we have done," a party member located in  Strasbourg told our newspaper. This is how the PSD hopes to  "see" stars in the sky.</p>

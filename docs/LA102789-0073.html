The 32.08-carat  ring came from the collection of the late Count and Countess Guy du Boisrouvray  of France. The jewelry sale totaled $31.2 million, an auction record for any  single-owner sale of jewelry in the United States, a Sotheby's spokeswoman  said. Worldwide, the record is second only to the 1987 sale of the Duchess of  Windsor's jewels, she said.  </P></p>

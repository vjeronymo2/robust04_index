			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 16, RIA -- "The situation on the  peninsula in general is quiet and business-like," Pyotr  Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser on military  questions, told RIA in a telephone talk. The Crimeans, he said,  follow their President Yuriy Meshkov's stay in Switzerland as he  attends the Crano-Montana forum dealing with trade between West  and East. The Crimeans' interest in this forum is quite  understandable as one of its plenary sessions will discuss the  theme "the security of the Black Sea and the future of the  Crimea".    In the words of the adviser, Ukrainian Speaker Aleksandr  Moroz is arriving today in the Crimea. Meshkov's adviser says  he is expected to participate in the plenary session of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Major refuses to meet BCCI victims MR JOHN MAJOR has refused to meet staff and depositors from the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Ralph Atkins writes. The prime minister said it would 'raise false expectations' about the extent to which the government could help to win an improved compensation package. He said in a letter to Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, that it would be 'quite wrong' to give the impression that the government could do more to help victims of the bank's collapse. Winding-up proceedings against BCCI were adjourned last month until January 14 to give provisional liquidators more time to negotiate a deal with Abu Dhabi on behalf of creditors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Geneva, March 29 (AFP) -- The Uruguay Round of  trade negotiations under GATT will produce a higher than  expected global tariff reduction of 40 percent for traded goods,  trade diplomats said here Tuesday [29 March].    This is seven percentage points in excess of the initial  objective of 33 percent for tariff cutting under the  seven-year-old negotiations, to be finalized in two weeks by a  GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial  conference at Marrakesh, Morocco.    The 40 percent overall reduction in customs duties will be  formally announced in a draft declaration to be adopted by  ministers from about 120 countries at Marrakesh.    Trade negotiators here said the tariff-cutting excercise was  completed when a number of countries tabled their final market  access offers here on Monday after intensive bilateral talks  since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round was adopted here last  December 15.

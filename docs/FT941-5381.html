			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Observer: Fair winds Bo Goranson is a businessman hoping to prove that running a yacht isn't necessarily an expensive hobby. His Intrum Justitia debt collection group is sponsoring a yacht in the Whitbread round-the-world race, which started last September. The company thinks sponsorship pays; it reckons its Pounds 3m sponsorship has recouped about Pounds 13m of free media coverage. Goranson, 56, who owns 30.9 per cent of the company, which is reporting annual results today - with profits expected to be lower than market expectations - hasn't done as well as he might. Its shares stood at 90p before the competition started, reached a high of 129p, but have fallen back to 116p.</p>

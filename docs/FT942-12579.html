			<p>940429 FT  29 APR 94 / Paris shaves interest rates The Bank of France yesterday took a further cautious step in its policy of gradually lowering interest rates, shaving its intervention rate, the key short term official interest rate, by ten basis points to 5.7 per cent. The move was the second reduction within a week and reflects the central bank's strategy of reducing borrowing costs in line with Germany. On Wednesday, the Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by 11 basis points to 5.47 per cent. Yesterday's lowering of the French discount rate was the fifth this year. All of the reductions have been of 0.1 of a percentage point. The French currency took yesterday's move in its stride, strengthening slightly to trade at FFr3.429 to the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Thin trading distorts market VERY thin trading lent an air of unreality to foreign exchange markets yesterday. The dollar was weak for much of the day in spite of more positive economic data and sterling was strong with little to sustain it, writes Peter John. Dollar enthusiasts must be wondering what the US has to do to inject life into the currency. Almost every day has seen a new release of encouraging US data and yet the dollar has failed to respond. Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Managers said the outlook for US Christmas retail sales was brighter than at any time since 1989. In the NAPM's semi-annual economic outlook, 36 per cent of the 300 firms surveyed said they expected sales to be good, compared to 10 per cent who expected them to be poor, an exact reverse of last year. Nevertheless, the dollar extended Monday's three-pfennig slide opening mildly softer against most significant currencies. Dealers who had been long for some time liquidated their positions in order to balance the books for the year end. The moves were exacerbated because some smaller houses have already stopped trading for the year and the market is exceptionally tight. There was also a belief that some central banks were selling dollars to buy D-Marks, which they will need to repay the short-term refinancing provided by the Bundesbank around Black Wednesday. The dollar eased to DM1.5570 against DM1.5685 previously and fell against the pound to Dollars 1.5970 against Dollars 1.5875 and against the Yen to Y123.95 from Y124.40. Sterling was the subject of opposite pressures. Many dealers who had left themselves short following the financial swings in mid-September have been buying back the pound. One economist said there was no fundamental incentive as the UK economy was still in recession, the deficit was about to reach 'horrible proportions' and the current account was deteriorating. He predicted that when the end of year distortions were removed the pound would fall back. The pound was a further half pfennig stronger around midday but it flinched at the DM2.50 barrier and closed only marginally stronger against the German currency at DM2.4900. Pressures on the franc returned but, once again, technical position-taking was seen as the motor. The slide to FFr3.410 against the D-Mark from FFr3.408 was not backed by any significant volume and not seen as a cause for concern. The Guilder was very firm against the D-Mark and many dealers were looking for a rate cut. However, the Dutch central bank said in the afternoon that it was maintaining its advances rate at 8.7 per cent. The Swiss franc closed stronger against the German currency returning to trade within the ERM range following several days of nervousness because of Switzerland's rejection of the European Economic Area.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Rolls-Royce 'viable' with sales of 1,500 cars a year Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are unlikely to exceed 1,500 a year - compared with a peak of 3,333 in 1990 - 'for the foreseeable future', according to Mr Michael Donovan, commercial managing director of the Vickers-owned luxury car maker. But with the company's break-even output, including substantial provision for research and development, down to 1,300, it is viable, Mr Donovan said. The prediction made in the summer by Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, that Rolls-Royce would return to profitability this year - after running up total pre-tax losses of Pounds 110m in 1991 and 1992 - is being borne out by the level of year-end sales, Mr Donovan said. The company last made a profit, of Pounds 32m, in 1990. He disclosed that Rolls-Royce's financial performance was being boosted strongly by the unexpected success of the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental coupe model, which is said to account for 20 per cent of output. The company's 'standard' model, the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, sells for about Pounds 100,000. Sir Colin has said that in the long term Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would need to find some form of partnership to develop a new generation of models. Mr Donovan said it was possible that future model developments would be achieved through a number of partnership projects. He indicated that, in the longer term, the company could make wider use of aluminium, new lightweight steels and possibly even diesel engines to accommodate energy and environmental concerns. Given the pace of diesel engine development, 'one should never say never when it comes to one being fitted to Rolls-Royce'.</p>

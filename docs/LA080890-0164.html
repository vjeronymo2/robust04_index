			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'MISS SAIGON' CANCELED ON ROAD TO BROADWAY;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE DECISION FOLLOWS A UNION RULING AGAINST CASTING A WHITE STAR IN AN  ASIAN ROLE.  </P> <P> The Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" was canceled today after Actors Equity  refused to allow a white British actor to play the role of a Eurasian in the  musical.  </P> <P> "The debate is no longer about the casting of 'Miss Saigon' but the art of  acting itself," producer Cameron Mackintosh said in a statement issued on  behalf of the creative team for the hit London musical.  </P> <P> The show, scheduled to open in March at the Broadway Theater, had advance sales  of more than $25 million, the largest in Broadway history. The money,  Mackintosh said, will be refunded.  </P> <P> Bowing to pressure from Asian groups, Actors Equity on Tuesday rejected the  application of British actor Jonathan Pryce, denying him the chance to repeat  his award-winning London performance as a brothel owner.  </P> <P> "The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an affront to the  Asian community," said Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive secretary.  </P> <P> "The casting choice is especially disturbing when the casting of an Asian actor  in this role would be an important and significant opportunity to break the  usual pattern of casting Asians in minor roles."  </P> <P> The union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on Broadway and must  give its approval to actors from foreign countries who appear there, except for  British "stars." But the definition of "star" is hazy.  </P> <P> "We did not deal with the issue of whether this man is a star or not,"  Eisenberg said.  </P> <P> Mackintosh said he would not take the matter to arbitration, a process that  Equity suggested Tuesday might be the next step.  </P> <P> Mackintosh and other producers have argued that the ban is an infringement on  their right to choose the performers they want.  </P> <P> "When my production team cast the noted black actor Robert Guillaume to replace  Michael Crawford as the Phantom in the Los Angeles company of 'Phantom of the  Opera,' we did so purely on the grounds of talent and suitability," Mackintosh  said last week.  </P> <P> "Ironically, in the current Broadway production of 'Phantom' we have an  Amerasian actor of tremendous ability playing the lead role of the Vicomte de  Chagny. Why is it quite proper for him to play a European aristocrat and not  for Jonathan Pryce to play a Eurasian?"  </P> <P> Robert Stigwood, who produced the musical "Evita," said in a letter to Equity  earlier this week that he is casting the film version of the show.  </P> <P> "Does the view of Actors Equity concerning ethnic casting preclude my  consideration of an American-Italian female star (Madonna) to play the title  role?" he asked. "Will I incur the wrath and condemnation of Actors Equity for  casting a non-Hispanic in the role of Che?"  </P> <P> Eisenberg said the union's decision was made "in full awareness that many jobs  may be lost to actors of Asian background" if "Miss Saigon" were canceled.  </P></p>

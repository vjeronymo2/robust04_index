			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Trade unions and farmers in interest rate protest Trade unionists, farmers and consumer groups yesterday protested over rising interest rates in a rally on the steps of the Federal Reserve building in Washington, writes Nancy Dunne. A further rate rise would 'clobber job prospects, squeeze wages, and raise mortgages and other loan payments for millions of Americans,' a rally leaflet said. Concern over interest rates is shared by some businessmen and economists who believe the Fed and bond market have not taken account of the competitive conditions in the global economy which curb inflation. At a briefing last week sponsored by two Washington think-tanks - the Economic Strategy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute - a panel of economists and businessmen attacked what has been the fastest tightening of interest rates since the second world war. Mr Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said a majority of chief executive officers in NAM opposed further interest rate rises at present.

President Mubarak also listened to a large number of  intellectuals, thinkers, and opinion makers about their concepts  of these problems and issues, both at the internal and external  policy levels. They also discussed the cultural challenge under  peace, the national dialogue, and the various problems facing  books and the theater. The president emphasized a number of  issues and principles during this dialogue.    President Mubarak also stressed his pledge to respect the  law  and Constitution without resorting to any emergency measure in  the confrontation with terrorism, even though that means that it  might take longer to eliminate terrorism.    The information minister added that President Mubarak also  stressed that corruption is not being covered up, saying that  every such case is referred to the courts for investigation. He  said that not a single case of corruption is covered up by the  state; on the contrary, the government has always taken the  initiative in following up and exposing such cases and referring  them to the judiciary.    The president stressed that every person who indulges in  corruption is brought to account and tried so that others will  be deterred. He said: We should respect the values of  publication and not belittle or insult ourselves.    The information minister went on to say that, on the issue  of  freedom of opinion, President Mubarak stressed that there is no  confiscation of an opinion, idea, or book. He said: We will  not permit the confiscation or the recollection from markets of  a book because of an administrative decision made by an  establishment or government department.    The president also stressed that the housing law will not be  referred to the People's Assembly until after an exhaustive  discussion and debate, adding that there will be no law that  harms the sons of society. He said: Up to this minute, no  draft law has been prepared. All we have are studies and views  on this subject.    The president called for setting up a higher specialized  committee that includes experts in civil planning and housing to  draw up the plan for tackling the issue of slums all over the  republic.    On the issue of the national dialogue, which he has called  for, the president stressed that the dialogue's objective is  Egypt's present and future, adding that it will include all the  political parties, national forums, intellectuals, thinkers,  experts, and specialists.    President Mubarak added: This dialogue will have working  papers that will be prepared before it starts. He proposed that  the dialogue start on 1 April.    The information minister said that the president emphasized  his responsibility to protect the security of Egypt and its sons  and to achieve stability on its land, noting that there is a red  line that no human being or group is allowed to cross.    President Mubarak stressed that the achievement of a just  peace in the region will lead to the development of a better  life and to a rise in its sons' standard of living. He said  that this can come only through the use of advanced technology  and cooperation and coordination between the countries of the  region.    President Mubarak affirmed that the emergency law will  continue and that, with the ongoing acts of terrorism, drug  trafficking, and unusual circumstances, it is impossible to  change or abolish it. He noted that this law was passed to  safeguard society and that it will not affect freedom of speech  and of the press.    President Mubarak called on the government to reconsider  certain laws to close loopholes regarding the illegal buildings  and to deter violators. He stressed that buildings that have  technically and structurally safe foundations will not be  demolished. He requested that fines imposed on floors built in  violation of the law be transferred to the popular housing fund.  He said that expropriation of property should be partial and in  accordance with a legal decision and verdict in favor of popular  housing.    Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak stressed that with  peace Egypt is capable of dealing with the region with  self-confidence to achieve progress and increase and improve  production.    President Mubarak stated that he referred to the People's  Assembly a bill requesting abrogation of the agreement of the  Arab Cooperation Council [which includes Egypt, Jordan, Iraq,  and Yemen]. President Mubarak ordered the formation of a  tripartite committee of the ministers of information, culture,  and education to meet monthly to coordinate efforts to educate  and enlighten society. He requested that the government study  the problem of books and their prices to ensure export and  competition in foreign markets. He requested reducing customs  fees on paper so that Egypt will retain its vanguard cultural  standing.    Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak declared that Egypt  will not sign the agreement banning the use of chemical weapons  unless it is linked to banning the use of nuclear weapons.  President Mubarak said that Egypt's stance is firm on this  issue and it will not sign this agreement unless the other is  signed.    President Mubarak stressed that national dialogue will  involve all legal parties and national forces. He emphasized  respect for the law and that there will be no dialogue with  illegal groups. He said that the Constitution in Egypt bans the  establishment of religious parties and that the experiments of  Jordan and Algeria will not be repeated in Egypt. No one will  impose a view on Egypt or its people in the name of religion.    At the beginning of the meeting, President Mubarak broached  the issue of terrorism, stressing that it preoccupies every  Egyptian citizen despite the fact that it is an international  phenomenon. He noted that we see acts of violence taking place  everyday worldwide. He said that despite this we will not be  lenient in confronting terrorism and stopping bloodshed and its  impact on stability and the people's wellbeing. He noted that  terrorism can be ended in a short time but will require  exceptional measures. He stressed that in its firm  confrontation of terrorism, Egypt wants to entrench the  supremacy of law and respect for the Constitution, although  settling this phenomenon once and for all will take time. He  said that we are determined to ensure respect for the law and  the Constitution without taking any exceptional measures to  confront terrorism.    President Mubarak said that certain people speak of human  rights and defend the rights of those who commit crimes of  terrorism, forgetting the rights of victims and the state's  right to protect and ensure security for its people. He noted  that there are forces and states seeking to harm Egypt's  stability and that certain parties fund the fugitive criminals.  These parties finance terrorists to commit their crimes  thinking that they will escape law and justice. [passage  omitted]    Dr. Muhammad 'Abdallah and Sakinah Fu'ad spoke at the  meeting  on Arab-Israeli cooperation and the importance for President  Mubarak of having a cultural adviser. President Mubarak said  that cooperation among the Arab countries of the region and  Israel under peace is clear to Egypt, noting his country's  initiative to achieve progress. He stressed that there is a need  to give and to take to serve the region's people. He said: I  do not agree that I should have a cultural adviser because the  channel between myself and the intellectuals is always open. He  said: I do not agree with the confiscation of books because the  law regulates this issue.    Journalist Salah Hafiz spoke on cooperation between Egypt  and  Israel in the next stage. President Mubarak said that under  peace we have to deal with all countries of the region with  self- confidence because no one can control our will or beliefs  or take from us what we do not want to give. He said: When I  call for openness, I call for cooperation, coordination, and  openness under peace to bring about progress and increase and  improve production. [passage omitted]</p>

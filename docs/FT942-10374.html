			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Lloyd's to reveal double counting Lloyd's of London will next week disclose for the first time the exact extent to which its losses are 'double-counted', when it reports its losses for 1991. It is expected that about a fifth of the loss, expected to total some Pounds 2.5bn, has been counted twice - as the original loss, then again as a claim on syndicates underwriting errors and omissions, personal stop-loss or estate-protection insurance. Errors and omissions policies insure Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence, while stop-loss and estate protection are forms of personal reinsurance bought by Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the Lloyd's market. Lloyd's last year estimated that the 'double count' amounted to about Pounds 600m of its 1990 loss of Pounds 2.9bn. This year the market, which accounts its results three years in arrears, has commissioned a firm of actuarial consultants to perform a precise accounting exercise. The measure is one of a number designed to soften the impact of the 1991 loss on Names. Also under consideration at the market is a plan to allow Names to take credit for profits which are expected in years where accounts have still to be finalised. Names would be allowed to offset these credits against losses when the market's authorities assess their solvency - the extent to which their assets can meet liabilities - later this year. Last year Names were allowed to take credit equal to 5 per cent of their premium income limits for solvency purposes. The 1991 loss, about half of which stems from claims on policies written in 1990 and earlier years, is the fourth in succession and will bring Lloyd's cumulative loss since 1988 to more than Pounds 8bn. However, both 1989 and 1990 included a significant element of double-counting, according to Inside Eye, the monthly independent Lloyd's newsletter. 'Any regular company would blanch at the incorrect figures which have been published to date and would certainly have endeavoured earlier to reduce any unnecessary exaggeration of the loss,' says the newsletter. 'Recognition of the need to strip out the duplicated element of losses was slow in coming,' it adds. The market is expected to report a further year of losses - possibly of around Pounds 1bn - when it reports its 1992 results next year.</p>

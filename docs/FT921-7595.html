			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York reinforces continent's optimism A STRONG opening on Wall Street underpinned the continent's optimism, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued its upsurge as investors scrambled to get into what they perceived as an accelerating market. The CAC 40 index rose 35.81 or 1.9 per cent to 1,951.22 in heavy turnover of FFr4.8bn. US brokers were reported to be trading actively in futures. Cyclical stocks continued to rise, with Ciments Francais, up FFr28 at FFr314 with 37,175 shares traded and Pechiney International adding FFr8 to FFr192. Even Credit Foncier de France, generally regarded as a conservative mortgage bank, jumped FFr53 to FFr985 with 42,520 shares traded. Also in the financial sector, Suez rose FFr8.80 to FFr336.20 on 891,325 shares. The department store, Printemps, fell FFr45 to FFr862 after a government prosecutor indicated that the government did not have a problem with Pinault only bidding for two-thirds of the company. FRANKFURT was positive in the pre-bourse after a strong New York bond market kept bunds stable. Dealers reported futures-related buying in cyclicals, anticipating the closing of DTB futures and options contracts today. The DAX index pierced 1,700, at its sixth attempt over four weeks, closing 15.39 higher at 1,703.18. The FAZ index rose 4.57 to 694.05 at midsession. In the post-bourse, the DAX future broke through 1,720 and held it to register 1,724.5, its highest for seven months. Volume climbed to DM7.4bn from DM5.3bn. Cars recovered from Wednesday's weakness, Daimler rising DM11.40 to DM746 on its indication of higher profits for 1991. The dollar-oriented mechanical engineering sector showed some useful gains with KHD DM5.80 higher at DM153.50, Kugelfischer up DM6.50 to DM251.50, and Linde DM126 better at DM794. MILAN closed slightly higher but shares in Cementir and Caltagirone, the construction group which on Wednesday won its bid for a 52 per cent stake in the cement company, both weakened. The Comit index rose 1.81 to 533.08 in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L83bn. Cementir resumed trading after its one-day suspension and fell L160 or 5.8 per cent to L2,610 as operators who had bought shares in the hope of a takeover battle sold out. The sale of the state's holding in Cementir has been rushed through before legislation protecting minority shareholders in takeovers takes effect. Caltagirone fell L610 or 13.2 per cent to L3,995 as the market took the view that the company had paid far too much for the stake - the L480bn price tag is about double the current market value. Montedison continued to gain, adding L16 to L1,372 with some 4m shares exchanged, in options-related buying. AMSTERDAM was lifted by a strong dollar. The CBS Tendency Index rose 1.7 to 125.4. Royal Dutch fell Fl 1.60 to Fl 140.50 after announcing a 33 per cent fall in 1991 net profits. Analysts were disappointed at the results, in spite of an increase in its dividend. Elsevier rose on foreign buying, closing up Fl 3.8 or 3.4 per cent at Fl 113.50. Hagemeyer, the trading group, gained Fl 2.00 to Fl 149.00 after reporting a 26 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. Unilever recorded another all-time high, closing up Fl 3.30 or 1.7 per cent at Fl 195.50. MADRID found renewed confidence by midsession. The general index closed up 0.81 at 261.04 in turnover estimated at Pta18bn. High volume in Telefonica continued with some 3.2m shares traded, against 3.5m, following news that unions had rejected the company's pension plan. It closed down Pta20 at Pta1,200, having lost Pta55 at one stage. The construction and utility sectors were both strong, with Cubiertas up Pta460 or 4 per cent at Pta11,890. STOCKHOLM was disappointed with the 36 per cent jump in profits at Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, and with the company's forecast of a 20 to 25 per cent rise in sales and profits for the current year. The B shares fell SKr12 to SKr558. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 3.7 lower at 929.4. ZURICH's SPI index closed 8.1 higher at a new 1992 high of 1,130.6. Alusuisse bearers topped the actives list, closing SFr18 higher at SFr988. Oerlikon, the arms manufacturer, put on another SFr17 to SFr345, taking its rise on the week to SFr43 ahead of a news conference next Wednesday. BRUSSELS saw the non-ferrous metals company, Acec-Union Miniere, add BFr95 or 4.2 per cent to BFr2,345 in active trade of 27,650 shares. The Bel-20 index rose 9.31 to 1,173.99 in turnover of BFr851m. ISTANBUL fell to its lowest level this year as the rising dollar prompted investors to shift funds into the foreign exchange market. The 75-share index lost 180.66 or 4.3 per cent to 3,993.56. OSLO, lifted by stronger prices for North Sea oil, closed up 2.36 to 416.22 in turnover of NKr213.2m. Norsk Hydro, which reported a 1991 net loss of NKr498m, rose NKr1 to NKr140.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1146.69  1146.39  1147.74  1146.47  1146.61  1147.05  1148.86  1149.62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1149.91    Day's Low  1145.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Feb 19     Feb 18     Feb 17     Feb 14     Feb 13       1140.09    1143.83    1135.65    1130.78    1136.68  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

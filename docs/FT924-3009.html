			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / West regrets Gaidar's rejection: Vote against acting PM seen as blow to debt relief talks THE rejection of Mr Yegor Gaidar as Russia's acting prime minister and guardian of the economic reform process is seen as a serious setback to western efforts to negotiate further debt relief and financial support for President Boris Yeltsin's government. Officials in European capitals made it clear that the upheaval in Moscow is seen with grave concern. 'Nobody can be happy,' one said. 'Naturally it does not help relationships to dismiss such a key man at such a sensitive moment. What is needed now above all else is continuity, and a calm but decisive hand.' A Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman added: 'We also need continuity as a signal to the west that Russia will meet its commitments, in exchange for international co-operation.' 'We hope and assume that the discussion on the reform process in Russia will continue, regardless of personnel decisions. We hope that happens, in the interests of Russia and its population, and for the success of the restructuring process.' Senior German officials are seeking to finalise agreements before next week, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits Moscow for his first top-level talks since the departure of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and end of the Soviet Union. In Washington, Senator Sam Nunn, the influential Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate armed services committee, said Mr Gaidar's rejection would be 'a blow to Yeltsin and a blow to economic reform.' After a meeting with President George Bush he said: 'There are other people who believe just as fervently in the market economy as Gaidar, but he is now the symbol.' Senator Richard Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, said he believed President Yeltsin wanted to maintain both the path of economic reform and Mr Gaidar, and might want to work out some way in which the latter could 'continue to be effective.' For his part, Mr Gaidar appeared sanguine. 'I think that the government should carry on calmly,' he said. Others agreed with him. Mr Vladimir Ispravnikov, chairman of the Supreme Economic Council of the Russian parliament, said there 'was nothing terrible for Gaidar in this: he'll stay as acting prime minister and the president will take responsibility for him.' Some even interpreted the vote to reject Mr Gaidar as a victory for him. His political adviser, Mr Vladimir Mau, said: 'The vote confirms Gaidar as a major political figure. We didn't expect anything like half. No other candidate could have got as much.' Although the votes were not recorded, it was clear that hardline groups of nationalists and communists, such as Russian Unity, had voted against Mr Gaidar coupled with so-called centrist factions such as the Industrial Union, Smena and Agrarian Union. However, the substantial vote for the prime minister means that the core pro-government constituencies - the Parliamentary Reform Coalition - in the Congress estimated yesterday to be between 300 and 350 deputies, has been swollen by members from at least some of the centrist groups.</p>

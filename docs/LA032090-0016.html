			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: BERMUDA SOCK TRIANGLE  </P> <P> For as long as there have been washers and dryers, women have been plagued by  the Bermuda Sock Triangle. For every pair of socks put into the laundry, only  one is returned.  </P> <P> In the '60s, I got a grant from the Mental Health Assn. to find out where all  these socks were going. I talked with mothers who put casts on their children's  legs, bought black stockings for everyone in the house -- and to one woman who  told her husband she was conducting a test to see if his "green" leg was less  tired than his "navy" one at the end of the day.  </P> <P> We bounced around a lot of theories. Some thought socks were victims of a great  cosmic force that demanded one be sacrificed like a virgin maiden. Others  thought socks were reincarnated and appeared in your dryer as bras and panties  you had never seen before.  </P> <P> They were just speculations. The only person who had a reasonable solution was  a man who bought two dozen pairs of new socks each year, tore them apart, and  threw out one sock from each pair to save his wife the trouble of losing them.  </P> <P> Me? I just caved in and told my kids the other sock went to live with Jesus.  They accepted that.  </P> <P> The other day, I received a package from a woman in Plymouth, Md. "I know you  have given up on the missing socks," she wrote, "but I just thought you'd be  interested to know where one of ours went -- one that had been missing a month  or two.  </P> <P> "On Christmas Eve, I was preparing clam chowder in my Crockpot for company  dinner. There was a strange odor in my kitchen all afternoon -- not at all  Christmasy, like evergreen or bayberry candles, but rather putrid. I knew I  wasn't the world's best cook, but I wasn't that bad either.  </P> <P> "When it was time to serve dinner, we found a sock half-melted between the pot  and the crockery. I thought of you that evening and wanted you to have it."  </P> <P> A charred-black, brittle piece of fabric fell out of the package. I didn't want  to look at it. I promised myself 15 years ago that if I didn't stop writing  about missing socks, I would end up on the pages of the National Enquirer next  to a spaceship that gave birth. But I couldn't resist. I held the burnt sock up  to a light and . . . here's the scary part. I have the mate to it.  </P></p>

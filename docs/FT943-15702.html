			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Junior debt-holders take Trizec restructuring to court The future of the CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.36bn) restructuring of Trizec, the North American property group, will probably be decided by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench at a hearing in Calgary on July 19. Trizec's senior debt-holders and preferred and common shareholders have voted to accept the restructuring terms, but the junior debt-holders, owed CDollars 310m, rejected it and were expected to take further legal action seeking an additional CDollars 25m compensation. 'We're not fighting senior creditors and all we want is our day in court,' said Mr Rick Orzy, their lawyer. 'We have new evidence to show that we are being short-changed,' he added. The senior creditors, who stand to receive CDollars 917m cash and Trizec shares in the settlement, were expected to lodge a technical motion in court yesterday, enabling them to seize their collateral. 'Ultimately, the court of Queen's Bench must decide on the restructuring,' said Mr Derrick Tay, lawyer for the senior creditors. 'But there is ample evidence already filed to show that the restructuring terms are fair.' The senior creditors were also considering several other options, Mr Tay added, but he declined to elaborate. Trizec, formerly controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, stands to get a CDollars 1bn cash infusion from Horsham, a holding company of Toronto financier Mr Peter Munk, and the US O'Connor Property Group. Mr Munk would be chairman, and Horsham and O'Connor would have majority control of the reconstituted Trizec. The Quebec government has sold its Sidbec-Dosco Steelmaker to Ispat Mexicana, part of the Indonesian-based Ispat steel group, for CDollars 45m cash, the assumption of CDollars 280m debt and a commitment to inject CDollars 30m of working capital, The government has been trying to privatise Sidbec and early this year hired Goldman Sachs of New York to find a buyer. Ispat Mexicana's bid was the best of three received, the government said. Ispat will also invest CDollars 100m in Sidbec over the next five years. Sidbec returned to profitability in the first quarter this year with higher North American steel prices. In 1993 its sales were nearly CDollars 500m and it lost CDollars 98m. Steel shipments were just over 1m tonnes. Sidbec's plant near Montreal is modern, using the Midrex pre-reduction system, but the adjacent rolling mills require investment. Nova, the Canadian energy group, said a consortium led by its wholly owned subsidiary, Novacorp International, has been named as the preferred purchaser of a 49 per cent interest in the 1,300km Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline in Australia, Reuter reports from Calgary. Nova said Novacorp's partner in the consortium was Petroliam Nasional Berhad of Malaysia. It said Novacorp will hold about 25 per cent of the investment, and Petroliam will about 24 per cent; the remaining 51 per cent interest will be held by Australian Gas Light of Sydney. In addition the group the group said its Nova Gas Transmission unit planned to boost spending in north east Alberta in 1994-95. The company said the original spending plans for the region were about CDollars 20m for the 1994-95 year. But they now expected to spend more than CDollars 240m to accelerate deliveries from the area. Nova said the additional spending in north-east Alberta did not represent new capital investment, but rather an acceleration of capital spending previously planned for 1995 and 1996. Nova Gas has said it planned to spend CDollars 2bn on construction over the next three years.</p>

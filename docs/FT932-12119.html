			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (1): Anxiety for the affluent - Baden-Wurttemberg, home of the Mercedes-Benz motor company, has long been Germany's wealthiest state. But the very factors behind its post-war success mean the present recession has hit it with particular severity FORTUNE has smiled on the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south-west of Germany - although the smile is looking a little forced as Germany slides deeper into recession. It is a land of beautiful and varied scenery, stretching from Heidelberg in the north to the Black Forest and Lake Constance in the south. Endowed with only limited natural resources, it is home to thousands of proudly independent family businesses - the backbone of Germany's fabled Mittelstand  -and scores of large industrial concerns, including Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company. Germany's third biggest state in terms of population, Baden-Wurttemberg has for decades been the wealthiest of the Lander (states), with the lowest rate of unemployment, the highest exports, the most universities and technical schools and the biggest expenditure on research and development. The state's hard-working people have earned for Baden-Wurttemberg the epithet Musterlandle - roughly translated from the local dialect as 'model little country'. Although Baden-Wurttemberg has not lost its economic pre-eminence within Germany, it has become something of a role model for a number of economic problems which afflict Germany as a whole. Big companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, IBM Germany and the Robert Bosch car components companies are cutting back staff and reporting substantial profits falls. To take the most prominent example, profits at the Daimler group dropped from DM1.94bn to DM1.45bn last year, and the group is planning to shed 20,000 jobs in its Mercedes-Benz subsidiary this year. Many of these job cuts will fall in Baden-Wurttemberg. Amid dire market conditions, Mittelstand companies are failing or rushing into cooperation agreements - such as the collaboration recently announced by two Baden-Wurttemberg companies, Berthold Hermle, a milling and drilling machine specialist, and Traub, Germany's second biggest lathe maker. In February, unemployment in Baden-Wurttemberg climbed to 6 per cent; lower than the national average but a record for a state which had only 3.7 per cent unemployment in 1991. Moreover, there are more than 200,000 workers on short-time work. In the first six months of last year, GDP growth slightly outpaced that of Germany as a whole, but since the recession began in earnest in the second half of 1992, the provisional figures for the whole of 1992 show that GDP growth fell from 2.9 per cent in 1991 to 1.5 per cent last year. The very factors which contributed to the state's post-war success now ensure that it feels the effects of the current recession especially sharply. The regional economy is heavily dependent on manufacturing - especially on the automobile sector and on other forms of mechanical and electrical engineering such as machine-tool building. It has the highest density of engineers anywhere in Germany, reflecting in part the perfectionist and practical mentality of the Swabian people. In 1991, before the downturn took hold, the state accounted for about a quarter of Germany's total exports of electrical equipment, 22 per cent of Germany's automotive exports and 17 per cent of all machinery exports. Like other German companies, those in Baden-Wurttemberg benefited from a two year surge in demand caused by German reunification. But this has petered out and the traditional export markets have failed to take up the slack. It is exactly the manufacturing sector - the source of Baden-Wurttemberg's strength in the past - which is worst hit during Germany's current recession. Car production in Germany is likely to fall back by 25 per cent this year, hitting not only car manufacturing companies such as Mercedes-Benz but also their suppliers in the small company sector. Demand for machines and other capital goods is stagnant in the absence of recovery in the rest of the world. The recent appreciation of the D-Mark against a number of currencies has made it that much more difficult for German companies to sell their products abroad. Meanwhile, cost structures reflect generous pay-rises awarded amid the euphoria of the post-reunification boom. 'As far as the technical quality of what we make is concerned,' says Mr Erwin Teufel, Baden-Wurttemberg's prime minister, 'we can hold our own with anybody in the world. But as for Germany as a whole costs have become too high and we have the lowest working hours of any of our major competitors. Industry has become inflexible.' Mr Teufel, a Christian Democrat who took over as prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg in January last year, cautions against exaggerating the state's economic woes. Unemployment is still lower than elsewhere in Germany, he says, and the decline in sectors such as the automobile industry is from a very high level. He argues that, at the core, the regional economy is extremely sound, supported by excellent educational infrastructure (there are 48 universities and technical schools, more than in any other German Land) and a research and development expenditure amounting to 3.9 per cent of the state's GNP, a higher percentage than in Germany as a whole - or in Japan. Mr Dieter Spori, the Social Democrat (SPD) economics minister who is deputy to Mr Teufel in the state's coalition government, agrees. Casting an eye towards Germany's more northerly Lander, where industry evolved earlier than in the south-west and, as a result, there is a greater dependence on 'smokestack' heavy industry, he says: 'Quite frankly I think we are lucky that Baden-Wurttemberg's economy is dependent on the automobile sector. It's better than being dependent on coal and steel.' Although Mr Teufel believes that '80 per cent' of the state's economic problems will be cleared up once the German economy participates in an economic upswing, both the prime minister and his deputy believe that Baden-Wurttemberg has to engage in some painful restructuring before it will emerge leaner, fitter and more competitive than before. That two such men, from opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum, can agree on anything at all, let alone function together in a ruling coalition, points to another way in which the state of Baden-Wurttemberg may prove to be a model for the rest of Germany. The coalition dates back to state elections in April last year, when the far right captured 11 per cent of the votes and 15 seats in the state parliament. As a result of the election the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, lost its traditional absolute majority in the last western state where it enjoyed a monopoly of power. The swing to the right, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the inflow of asylum-seeking refugees into Germany, presaged a similar, if not quite so pronounced swing to the right in the state of Hessen this year. The alliance between the CDU and SPD just may make Baden-Wurttemberg a role model for a 'grand coalition' of the main parties in Germany as a whole in the aftermath of next's year's federal elections.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Recovery is 'on track' SIGNS OF rising confidence and improving company performance in the Institute of Directors' latest business opinion survey provide clear evidence that recovery is on track, the institute says today. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general, warned that business needed a period of stability to build on the 'still fragile recovery'. The survey showed that expansion could be inhibited by growing cashflow problems and 'any tax increases in the November Budget could prove a serious setback'. The institute's bi-monthly survey shows that in August 63 per cent of members were more optimistic about the economy, compared with 55 per cent in June. August's result came close to the 65 per cent of directors expressing optimism in April - the highest confidence level since 1988. A total of 56 per cent of directors reported increased business volume - up from 49 per cent in June - while the proportion recording improved profits rose from 45 per cent to 52 per cent. But only 27 per cent expected employment levels in their companies to rise in the next six months, compared with 35 per cent in June. The survey shows a sharp rise in directors regarding cashflow as their main business concern - up from 33 per cent in June to 41 per cent in August. This, says the institute, strengthens the view that companies are starting to look to the financing of expansion. Lower European interest rates, subdued inflation and a tough November Budget will lead to a UK base rate of 5 per cent before the end of the year, Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster Bank, predicts in its September Economic and Financial Outlook. But, he says, a rise in inflation will push the base rate back to 6.5 per cent by the end of next year.</p>

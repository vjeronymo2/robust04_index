			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: Punch and Judy - Opera in Amsterdam Pierre Audi, for ten years (1979-89) director of London's Almeida Theatre, developed during that time an enviable reputation as a deviser of programmes  -what was today discovered (or re-discovered) at the annual Almeida Festival tended to become tomorrow's musical fashion. Since 1989 he has been artistic director of the Netherlands Opera; and, notwithstanding the differences of style and substance between a small London avant-garde enterprise and one of Europe's most important opera companies, Audi has swiftly settled in to demonstrate the same skills in Amsterdam. The blend of fare, casts and production teams has been balanced with imaginative flair. Audi regularly directed both plays and operas in his time at the Almeida; at the Muziektheater he continues to stage works (his recent Monteverdi Ritorno d'Ulisse was highly praised on this page by Andrew Clements). This season features, for instance, the first Dutch performances of Harrison Birtwistle's and Stephen Pruslin's Punch and Judy (1968), in an Audi production conducted by Oliver Knussen. To my mind Birtwistle's first opera, a 'tragical comedy or comical tragedy', stands as one of the key works, one of the extraordinary, unrepeatable outbursts of iconoclastic vitality in postwar British music. Its productions have been few - it is a chamber opera at once robustly entertaining and knottily complex - but almost all have etched themselves deep in the memory of their devotees (the 1982 Opera Factory version was a peak of that company's achievements). Alas, on the evidence of its opening night, this new Amsterdam Punch and Judy may well be remembered for rather different reasons: it seemed to me, in several key respects, a flop of depressingly large proportions. With hindsight it becomes clear that the attempt to do the opera in this theatre at all was on Audi's part a rare miscalculation. The stage, that huge Cinerama space, caused the tightly mapped formal patterns of Birtwistle's angularly lyrical vocal lines and Pruslin's elaborately witty verbal sallies to be spread out and, almost all of the time, to become hopelessly blurred. Then there is the matter of the Muziektheater acoustics, a modern disaster of uncommunicative dryness. (Only the Paris Bastille's are worse.) The physical unsuitability and acoustical limitations of the space managed, between them, to achieve the previously unimaginable - the blunting of the famously abrasive edge to Birtwistle's chamber-ensemble instrumentation. Word-inaudibility was a constant; admittedly, composer and librettist built in a pretty considerable Comprehension Problem in the first place, but it needs to be grasped, not comprehensively evaded. Audi's production, which forsook the puppet-show setting and props specified in the stage directions, had as its background four gigantic inflatable dolls, hung on wires and slowly moved around. This was a stupendous feat of design (by the celebrated German artist Baselitz) whose qualities of monumental primitivism added to the general feeling of lethargy and deadened dramatic purpose. Individual roles were characterised by costume (brilliant punk-cum-Beckettian invention by Jorge Lara) and by physical motions carefully routined - Punch jerks, slides and stumbles as if himself operated on wires, the Choregos prances about as a mixture of the clown Grock and Little Lord Fauntleroy. There was much well-crafted theatrical imagery on show, which was translated into particularly vivid action by Robert Poulton (Punch) and David Wilson-Johnson (Choregos), outstanding members of the six-strong cast. But the confrontation in the opera of ancient and modern, ritual and burlesque, seemed entirely to escape this staging, which substituted instead an all-purpose air of Art. In the pit, at least, Knussen and the players of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra managed to convey a much more lucid and idiomatic command of the work (but what were they all doing down there? The score calls for the disposition of the players into stage and pit bands). The number of audience members that I could see fast asleep in their seats by the three-quarter point of the unbroken 100-minute stretch suggested - as did much else in the performance - that the opera's cause will not have been greatly advanced by its first showing in Amsterdam. Amsterdam Muziektheater: in repertory until January 29</p>

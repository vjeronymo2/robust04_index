			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Austrailian market closed 1994 with prices about 50pc higher than when the year began. The rise for wool growers was enough to mean a return to economic production after the extremes of deep recession. The wool trade and textile industry experienced a much more satisfactory year as prices took an upward trend. The problem which developed during the latter half of the year was that of passing on the higher raw wool prices. Lower levels led to better business but when it comes to replacement retailers were reluctant to pay prices up by 50pc to 100pc or for speciality fibres by more than that. Wool is not the only commodity facing this problem of a rising market at the primary end but resistance further down the line, closely related to policies designed to check inflation. The outlook for 1995 is seen as difficult largely for this reason.</p>

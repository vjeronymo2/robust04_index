			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE OVER MONUMENT HAS A DEEPER MEANING  </P> <P> The story of the 442nd Regiment Combat Team is more than the heroic battles of  some American citizens in their quest for acceptance into American society. It  is the story of loyal Americans interned because of their government's unjust  fear.  </P> <P> In turn, that minority of Americans (performed) the most valiant of deeds (for)  that same government in a most desperate time of need.  </P> <P> While the battle lingers concerning a monument commemorating the  Japanese-Americas who fought for their country, I can only hope that somewhere  . . . the virtues extolled by the 442nd -- in proving the U.S. government wrong  -- will hold a distinct and exemplary place in American history. The spirit of  the 442nd will always hold in me the anticipation that the interning of  American citizens will never recur. Hopefully, the spirit of the 442nd can  achieve a foundation in the memorial that arises from the remaining ashes of  the "Battle Zone" affair.  </P> <P> Perhaps President Truman, while on the White House steps, stated a matter of  Americanism best in his address to the 442nd upon their return home: "You  fought not only the enemy, but you fought prejudice -- and you won. Keep up  that fight and we will continue to win -- to make this great republic stand for  what the Constitution says it stands for: 'The welfare of all the people all  the time.' "  </P> <P> KEN SALAZAR  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

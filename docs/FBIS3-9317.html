			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tirana, March 20 (ATA) -- The Popular [People's]  Assembly discussed at the yesterday's session the draft law on  state draft budget for 1994 presented by the Meksi cabinet.    Deputy Rakaj, who took the floor in the name of the SDP  [Socialist Democratic Party] parliamentary group, said the draft  budget is the main point of the government for the year 1994.  But it would be better, Rakaj said, if we should have approved  the platform of the economic reform before the draft budget.  That is because the platform defines the medium government  program until 1996.    Deputy Angjeli, representative of the SP [Socialist Party]  parliamentary group, said that the draft budget for 1994  reflects the economic and financial difficulties our country is  passing through in this transformation period towards the market  economy. After he made an analysis in what degree the last year  budget have been realised, Mr. Angjeli explained the reasons why  the SP parliamentary group gives an abstention vote. Speaking  in the name of independent deputies, Deputy Pashko was in favour  of the abstention, saying the budget shows Albania is going to a  very social market economy. "We abstain," Pashko said, "because  we are not for a such market economy."    Deputy Jemin Gjana, speaking in the name of DP [Democratic  Party] parliamentary group, said a special thing in this draft  law is that discussions, debates, and the confrontations between  parliamentary members, between parliamentary commissions and  groups have lasted relatively long showing their responsibility.  No one, excepting criticizers, can reject the achievements in  the economic and financial situation, in the bank system, in  gradual installing and perfecting the fiscal system, in prices  and salaries policy, in privatization and investments  continuation and in communication and trade development. These  achievements were reached by the support of international bodies  such as EU, World Bank, IMF, G-24, etc.    Deputy Gjana mentioned two essential elements of the state  budget for 1994: expenses for social support will be risen at a  level of 45 per cent covering 30 per cent of the total expenses  compared to 25 per cent of the last year. The second element in  the budget is the raise of the public investments. Their  program raises by 15 per cent for 1994 covering about 8.5 per  cent of the GDP [expansion unknown].    "The budget presented to us is a program which expresses all  the endeavours for building the market economy and the legal  state," Mr. Gjana said in conclusion.    Then Pjeter Arbnori, speaker of the parliament, invited  deputies to vote for approving the draft project. Taking in  consideration the remarks and the proposals of parliamentary  respective commissions and deputies, the draft law on the state  budget for 1994 was approved in principle, article by article,  and a majority of votes.</p>

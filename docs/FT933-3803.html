			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte rights talk Talk of an imminent rights issue by Forte produced a late flurry of trading, sending shares in the hotel group down sharply at the close. The rumours were firmly denied after the market closed by Forte. Dealers said that a big seller in the market, by touting around different broking houses for prices, had prompted marketmakers to mark quotations lower. However, the rights issue story excited imaginations most, given Forte's debt situation, with speculation that such a call would be in excess of Pounds 500m. Forte has said previously that any such move would only be made to accompany an acquisition. Forte shares closed 5 1/2 off at 237p.</p>

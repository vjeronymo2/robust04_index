			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS DEADLOCK; EASTERN ACCORD MAY BE DOOMED  </P> <P> Peter V. Ueberroth's effort to acquire Eastern Airlines appeared doomed early  today after a rancorous battle in which lawyers for the strikebound carrier  rebuffed union efforts to wrest control of Eastern from its current owners even  before it is sold.  </P> <P> "The agreement is dead," a well-placed source close to Ueberroth said early  this morning.  </P> <P> Ueberroth himself could not be reached for further comment at his Manhattan  apartment after a midnight Tuesday deadline for all parties to agree to the  sale passed inconclusively. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland ordered  lawyers to return to his office at 8:30 a.m. for a "status conference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Looks Bad'  </P> <P> But a short time earlier, a dramatic late-night meeting of the judge, Ueberroth  and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., ended with the  former baseball commissioner declaring: "I'm not optimistic." One of his aides  added: "It looks bad."  </P> <P> The deal appeared to turn on the naming of a trustee to run Eastern while the  airline remains in bankruptcy, a demand made by the airline's unions in return  for wage concessions. But serious doubts also were raised by Eastern's  creditors committee about whether Eastern would be a viable company if the  Ueberroth deal is consummated.  </P> <P> The Ueberroth group said its proposal depended on approval by the unions and  Texas Air, owner of Eastern, by midnight, and both sides reserved the right to  back out. But it remained to be seen whether the passing of the deadline indeed  doomed the deal.  </P> <P> "It's not my deadline," Lifland said just before midnight. "There was an  earlier deadline for certain things that I set and it was met." He did not  elaborate.  </P> <P> James Linsey, one of the lawyers for the pilots union, said: "I don't think any  single person has the whole picture."  </P> <P> The appointment of a trustee to run the airline in the next 60 to 90 days while  the company is reorganized in bankruptcy was described as an absolute condition  of the unions' agreement to a deal with Ueberroth. They are adamant that  Lorenzo and his management not be allowed to continue to run the airline.  </P> <P> Lorenzo and his lawyers have objected because it would mark their loss of  control over Eastern even before ownership of the airline shifted to  Ueberroth's group.  </P> <P> Two union lawyers and a Ueberroth lawyer said they thought there was a  possibility that Lifland would appoint a trustee if he came to the conclusion  that Lorenzo was "the roadblock" to a deal being concluded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Procedure  </P> <P> It is highly unusual for a trustee to be appointed in a voluntary bankruptcy  proceeding, according to Robert J. Rosenberg, one of Ueberroth's lawyers.  However, he said, it was warranted under the circumstances in part because "our  partners -- the unions -- insist on it."  </P> <P> Joseph Guerrieri Jr., a Washington lawyer representing the machinists, said he  believed that Lorenzo opposed the appointment of a trustee because he not only  would lose control of Eastern's operations but power over its reorganization  plan in bankruptcy court. It could also foreclose other options he might have  in determining the company's future, Guerrieri said.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, lawyers said Lifland told them he was reluctant to name a  trustee if Lorenzo would contest it in court. The judge said he would prefer  that both sides reach an agreement on whether to name a trustee.  </P> <P> After a full day of hotel-room meetings aimed at meeting the midnight deadline,  Lorenzo, Ueberroth and their advisers arrived at the federal courthouse in  lower Manhattan about 7:30 p.m. to discuss the trustee issue.  </P> <P> Sources said Lorenzo's advisers had told him by phone that there was an urgent  need to talk with the judge about the trustee issue. Lorenzo was accompanied by  Phil Bakes, the president of Eastern. Ueberroth was joined by partner J. Thomas  Talbot.  </P> <P> About 9:30 p.m., Lorenzo and Ueberroth left the judge's office. Then someone in  the hallway said: "The judge is calling you back in." Lorenzo re-entered the  office, but Ueberroth said to an associate: "I'm not going back in. . . . Let's  go."  </P> <P> Then Lorenzo and Philip Bakes emerged again and left the building. Lorenzo,  surrounded by a throng of reporters and cameramen shoving microphones in his  face, declined to comment on the elevator ride down to the lobby or on his way  to a waiting car.  </P> <P> None of the parties would discuss the meeting with Lifland.  </P> <P>  Nerves grew frayed and tempers got short as another long day without a  completed sale wore on at the federal bankruptcy courthouse. In the morning,  negotiations were held at the Vista International Hotel in lower Manhattan.  </P> <P> At one point, Lifland was overheard by reporters in a hallway as he shouted at  Harvey Miller, Eastern's chief bankruptcy lawyer.  </P> <P> "Damn it, Harvey, if you want the planes in the air, all you have to do is sign  the paper," Lifland yelled at Miller.  </P> <P> Lifland has repeatedly voiced his desire to get Eastern -- which the judge has  described as a "national asset" -- flying again. Eastern has had to cancel  about 90% of its flights since a strike was launched against the company by the  International Assn. of Machinists on March 4.  </P> <P> Moments later, David Shapiro, a Washington lawyer serving as a special  court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, tried to get Miller's  attention as Miller walked by in the courthouse hallway.  </P> <P> "Harv," Shapiro shouted. Miller looked at him and declared: "Shove it, David,"  before stalking away.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, a machinists union official, LeRoy Washington, said:  "Lorenzo's trying to pull the plug on the deal. He thinks if the unions will  give concessions to Ueberroth, they ought to give concessions to him."  </P> <P> He was referring to the fact that Eastern's machinists, pilots and flight  attendants have agreed to give the Ueberroth group $199.6 million in annual  wage concessions for the next five years in return for a 30% ownership interest  in the newly re-formed company, to be called the Eastern Airlines Employees  &amp; Service Co.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable sources said that $168 million of those wage concessions would be  given yearly by the machinists, $28 million annually by the pilots and $3.6  million by the flight attendants. Additionally, sources said that Eastern's  11,000 non-unionized workers would be asked to make about $10.4 million in  concessions annually, coming from their current benefits, not from their wages.  </P> <P> Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots' union, said the pilots agreed to sign  off on the concession deal at 4 a.m. Monday in Washington when they were told  by Shapiro that he would fly to New York that day and recommend to Lifland that  a trustee be appointed to run the company. Former Defense Secretary Frank C.  Carlucci flew to New York with Shapiro, Bavis, Ueberroth and the other key  figures in the deal.  </P> <P> "I understood that he (Shapiro) had extraordinary powers," Bavis said,  explaining that he expected that a trustee would be appointed. But lawyers for  Eastern and Texas Air balked Monday and the transaction was delayed,  necessitating further talks.  </P> <P> "I'm pissed," Bavis said. He said it was essential to get Eastern planes flying  quickly because the airline has been losing "a million dollars a day" as well  as market share during the strike, and that its value continues to diminish.  </P> <P> In order to save the airline, he said, Eastern must start flying before the 60  to 90 days it would take to consummate the Ueberroth deal.  </P> <P> Bavis said that starting up operations now represented "a risk" to the  employees because the Ueberroth deal was not finished. He said it was a risk  they are only willing to take if Lorenzo is out.  </P> <P> "Our people aren't going to take that risk for the guy they hate the most --  Lorenzo. Giving up $210 million a year in concessions is quite a bath. Our deal  is with Peter."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Joel Zweibel, the chief lawyer for the 15-member Eastern  creditors committee, presented a resolution to lawyers for Ueberroth, Texas Air  and Eastern, as well as Lifland, expressing reservations about "certain  significant aspects" of the Ueberroth deal.  </P> <P> In particular, he said the creditors committee had not been given "any  demonstration . . . of the economic viability of a business plan for a  reorganized Eastern."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transfer of Assets  </P> <P> Additionally, Zweibel said the committee was disturbed "by the apparently  substantial transfer of assets from Eastern to Texas Air without equivalent  value" being given to Eastern from Texas Air. The Ueberroth purchase plan calls  for a transfer of $79 million of Eastern's assets to Texas Air.  </P> <P> The creditors committee also expressed reservations about Eastern incurring an  additional $100 million in new debt as part of the Ueberroth deal.  </P> <P> Zweibel said he thought the issues raised by the creditors committee were  significant, but he said he did not think they were the principal reason why  the deal had not been consummated.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Ueberroth acknowledged that creditors have significant statutory  rights in a bankruptcy proceeding and could present a significant obstacle.  </P> <P> In Miami, U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, after consulting by phone with  Lifland, said he planned to release his ruling this morning on whether  Eastern's pilots should be forced back to work.  </P> <P> Davis, speaking to reporters and lawyers for both sides in his chambers, said  he had decided to delay his ruling Tuesday to give Lifland more time to work  out a final agreement.  </P> <P> "I have determined that it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with  the negotiations that are ongoing tonight," said Davis, who signed his ruling  and sealed it.  </P> <P> But he said he would again delay his ruling if both Eastern and the pilots  union requested it. Eastern lawyer David Ross said the airline did not want any  further delays in the release of Davis' decision.  </P> <P> In its suit, Eastern has asked Davis to order its 3,400 pilots to end their  walkout in support of striking machinists. The company contends the pilots  union is conducting an illegal strike in pursuit of its own contract goals,  while union leaders say it is a legal sympathy walkout.  </P></p>

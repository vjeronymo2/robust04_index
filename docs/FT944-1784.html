			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Difficult choices ahead for Mercosur: Trade quartet must decide on direction after euphoria of pact Late-night summits often spawn hyperbole and talk of breakthrough, but the upbeat statements coming out of the colonial Brazilian town of Ouro Preto this weekend have a basis in fact. The Mercosur trade group of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed to become a customs union from January 1. The decision, an idea which four years ago was dismissed by many as politically inspired and wishful thinking, will create the world's second largest customs union, linking economies with a combined GDP of about Dollars 800bn (Pounds 490bn) and 200m consumers. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, described the agreement as a 'historic landmark', while President Carlos Menem of Argentina said its effects would be 'highly positive' for the four countries' economies. Both men marvelled at the achievement, remarkable given that relations between Brazil and Argentina have until recently been poor and that their economies for decades encouraged protectionism. Despite the celebrations, some difficult choices lie ahead. The partners must decide whether to push on towards a common market with free movement of labour and capital, or whether to concentrate on leading South America's integration with Nafta in the planned Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Mercosur's success also threatens to concentrate investment in the richer areas of Brazil and Argentina, two countries which already suffer from dangerous differences in regional wealth. According to diplomats, the catalyst for agreement was the decision to allow sensitive and less competitive products temporary exemptions from the free trade regime. For trade between the four countries, where tariffs have been falling since 1991, less than 10 per cent of trade will get the special exemptions. However, these products, ranging from Argentine paper to Brazilian peaches, will have their tariffs reduced to zero by 1999. With the common external tariff (CET) covering trade with countries outside the area, less than 10 per cent of products will have an exemption from the tariff. In these cases, governments have until 2001 to apply the CET, whose average rate for all products is 14 per cent. Two sensitive areas, cars and sugar, will also be excluded until the next century. A second important reason for agreement was the recent, and still fragile, economic recovery of Brazil, which has seen its monthly inflation rate fall from 50 per cent in June to less than 3 per cent this month because of a new currency, the Real. Now the four countries must decide how much further to go. The Protocol of Ouro Preto, which gives Mercosur a legal status and lets it negotiate with other trade groups such as the European Union, also commits the partners to review by 2001 whether they want a full common market. Predicting the outcome is difficult, especially since Argentina holds presidential elections next year, and Brazil in 1998. Until the review, the two main partners are determined to limit the growth of Mercosur's institutions. A Uruguayan proposal to establish a supranational court to rule on trade disputes was opposed by Brazil and Argentina, which feared their sovereignty would be diluted. Mercosur's secretariat will remain a small, administrative organ, and policy and decisions will remain with the four governments. Despite these intentions, however, closer integration is likely to lead to stronger Mercosur institutions and devolved sovereignty. In place of a court, the countries agreed over the weekend to set up an arbitration tribunal. A Brazilian-Argentine proposal to merge their automotive industrial policies by 2000 also implies the ceding of national interests to those of Mercosur. Mercosur officials talk of the next few years as a time of 'deepening' integration. But an important distraction is the 2005 deadline for a continent-wide free trade area, which was agreed at the recent Summit of the Americas and which will involve a convergence of existing trade blocs like Mercosur, Nafta and the Andean Pact countries. Mercosur has already opened talks with Chile and Bolivia about their joining the free trade area rather than becoming customs union members. took care to send a high-level observer to the Ouro Preto. meeting, presumably to prove his determination for Chile to join both Mercosur and Nafta. Mercosur is the natural negotiating partner for Nafta, especially if relations continue to improve between the two biggest countries, the US and Brazil. However, there are real limits to Mercosur's further expansion. Some countries such as Venezuela want to establish links, principally to reduce their reliance on US trade. But Caracas is closer to Miami than Mercosur's main crescent, between Sao Paulo state in Brazil and Buenos Aires. The expanse, and poor communications, of the Amazon are also a barrier to further integration between north and south of South America.</p>

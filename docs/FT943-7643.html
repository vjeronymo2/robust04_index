			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Swiss army knives cut no ice with US court Where does the Swiss army knife come from? According to a US appeal court judgment, the knife of many parts can come from any country, since the words 'Swiss army' describe a type of knife and are not 'location-specific'. The ruling has angered Swiss producers of the genuine article, who are under attack from cheap red Chinese imitations and claim there has been trespassing on their intellectual property. 'The Americans make such a fuss about protecting consumers and intellectual property rights, and then they do this. We were very upset,' said Maurice Cachot, chief executive of Wenger, one of the two companies that supply the pocket knives to the Swiss army. Wenger and Victorinox, the other Swiss maker, say they are not particularly worried about competition from the cheap Chinese imitations because they say the Chinese knives are obviously of inferior quality. What does worry them is that the judgment is a licence to precision manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Britain and other industrialised countries, which could make a better job of imitating the Swiss article. Consumer information is also an issue: a survey showed that most Americans believe that when they buy a red, multi-gadget pocket knife they are buying a Swiss product. The Chinese set alarms ringing in the Alps two years ago by painting the Swiss white cross symbol and the words 'Swiss army' on their exports to the US. The Swiss and their US distributors replied to this cheeky challenge with a lawsuit in September 1992, accusing Arrow Trading, the US distributor for the Chinese, of qualitatively and geographically false advertising. They also won an injunction prohibiting Arrow from using the words 'Swiss army' and the cross symbol until the case was decided. A year later, they won their case, but then lost on appeal last month. As well as ruling that 'Swiss army' was not location specific, the court said Arrow's conduct in promoting its knives might be misleading. It ordered a new hearing to resolve that issue. The court also lifted the injunction against Arrow using the Swiss army name and cross.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (7): Brain, not brawn, is the key to the future - Paul Cheeseright examines the region's academic-industrial nexus Sunflower husks can be turned into cellulose and used as a thickening agent in paints. This was established at an agri-industries laboratory in Toulouse where scientific work is taking place in an effort to breathe new life into the harassed agricultural sector. Every year students arrive at the design centre of Aerospatiale-Avions, where the Airbus is assembled, and take part in research projects, while Aerospatiale engineers provide tuition at the two graduate engineering schools, the grandes ecoles, with which it maintains close relations. Pierre Fabre, the second largest privately-owned pharmaceuticals group in France, will by the end of this year establish an international centre to study skin ageing at one of the Toulouse university hospitals. These links between the academic and research world, on one hand, and industry, on the other, point to the broad economic and scientific policy espoused by national, regional and local government and paid at least lip service by the private sector. This policy is to assure economic growth and sharpen an international commercial edge by creating a cluster of industries and academic institutions, where each feeds off the other and the future is brain, not brawn; white collar, not blue collar. In terms of people, the infrastructure is already there. Figures trip off the tongues of Toulouse enthusiasts: nearly 90,000 university students, four universities, 10 graduate engineering schools in and around, about 350 research laboratories, about 11,500 research workers, 10,000 jobs created a year and so on. But in terms of securing a future through growth, the policy is unproven. Recession has shown no mercy. Unemployment in Toulouse has not been less than the national average. What is clear, however, is the paramount role of the public sector. Of the 11,500 research workers, the private sector, according to official figures, employs just 1,500. Most of the university laboratories are supported either by the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the National Institute for Health and Medical Research, both state bodies. CNRS officials note that it directly manages 20 laboratories in Toulouse and is in association with 40 others. Not that there is anything surprising in this. The scientific research the laboratories undertake will have a commercial application only in 10 or 12 years' time. 'In a public laboratory we must be creative,' says Mr Gerard Goma, who runs a biochemical and food engineering laboratory. Such creativity is now spinning off into joint research ventures between the public sector institutions and Matra on space computing, Alcatel on multimedia communication, Technofan on turbomachine acoustics and Siemens on automotive electronics. Such joint activity is more widely practised in the Midi-Pyrenees region than anywhere else in France. Clearly, the nearer the scientific idea gets to the marketplace, the greater will be the interest of the private sector. But in some cases relations between the public sector scientists and industry are bound to be difficult. Mr Michel Wright, research director of a pharmacology and toxicology centre, says that as a public laboratory, it has to publish its results, but this is unacceptable to pharmaceutical companies, the main potential clients for its work. 'The best way to collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry is to provide them with complementary results, exploring along the lines of their own interests,' Mr Wright says. More generally, the classic form of contact between a company and a laboratory is the research contract, where, in effect, companies are using the expertise of state institutions to undertake work which they cannot, or are unwilling, to do themselves. The extent to which this is taking place is difficult to gauge precisely. Mr Alain Costes, director of the centre for automation and systems analysis, calculates that 220 such contracts are signed each year in Toulouse. City officials variously claim 700 or 1,000 contracts a year. Of these contracts, 70 per cent are signed by companies employing 500 or more people, suggesting that in France, as in the UK, there remains the perennial economic problem of how to raise the technological levels of smaller companies. Technology transfer in Toulouse is seen largely as a question of bringing companies and the broad academic sector into collaboration. Specialists in this area acknowledge that little has so far been achieved in spreading expertise into small manufacturing companies. Mr Costes has tried to solve this problem by setting up affiliate clubs whereby his institution can reach small companies via large companies that already have relations with the laboratory and sub-contracting arrangements, and via colleges, lower down the academic strata, with which small companies are more likely to have contact. Smaller companies probably are most likely to be drawn into the industrial-academic nexus through larger groups, as assemblers, like Aerospatiale, redefine their relations with component suppliers and their sub-contractors. The overriding demand for quality and safety in the finished product creates its own demand for higher technology. In Toulouse, it is acknowledged that there is a lot to learn and deep cultural divides to cross. As one businessman noted of the academics, they are very good at devising products and coming up with ideas, but they are bad at industry.</p>

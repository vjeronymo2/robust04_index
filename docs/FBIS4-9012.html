			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- The final version of a  draft agreement on the restructuring of Bulgaria's debt to its  commercial creditors was presented in Frankfurt today, national  radio said. Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, head of the  Bulgarian delegation to the talks, and Deutsche Bank Director  Peter Tilch, coordinator of the London Club of commercial  bankers, today briefed the press on the key parameters of the  draft agreement, radio correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov reported  from Frankfurt. Bulgaria's debt to the London Club totals $8,700  million, of which about $2,000 million in arrears of interest.  25 percent of the debt is repayable in the short term. About  $850 million are to be paid in debt service by the end of 1994.    "So far the European Union, G-24, the IMF and the World Bank  have promised and will extend about $1,000 million," Aleksandrov  said, "so that, thanks to the international financial and  economic institutions, Bulgaria will be in a position to make  these payments." According to Mr. Tilch, there are different  options for the implementation of the deal, guaranteeing  Bulgaria at least 36 percent debt reduction. Depending on the  choice of option -- repurchasing of debt, re-investment by  foreign creditors, etc.    Bulgaria could get a debt reduction of over 50 percent, Mr.  Tilch said. It is too early to cite an exact figure because it  is not known which option will be chosen by the 400-odd banks.    "We wish to establish a lasting presence in business with  Bulgaria and will act accordingly. In its present version the  agreement is a real breakthrough in the complicated foreign debt  problem. I hope that by the end of May you will have settled  all technicalities. A long-term agreement with Bulgaria would  greatly encourage financial and industrial circles showing  interest in investing in Bulgaria", Deutsche Bank director told  national radio. On his part Finance Minister Aleksandrov  expressed satisfaction with the outcome of three years of  negotiations and observed that this was the Bulgarian  Government's most important task in the foreign economic field.  Mr. Aleksandrov noted the special understanding shown by the  international financial institutions for Bulgaria's present  problems which has found expression in the credits they have  extended. "The rest remains with us -- to step up the economic  reform and above all privatization," Finance Minister  Aleksandrov said.    Two days ago Bulgaria reached an agreement on the debt to  its  official creditors of the Paris Club.</p>

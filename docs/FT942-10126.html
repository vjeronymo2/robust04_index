			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'Asian Delight' tempts Thai palates - How Lever Brothers has benefited from the growth of ice cream consumption Unlike some of Bangkok's raunchier roadside advertisements, the enormous billboards depicting a woman's red lips invitingly parted have nothing to do with the sex industry; they are selling Wall's ice cream. Japanese corporations dominate south-east Asian markets for cars and consumer electronics, but western companies such as the Anglo-Dutch Unilever  -owner of the Wall's brand - are influential players in Asia when it comes to branded foods and household goods. Lever Brothers (Thailand), wholly-owned by Unilever, has been operating in the country for more than 60 years and says it is dominant in six of the nine markets in which it competes, including ice cream and hair care products (dominance is defined as having a market share at least 50 per cent bigger than your nearest rival). Thai demand for branded shampoos is well-established - Kao of Japan is credited with opening the market more than 20 years ago and Lever took a dominant position by the end of the 1980s - but the growth of ice cream consumption is a phenomenon of the 1990s. Although Thailand's economy has been expanding steadily for 40 years, only recently has the disposable income of most Thais been able to stretch to ice cream. 'Until 1990 the market was very basic and primitive,' says Viroj Phutrakul, chairman of Lever Brothers (Thailand). 'Availability was not good and visibility was awful.' The main ice cream company in Thailand was Foremost, originally introduced to cater for American servicemen during the Vietnam war. Then in the 1990s, Viroj says, 'the market absolutely exploded'. Consumption rose from 20m litres a year to the current 55m, which is worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.40m) at ex-factory prices. In the long term, the market could increase fivefold from the present level. Lever entered the fray four years ago by making 5m litres a year and found that its factory was producing at full capacity within a year. Now the company can produce 35m litres and is increasing capacity to 50m by July. In 1992, Lever bought Foremost, and recently shut down the Foremost factory. Lever now claims a dominant 67 per cent share of the Thai ice cream market, and says it is especially strong in the profitable 'impulse buying' sector. Ice cream helped raise Lever's overall Thai turnover last year by 25 per cent to about Dollars 440m - pre-tax profit was about Dollars 40m - and sales this year are expected to rise another 18 per cent. Viroj, 59, who graduated in economics from Sheffield University and worked his way up the Unilever ranks, says Thailand is a particularly good market for a multinational company because it has a large, young and culturally homogeneous population; most of the country's 58m people are ethnic Thai Buddhists who share similar tastes in food. Multinationals, however, still need to adapt their international strategies to local tastes. Just as Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisees offer extra-spicy meals to suit the Thai palate, so Lever adjusts the ingredients and the brands of Wall's ice cream for Asian markets. Ice cream in Thailand has a lower fat content than the formulation used in colder climates, and Lever has introduced an 'Asian Delight' Wall's brand in red bean or taro (a type of sweet potato) flavours. There are some difficulties in distributing ice cream in Thailand, including the high proportion of people living in far-flung parts of the countryside and Bangkok's notorious traffic jams; the take-home market is limited by the fact that ice cream often melts in the car before shoppers can reach their houses. But the hot climate and the increasing wealth of Thai consumers makes Thailand a tempting and accessible market. No less than 95 per cent of Bangkok households have television, and 60 per cent of Lever's overall sales in the capital now go through modern supermarkets and stores rather than the small shops more common in the provinces. Lever has doubled its budget for research into Thai consumers in the last three years. An entrepreneurial economy also means that companies can conceive and launch brands in 18 months or two years, compared with as much as five years in Europe, says Viroj. So much so, indeed, that Lever is unlikely to be allowed to maintain its ice cream dominance: Nestle is rumoured to be attempting to buy one of the smaller Thai ice cream manufacturers.</p>

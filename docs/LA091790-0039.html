			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB LEAGUE OFFICIAL SEES NO HOPE FOR UNITY;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: 'CONFLICTS HAVE SUBMERGED OUR SHARED PRIORITIES,' SAYS ENVOY WHO HAS  RESIGNED.  </P> <P> Describing the Arab world as "fragmented to a terrible and unprecedented degree  by the events in the gulf," the man who for 11 years represented the Arab  League in the United States and the United Nations has explained his recent  resignation by saying that he sees no prospect that the league can recover its  unity.  </P> <P> Clovis Maksoud, a former Lebanese journalist, said in a telephone interview  over the weekend that he will remain at his post until the end of September.  </P> <P> "Throughout my term of office I have looked upon the Arab League as the Arab  national home," Maksoud said in a letter made public late last week. "Now the  Arab house has fallen on itself, and the conflicts have submerged our shared  priorities. Unable to rationalize or analyze these developments, I am no longer  able to cope with them."  </P> <P> His letter faulted Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, as well as Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait for immediately calling for U.S. troops, rather than seeking an "Arab  solution."  </P> <P> "On the one hand, I cannot accept the violation of an established legality --  the invasion of Kuwait," the envoy wrote in a letter addressed to Chedli Klibi,  who had earlier resigned as secretary general of the 22-member league. "On the  other, I cannot accept the rush towards the internationalization of the crisis.  The original action was wrong and the ensuing reaction is wrong. . . . I feel  in all honesty unable to do my duty after the Arab world has been dragged into  the depths and fragmented in such a way."  </P> <P> The worst of it, Maksoud lamented in the telephone interview, is that what he  considers Arab national interests -- such as Palestinian rights, the return of  territories occupied by Israel and the restoration of Lebanon's unity -- will  be indefinitely postponed by the clash in the gulf.  </P> <P> "In 11 years here I have established some credibility," the normally buoyant  Lebanese declared bitterly. "I can't say there is an Arab position on anything  anymore."  </P> <P> Maksoud said Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim Hoss has told him that Lebanon will  ask other Arab states to join in calling for his withdrawal of the resignation.  </P></p>

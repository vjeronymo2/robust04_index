			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Paisley says documents are 'positive proof of double dealing' The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said yesterday in Belfast that documents relating to secret contacts between the government and the IRA were 'positive proof of the double dealing and lying of the secretary of state', Jimmy Burns writes. He also alleged that the IRA had threatened to kill him because of his opposition to its possible involvement in the peace process. Security sources said they had no evidence of that.</p>

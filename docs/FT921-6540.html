			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Restructuring at BCI BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the state-owned bank, has been restructured, grouping its activities into three separate holdings to cover domestic banking operations, foreign banking, and para-banking activities such as leasing, factoring and investment. The move is primarily for fiscal reasons to comply with new regulations in the 1992 budget law approved on December 30 and means the elimination of BCI's property division. The budget law obliged the bank to revalue its property assets and this week the board approved an increase in the latter's book value of L1,390bn (Dollars 1.13bn), bringing the total to L5,330bn. If the property division had been retained separately the increased book value of the four holdings would reportedly have been L7,343bn. The new holdings will be called Comit Holding Italia, Comit Holding International and Comit Holding respectively. The board has also announced preliminary results for 1991 with gross operating earnings of L1,139bn against L1,111bn in 1990 a modest 2.5 per cent increase.</p>

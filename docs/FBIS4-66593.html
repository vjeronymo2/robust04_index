			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "India's Defensive Stance Harmful"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, February 18--India's response to the  Clinton remarks on human rights and Kashmir, described by some  observers as "official" rather than "political," appears on  second reflection to be confused and vacillating, if not  downright weak. At the time of the Raphel controversy, the  official aide memoire had not only characterised the  American position as being a "qualitative shift" but "an  excessively negative policy assertion." If an assistant  secretary's remarks had occasioned such strong language, it is  indeed surprising that the American president's own record of  insensitivity to Indian concerns are meriting such polite  responses.    The press statement issued in New Delhi on Wednesday, in  fact, goes out of its way to signal to the United States that  while something has to be said about President Clinton's  tendency to appear to be rooting for Pakistan, the United States  need not take it amiss because as it notes "India shares  President Clinton's strong interest in reducing tension in South  Asia ..." In the light of the comfort that anti-Indian elements  in Kashmir and Punjab have got from the president's remarks  beginning with his lumping Kashmir as an area where civil war  was taking place, to his expression of common concern over human  rights in that state with the country which has supplied the  insurgents there with direction, training and weapons, South  Block's pussilanimity is bound to encourage rather than  discourage the White House in persisting with its tilt. There  can be no doubt of the encouragement that the remarks will give  to sundry terrorists, insurgents and nations like Pakistan who  have a grouse against India.    Remarkably, the Indian response has failed to highlight the  major gap in President Clinton's remarks as well as what ought  to be the major thrust of its own policy pinpointing the role of  Pakistan as an abettor of state-sponsored terrorism. New Delhi's  failure in convincing America, and indeed the world, of this is  not because it lacks evidence of Pakistani actions, but that it  is unable to find courage to express its outrage at events like  the Bombay blasts, or the continued support for cross-border  terrorism from Pakistan.    Though 1993, especially after a series of statements and  actions from Washington D.C., began to indicate that a  pro-Pakistan tilt was emerging, officials in New Delhi have been  advocating that India turn the other check so as to move ahead  on an agenda which benefits India such as trade, investment,  technology transfer and even a dialogue on non-proliferation  issues. Unfortunately, they have permitted the United States to  push its own skewed agenda which is being perceived by many to  be inimical to India's sovereignty. Instead of finessing India's  most important, and in a sense, difficult relationship, South  Block seems to be responding in a confused and ad hoc fashion  which is only likely to see increased American meddling since  no one has bothered to spell out any Indian bottom line in its  relationship with the United States till now.    A major weakness of the Indian response has been its  excessively defensive tone. In the world of  realpolitik it signifies that either India is weak or  that its case is. Considering the access being given to foreign  diplomats, and most recently the International Red Cross to  visit Kashmir, such a posture towards Washington appears  strange. India is involved in fighting a difficult battle in  Kashmir. Foreigners, including Americans who have seen the  difficulties faced in Somalia and Bosnia are reacting not so  much to India's record, which is middling-to-bad in Kashmir, but  its defensiveness, which in some eyes betokens a weakness which  can be exploited.    Almost egregiously, Wednesday's statement has made claims on  India's nuclear posture that require some clarification from the  government. In responding to its observation that "Pakistan's  nuclear intentions are well-known and confirmed time and again,"  the statement declares "India neither has nor intends to acquire  weapons of mass destruction." This is an extraordinarily  definitive statement which appears to be at variance with the  much more ambiguous, and therefore deterrent, posture adopted by  the government till now that it will do whatever needed for the  defence of the country, and its unstated belief that its  unsafeguarded nuclear power programme and proven nuclear  capacity are its real insurance against nuclear adventurism, not  brave words.</p>

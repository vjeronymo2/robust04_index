			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German repo rate falls THE minimum rate for German 15-day securities repurchase agreements fell 9 basis points to 6.29 per cent at the Bundesbank's latest open-market operation, writes Conner Middelmann. A substantial drop in the repo rate had been widely expected after the rate for D-Mark overnight funds eased by about 10 to 15 basis points last week. Call money remained unchanged after the operation at about 6.30 per cent due to a DM3.2bn liquidity drain at the allocation. In spite of this week's larger drop in the repo rate - following last week's tiny one basis-point reduction - most market participants do not expect the Bundesbank council to lower Germany's leading discount and Lombard rates at its meeting tomorrow. The council meets again on December 2 and 18, and most traders are betting on another round of key rate cuts at either of these meetings. The Dutch central bank swiftly followed the Bundesbank, cutting its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 6 per cent. The move had been widely expected and caused no ripples. Also as expected, the Danish central bank cut its two-week certificate of deposit rate by  1/4 percentage point to 7.50 per cent following Monday's 1/4 point cut in its discount and deposit rates to 6.75 per cent. Austria left its rates unchanged. The discount and Lombard rates are 1/2 point below German levels and the central bank cut its GOMEX rate by 10 basis points to 6.1 per cent last week. According to Mr Andre de Silva, market strategist at PaineWebber International, the French and Belgian authorities might soon be tempted to shave official rates. Having lagged behind the Bundesbank's rate cuts in recent months, 'lower money market rates in Germany plus a relatively firm franc could well prove irresistible (for the Bank of France) and see 20 basis points off the intervention rate', currently at 6.45 per cent, he said. In Belgium, the focus remains on the government talks for a social pact. 'If a deal is struck today, we could see a rate cut by the end of the week,' said Mr de Silva. In the sterling money market, the Bank of England forecast a flat liquidity situation and carried out no money market operations. The short sterling future rose 0.03 point to 94.47.</p>

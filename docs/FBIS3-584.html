He said it is clear that general calls to the  Bophuthatswana government have not helped and that if necessary  discipline must be enforced by the security forces in an  impartial manner.    At a news conference on the last day of his northern  Transvaal election campaign road show, President de Klerk said  he had discussed the issue with ANC [African National Congress]  leader Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela had raised the question of  state intervention in Bophuthatswana with him.    President de Klerk said he had told Mr. Mandela that his  security and other advisers were keeping him fully briefed on  the situation in the homeland and that any intervention would  depend on whether the lives and property of South Africans were  in danger. He said he would possibly make a statement on the  matter by tomorrow.</p>

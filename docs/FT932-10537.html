			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Germany's states apply brakes to railway sell-off GERMANY'S plan to privatise its loss-making railways suffered a severe setback yesterday after the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, tried to water down legislation drafted earlier this year. The Bundesrat, which represents the interests of the 16 federal states, recommended rail infrastructure should remain state-owned to ensure that remote regions are not disadvantaged. It also demanded an additional DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn) from the federal budget before the states take over the commuter trains network. It called for the federal oil tax to be increased and said 25 per cent of the revenue should be distributed to the states to finance the commuter network. In February, the government approved comprehensive railway reform to pave the way for privatisation of the rail network after 2002. The government plans to create, in three years, three independent companies responsible for national passenger traffic, freight and infrastructure maintenance. It aims to decentralise the rail network and make states responsible for all but interstate rail links. Bundesrat resistance threatens to bog down the privatisation process, with the federal and state governments wrangling to find a compromise. The Bundesrat, where the Social Democrats have a majority, is also likely to oppose other privatisation projects of the Bonn government, including telecommunications. Reacting to the Bundesrat's proposals, the German Industry Federation, said rail reform 'would be turned upside down if the state remained in charge of the infrastructure.' It warned that an increase in the oil tax would be 'disastrous' and weaken the financial position of German enterprises. The government's rail privatisation plan is designed to reduce the huge drain on the federal budget caused by subsidies to the railways, which last year had a DM14.8bn deficit and a DM70bn debt burden. But the government has yet to agree how to finance its plan until the railways are fully privatised in 10 years. Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister who resigned on Thursday, drew widespread criticism when he proposed to tax the use of motorways. Mr Matthias Wissam, his successor, put on a brave face on his first day in office yesterday, stressing rail reform was a 'top priority'. Germany and Poland yesterday signed an agreement to control the flow of illegal asylum seekers over their border, Quentin Peel writes in Bonn. Poland has agreed to take back up to 10,000 of such would-be immigrants to Germany in the rest of 1993 and an unlimited number in 1994. Germany will pay Poland DM120m to meet the cost of greater border security and to provide transport and accommodation for deportees. The agreement was signed in Bonn by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German interior minister, and Mr Andrei Milczanowski, his Polish counterpart. It is intended to come into effect once the German parliament has passed new asylum laws, which provide for the rapid processing and deportation of asylum seekers coming from countries with no record of political persecution.</p>

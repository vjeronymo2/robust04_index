			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Opening of Thai motorway ordered A THAI court has ordered that a controversial Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) motorway be opened today, without having solved bitter disputes with the international consortium which has a 30-year concession to build and operate it, William Barnes reports from Bangkok. Mr Sukavich Rangsitpol, governor of the state-run Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority, succeeded in obtaining a court order citing the consortium's breach of contract and bad faith. Mr Takao Ninomiya, managing director of Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the consortium led by Japan's Kumagai Gumi, said he was 'astonished. We have only a few hours remaining. We are a private company with no power; we cannot resist them.' The move to force open the Second Stage Expressway, through the middle of the capital, surprised and dismayed financiers. Some warned it might alienate international investors.</p>

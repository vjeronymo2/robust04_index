			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: NOT EVERY TV BULLETIN ON NORIEGA WAS A NEWS COUP  </P> <P> Frustrations have been building for months. So once again, it's time to unleash  the fury of . . . The Gripe Line. First, a good news/bad news gripe.  </P> <P> We Interrupt This Program. . . . But why? News bulletins are often arbitrary  and unmerited, giving undue emphasis to relatively unimportant events.  </P> <P> An example of good use came Tuesday morning, when ABC, CBS and NBC repeatedly  interrupted their regular programming for accounts of a possible coup attempt  in Panama, where strongman Manuel A. Noriega has been a scourge to the United  States.  </P> <P> The early information was sketchy and conflicting. In its role as the nation's  instant news source, CNN inevitably succumbed to the scattershot  "another-report-we're-getting" syndrome. And there was this from KCBS reporter  Harvey Levin:  </P> <P> "As you've just heard, Panama strongman Manuel Noriega has fallen from power as  the result of a coup." Levin announced it at a 10 a.m. newsbreak. He spoke  those words, firmly and resolutely, moments after Harry Smith of CBS News had  echoed ABC, NBC and CNN in reporting that there was not yet outside  confirmation of Noriega being ousted. Perhaps Levin had independent sources in  Panama.  </P> <P> The bulletins became less frequent as the morning wore on. Confusing? Yes. Yet  merely informing viewers that something of consequence was happening in  strategically important Panama -- more definitive details to follow -- was  ample reason for the bulletins.  </P> <P> That was hardly the case last month when all three networks interrupted their  prime-time programming for live reports on the USAir crash in New York City's  East River that took two lives. Few details were available at the time. Yet the  mere presence of these bulletins -- regardless of their content -- gave undue  weight to the story by giving the erroneous impression that a disaster may have  occurred.  </P> <P> It appeared that these hair-trigger bulletins from the networks were motivated  by competitive pressure and by having accessibility to the crash site, which  translated into pictures.  </P> <P> But that did not translate into good judgment.  </P> <P> The TV Witness Protection Program. What else would you call it when the  identity of someone being interviewed is supposed to be hidden for his or her  protection? But who is kidding whom?  </P> <P> One method of concealment is electronic breakup -- a section of the picture  turning into a sort of cubist blur -- that is designed to hide a person's face  on newscasts. It works fine -- until the person moves suddenly, leaving the  blur behind. Oops, there's the face.  </P> <P> Another method is outright disguise, as on Monday's "Donahue" show featuring  three women claiming to have been molested by clergymen. Their flimsy disguises  -- wigs and sunglasses -- were a joke. What's more, they spoke in their normal  voices, making them easily identifiable to anyone who knew them.  </P> <P> A third method is positioning and lighting, a la the recent "CBS This Morning"  interview with a 13-year-old girl whose mother had delivered her to a man to be  raped as payment for drugs. After the rape, the mother and the man got high  together. They're now in jail.  </P> <P> At one point, CBS shot the girl in a sort of silhouette, with a shaft of the  background light briefly hitting her face and allowing viewers to get a glimpse  of both her eyes. At another point, she was shown from the rear. Meanwhile,  she, too, spoke in her natural voice.  </P> <P> Yes, her identity was shielded, but only from people who didn't know her in the  first place. For all the others, it must have been an easy call.  </P> <P> One wonders about the promises made to interviewees who desire their identities  to remain secret, or possibly in the case of the young girl, promises made to  the authorities charged with protecting the interests of a minor. And one  wonders about the reactions of interviewees upon learning the promises haven't  been kept.  </P> <P> Although the case involving the teen-ager and her mother had already been  widely publicized, the girl's identity had not been revealed. Victimized first  by her mother and the rapist, she was now victimized again by a TV news program  using her to fill a few minutes of air time.  </P> <P> If the implications weren't so sobering, all of this would be almost comical.  It recalls those old movie Westerns in which bank robbers shrewdly disguised  themselves by raising their kerchiefs over their mouths and noses, as if this  alone would hide their identities from those who knew them, even though they  were wearing the clothes they always wore -- including those kerchiefs.  </P> <P> Some of the methods used to disguise TV interviewees are so inept that you  wonder if they're deployed merely for effect, to inject suspense. What I'm  waiting for is the interview where the only person wearing the disguise . . .  is the interviewer.  </P> <P> The Bleep That Doesn't. We've all seen it happen, usually in theatrical movies  aired on regular television. But what in the bleep is gained from erasing  potentially offensive words from a sound track when the deleted words are so  obvious that only an idiot couldn't fill in the blanks?  </P> <P> Credits That Don't Credit. These are the after-show credits that roll by so  fast that they can't be read.  </P> <P> Political Pundits on Talk Shows. One day, someone will blow the whistle on  these people by tallying how often they have been wrong. Aside from that, some  people can't tolerate them on a gut level.  </P> <P> In his latest book, "Harp," John Gregory Dunne describes his reaction to  watching Patrick Buchanan, Robert Novak, Fred Barnes, Morton Kondracke and  Michael Kinsley on CNN:  </P> <P> "I detested those people I was staring at on the tube, the op-ed grandees who  moonlight as talking heads, that symbiotic army of the knowing who would  explain the political process to us, at least as they wish us to believe it  functions." Then Dunne quits softballing and gets tough:  </P> <P> "Plump is the word that fits them best. They are plump of body, plump of mind,  the cholesterol of smarm and self-importance clogging every mental artery,  bloated bladders of hot air (blowing) the most noxious kind of knowingness out  through the cathode tube. They have nothing to tell me, these Kondrackoids of  the process, they have nothing to tell any of us about the United States of  America."  </P> <P> But give them credit, they sure are arrogant.  </P> <P> The Commercial You Can't Bear to Hear. The reason is the irritating voice on  the commercial. It belongs to Robert M. Haft, president of Crown Books, who  sounds like Mickey Mouse when he says: "If you paid full price, you didn't get  it at Crown Books."  </P> <P> The Commercial That Won't Die. You'd have to drive a stake through its heart to  kill that long-running spot for Jack Stephan Plumbing &amp; Heating. The actor  has been changed, but not the awful script. Playing around with the name --  "Stephanski" and so on -- wasn't funny 10 years ago, it isn't funny now and it  won't be funny 10 years from now when, undoubtedly, this dopey commercial will  still be running.  </P> <P> Sort of like The Gripe Line.  </P></p>

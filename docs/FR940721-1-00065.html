			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The operator could charge lenders to have information about their products displayed on the CLO system; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The operator could charge borrowers to use the CLO system; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The operator could charge both lenders and borrowers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The operator could provide the service free of charge to both lenders and borrowers in the belief that providing the service will attract more customers for the operator's related settlement service business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8(a) of RESPA prohibits a lender from paying a CLO operator a referral fee. Section 8(b) of RESPA prohibits a CLO operator from accepting a payment from a borrower ``other than for services actually performed.'' Therefore, in the absence of any regulatory exemption, under RESPA: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (one) Payments by a lender to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a referral fee or is bona fide compensation for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (two) Payments by a borrower to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a sham or duplicative charge, rather than a payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or services actually performed; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (three) When neither borrowers nor lenders pay a fee for the CLO services, only certain disclosures are required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 final rule created an exemption from Section 8 for ``any payment by a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> borrower <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for computer loan origination services,'' as long as certain disclosures were provided (emphasis added). This rule did not address payments made by lenders, thus leaving such payments subject to Section 8 scrutiny. Although the term ``CLO exemption'' is frequently used, including in the preamble of the 1992 final rule, the exemption was not for the CLO itself, but only for payments made for CLO services by borrowers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters were concerned about whether any system that merely claimed to be a CLO deserved to be given an exemption from RESPA's requirements. As noted in the above statement of HUD's objective, the Department seeks to encourage the use of new technology in ways that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Uncertainty about how RESPA applies to CLOs may inhibit their development. Therefore, the Department has determined that continuation of such an exemption is justified; however, the Department seeks to limit the exemption only to payments for access to CLO systems that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments for access to systems that provide such benefits will not be subject to scrutiny under Section 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the 1992 final rule to limit the exemption to payments made by borrowers for services from ``qualified CLOs'' only, and to define qualified CLOs to be those systems that the Department believes provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments by borrowers for services of systems other than ``qualified'' CLOs are not prohibited; rather those payments are subject to scrutiny under the Section 8 test articulated above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the 1992 final rule did not mention payments made by lenders to CLO operators. However, having proposed to limit the scope of the exemption for borrower payments and certain lender payments, the Department asks commenters to address whether a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of ``qualified CLOs'' would be in the best interest of consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Position of the Proposed Rule on CLOs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon a review of the comments and testimony on this issue, the Secretary concluded that the potential of CLOs to be convenient and provide consumers with meaningful information about their choices justified the encouragement of certain CLOs and the continuation of an exemption for borrower payments for certain CLOs. The Secretary also determined that it is necessary to amend the rule to define the type of CLO for which borrower payments are permitted without further RESPA scrutiny, in order to maximize the potential consumer benefits from this developing technology and protect consumers. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the rule to provide that payments made by borrowers for qualified CLO services only are exempt, and to define qualified CLOs as those systems meeting the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Qualified CLOs must be responsive to information about the borrower and provide information regarding loan options for that borrower. (This provision is responsive to commenters who feared that without definition, a system using FAX-transmitted data or even telephone calls might qualify as a CLO system.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Qualified CLOs must meet certain fair participation and display requirements, including that participation and display of loan products from numerous lenders offering various loan products must be allowed, factors for selecting lenders to participate on the CLO system be fair and legitimate; and information on individual loan products must be displayed in a lender-neutral manner. While the Department recognizes that there are practical limits on the number of lenders that can be included usefully on a system, because of technological and other limitations, the proposed rule contemplates that a minimum of 20 lenders will participate on a qualified CLO system. (The Department asks for comments on whether this number is appropriate or another number would better ensure competition while providing a meaningful level of information to the consumer.) The exemption is still available when less than 20 lenders choose to participate, as long as the CLO system remains open to and accepts additional lenders. Selection of lenders for participation must be done as a result of the fair application of impartial criteria, which may include, but are not limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the CLO system ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  first-come, first-served), the quality of services and capabilities a lender provides to consumers, the types of loan products offered by a lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which a lender's participation will increase the variety of loan products offered to consumers by the system. (The application of factors may not be used to avoid the 20 lender requirement.) CLO system operators must have a reasonable justification supported by documentation for selection decisions. No lender may be favored or disfavored by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> manner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in which information regarding the lender or its products is presented to the borrower or is utilized on the system, or by the scope of information that a particular lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Qualified CLOs must provide borrowers with a CLO disclosure form that states that use of the system is not required, space on the system is limited, the full range of products meeting the borrowers' needs may not be listed on the system, and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better terms and conditions including lower rates. A disclosure format for this and other information is set forth in the proposed rule as Appendix E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Qualified CLOs must charge borrowers the same fee for the same CLO service or the same components of service. The exemption does not attempt to fix a price for CLO services; market forces and market experiences should continue to shape the evolution and development of qualified CLO systems. Rather, where fees are charged, all borrowers must be treated equally. If fees are waived by a CLO provider, they must be waived fairly and not because of the choice of a particular lender. If the fee is contingent on use of a loan product on the system, the contingency must apply equally to all loan products and lenders on the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) An operator of a qualified CLO may also charge lenders for access to the system and for a portion of maintenance and operation costs of the system. However, the schedule of charges for each lender on the system must be identical. Furthermore, qualified CLOs must disclose to the borrower, on the form prescribed in Appendix E and on the HUD&hyph;1 or the HUD&hyph;1A, the amount of any anticipated payments by a lender. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Fees and disclosures about the CLO system must also be prominently displayed and visible to the potential borrower on the premises near where the CLO terminal is located. The information that more advantageous loan alternatives may exist that are not displayed on the system must be similarly disclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

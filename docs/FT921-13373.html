			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Double-booked What could be more important than listening to Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England? Tonight's annual dinner of the Manchester Merchant and International Bankers' Association, it seems. I hear that there is an embarrassing clash between the timing of the bankers' booze-up at the Midland Hotel, and the governor's speech at Manchester Business School's celebrity seminar, a quarter of a mile away. ABN-Amro Bank's Howard Middleton, chairman for the dinner, assures me that his keener banker colleagues will be able to squeeze in both events. However, the figures speak for themselves. There will be almost twice as many people sitting down to dinner as listening to the governor.</p>

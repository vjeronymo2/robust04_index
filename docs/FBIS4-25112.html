			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Katsutoshi Sakota] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr -- During an interview with TOKYO  SHIMBUN Chairman Miichiro Kato on 13 April, Chinese Vice Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen asserted that the issue  concerning North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections  should be resolved through dialogue. Because of its expectation  that China will persuade the DPRK to accept full inspections,  the United Nations Security Council recently issued a  non-binding presidential statement while avoiding the adoption  of a resolution urging North Korea to accept nuclear  inspections. Nonetheless, Vice Premier Qian's remarks during  the interview suggest that China also finds it difficult to deal  with the DPRK issue because what it can do is just call for  PRC-DPRK talks.    Behind China's soft stance lies its fear that if hard-line  measures such as economic sanctions are adopted, this will deal  a decisive blow to North Korea, which is currently in a serious  economic crisis.    Such being the case, social unrest will be produced and this  will inevitably affect China. Unlike the United States which is  separated from North Korea by the Pacific Ocean, China is the  DPRK's neighbor. Thus, it is a matter of course for Beijing to  cautiously handle the DPRK issue.    Although China is now hastily promoting a shift to a social  market economy, problems such as inflation have arisen in the  process. Thus, China itself has already had the seeds of social  unrest. It appears that Beijing is trying to avoid another  disturbing factor, which is political unrest in North Korea.    It is also possible that China's influence over the DPRK is  not as great as Western nations expect. Vice Premier Qian  flatly denied the possibility of mutual visits by top leaders of  China and North Korea in the near future, thus giving no  indication that China will take action to persuade the DPRK.    There is a report saying that North Korea recently provided  weapons to the Cambodian Government army. This suggests that  North Korea is making its own efforts to avoid being isolated  from the international community.    For the time being, China will keep watching such efforts by  the DPRK to pay respect to its independency. Although Western  nations believe that China possesses a diplomatic "weapon"  toward Pyongyang, which is its influence over North Korea, it  might be valuable for China not to use it.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN EUROPE, TIME TO GIVE PEACE A CHANCE, COMBINING NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT  </P> <P> The major countries of Europe have now been at peace with one another for the  longest continuous stretch since the days of the Roman Empire. A truly  substantial crisis has not been witnessed for more than a quarter-century.  Therefore it may now be time to take this remarkable phenomenon -- peace --  seriously.  </P> <P> While major war in Europe is not impossible in the foreseeable future, it seems  far from heroic to assume it to be wildly improbable. Since the consequences of  even a non-nuclear major war would be horrendous, it is sensible to be  concerned about it even if its likelihood is slight.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, when the probabilities get low enough, a relaxation of concern  even about calamity begins to become justified. A nuclear war between Britain  and France, or between either (or both) and the United States would be  catastrophic but, because of its low probability, none of these once-hostile  countries spends much time, effort, money or psychic energy guarding against  the danger.  </P> <P> The chances of a war between East and West may not be that low, but they are  getting there.  </P> <P> Although unprecedented peace has prevailed in Europe since 1945, there remain  serious unresolved problems on that once-warlike Continent. Chief among them  are an unnatural division into two camps and the anachronistic empire the  Soviet Union has forced upon unwilling peoples in Eastern Europe. These  problems might best be resolved by confederating the alliances; the conditions  may now be favorable for probing such an unorthodox solution.  </P> <P> The division of Europe is built around two alliances arrayed in military  opposition. If war is no longer a realistic possibility, the two alliances are  essentially unnecessary. Equally unnecessary is the Soviet Union's empire.  Today, Eastern Europe is probably an economic burden on the Soviet Union and  its military usefulness in the days of long-range missiles and diminished  threat of war is highly questionable. Ideological justifications for the empire  can still be spun out, of course, but ideology is in pronounced decline in the  Soviet Union, particularly when it runs up against unpleasant economic  realities.  </P> <P> The logical outcome of all this would be a gradual evisceration of the costly  and useless alliances and empire -- a sort of continentwide Finlandization or  Austrianization as each country wanders off to pursue its independent destiny.  </P> <P> There are two major problems with such a development, however. One concerns  Germany. Without the involvement of the United States and the Soviet Union,  Germany would be the most formidable country in Central Europe. Given the  history of the last century or two, it is too easy to visualize, on the one  hand, eventual conflict or war between two independent Germanys, or, on the  other, a reunification of the two entities leading eventually to hegemonic  domination, militarization and war.  </P> <P> Neither of these dire possibilities may be very likely. With the experience of  two world wars behind them, however, it is understandable that the Soviets (and  many others) would want an arrangement keeping Germany permanently under wraps.  The current arrangement in Europe may be absurd, inefficient and unjust, but at  least seems to guarantee that Germany can be forever prevented from again  perpetrating a major war on its own. Any resolution of the European situation  should need to include a similar perpetual -- or at least seemingly perpetual  -- guarantee.  </P> <P> Another problem with an abandonment of the alliances is that it would leave the  Soviet Union, even if there were significant arms reductions, as the dominant  military entity in the area. Clearly, an attractive plan for a lasting  resolution of the European situation should guard against the possibility of  Soviet domination.  </P> <P> Since it would allow for the potential rise of German revanchism, the  withdrawal of the United States and the Soviet Union from effective  participation in the affairs of Central Europe should be an element within any  effective resolution of the divisions and discontinuities of the Continent.  Since it would allow for the potential Soviet domination of Europe, the  withdrawal of the United States from the affairs of the area is additionally  undesirable; a solution should keep the American counterweight in place.  </P> <P> An economic blending of West and East could be part of a solution. But mutual  economic dependency has been no guarantee against war in the past. Political  and military dependency is also necessary; this could be accomplished with most  direct dispatch by combining the two alliances. If Britain and France can be  linked in an alliance, so perhaps can the United States and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Initially, of course, any confederation of the alliances would feel awkward and  peculiar. It could begin with political consultations and lead to a rough  coordination of military planning. (The Voice of America is far more likely to  bring about a collapse of the Soviet regime than is the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization. VOA will soon have an office in Moscow; why can't NATO?) The role  of France within NATO might form something of a model -- French forces are not  integrated under joint command but they are coordinated with those of NATO.  </P> <P> Bases or training camps might even be exchanged eventually, something that  perhaps can now be contemplated after the sanctity of bases has been violated  by inspectors from the enemy alliance under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces  Treaty. The bases would be at once guarantors of cooperation and hostages to  it. This might lead in time to joint command in places and then to judicious,  balanced and overdue arms reduction in Europe.  </P> <P> Historically, alliances have often been formed as much to control allies as to  confront potential enemies. In a modern confederation, the goal would be to  create a situation in which every country in the area feels it has some control  over the military destiny of every other country and, specifically, one  allowing both the United States and the Soviet Union to maintain control over  the military potential of the two Germanys. Under that circumstance a  relaxation of the Soviet Union's grip on its useless and costly empire in East  Europe would be entirely feasible, as would an eventual German confederation.  Without such a resolution to the German problem, Soviet colonies will be able  to pry themselves free only by causing dangerous unease in Moscow.  </P> <P> A plan that promises at once to solve the German problem and to remove their  East European albatross is likely to have substantial appeal to the Soviets.  And a plan that promises gradually to decolonize East Europe is likely to  reduce Soviet problems in that area by relieving the frustration of Eastern  Europeans and giving them a future to work for. To accept the plan, however,  the Soviets would have to abandon any hegemonic notions they might still  cherish about Europe. If they are still Stalinists at heart, they won't be able  to buy the idea. If they've genuinely changed, they will. It would be a useful  test.  </P></p>

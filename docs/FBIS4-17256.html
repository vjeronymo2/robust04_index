			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr, BNS -- The commander of the  Estonian Defense Forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln  discussed today in Moscow with Russian military command the  possibility of military cooperation between the two countries.    "We don't think our contacts with the Russian military will  stop with the pullout of Russian troops (from Estonia)," Einseln  said in an interview with BNS. "We must look into the future and  map out the course of our cooperation."    Einseln regards training of Estonian officers in Russia as  one of the forms the future cooperation may take. "It would be  useful for our officers just like training in other countries,"  he said.    The general didn't rule out the possibility that Estonia may  purchase military equipment from Russia. "We are interested in  Russian antitank and antiaircraft weapons," he said. "We  received price lists and we shall study the offer together with  other countries' offers."    Estonia is interested in buying Russian armaments, although  it bought a large consignment of weapons from Israel and plans  to adopt NATO standards.    "Estonia hasn't adopted a policy of purchasing its weapons  from one certain country," the commander of the Estonian Defense  Forces said. "We realize the disadvantages of having different  types of arms in one military unit, but we still have a long way  to go and our options are open," Einseln told BNS.    During his visit to Moscow that began on Wednesday [20  April], Einseln had meetings with Colonel General Mikhail  Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian general staff, and with several  officers responsible for foreign relations.    The commander of the Estonian Defense Forces received good  impressions during a visit on Thursday to the Kantemirov  division stationed near Moscow. "The unit looked good," he  commented briefly.    The Russian officers who met with Einseln noted that the  talks were "surprisingly friendly."    "Sometimes we even forgot we faced an Estonian, not  American,  general," one of the participants in the meetigs told BNS.  Einseln himself was more reserved, saying the meetings were  "professional."    This was the Estonian Defense Forces commander's first visit  to Russia. Einseln, who has spent the greater part of his life  in the United States, assumed his present post in 1993. He  retired from the U.S. Army in 1985 after 35 years in service.    Einseln leaves Moscow on Friday after a tour of the Kremlin.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese  at 2332 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a 15-minute  live interview in Tokyo with Masaharu Gotoda, former deputy  prime minister from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by  moderator Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University Professor Yoshiaki  Kobayashi, and political commentator Kenichi Takemura.    At 2333 GMT, Kuroiwa asks Gotoda for his views on the Hata  administration.    Gotoda says: "The Hata Cabinet lacks a power base as a  cabinet under the system of parliamentary democracy. In the  House of Representatives, for instance, little more than one  third of the members belong to the ruling parties, and the  figure drops to one quarter in the House of Councillors."    He adds that as the purpose of political reform is to  introduce responsible political administration, the ruling  coalition should hand over political power to the opposition LDP  and take the blame for causing the recent political chaos.    Gotoda then says: "From the viewpoint of parliamentary  democracy or the parliamentary cabinet system, the Hata Cabinet  is an anomaly," adding that this alone is sufficient reason for  the opposition parties to submit a motion of no-confidence  against the present cabinet.    The topic of discussion moves on to the next general  election, and Gotoda says that right now the next general  election could not be held under the new electoral system  because it is uncertain when the Diet will approve the electoral  redistricting bill.    Gotoda says that although the present cabinet is incapable  of  handling the pending important issues, such as North Korea, tax  reform, and the Naples summit, the possibility of it facing a  no-confidence motion is uncertain because both the LDP and the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are divided over the  matter.    He predicts, though, that even without a vote of  no-confidence the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse,  regardless of the SDPJ's standing demand that it quit.    Gotoda says he is in favor of completing the redistricting  bill as soon as possible so that elections can be held under the  new system. He admits, however, that the Hata cabinet may not  survive until the bill is passed, and the election may have to  be held under the existing system.    "If that happens, the political parties should first promise  voters that efforts to accomplish electoral reform will not be  aborted. Otherwise, the people will not be convinced," he says.    Kobayashi says political realignment, on the basis of policy  on pending issues, is needed before the next general election.  He then asks Gotoda if he would act as leader of a camp  opposing forces led by Ichiro Ozawa.    Gotoda says: "It would be impossible to complete political  realignment before the next general election. I think it will  take several years."    He says political realignment will be completed by the  process of forming successive new administrations over the  course of several general elections.    He says: "There is also the possibility that when the no-  confidence motion is submitted, the coalition may simply  reshuffle its party make-up to provoke the LDP and the SDPJ  rather than dissolving the lower house to conduct a general  election."    He adds that it is most important that the LDP strengthens  its unity to deal with such a situation.    Asked about the possibility of a conservative alliance  between the ruling coalition parties and the LDP, Gotoda says:  "Such an alliance may result in the revival of the 'Taisei  Yokusankai' [an autocratic national political mobilization  organization] seen before World War II."    Finally, at 2345 GMT, Gotoda says: "While both the LDP and  the SDPJ have appeared to acknowledge the end of the '1955  political regime' [post-1955 political order in which the LDP  dominated over the SDPJ and other opposition parties], they  still unconsciously cling to the way things appeared in 1955.    He calls on all parties to deal with pending issues, each  from their own different standpoint.</p>

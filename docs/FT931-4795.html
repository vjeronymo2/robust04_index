			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marriott set to sign deal with bondholders MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotel and food services group, said yesterday it was poised to sign an agreement with disgruntled bondholders. Bondholders have been protesting at the company's plans to spin off its hotel management operations into a separately-quoted entity, Marriott International. One of the protesting groups is led by Chicago-based PPM America, part of the Prudential insurance company of the UK. It was unclear yesterday whether the agreement would resolve the dispute. Marriott declined to say what the terms would be, but they are thought to centre on improvements to the capital structure of the remaining Marriott group, which will house the group's property assets and airport-tollroad concessions. Under the demerger plan, this company, which would be quoted, would be renamed Host Marriott. During the past few months, bondholders have split into two camps. One is a group of large US institutions, thought to include The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and represented by Goldman Sachs. The company's negotiations have been with this group. A second group is led by PPM America. These bondholders, who purchased new Marriott debt securities last year, have already filed one lawsuit against the company, and are threatening to expand the litigation. Yesterday, Mr John Stark, general counsel for PPM America, said the 'litigating' bondholders were not 'specifically aware' of the proposed settlement terms. However, his general understanding was that the deal would not meet their demands that credit quality and trading value of the bonds be fully restored. If this was the case, he said, litigation would still be pursued. Under the original 'demerger' plan, Host Marriott would have retained virtually all Marriott Corporation's Dollars 3bn of long-term debt. By separating out the financially healthy hotel management business, the company hoped to accelerate its expansion, allowing it to take advantage of an upturn in the economy unimpeded by the group's heavy debt burden. Although Marriott shares rose on news of this scheme, bond prices dropped sharply. Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, downgraded Marriott bonds from investment to non-investment grade. The original scheme suggested Marriott International would provide a Dollars 600m credit facility to Host Marriott. During the lengthy negotiations with the Goldman Sachs bondholders, there had been talk of expanding this, perhaps to Dollars 900m. However, sources suggested yesterday the deal would combine an enhanced credit facility with a reshuffling of some debt to Marriott International.</p>

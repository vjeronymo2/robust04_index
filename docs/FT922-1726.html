			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: Time to bag a bagel - Appetisers LEGEND has it that in 1683 a Viennese baker, honouring the king of Poland, created a quirky roll to resemble a stirrup because the monarch's favourite pastime was riding (bagel comes from the German Bugel, for stirrup). Bagels became very popular in Poland, where they were given as gifts to women in childbirth (and by mothers to their children as nutritious teething rings). They were sold on strings in Russian towns, and were said to bring good luck and to have magical powers. Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in eastern Europe introduced the bagel to the US where it is now part of the food culture. Bagels are also big business in the UK. Eaten by the Jewish and east London communities for years, they were bought from small local shops, or from pushcarts on the streets. They were made by hand and eaten warm. You can still buy these from Bagel Bake at 159 Brick Lane, London E1. The bakery is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day (except Jewish holidays); it is worth the journey. Elsewhere in Britain, the New York Bagel Company has brought its products to supermarkets. Tesco, Sainsbury, Safeway, Selfridges and Boots stock them, at 83p for a pack of four, and they come plain or with onion, cinnamon and raisin, garlic, or topped with sesame seeds or poppy seeds. I have eaten them sliced, buttered, toasted or warmed, with and without various fillings, but I still prefer the plain bagel filled in the American way with pastrami and cream cheese. If you work in the Docklands area of London, head for the Hot Bagel Shop at 4 South Quay Plaza, Marsh Wall, Isle of Dogs, E14, which sells very special filled bagels from only Pounds 1. *** Cuban and Philippino cuisine will be featured at festivals planned for later in the year in the St James Court Hotel, Buckingham Gate, Westminster, London. (Tel: 071-834-6655. Fax: 071-828-5802). Cubana Airlines will be flying two chefs to London to prepare authentic Cuban lunch and dinner menus, from September 14-25. The Philippine Festival will take place between November 9 and 20. On both occasions three-course lunches will be available at around Pounds 15 and dinner menus at Pounds 18.</p>

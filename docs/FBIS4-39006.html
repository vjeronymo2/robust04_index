			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia plans a 10-fold reduction of its nuclear  arsenals by the year 2003. This has been announced by Atomic  Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to him, Russia will  retain 3,500 highly efficient nuclear warheads capable of  defending it from any form of aggression. As to nuclear weapons  cuts, Moscow spends up to 1,000 billion rubles a year for these  purposes. An agreement with the United States on processing  weapon-grade uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations only  partially compensates for the losses incurred by Russia due to  the destruction of the nuclear weapons of Ukraine, Belarus, and  Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Numan Ucar, alias Mahir, the </F> commander of the ARGK's -- People's Liberation Army of  Kurdistan -- Zhalah camp in Iraq, by Behcet Avsar, in Cologne;  date not given]    [Excerpts] [Avsar] What were the aims and results of the  operation launched against Zhalah?    [Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack  against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government,  Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to  Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the  Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the  war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does  not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. [passage omitted]    [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and  communications room were destroyed?    [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are  continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading  cadres: The PKK's [Kurdish Workers Party] leading cadres never  stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas  were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading  cadres exist in every locality where we are active. [passage  omitted]    [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah  take the place of al-Biqa'?    [Ucar] [passage omitted] Recently, they tried to divert  attention from the struggle inside the country by stepping up  the propaganda about the Zhalah camp. By claiming to have  destroyed Zhalah, which they asserted has supplanted al-Biqa',  they actually aimed to shore up their image before the  elections. Zhalah camp can never supplant Mahsum Korkmaz  Academy [the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa' valley]. It has assumed  no such function. [passage omitted]    [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation?    [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has  given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a  special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and  intensifying our war. [passage omitted]    [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place  near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk.    [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have  received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in  Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will  participate in these operations. We have made preparations to  retaliate.</p>

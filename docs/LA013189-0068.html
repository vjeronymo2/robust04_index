			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERIMENT WITH STEROIDS PROVIDED A FRIGHTENING LESSON  </P> <P> For 3 weeks in the winter of 1972, while training for her fifth Olympics, Olga  Connolly turned to the world-class athlete's little helper, anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> "I had four kids and a full-time job," she said. "The only time I had for  weightlifting was at night. I was getting nowhere. I was stuck at 165 pounds.  </P> <P> "There's a saying in the discus, that you can throw a foot for each pound you  can bench-press. I needed 186 to beat my personal best."  </P> <P> She said that she took about one-half the men's daily dosage of Dianabol, the  most popular steroid among athletes at the time.  </P> <P> "After 3 weeks, I was bench-pressing 200 pounds," she said.  </P> <P> But she said that she quit when she began to grow hair on her knees.  </P> <P> "My doctor (who had not prescribed the steroids) told me that the next step  would be to go bald," she said.  </P> <P> Connolly said that at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, she realized for  the first time that some women were using steroids. She said that by the 1972  Summer Olympics in Munich, steroid use was widespread. The International  Olympic Committee did not begin testing for steroids until 1976.  </P> <P> "Of 12 discus throwers in the weight room, only three of us weren't on the  drug," she said. "The other nine women were lifting well over 200 pounds, 220  and 230 in some cases. It was really devastating to know that we were beaten  even before we competed.  </P> <P> "I went to the weightlifters and tried desperately to get a steroid booster  shot. But they explained to me that it doesn't work that way."  </P> <P> In 1968, the gold medalist in the women's discus won with a throw of 191 feet 2  inches, more than 27 feet shorter than gold medalist threw 4 years later. The  eighth-place finisher in 1972 had a better throw than the 1968 champion.  Connolly, the 1956 gold medalist with a throw of 176-1, finished sixth in 1968  and 16th in 1972.  </P> <P> "I could either go on steroids or quit completely," she said. "I decided to  quit completely. It wouldn't have been me throwing. It would have been a  completely different organism. There would have been no personal challenge in  it." RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMENTALISM AND UNREST IN INDIA  </P> <P> I would like to say that it is open season on Islam. It is so trendy to dump on  Islam. So convenient to oversimplify -- good guys versus bad guys.  </P> <P> Acts of violence committed by others against Muslims are portrayed to be only  in reaction to some act of the followers of Islam. How foolish it appears to  imply that these poor lambs go about their business peacefully until excited  into action by a person of Islamic faith.  </P> <P> Blaming Hindu fundamentalism on Islamic fundamentalism is mental trickery in  order to skirt the real issue, i.e., minority rights. V.P. Singh is to be  commended for his courageous stand on minority rights -- those of the  untouchables and Muslims. Ignoring real issues and looking for scapegoats are  deception.  </P> <P> SHAMIM IBRAHIM, Lomita  </P></p>

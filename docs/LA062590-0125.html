			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BILLUPS ADMITS GUN CHARGES  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals defensive back Lewis Billups pleaded guilty today in court  to three misdemeanor charges stemming from his January arrest for allegedly  waving a handgun at two undercover Cincinnati police officers.  </P> <P> Billups, 25, pleaded guilty in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to improper  transportation of a firearm and two counts of aggravated menacing, all  first-degree misdemeanors.  </P> <P> Judge Ralph Winkler released Billups on bond and scheduled sentencing for July  31, the week when Bengals players are supposed to report to the team's  preseason training camp in Wilmington, Ohio.  </P> <P> Billups faces maximum penalties of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine on each  of the three charges. In return for his guilty pleas today, Hamilton County  prosecutors dropped a felony charge of carrying a concealed weapon.  </P> <P> Billups was arrested Jan. 4 in suburban northern Kentucky after he allegedly  pointed the gun at two undercover police officers in downtown Cincinnati. The  officers testified that Billups drove off and they chased him across an Ohio  River bridge into Kentucky at speeds of up to 85 m.p.h. before Ft. Wright, Ky.,  police stopped him.  </P> <P> Billups was charged in Kentucky with a misdemeanor offense of carrying a  concealed weapon. On Feb. 14, Kenton County District Judge William Schmaedecke  agreed to allow Billups to perform 40 hours of community service work rather  than stand trial on the charge.  </P></p>

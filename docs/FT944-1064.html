			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Babes in the Wood/Peter Pan - Pantomime Pantomime has returned to Sadler's Wells with a vengeance. Roy Hudd's Babes In The Wood - written by Roy Hudd, directed by Roy Hudd, starring Roy Hudd - is pure, unreconstructed family pantomime in all its tacky glory. Unperturbed by the recent new wave of children-orientated Christmas shows - which have done away with dames, principle boys, blue jokes and TV stars in favour of proper storylines and fuller characters - this show is as flimsy and ridiculous as the glittery costumes and scenery. Yet it manages to avoid the true excesses of the totally commercial show (there are no sports personalities or weather girls in sight) and it demonstrates how the full blown panto is next of kin to the variety show, demanding performers who can do the business: tap dancing, add libbing, the lot. The story is the traditional Babes In The Wood/Robin Hood conflation. The plot is scarcely important here: this is old fashioned panto where plot is just an excuse for a series of gags, routines and set pieces - effect is everything. And most ingredients you could wish for are in here - a messy kitchen scene, plenty of slapstick, a few double entendres, a totally unfounded dance scene (what were all those czardas dancers doing in Sherwood Forest anyway?) and more corpsing than the average morgue . . . Keith Barron, as the Sheriff of Nottingham, makes a commanding and thoroughly enjoyable baddy (so he plans to double taxes, eh? Oh outrageous. It will be VAT on fuel next); Julie Mullins is suitably sickly as Maid Marion and Lisa Hull is glamorously preposterous as Robin Hood. Jack Tripp, amusing as Nurse Ribena, is advertised on the programme as 'Britain's Greatest Dame'. I beg to differ - once you have seen Stanley Baxter do the striptease, no one else comes near. But the stars of the show are, of course, the dopey duo of henchmen hired to kill the babes in the wood, Geoffrey Hughes and Roy Hudd. Hudd, in a series of virulent smocks and stockings, his face beaming with that gap toothed smile like a crazy turnip lantern, is a force to be reckoned with. He holds the stage whenever he is on it, and his comic timing and easy, genial relationship with the audience makes him irresistible and galvanises the show. The script proceeds on the understanding that the old ones are the best, which is true half of the time, but there is an occasional whiff of mothballs, and political jokes are pretty limp, while some of the corpsing is perhaps more fun for those on the stage than those off it. The show outstays its welcome, particularly for the children; it is broadly enjoyable, rather than downright hilarious. Piers Chater-Robinson's version of JM Barrie's classic at the Cambridge Theatre, WC2 is sub-titled Peter Pan 'The British Musical'. Perhaps we could retitle it 'A British Musical' in the hope that someone else will fly in to repair the damage; it would be depressing to think that this saccharine, superficial piece was the last word in musical adaptations. Now revived by Chater-Robinson with two new songs at the Cambridge Theatre, this version (the programme tells us) was first published in 1985, is now in its second edition and has enjoyed many revivals - so it is clearly as buoyant, popular and indestructible as Peter himself. Though quite why is beyond me; right from the pounding overture, with the lights whirling in a demented fashion around the auditorium, it goes all out for a young audience offering them large chunks of cuteness, cod rock and roll, and feeble characterisation. All right, there are some redeeming features. It tells the story clearly (a plus for the young children) and it looks pretty, with a charming Darling household and a backdrop of twinkly stars. It picks up in the scenes with the pirates, when the songs are quite funny and Ron Moody, as Captain Hook, adds a touch of spice. With his lugubrious features and bedraggled wig, looking like Charles II after a bad night on the tiles, he plays the audience well, ad libs admirably and steps out of character just enough to lift the show. At one point, he creeps right to the front of the stage, to a sea of hissing and booing, and remarks, deadpan, 'How still is the night'. But every time the show gets going, back comes the music to drown it all in a ghastly, gooey sauce. It goes for cuteness at every turn. Nicola Stapleton is perky as Peter, but under-used - there is no real sense of Pan's cheekiness, subversiveness or charisma in the character as he is drawn here. Debbie Wall gives a gutsy performance as Wendy but is foiled by winsome lyrics and feeble dialogue. Worst of all, as Tinkerbell's light flickers after drinking poison and Peter turns to the audience, who are all poised on the edge of their seats with the words 'We believe in fairies' ready on their lips, some sickening, piped chorus of children starts warbling 'You've Gotta Believe' over the loudspeakers. If I were Tinkerbell, it would have finished me off. It certainly confounded the audience.</p>

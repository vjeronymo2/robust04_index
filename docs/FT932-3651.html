			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: Labour's leading lady FIGHTING ALL THE WAY by Barbara Castle Macmillan Pounds 20, 626 pages BARBARA CASTLE was the Labour Party's Margaret Thatcher, or should have been. They have different beliefs and Mrs Castle never even became party leader, let alone prime minister. Yet in character and background they have a great deal in common. Even in their politics they have a shared suspicion of the European Community. Mrs Castle's misfortune was to have been born too early - four years before the outbreak of the first world war. There was never a chance that a woman could make it to the very top in her generation, especially in the Labour Party. When she was seeking to become a parliamentary candidate in the early 1940s, an old trade union hand told her bluntly: 'Women won't vote for women.' Still, it is possible that Mrs Castle's pioneering in one party made it easier for Mrs Thatcher in another. Barbara Betts, as she was born, owed a lot to her father, who worked for the inland revenue but was also a socialist intellectual who wrote poems. The north country family was not well off. Like Margaret Roberts from Grantham she went to Oxford at a time when that was relatively unusual for a girl from a poor background. With her customary flexibility, Mrs Castle believes that once women had achieved equality - such as being allowed to speak at the union and have wine at dinner - there was no need for mixed colleges. The length and depth of her political training are remarkable. After what she regarded as the shame of an Oxford third, she went in for party propaganda, being proclaimed in Ashton-under-Lyne as 'a unique phenomenon - a woman wot speaks'. She knew most of the leading figures in the party early on and wrote a joint column in Tribune with Michael Foot. She was already a figure at party conferences, and had even called for limiting the trade union block vote, before she entered parliament in 1945. Almost at once she became a parliamentary private secretary to Stafford Cripps, then to Harold Wilson. Those were the liberal days when a PPS was allowed to vote against the government. By 1950 she was a member of the party's national executive committee. Probably her closest political ally was Aneurin Bevan, who she thinks would have had a healthy influence on the left had he not died in 1960. Mrs Castle disliked Hugh Gaitskell intensely, and in the long period of Labour opposition spent much of her time working with the Movement for Colonial Freedom - a fascinating part of her memoirs. Much of the rest of the volume is more familiar, from not only her own diaries but also those of her colleagues: Wilson, Crossman, Healey, Jenkins and Benn. She was the first minister for overseas development to be in the cabinet; the (non-driving) transport minister who introduced seat belts and breath tests; then she came a cropper with 'In Place of Strife' when ultimately only Harold Wilson supported her attempts to reform trade union legislation. She left office completely when Wilson was succeeded as prime minister by James Callaghan, a man whom she plainly disliked as much as she had Gaitskell. Still, some insights are new. She was not conventionally left wing and she has a nice turn of phrase: on Tony Benn - 'I had an uneasy feeling from time to time that something was not quite in focus.' She says that her own view about the Labour Party is like that of the present Bishop of Durham on Christianity - 'continuing to assert the faith while shedding those doctrinal elements which no longer seem appropriate.' I did not know that Mrs Castle wanted to be foreign secretary when Labour returned in 1974, but that is what she claims. On her desire for the premiership, she is quite open, yet honest enough to recognise it was not within her grasp. She never schemed for it. Perhaps her most surprising characteristic was her total hostility to the European Community in the years when Britain was seeking to join. There was a mild conversion when she became a member of the European Parliament in the 1980s, but a pro-European Castle earlier on might have tilted the balance in the Labour Party. With these memoirs Mrs Castle is back with the Healeys and the Jenkins which is where she belongs. She leaves no doubt of her admiration for Mrs Thatcher's determination, but must be pleased to have got in first. Lady Thatcher's memoirs are due in the autumn.</p>

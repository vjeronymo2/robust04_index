			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle published in </F> the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO; place and date not  given]    [Text] [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Conducting a provisional  stocktaking of your administration, what has satisfied you most  and what are the frustrations after four and a half years of  tenure?    [Lacalle] Considering we are a minority government--of which  we were already aware before the 1989 elections--I believe we  have accomplished quite a lot.    Indeed, we have done everything we were permitted. We could  not do some things because we lacked the support of Congress or  of the citizenship--as in the case of the Law on  Government-Owned Enterprises. This was the fate of the two most  important issues the country must resolve, namely the social  security system and the privatization of state-run enterprises.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What happened to those questions?    [Lacalle] It is very simple. The privatization of  government-owned enterprises came under fire at the plebiscite.  [Former president and Colorado Party leader] Dr. Julio Maria  Sanguinetti and left-wing sectors campaigned against it under  the slogan "Vote Against the Government." It goes without saying  that they won a political victory, but they acted like a brake  on the modernization of Uruguay, slowing it by several years.    Moreover, they acted even though Congress had enacted a  watered down and tempered privatization law.    With regard to social security, we submitted a reform bill  to  Congress but we could not muster the necessary votes to pass it.    Last year, for example, the state had to subsidize the  social  security system to the tune of $282 million.    Imagine what that means to a country whose annual export  earnings total $1.7 billion. This situation affects the  competitiveness of companies because labor is very expensive in  Uruguay and the cost of living goes up for workers. This may  sound a bit pompous, but our responsibility to our country and  to history is saved.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about Dr. Sanguinetti,  who considers the Broad Front as his only political opponent in  the run-up to the elections? He even predicts that the 27  November elections will polarize voters around himself and  [Broad Front presidential candidate] Tabare Vazquez?    [Lacalle] As I do not like making political prophecies, I  will tell you an anecdote. Before the 1989 elections, the  Colorado Party contended that it would govern until the year  2000, and that its main rival was the Broad Front.    All the public opinion polls supported this forecast. Six  months later, I won the elections by the greatest margin ever  recorded in our history. Sanguinetti is merely using a political  strategy.    If you want to know why, you must ask him.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The problem is that for the time being  he  does not want to talk to the press.    [Lacalle] Well, Dr. Sanguinetti said something very  important  in Buenos Aires, on [Bernardo] Neustadt's television program. He  said: "We do just fine until we open our mouths."    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The local press say you have lost clout  with your own political faction and that you are unable to  impose Senator Juan Andres Ramirez's candidacy. Is that true?    [Lacalle] I have been in politics for 35 years and was the  first elected "Blanco" [Party] president in 160 years. During  those years, I have fallen and started anew. I have endured  bombs planted by Tupamaros guerrillas and the action of hooded  military men, and I have lost more elections than I have won.  This is just another circumstance, but I will respond in a more  precise way on 28 November.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about of Argentine  interest in joining NAFTA?    [Lacalle] Brazil and Argentina are interested in other forms  of integration because of their internal policies and not  because they are not interested in the Mercosur [Common Market  of the South]. Argentina is determined over the issue of NAFTA  and Brazil has a project, which to some extent is an alternative  to Mercosur--the South America Free Trade Zone. I believe it is  a big mistake because political anxiety is the worst fate to  befall a country's foreign policy.    By signing the Treaty of Asuncion, we committed ourselves to  establishing one of the largest markets in the world. If we do  so appropriately and expeditiously, we can partake in this game  of giants in which economic blocs rather than individual  countries participate. Argentina and Brazil would attain what  seems to be their objective of belonging to the first world by  enhancing each other's position--and with our  participation--within the Mercosur.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Last week the United States declared  Uruguay "eligible" to join NAFTA. Are you not tempted?    [Lacalle] No, because I do not look to the United States to  guide my life, even though I must obviously take it into  account. For me, the United States' positive evaluation of our  country can only be interpreted as a compliment. What I did  propose to President Bill Clinton is a link between NAFTA and  Mercosur. This would not rob Uruguay of its sleep as it already  has a priority--Mercosur.</p>

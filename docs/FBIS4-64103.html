			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 26 May (SNARK)--Armenian Internal Affairs  Minister Vano Siradegyan, appearing by a TV, called criminal the  Trade Minister Tigran Grigoryan. "The May 10 arrest of trade  minister, while he took a 2,500-dollar bribe, was carried out  smartly", told Siradegyan.    As already reported, two days after his detention the trade  minister was released, because no prosecutor sanction was  submitted during his arrest. He took up his office again.    From a TV screen, Vano Siradegyan announced: "All officials  with whom I have talked accepted that trade minister is a thief  and bribe-taker, however they required proof, being doubtful  about the sum as low as 2,500 dollars. But it's a teacher's  salary for 50 years", exclaimed Siradegyan. He promised to  arrest next time the state minister red handed--instead of a  minister--and present the proper videotape.</p>

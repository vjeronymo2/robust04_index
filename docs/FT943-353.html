			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Australians may float French mine Eltin, the Western Australian mining and earthmoving contractor, and Orion Resources, a WA goldminer, said yesterday that they were considering floating the Salsigne gold project in France. The companies, who were responding to a query from the Australian Stock Exchange, said they had engaged the stockbroking company James Capel in London to explore possible options, and expected its findings to be presented within the next three months. The project, near Carcassonne in south-west France, is the country's last gold mine. Production has been budgeted to reach 90,000oz a year when full capacity is reached.</p>

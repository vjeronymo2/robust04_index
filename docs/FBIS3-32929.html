			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Victor Augusto Vasquez Echeverria,  commander of the military base in Quiche Department, said: "We  will give Galil assault rifles to those who legally organize  themselves to protect their properties."    Following the attack carried out by guerrillas on the  morning  of 13 February, the majority of the store owners are furious  because the insurgents' actions have only caused them losses, he  said. "They have stated they intend to join the Civilian  Self-Defense Patrols to oppose the instability caused by the  insurgents. The Constitution allows civilians form groups to  protect themselves from foreign forces," he pointed out.    On the morning of 13 February, members of the Poor People's  Guerrilla Army (EGP) used explosive charges to topple nine  electric posts in Chichicastenango and Solola. According to Gen.  Vasquez, the operation was carried out simultaneously by groups  of four rebels, and authorities found propaganda at the sites  from the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the  EGP alluding to the anniversaries of the two organizations.    He said: "We have sent more than 200 soldiers to patrol the  area as the inhabitants of the three affected departments have  requested." The URNG operation was executed at a strategic  point, since the posts that were blown down interconnected the  electricity network between Quiche Department, Chichicastenango  Municipality, and Solola Department.    Up to yesterday, electrical power had not been restored in  any of these places. Businesses opened as usual even though some  products that required refrigeration were lost. Gasoline service  stations used manual pumps, which caused a certain backlog of  vehicles. Nothing like this has been experienced in this area  since the beginning of the 1980's when guerrillas destroyed an  electric power generator in the outskirts of Quiche.  <H5>  Unhappiness In the Area </H5>   Quiche Governor Alfonso de Paz rejected these types of  actions, which only serve to stop development. "It is  regrettable that these acts are repeated in our department,  which has suffered plenty of damage due to the domestic  conflict," the governor said. Quiche belongs to Region No. 7,  which is classified as one of the country's poorest. Extreme  poverty is experienced in 95 percent of its 21 municipalities.  Also, according to what the residents say, this area suffered  constant Army bombings during the 1980's.    Quiche Mayor Juan Jose Garzona also condemned the attack  saying that these actions affect all residents of the  department. "Market vendors and hotel owners have been affected.  Several tourists left on Sunday morning because they were afraid  of renewed guerrilla attacks," the mayor said. Up to now, the  URNG has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has  not denied it either.</p>

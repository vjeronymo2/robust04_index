			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Jan 14 (TANJUG) -- Prime minister of the  Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna Jadranko Prlic said that the  Bosnian Croat state will join neighbouring Croatia if the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina breaks up.    In a statement to the Split weekly NEDELJNA DALMACIJA Prlic  said that Bosnia-Herzegovina can only survive as a union of the  republics of the three constituent nations -- Moslems Serbs and  Croats, and that if such a state is formed Herceg-Bosna would  not secede. Asked if Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Bosnian  Serbs (RS) would recognize each other Prlic said that this would  automatically take place if the union is formed for it provides  for the existence of three mutually recognized republics.    Even though the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Serbs assured  one third of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Moslems  asked for at the last round of peace talks in Geneva and  Brussels last month, the Moslems again turned down the plan  saying that they were dissatisfied with the quality of the  territories.    What the Bosnian Moslem leadership wants is a  Moslem-dominated unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was confirmed  Wednesday by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who said  that the Moslems have to fight for a united Bosnia and the  preservation of Islam there and called for new military  operations. He also stressed that his troops were now 200,000  strong and that things were now different.    The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out in April 1992  because  Izetbegovic insisted on a unitary state, which was first  rejected by the Bosnian Serbs and later by the Bosnian Croats,  who declared their own states within the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

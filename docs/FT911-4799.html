			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (4): Pounds 65m plant to create 450 jobs - Japanese-led scheme is Telford's biggest overseas investment NIPPONDENSO has started to recruit staff for the biggest single overseas investment project in Telford - a Pounds 65m plant to manufacture automotive heating and air-conditioning units. When full production is reached in 1995, 450 jobs will have been created. The project is a joint venture between Nippondenso, the Japanese group which has worldwide annual sales of more than Pounds 5bn, and Magneti Marelli, which is two-thirds owned by Fiat, the Italian group. But Nippondenso, which holds 75 per cent of the equity in the joint venture, is managing the project. At the beginning of 1992, Nippondenso will start recruiting staff in two categories: maintenance and general plant workers like assemblers and machine operators. Mr Michio Ohiwa, Nippondenso's man in charge at Telford, is following what has become an established line of Japanese recruitment policy in the UK. 'We want people who are diligent and have a positive attitude to the job and can keep good teamwork', he says. In terms of Telford's economic development, the main impact of the Nippondenso project, initially at least, is purely that of job creation. It is doubtful whether the project will deepen the economy, though it will extend it. The technology to be used at the plant is solely that of Nippondenso. There are no plans for a design or technological centre. The plant is a simple manufacturing facility. To this extent, the venture is clearly a 'screwdriver assembly' operation of the type with which Japanese industry has become associated in, for example, south Wales. But in Telford, it is pointed out that assembly tends to be the first phase of corporate involvement in the local economy; design centres, the brains of an operation, can come later. Certainly there are no local qualms about the presence of Nippondenso. Mr Ohiwa notes that there are many good places for manufacturing, but he has been impressed by the support organisation - the Telford Development Corporation - of the area. An additional sweetener was the availability of Pounds 2.2m in regional aid. This is a greenfield operation, says Mr Ohiwa, 'so the support is a big help'. Nippondenso is using a site of 53 acres and has enough space to expand if the market warrants it. Production will start in July 1992 with an initial workforce of 160. It will be directed at all major European car manufacturers, but Nippondenso has a contract to supply Toyota, with which it has a long-term relationship, at its developing plant on the old Burnaston airfield in Derbyshire. The Telford venture will consolidate Nippondenso's position as the dominant supplier in the UK of car ventilation equipment. Production of 800,000 units a year is planned. This position of dominance has been reached not only from Nippondenso's own production but also through acquisition - IMI Radiators, for example. Nippondenso's main competitors are in continental Europe.</p>

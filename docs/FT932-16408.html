			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Yankees on the fringe - Theatre London's fringe theatre has gone very American. After David Mamet's early play Squirrels at the King's Head, a new company, Small Talk Theatre, is reviving another Mamet, Sexual Perversity in Chicago at the Etcetera in Camden Town. Meanwhile, the Gate in Notting Hill has come up with a relatively unknown playwright in Wendy MacLeod, whose The House of Yes has the disadvantage of harking back yet again to the day that President John F Kennedy died, but adds a macabre Jacobean touch of incest. All three productions are superbly done. What they also have in common is short, terse dialogue and rapidly changing scenes. Possibly the influence - the desire to play it fast - comes from Hollywood. Some of the Mamet scenes last less than a minute. In The House of Yes one key scene is acted several times over, though each time with a twist. None of the plays is quite up to Arthur Miller's The Last Yankee, still playing at the Young Vic, but there is a vitality in the writing and staging of all them that the indigenous theatre has temporarily lost. The small platform is the right place for them, but it the same kind of taut dialogue that makes City of Angels such a good musical. Americans are still talking to each other on stage.</p>

After a meeting scheduled to last 15 minutes, but which  lasted an hour, the Colombian diplomat said Colombia will be  able to sell almost all its products to the 12 EU countries  without paying duties. She added that such conditions would be  applicable for a period of four or 10 years, depending on  Colombia's request, to begin when the current agreement expires.    Noemi Sanin visited France in December and met with French  officials to expound on the country's achievements, the  government modernization policy, the strengthening of the  judicial system, the efforts to counter drug trafficking, the  peace process with the guerrillas, and the defense of human  rights.    The possibility of France investing in our products,  including bananas, and the repercussions for Colombia --  especially the Uraba region -- would be a positive step that  would further expand Colombia's participation in the foreign  market.</p>

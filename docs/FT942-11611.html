			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Fowler willing to take rap for losses Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, yesterday attempted to act as a lightning conductor for Mr John Major, the prime minister, by taking personal responsibility in advance of the Tories' expected poor performance in today's local elections. Sir Norman said: 'As party chairman, I take responsibility for the campaign; the buck stops with me.' In contrast to the Tories, who sought to focus the debate on local issues, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, insisted that the public saw the elections as a means of registering their anger at the 'incompetence of the government'. Today's local elections involve 114 English non-metropolitan districts, 36 metropolitan districts, 32 London boroughs, nine Scottish regional councils, three Scottish islands councils and four Welsh districts. There is also the Rotherham parliamentary by-election caused by the death of Mr Jimmy Boyce, which Labour is expected to hold easily. A poor performance by the government in the local elections is likely to lead to increased speculation about Mr Major's future. Mr Smith demanded that the government call an election if Mr Major is forced from office following further disappointing results in next month's European elections. While he predicted that Labour would be the clear winner from today's elections, Mr Smith warned that in many areas it was almost impossible to improve on his party's performance in the last local contests in 1990. Sir Norman stuck to his earlier prediction that the party would take seats from the opposition parties, but declined to say where. The Liberal Democrats, who expect 'modest gains' from today's elections, denied that the outcome of the poll could be seen as a referendum on the government. Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, said Tory infighting over a single currency in Europe confirmed the impression of a government in 'some disarray'. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, accused Labour of trying to divert voters' attention from local issues because of the 'appalling record' of Labour-run councils. Labour denied the accusation as it published a document boasting of a record of 'excellence' in local government. But it omitted to mention Lambeth, where Labour has expelled several extreme left councillors and the council has been accused of more than Pounds 20m of unlawful expenditure by the district auditor. Mr Smith denied that he was embarrassed by the council's record. Earlier, Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, declined to apologise for breaking cabinet ranks over his opposition to a single currency. He also refused to accept advice from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, that all contributions to debate should concentrate on supporting local government candidates and not be distracted by other issues.

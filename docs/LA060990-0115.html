			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RILEY: 'ONLY BUSS AND I KNOW'  </P> <P> Pat Riley, addressing growing speculation about his status as Laker coach, said  Friday that he will announce his decision next week but indicated that only he  and team owner Jerry Buss know any details of his situation.  </P> <P> "This week coming up, without a doubt, it'll be decided upon," Riley said.  </P> <P> "There are only two people who know what's going on, and that's Dr. Buss and  myself."  </P> <P> People close to Riley, including assistant coaches Bill Bertka and Randy Pfund,  have said they have received indications that Riley is going to leave coaching  after nine seasons with the Lakers.  </P> <P> But Riley would only reiterate that his situation will be resolved soon.  </P> <P> Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, already has compiled a list of  possible replacements, including, but not limited to, assistant coach Mike  Dunleavy of the Milwaukee Bucks.  </P> <P> Riley said he understands West's motives in formulating a contingency plan.  </P> <P> "I don't (blame) him," Riley said. "They've got a job to do in the  organization. The Lakers are in a business. I don't mind them looking into  that. I haven't decided yet, but that process (of interviewing candidates) is  fine.  </P> <P> "Jerry was probably put in a poor position by me on this whole thing. They've  got moves to make. They've got a draft to prepare for. Jerry's got a team to  run. I appreciate Dr. Buss and Jerry giving me the time I asked for."  </P></p>

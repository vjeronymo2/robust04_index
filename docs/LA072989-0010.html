			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC DID RESPOND TO THE SHRINE GAME  </P> <P> Those of us connected with the USC football program are disappointed with the  comments of Bob Belyeu, general manager of the Shrine All-Star game, which  appeared in The Times July 22.  </P> <P> Belyeu said he was upset with the way USC handled the situation, claiming that  "USC just ignored us, like the game means nothing. They did not even show the  courtesy to contact us; no phone call or anything."  </P> <P> In fact, Trojan Coach Larry Smith has always encouraged recruits to play in  all-star games. However, Smith was not contacted about the Shrine game date or  practice schedule until about a month ago, when Belyeu called to alert him of  the conflict. Although Smith was on vacation, he called Belyeu back that day  and offered to put him in touch with the bridge program's administrator to see  if something could be worked out. Belyeu declined this offer.  </P> <P> TIM TESSALONE  </P> <P> USC Sports Information Officer  </P></p>

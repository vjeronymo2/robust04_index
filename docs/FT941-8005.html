			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commons voting took up 94 hours MPs spent a total of 94 hours in the process of voting during the last parliamentary session, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said yesterday. He was rebutting Labour calls for the introduction of electronic voting. Mr Newton said the prospect of such voting 'would not command universal support'. Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, had called for voting machines to be introduced on the grounds that it was time the Commons was 'dragged into the 20th century'. He was supported by Ms Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall, who asked whether it was sensible to devote the equivalent of nearly four days of a parliamentary session in voting procedures.</p>

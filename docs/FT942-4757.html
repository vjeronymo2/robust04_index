			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Observer: Party time Rarely has there been a finer array of parties to choose from than in Thursday's UK version of the elections to the European Parliament. Pity only 50 per cent of Britons apparently know what the parliament is. Never mind. Besides all the obvious dull worthies, Observer fancies the chances of the 'Rainbow Connection Oui-Say-Non' party, though the choice of four splinter versions of the ubiquitous 'Raving Loony' faction might squeeze a vote here or there. Fervent athletes might find a common front with the 'European People's Party Judo/Christian Alliance'. Heinz employees could plausibly be deluded into casting a glance towards the 'Eurobean from the planet Beanus' party. No doubt a few angry parents will put a cross against the 'Network Against Child Support Agency' party. Though who will find themselves in sympathy with the Mccarthy-ites - the 'Make Criminals Concerned About Our Response to Hostility and Yobbishness' party? Oh, I see - expecting a mass turnout of disillusioned Tory voters . . .</p>

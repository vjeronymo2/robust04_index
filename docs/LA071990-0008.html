			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTER APATHY IN JUNE PRIMARY  </P> <P> When are we ever going to mention the word "responsibility" when we discuss and  relate all the data on the June 5 primary election? It isn't unusual, though,  since we never hear about "responsibility" regarding any other facet of our  lives and we will continue to have problems in our society, as long as  "responsibility" is not the keyword in our lives!  </P> <P> Men have fought and died so that we can participate in this beautiful voting  privilege and yet there are always so many excuses! How sad! Voting is the  easiest function we have to perform, since one can always vote by using the  absentee ballot.  </P> <P> Signing up for a race or college class takes more effort and time! We have got  to do better.  </P> <P> Here in Los Angeles County of the 3,402,509 registered voters, only 1,283,079  voted and 177,295 voters did vote absentee by mail. Let's go, Los Angeles  County -- let us all register and vote in the November election!  </P> <P> HELEN LESKO ROGERS  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

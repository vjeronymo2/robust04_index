			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Wherever I lay my hat - Style The problem with men's hats, is that it's hard to wear them without seeming ironical. Hats, like bow-ties and mustard-coloured waistcoats, aren't so much clothes as items from the dressing-up cupboard; things which make a self-referential statement, rather than just keep the sun off your head. Which is probably why the classic Panama and the baseball cap are the two most popular hats around at present: you can just about get away with one or the other, without having to explain your motives. As is usually the case with hats, Lock's of St. James has some of the nicest items. Its broad-brimmed planter's Panama costs Pounds 67: this is both functional and stylish and a change from the traditional folding Panama with its ridge (or optimo) crown and narrower brim. Christy's of London also make a very decent selection of Panamas and Panama variations, many of which are can be found at Selfridges and Austin Reed, at prices between Pounds 30 and Pounds 60. But what if you want to break free from the masses and make that big statement? What if you want to look larger than life? Well, back at Austin Reed, there is a very fetching Burma Bush hat (made by Austin Reed itself), in muddy olive felt and with a kind of fisherman's fly feather tucked into the band. It looks indestructible and it costs Pounds 79. Even better, perhaps, is the RM Williams Australian Outback clothing store, a little way up Regent's Street from Austin Reed. It has a terrific range of tough-guy, outdoors headgear, including the Pastoralist (which looks a bit like Lester Young's pork pie hat, but is none the worse for that) and the splendid Cattleman, which is built on an heroic scale and should outlast its owner. Both cost Pounds 65. Or, back at Lock's, there is something for the truly self-dramatising: a vast white sunshade job, wide-brimmed and with a coral-coloured band, made by Borsalino of Italy. Admittedly, it has more than a whiff of Cosa Nostra about it, but it is a beautiful object - and the fact that Lock's is prepared to stock it is a guarantee of its quality. Sheer extravagance, for Pounds 97.</p>

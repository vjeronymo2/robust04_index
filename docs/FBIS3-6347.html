The puppet defence minister, Yi Pyong-Tae, too, openly  talked  about resuming "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year  when he met with a U.S. undersecretary of defense that day,  saying "the exchange of special envoys between the North and the  South was unlikely to be realized".    Such ill-boding remarks vividly show that the Kim Yong-sam  group has no intention to discuss the pending issues between the  North and the South.    The puppets now lay the blame for the failure to make a  progress in the working-level contact at the North's door. This  is, indeed, an act reminding one of a thief crying "stop thief!"    It is entirely because of the South Korean puppet clique's  unjust behavior that the four rounds of working contact held in  March failed to get anywhere. The South side objected to the  North side's proposal to announce in a joint communique that the  sides confirmed again the will for the exchange of special  envoys and agreed on their early exchange. It categorically  took exception to the North side's suggestion that the questions  of observing the principle of national independence, deciding on  the way of national reunification and of promoting the great  unity of the whole nation be stipulated in the draft agreement  with regard to the duty of special envoys.    Their acts of dragging on the working-level contact, while  objecting to the North side's principled proposals without any  justification and reasons, are nothing but a despicable intrigue  to reduce the talks to ostensible and nominal one.    It is not hard to gather that lurking behind such perfidious  acts of the puppets is their sinister intention to put the  brakes on the third round of DPRK-USA talks at any cost by  blocking the progress of the contact for the exchange of special  envoys and overpower the North with the help of foreign forces.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must stop its adventurous  rash  acts of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a very  dangerous, catastrophic crisis, approach the dialogue with an  honest attitude in response to the demand and aspirations of the  fellow countrymen and make a bold decision to accept the North  side's drastic proposal on working procedures at an early date.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco set to buy Royal Brands RJR NABISCO is poised to re-enter the European food sector with the Pta34.5bn (Dollars 297m) acquisition of Royal Brands, the food and agricultural division of Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco company. The Nabisco bid, which requires approval by the Spanish cabinet, was preferred by the Tabacalera board over a rival offer from United Biscuits of Britain and an unnamed partner. UB would not disclose the value of its offer, but said that it was 'not significantly different' from Nabisco's. Royal Brands, which earned net profits of Pta2.7bn on Pta27bn sales last year, owns Artiach, Spain's leading biscuit producer, and Royal, the country's biggest baking powder and home-made desserts company. Nabisco is believed to have promised to maintain Carcesa, a formerly state-owned Royal Brands canning subsidiary. The US company sold its extensive European food businesses in the late 1980s to pay off debt raised to finance a Dollars 26bn leveraged buy-out. The businesses included Spanish assets which were sold to Tabacalera and now form the core of Royal Brands. It is unclear whether the deal presages further European acquisitions by Nabisco. Analysts believe the company's cash-flow is likely to be substantially reduced by the recent US price war in cigarettes and point out that most of the best European acquisition candidates in biscuits, Nabisco's main food business, have already been bought. The sale will realise net capital gains for Tabacalera of Pta9bn, almost as much as the Pta10.8bn net profits that the group is forecast to declare this year, and will help cut Tabacalera's Pta45bn consolidated debt.</p>

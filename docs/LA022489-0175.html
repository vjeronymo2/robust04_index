			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DOLLAR RISES MARGINALLY IN EUROPE IN MILD REACTION TO FED RATE HIKE  </P> <P> The dollar finished marginally higher in Europe today as the market reacted  without enthusiasm to a hike in the U.S. discount rate. Gold prices fell.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's move to raise  the discount rate to 7% from 6.5% initially caused the dollar to steam to a  session high of 1.8330 West German marks.  </P> <P> Although dealers had been complaining about the lack of strong action from the  Fed for months, some thought that the rate hike was not strong enough.  </P> <P> "It should have been a full point, many people thought, and the dollar then  went down," said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank.  </P> <P> Others said the move came too late and had only a symbolic effect that wore  off. The dollar then traded in quiet ranges.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Hanson writes to Major on dividends Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson, has urged the prime minister in a letter to keep a firm hand on the Treasury's review of dividend taxation. Hanson donated Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative party in its last financial year, which ended in September 1993. He expresses relief in the letter that Mr John Major appears to be taking charge of the study into savings and investment. Lord Hanson recently accused Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, in a letter of 'sounding like a socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends. He insisted that the issue of dividends was one for shareholders and their companies alone, and not the government. Lord Hanson's latest letter has irritated some ministers who support the Treasury's review of savings. 'In urging the prime minister, as First Lord of the Treasury, to take charge of the review, Lord Hanson is interfering in government policy,' a minister said. 'The Treasury has a good point over dividends and the prime minister will not be put off by Lord Hanson.' Lord Hanson has been encouraged by Mr Major's recent interview in The Daily Telegraph in which he said there was no question of dividend control from a Conservative government. 'Dividend control is socialism,' the prime minister said. 'I'm a Tory; dividend control is a non-starter.' Mr Major appeared to restrict the Treasury's room for manoeuvre by dismissing the argument that high dividends prevent capital investment. Hanson, which is one of the Conservative party's biggest company contributors and has donated more than Pounds 800,000 since the Tories came to power in 1979, said it was only being supportive of the prime minister. Mr Christopher Collins, a director of Hanson, said: 'Having seen the prime minister's interview, Lord Hanson wrote a private and friendly letter to say how pleased he was with the line he took in the dividend issue.' The Treasury angered Lord Hanson by suggesting that UK dividend pay-outs, which have risen significantly during the past decade, may have become too high and inflexible. Mr Dorrell said the Treasury decided to review savings and investment to see whether the rise in dividends had come about because of the tax structure set by the government. 'After 15 years of deregulation, there's no question of us regulating dividends,' Mr Dorrell said.</p>

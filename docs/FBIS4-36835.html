			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Falsifying Facts Does Not Serve  the Peace Process," AL-BA'TH newspaper editorial says:  Although the entire world is now aware that Israel is  responsible for halting the peace process, and, consequently for  the inability of the bilateral peace talks in Washington to  achieve what they were supposed to achieve, the Tel Aviv  government still insists on reversing and falsifying facts by  claiming that Syria is behind the failure to achieve the  supposed breakthrough in the peace talks.    The paper says that Israel continues to repeat this because  Syria, from the outset of the peace talks, has been rejecting  any peace outside the Madrid formula, stressing that peace  should be based on the resolutions of international legitimacy.    AL-BA'TH adds: This position basically conflicts with the  known Israeli plans to drag the Arab parties into signing  separate peace deals which would acknowledge everything Israel  wants.    AL-BA'TH notes that Syria's consistent and positive position  on the peace process has been described by the U.S.  administration and all world governments as the key to regional  peace. The paper adds: The Geneva summit results and President  Hafiz al-Asad's statements proved without any doubt that Syria  is truly working for a just and comprehensive peace in the  region, especially since the president stressed full withdrawal  in return for full peace. In this regard, the paper points to  the U.S. President's reply that Syria has the right to demand  the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace.    AL-BA'TH continues: Definitely, this U.S. statement was  based on the facts of the regional conflict, and, consequently,  on a conviction that it is impossible for partial and separate  solutions to bring about regional security, peace, and stability.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Despite all that happened and may  happen, the region will remain far from the real peace  emphasized by the international community, unless there is full  and absolute commitment to implementing all the requirements of  a just and comprehensive peace, chief of which is a  comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories.    In the "With the Events" column, the newspaper AL-BA'TH  says:  The road to peace has clear features and signs. It begins with  the implementation of the UN and Security Council resolutions.  If this is not achieved, the national resistance in Lebanon  will continue and will not retreat or compromise. The Israelis  know better than others the resolve and solidity of this  resistance. Only justice will triumph.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-won] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 6 February that North Korea  concluded a contract with the former Soviet Union to buy 100  MiG-29 jets by the end of the eighties and succeeded in the  assembly-production of MiG-29 in 1992.    A government intelligence official revealed that "it has  been  confirmed that, by using the parts and facilities North Korea  introduced from the former Soviet Union in 1991, North Korea  succeeded in assembly-production of two MiG-29 jets at the  Panghyon plant." MiG-29 jets are Russia's ultramodern fighters  that are recognized as being superior to U.S. F-16's which the  ROK Air Force is expected to import for its Korean Fighter  Program.    North Korea's assembly-production success draws public  attention, because this means that the technology of North  Korea's arms industry has surpassed expectations.    Another high-level government intelligence official said  that  "the government is keeping close watching over North Korea's  possible production and introduction of more MiG-29 jets."  North Korea began introducing MiG-29 jets from the former  Soviet Union in the mid-eighties and now possesses approximately  20 MiG-29 jets.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson cuts losses to Pounds 1.66m OWEN &amp; Robinson, the Basildon-based jewellery and sports footwear retailer, cut interim pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 1.66m. The company credited an increase in gross margins and a reduction in shop costs and central overheads. The company also announced the departure of Mr Mike Smith, finance director, 'to pursue other career opportunities'. Turnover in the six months to July 31 for the company, which underwent a capital reconstruction during the period, fell 20 per cent to Pounds 8.21m (Pounds 10.2m). Mr Neil Thomas, chairman, said in line with other retailers in the sector sales volumes had been disappointing. However, taking into account shop closures, the fall was 14 per cent. The Gold Centre jewellery side was trading in line with budget following cost cuts and increased margins. The Foothold sports shoe retailer recorded a small trading profit. On prospects Mr Thomas said that although signs of economic recovery were random and inconsistent, Foothold had recently shown a significant improvement in sales. The pre-tax result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 246,000 (Pounds 405,000) and the lack of exceptional costs against Pounds 300,000. Losses per share fell from 31.08p to 13.94p taking into account shares issued for the placing and open offer and the conversion of bank debt and loan notes. The conversion of A preference shares and convertible preference shares was deemed to have applied throughout the period. The comparative figure was adjusted for the preference conversion and the 1-for-20 consolidation of ordinary shares.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The managing editor of a major Turkish newsmagazine went into hiding last month  after being sentenced to nine years in jail for articles carried by the leftist  publication, friends said. Fatma Yazici, 33, managing editor of the weekly  Toward 2000, was charged with producing Communist and Kurdish propaganda,  insulting Islam and being disrespectful to the president. The magazine has  constantly been in trouble with authorities for tackling taboo subjects that  often lead to prosecution under the country's restrictive press law.  </P></p>

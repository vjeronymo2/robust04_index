			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A limit to options excess Sir, We would support David Rhoads's warnings (Letters, May 27) of legislative action, based on US experience, if aspects of executive pay are seen to be excessive. The pensions 'cap' is a recent UK example and some elements of option awards must be in the sights of future ministers and their advisers. The accusations of excess lie not in exercising options but immediately selling the entire holding, and it is this aspect of scheme design that is principally exercising remuneration committees and investors. If on exercise of an option worth more than 30 per cent of current salary an executive could only sell enough shares to allow him/her to reinvest in purchasing the remainder of the option entitlement for a further period of, say, three years, the danger of the 'inspired' sales of option shares would be reduced. The trouble with 1984 executive option legislation was its uneasy balance between the concepts of long-term performance awards and shareholding democracy as many more holders have used options as a one-way bet on a bundle of cash rather than becoming real shareholders. Option rights restricted to the reinvestment of cash in some retained shares would restore the concept of shareholding executives without any knock-on effect on revenue or other related legislation.

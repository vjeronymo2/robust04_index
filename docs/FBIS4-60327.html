			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] O brother officers and soldiers in the remaining  forces still taking orders from war criminal ['Ali Salim] al-Bid  and from his secessionist clique in the Yemeni Socialist Party's  leadership, O dear brothers, we call on you to resort to both  reason and conscience.    We call on you to disavow the falsehoods imposed on you by  the gang of apostasy and secession. The members of this gang  are pushing you into the crematorium of war against your  brothers in the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy.  They mean only to protect themselves, their sick delusions, and  their suspicious schemes designed to return the homeland to the  situation that prevailed prior to 22 May 1990.    We urge you to reject the orders of the gang of apostasy and  secession. This gang illegally gives orders to the Armed  Forces' officers and soldiers. We call on you to carry out your  national duty by joining the ranks of the forces of unity and  democracy which are defending both Constitutional legitimacy and  the interests of both the homeland and people, exactly as was  done by thousands of your comrades in arms in various positions.    O dear brothers, we appeal to you to ask yourselves about  what you are fighting for, and for what objectives you are  aiming the weapons at your brethren. If you are really fighting  for Yemeni unity, your natural position is within the ranks of  the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, the forces of  both the people and homeland.    You should aim your guns where they should be aimed: At the  secessionist clique in the Socialist Party's leadership that  betrayed the cause of unity, rebelled against democracy and  constitutional legitimacy, and launched this war between  brothers in arms for the sake of its dominating secessionist  aspirations.    Why are you aiming your weapons at your brothers who are  defending unity and democracy? Why are you killing men,  bereaving the women of their husbands, and bereaving the  children of their parents? Why are you exposing yourselves to  death and creating disasters for your families and kinsfolk?  Why are you setting fire to the homeland's achievements and  deepening the people's wounds? Why are you demolishing the  schools and hospitals and destroying the institutions which  serve the people? Are you doing all this for a handful of  rebellious secessionists?    O brothers in arms, return to your senses and fear God  regarding yourselves, your kinsfolk, and your people's sons.  Quickly join the ranks of the Armed Forces, which are defending  unity and constitutional legitimacy. The secessionist clique  has no chance of victory, now that most governorates are  controlled by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy.    O dear brothers, quickly save yourselves from the dark fate  which will be soon the lot of the secessionist clique led by  traitor al-Bid. Be as the people expect you to be. Be  rightfully and honestly the soldiers of God, the protectors of  the homeland, the providers of security to the people, and the  builders of life. Always be the defenders of unity, democracy,  and constitutional legitimacy.</p>

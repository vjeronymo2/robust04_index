			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIAL DEFENDS WORK OF CRITICIZED  CONTRACTOR  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County official has recommended against canceling a contract with  a company that maintains and repairs county vehicles, despite complaints about  shoddy service.  </P> <P> "The performance of the contractor has dramatically improved," William F.  Stewart, director of the county Internal Services Department, said in a report  to the Board of Supervisors, which delayed a vote on the matter until Tuesday.  "We believe that there is no justification for canceling the contract."  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who proposed that the board consider canceling the  $12-million annual contract with Holmes &amp; Narver Services Inc., expressed  concern that the pact may end up costing the county more than when county  mechanics serviced the fleet. Hahn said Tuesday that a member of the county  grand jury plans to ask fellow jurors to look into the contract. A jury  official refused comment.  </P></p>

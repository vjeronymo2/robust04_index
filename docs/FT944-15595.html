			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: E Asia and EU may hold talks The European Union and east Asian countries may hold a summit late next year at which government leaders would aim to forge closer economic and trade ties between the two regions, according to European Commission officials. The EU also plans to renew attempts to establish a dialogue with the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, the five-year-old grouping which embraces the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand as well as Japan and 11 other Asian countries. The initiatives are intended to accelerate recent efforts to deepen relations between Europe and Asia, amid growing European fears of being excluded from developments in the world's fastest-growing economic region. Until now, most of the running has been made by the Europeans. However, EU officials say the proposal for a summit is Asian-inspired, and has been backed particularly strongly by Singapore and Thailand. The proposal has yet to be placed formally on the EU agenda but may be raised during a visit to Paris this week by Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister. As president of the EU Council of Ministers in the first half of next year, France would be closely involved in preparing the ground for a summit. Germany, the current council president, has called for stronger EU links with Asia. A senior European Commission official said yesterday that if the summit went ahead, participants would be likely to include government leaders from Japan, Taiwan and Korea, as well as from the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. The official said the meeting was envisaged as a relatively informal event which would seek to encourage increased trade and investment between Europe and Asia and closer co-operation between governments of the two regions in the new World Trade Organisation. Talks with Asian leaders would also bolster European efforts to establish closer contacts with Apec, which is expected to agree a timetable for trade liberalisation by its members at a summit meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, next month.</p>

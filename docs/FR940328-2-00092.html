Atlas Assets is an open-end, management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. Atlas Assets is organized as a series fund, and currently issues shares in twelve series (the ``Portfolios''). Portfolios that are money market funds are referred to herein as ``Money Market Portfolios.'' The Adviser serves as the investment adviser to Atlas Assets. The Distributor serves as the principal underwriter of the shares of Atlas Assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Portfolios, other than the Money Market Portfolios, currently offer their shares at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. The Money Market Portfolios issue their shares at net asset value without the imposition of a front-end sales charge. Atlas Assets is subject to a distribution plan pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under which each Portfolio may reimburse the Distributor up to .25% per year of its average daily net assets for actual expenditures made by the Distributor on behalf of that Portfolio for distribution and shareholder services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants request an order to permit the Funds to issue and sell multiple classes of shares, assess a CDSC on certain redemptions, and waive the CDSC in certain instances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Under applicants' proposal, the Funds initially may offer shares either: (a) Subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution or service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of the average daily net assets (``Class A shares''); or (b) subject to a CDSC (which applicants expect will range from 3% on redemptions made during the first year following purchase to 1% on redemptions made during the fifth year since purchase), a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class B shares''). Existing shares will become Class A shares upon implementation of the proposed multi-class distribution system. Applicants also may establish one or more additional classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from the classes of shares described herein only as described in condition 1 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The CDSC will be imposed on the lesser of the aggregate net asset value of the shares being redeemed either at the time of purchase or redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired more than a fixed number of years prior to the redemptions or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents capital appreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC in the following instances: (a) Redemptions following the death or disability of a shareholder within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the ``Code''), if redemption is made within one year of death or disability; (b) redemptions in connection with a lump-sum or other distribution following retirement or, in the case of an IRA or Keogh Plan or a custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after attaining age 591/2; and (c) redemptions that result from a tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of the Code or from the death or disability of an employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

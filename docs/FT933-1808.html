			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / MacGregor gets show on the road: Charging for UK road use has attracted support When Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, published proposals in the spring to charge motorists for using Britain's motorways, many Conservative backbenchers thought a public relations disaster was in the making. Like rail privatisation and talk of cuts in pension provision, the plan seemed set to alienate Tory supporters and add further to the government's unpopularity. Yet now that the consultation period on the green paper has ended, Mr MacGregor appears to have won unexpected support for his proposals. The Confederation of British Industry, the Freight Transport Association and motorists' organisations have all accepted the principle of motorway charges  -though with differing degrees of enthusiasm. The CBI has reversed its previous opposition to road charging, even though it estimates that motorway tolls would add as much as Pounds 300m a year to business costs. This would be outweighed by the benefits of reduced congestion and easier access to customers and suppliers, the CBI believes. The Freight Transport Association, representing 12,000 companies in the freight transport and distribution business, says it is prepared to accept motorway charging as the only way of raising sufficient finance for improving the motorway and trunk road network. 'We're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,' says the association's Mr John Gutteridge. Even the two large motoring organisations, the Automobile Association and the RAC, accept the case for charging. Both acknowledge the opposition of their 13m members to paying motorway tolls, but say they will not oppose charging provided it is examined in the context of all motoring taxation. The RAC suggests that a reduction in other motoring taxes such as vehicle excise duty could ease the initial impact of road charging and win acceptance. All the organisations prepared to comply with motorway charging do so largely because they accept the premise of the government's green paper that the public purse is not deep enough to build the new road capacity needed to accommodate the doubling of traffic by 2025. This argument has encouraged other countries to adopt forms of road charging to fund new roads and reduce congestion, as Mr MacGregor has discovered in recent overseas trips. In May he visited Norway and Sweden to look at experiments in urban road pricing and last week he visited the US to look at several toll road projects. If any nation could be expected to resist the introduction of paying for roads it should be the US, where cheap motoring and the 'car culture' are deeply embedded. Even the terminology the Americans use to describe their highways - freeways - suggests an unrestricted and uncosted freedom to drive. Yet Mr MacGregor found a surprising willingness to accept tolling in response to increasing congestion on suburban freeways and pressures on trunk road budgets. At Harris county in Texas, which includes Houston, he saw two toll roads built by the county after residents voted seven to three in favour of tolls. One, the Hardy Toll Road, links the airport to the town centre; the other, the Sam Houston Tollway, is part of an outer city ring-road. The Federal Highway Administration in Washington, which is responsible for 45,000 miles of interstate highways, is also encouraging toll road construction. 'It is the only way to speed up our road-building programme,' commented Mr Gary Maring, head of the transport studies division. Federal, state and local authorities currently spend Dollars 83bn a year on road building and maintenance, funded largely through an 11.5 cent tax on a gallon of petrol. 'But we found these resources didn't meet our needs,' said Mr Maring. Pressure on revenues prompted legislation in 1987, allowing demonstration toll programmes in seven states. In 1991 this was extended to allow all states to charge tolls on new or reconstructed roads and bridges. 'We see toll roads as a supplemental finance mechanism and not as a replacement for the basic idea of funding road building through fuel tax,' said Mr Maring. Increasingly, electronic tolling is used globally to collect road charges. In Harris county, tolls were initially collected at manned and automatic toll booths but the county is now moving to electronic tolling. Motorists carry an electronic tag on their windscreen. This is read as the vehicle passes through the toll plaza and the driver's bank account or charge card is automatically debited. Up to 1,800 vehicles an hour can pass through the electronic toll gates compared with just 350 when an attendant collects the money. Motorists have been encouraged to sign up for Houston's tag system by a reduction in the standard toll from Dollars 1 to 75 cents, explained Mr Chuck Reedstrom, revenues manager of the Harris County Toll Road Authority. Some 17,000 motorists are now registered for electronic tolling and new subscribers are signing up at the rate of 1,000 a month. Mr MacGregor's preference is for some form of electronic charging system for UK motorways. 'It is fairly clear that in the long run tolling has to be electronic,' he said during the US trip. He will find support for this view when he and officials come to read the responses to his green paper on motorway charging. A strong advantage of electronic charging, according to these submissions, is that charges can vary with time and place of use to relieve congestion and encourage off-peak journeys. However, the necessary technology for electronic tolling across the UK motorway system would take some time to install. To bridge the gap until then, Mr MacGregor has suggested a system of motorway permits, similar to the vignette system in Switzerland that requires motorway users to display an annual permit bought from post offices or petrol stations. The bad news for Mr MacGregor is that there appears to be little support for a permit system as an interim step. Responses to his green paper say that it would be expensive to administer and difficult to enforce. They also point out that the cost bears no relation to use - indeed, permits might encourage motorists to increase their use of motorways to get the most from the cost. There is also concern that tolls should supplement rather than replace existing Treasury finance for road-building and maintenance. The CBI, the Freight Transport Association and the motoring organisations all insist that toll revenues should be spent on improving the motorway and trunk road network, and that this money should be additional to the Pounds 1.7bn a year the government currently spends. Mr MacGregor may find that clearing this hurdle is somewhat harder than winning support for the principle of motorway charging. The Treasury has long been implacably opposed to the idea that any form of government revenue should be 'hypothecated' to particular types of expenditure. It is also unwilling to guarantee any particular level of finance beyond the current public expenditure plans. However, persuading the Treasury to overcome its traditional stance on these issues may be the only way of keeping the public support for motorway charging that Mr MacGregor has succeeded in establishing.</p>

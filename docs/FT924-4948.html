			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Asylum problem for Peru THE arrival of an aircraft loaded with 93 Venezuelan military in the Amazonian town of Iquitos late on Friday has posed a delicate diplomatic problem for the Peruvian government. Gen Francisco Visconti the group's senior officer, claimed they fled Venezuela in danger of their lives. They had chosen to seek asylum in Peru because of 'links of brotherhood which unite our people'. Diplomats and constitutionalists in Lima say that, on humanitarian grounds, the rebels could hardly be sent back to Venezuela. Granting them asylum, however, would further strain tense relations between the two countries. One solution might be to move the Venezuelans on to a third country, possibly Chile. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Peru immediately after President Alberto Fujimori's April 5 coup and Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has been one of the regime's most severe critics. As a result of last week's elections, however, relations were likely to be normalised soon.</p>

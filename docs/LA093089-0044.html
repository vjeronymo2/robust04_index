			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Former City Councilman Mike Schaefer was acquitted Friday of a misdemeanor  contempt-of-court citation alleging that he had interfered in a bankruptcy  case.  </P> <P> Schaefer, a perennial candidate for local and state offices since he left the  council in the 1970s, acted as his own attorney in a non-jury trial conducted  by U. S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office had alleged that Schaefer had contacted other  attorneys in the bankruptcy case, filed documents, and had interfered with the  appointed trustee in the case.  </P> <P> Brewster found that while some of the contacts may have occurred, Schaefer did  not have criminal intent to interfere with the trustee.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Boltovskiy report: "Between Two Slogans. Notes on </F> the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Moscow  Organization's Conference"]    [Text] In the past, everything that belonged to the capital  was called excellent. Now this is no longer the case. And you  cannot say this about the work of the party organization either.    The city party conference of the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation [CPRF] was held last Saturday. Committee  Chairman A. Shabanov gave a very sharp and clear-cut description  of the situation in the country. He compared the city's  Communists with the home guard thrown into the very hell of  combat operations.    Hard as it has been, a lot has been done. Primary party  associations have appeared and have at least started working,  councils are operating -- the intervuz [higher educational  establishment] council and the council of leaders of  enterprises; a discussion club is holding meetings, and  scientific-practical conferences have been held. Of course  there are the elections to the Duma. However, the party  organization is not in the vanguard of events, it has not seized  the initiative, it has not been able to act as the organizer of  a mass movement. That, presumably, is one reason why it has  lost around one-third of the Communists.    But here is the opinion of worker V. Sokolov, now a former  member of the gorkom [city party committee].    "I have received 50,000 rubles since January, and I have  four  kids. The youngest is three months old, and my eldest daughter  is 13. If we all perished, the party would not notice. An  ordinary mortal does not exist for it" -- these are harsh words.    But it is not an unfair complaint. The organization starts  with comradeship. Now that enterprises are stopping and  unemployment is growing, the need arises to create special funds  for assistance to the needy, and the new gorkom should think  about this.    V. Denisov, a representative of the Krasnopresnenskiy  organization, tried to analyze the party's problems  theoretically.    "We have lost Communists because certain party leaders have  noticeably moved to the right," is his viewpoint. "This has  manifested itself in the negation of the theory of class war,  instead of which they are putting forward `state patriotism.'"    There is a big difference between the slogans of national  liberation on the basis of a broad patriotic front, and state  patriotism. The former is a struggle, while the latter is  time-serving. It must not be forgotten that the memorandum on  accord, composed by the presidential team, also takes refuge in  the idea of state patriotism.    The speakers were unanimous that the prevalence of debate in  the life of party organizations is generated by the delay in  adopting a party ideological program. The Russian conference  must finalize things.    The ideological turmoil is rooted in the party's lack of an  adequate social base. For example, over one-third of the Moscow  organization is made up of employees of higher educational  establishments, and the rest are engineering and technical  personnel, and veterans. There are few workers.    A social base cannot be found unless it is not fought for.  The party is unfortunately conducting very poor work in  production labor collectives. There were 18 workers in the  previous gorkom, and now there are 10. One was elected to the  Russian conference. This too is an indicator. It is  characteristic that the discussion of the working movement  seemed to be conducted only at odd moments.    The most important result of the conference is the decision  to strive for the unity of Communists and to join the SKP-CPSU  [Union of Communist Parties--CPSU].</p>

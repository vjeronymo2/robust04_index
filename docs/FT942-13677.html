			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI firm Previous strength on Wall Street helped ICI experience a sharp gain ahead of first-quarter figures on Thursday. The shares were restrained in early trading as NatWest Securities stressed its negative view. However, they closed 24 1/2 higher at 829p with analysts expecting a profit of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m on Thursday against a figure of Pounds 74m - restated for the demerger of Zeneca. There was some assistance from Kleinwort Benson which has moved its recommendation to hold from sell. There was no surprise that Hogg Group, the insurance group, finally attracted a bid but there was surprise at the identity of the bidder. The market had expected an offer to come from HSBC, the far eastern bank whose shares had been marked down accordingly. In the event, the offer was launched by Inchcape, the general trader, which then bought HSBC's 6.1 per cent stake in Hogg at 257 1/2 p a share. Inchcape shares slipped 9 to 552p on news of the Pounds 176.6m recommended cash offer at 255p a share. HSBC rebounded almost 20 initially but settled 10 higher at 733p and Hogg, which had risen from 133p at the start of the month, gained a further 23 to 257p. Talk that Allied Lyons had lined up buyers for some of its food businesses was again heard. Dalgety, off a penny at 445p, was being mooted as the most likely purchaser of the ingredients business, while Associated British Foods was being fingered as a candidate for the cake and biscuit business. The shares bounced 17 to 598p, enhanced by a Pounds 35m agricultural business deal, and ahead of figures on Monday. Allied Lyons rose 5 to 590p. Reports that the deal to buy the Italian Ciga hotel chain was on the brink of collapse, helped Forte shares advance 4 to 241p. The UK group had been outbid for Ciga by ITT Sheraton, but was unlikely to return to the fray, according to leisure analysts. Among construction stocks Alfred McAlpine was strong, up 9 to 262p. The company has been granted planning permission to build 3,330 homes and a commercial development in Cambridgeshire. Elsewhere, Tarmac closed 7 higher at 185p, ahead of results on Tuesday. Eurotunnel fell 22 to 448p as reports circulated that its debt was trading at a lower level. The banking sector was still absorbing Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Lloyds continued its rise, up 12 to 597p on turnover of 10m. Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, was worst hit by the probable increase in competition, dropping 14 1/2 to 432p; Credit Lyonnais Laing downgraded its 1996 forecast 28 per cent to Pounds 871m. Other big mortgage lenders affected were Royal Bank of Scotland, down 8 to 388p, and TSB, down 4 to 214p. There was also heavy trade in Barclays, up 7 to 516p, and NatWest, down 3 1/2 to 442p. The fortunes of TI shares improved after the engineering group held a presentation on its aerospace subsidiary Dowty to analysts and institutions. TI's price moved ahead 7 to 425p on trade of 1m shares. Cazenove was said to have been behind the strong performance of BT whose shares rose 8 1/2 to 391p. The partly paid added 7 1/2 at 272p. The oil majors gave a robust performance in response to a surge in the price of Brent crude and stronger than expected first-quarter figures from US counterparts. BP improved 9 to 385 1/2 p and Shell Transport 14 to 725p. Vodafone, badly affected at the start of the week by the forthcoming launch of Hutchison Telecom's Orange mobile telephone system, continued to rally. NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett led the recovery which drove Vodafone up 10 more to 522p yesterday after good turnover of 5.5m shares. The insurance sector was pulled back by concerns over a television programme scheduled for this weekend and expected to raise questions over asbestosis. General Accident fell 12 to 594p and Commercial Union tumbled 14 to 574p, while Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance slipped 5 to 259p and 3 to 329p respectively.</p>

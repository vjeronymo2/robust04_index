			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KASPAROV, KARPOV PLAY TO A DRAW, REMAIN TIED IN WORLD CHESS MATCH  </P> <P> Soviet grandmasters Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov recorded the sixth  successive draw in their world title chess match Sunday, remaining tied with  one win each and 11 draws.  </P> <P> The players, instead of resuming play Sunday, agreed to end their 13th game  after 42 moves. The game was adjourned Saturday night after 41 moves in five  hours of play with a draw inevitable, according to the experts.  </P> <P> Karpov, playing white, would have opened Sunday's play with Kxd3. The 42nd  move, sealed Saturday night in an envelope, was disclosed with the draw  announcement Sunday.  </P> <P> Each draw brings Kasparov closer to his third successful title defense against  Karpov, whom he dethroned in 1985.  </P> <P> Kasparov needs only a 12-12 result in the 24-game, three-month contest to  retain the crown. The match score now stands tied at 6 1/2 points each.  </P> <P> Karpov, who held the title for a decade before being toppled by Kasparov, was  thwarted by a drawn match in their previous encounter in Seville, Spain, in  1987.  </P> <P> The next game is scheduled for today with Kasparov having the advantage of the  first move.  </P> <P> Both sides are reported to be supremely confident of their chances in the  match, which has a $3-million purse, with $1.7 million going to the winner.  </P> <P> Here are the moves of the game:  </P> <P> Karpov-Kasparov 13: 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5 4 cxd5 Nxd5 5 e4 Nxc3 6 bxc3 Bg7  7 Be3 c5 8 Qd2 0-0 9 Rc1 Qa5 10 Nf3 e6 11 d5 exd5 12 exd5 Re8 13 Be2 Bf5 14 0-0  Nd7 15 h3 Nb6 16 g4 Bd7 17 c4 Qxd2 18 Nxd2 Na4 19 Bf3 Nc3 20 Rxc3 Bxc3 21 Ne4  Rxe4 22 Bxe4 Re8 23 Bd3 b6 24 Kg2 f5 25 gxf5 Bxf5 26 Bxf5 gxf5 27 Rd1 Kf7 28  Rd3 Bf6 29 Ra3 a5 30 Rb3 Bd8 31 Rc3 Bc7 32 a4 Kf6 33 Kf1 f4 34 Bc1 Kf5 35 Rc2  Rb8 36 Re2 Be5 37 Bb2 Bd4 38 Bxd4 cxd4 39 Re7 d3 40 Ke1 Rc8 41 Kd2 Rxc4.

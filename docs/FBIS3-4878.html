			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An auto industry source says the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association, headed by Yutaka Kume, has firmed up  plans to propose to the U.S. automobile industry that a venue be  agreed at which both automakers from both countries can discuss  Japanese purchases of American-made auto parts and moves to  increase sales of American-built cars in Japan. Both issues  have become the focus of a Japan-U.S. trade row in economic  framework talks.    Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have begun  to study plans to purchase American-made auto parts.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and major  automakers plan to finalize details of plans to purchase  American-made auto parts in mid-March, at the earliest, in line  with government plans to open the Japanese market.    Strained Japan-U.S. economic relations following the  breakdown of economic framework talks over the issue of  numerical targets have prompted the automobile industry, which  has insisted that Japanese purchases of American-made auto parts  are not the province of government negotiation, to judge that  the industry now needs to announce measures to resolve the issue.</p>

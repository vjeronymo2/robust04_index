			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Lib Dems tax shake-up proposes top rate of 60% The Liberal Democrats are poised to announce a radical package of tax and benefit measures which would take more than 50,000 people out of taxation and impose a top tax rate of 60 per cent on incomes over Pounds 100,000. Mr Alan Beith, the party's deputy leader, will announce the proposals this week in a paper expected to become policy at the party conference next month. The paper proposes the introduction of three higher rates of income tax at unspecified levels, together with the integration of the tax system with the national insurance and benefits systems. Liberal Democrat officials said no decisions had been taken on the structure of the higher tax rates, or the thresholds at which they would take effect. However the paper guarantees a top level of no more than 60 per cent. The paper suggests that a number of existing tax reliefs valued by middle-income taxpayers should be abolished, including mortgage interest tax relief and the married couples allowance. It proposes a transfer of resources to finance a range of extra benefits designed to have the greatest impact on those with lower income. The proposed benefits include an increase in child support of Pounds 5 per family and the removal from the tax net of 50,000 low-paid workers by equalising the threshold for income tax and national insurance payments. Party officials said the system was intended to increase the fairness of the tax system by improving benefits for the lower paid and making income tax payments more progressive than has been the rule under the Conservatives. Tough controls intended to maintain the quality of television and radio broadcasting will be proposed today by Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat media spokesman. The proposals would remove regulatory supervision of broadcasting from the government. Regulation of the BBC, ITV and independent radio would be transferred to an Office of Broadcasting.</p>

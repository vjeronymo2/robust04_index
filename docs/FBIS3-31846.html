			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Army Press Bureau "communique"] </F>   [Text] Regarding the serious accusations against the  leadership of the Ministry of National Defense published in the  weekly ROMANIA MARE, the Press Bureau of the Army is authorized  to state the following:    1. The entire activity of the Ministry of National Defense  is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the strategy  of the government program, under the control of Romania's  Parliament, the Supreme Defense Council of Romania, and the  government. Therefore, no action taken by the leadership of the  ministry, including the minister, has taken place without the  previous approval of the institutions authorized in this respect  (...)    2. Although the consequences of the economic recession and  of the other difficulties specific to the transition period are  seriously felt in the army, too, the Ministry of National  Defense has obtained noteworthy results, which have been  mentioned as such at the meeting of the Executive and the public  has been informed about them.    We mention a few of these results:    -- the equidistance of the army from any political or party  ideology;    -- the actions aimed at improving the training of all  military groups, while the budget is being reduced every year --  last year's budget was three times lower than in 1989 and was  among the lowest in Europe.    -- courses of flying instruction for military pilots, with  an  average duration three times longer than before 1990, but which,  unfortunately, is still below international norms. In 1993 we  succeeded in promoting all military pilot trainees to the first  stage of full command [iesirea in simpla comanda a tuturor  pilotilor militari], an unprecedented fact in the past 15 years;    -- the improvement of military discipline while action to  restructure the system of social values is taking place, with  respect for the traditional standards of the military  institution thus being weakened. In this respect, through  appropriate measures in the army, we achieved a threefold  reduction of the number of serious violations of standards in  1993 compared with 1991;    -- the implementation of certain measures of social  protection for all military ranks, including reserve officers,  retired officers, and veterans.    3. Through legal measures and government decisions initiated  by the Ministry of National Defense together with the Ministry  of Industry, which bear responsibility for private corporations  that produce military equipment, we succeeded in preserving the  production capacities of the defense industry. They have  continued their specific activity, ensured the production of 74  percent of combat equipment, equipment taken over by the army in  1993, and ensured the fulfillment of export orders, as well as  products for civilian use.    No type of military equipment that can be produced at home  has been imported (thus, no tanks from Israel either!), and the  export of special products has been constantly increasing since  1990.    With Israel and other countries we have organized ventures  to  jointly produce certain special products, but actual production  has been exclusively the job of industrial capacities in Romania.    4. A reduction of combat technology is currently taking  place in our country and as in the case of other European  countries -- including our neighbors -- this action is carried  out strictly in accordance with programs under international  treaties that Romania has signed, treaties signed by the  country's political leadership and approved by parliament.    5. Regarding the so-called "Kent" affair [cigarette  smuggling affair involving a number of military personnel], the  Military Prosecuting Magistracy's investigation in connection  with the case before the court established that the renting of  storage space from the "Romtechnica" Autonomous Public  Corporation was a legal act and did not result in any material  damage to the Ministry of National Defense. From documents  provided to the investigators by the "Romtechnica" Corporation,  the identity of the guilty party was established -- Lebanese  citizen Nassar Elias -- and the amount of the damage to the  Romanian state through evasion of customs duty with the use of  fake stamps was recovered. The military cadres guilty of  certain violation of the military norms, on the basis of which  the customs evasion took place, were removed from their  positions and turned over to the appropriate legal authorities.    6. Regarding the alleged damage to the army's patrimony as a  result of the contract with the Delta Design firm -- whose owner  is Iulian Rosengren -- a firm that had to supply us with oil  products, using its own means, the Ministry of National Defense  detected a lack of trustworthiness of the partner -- who cheated  other institutions as well -- and thus canceled the contract in  time and recovered all the money that represented the payment,  together with interest on the amount owed by the firm (...).    We express our regret that, at this time that is extremely  important for speeding up the process of our country's  integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures, accusations that  are in flagrant contradiction with reality are made public.  These actions show ill will, the more so, since the ministry  leadership has submitted to the democratic bodies of our country  all the requested information regarding the activity of the army.</p>

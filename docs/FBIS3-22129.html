			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>   [Text] Rome, (ANSA) 17 Jan -- ENEA [National Agency for  New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] and the Ministry  for Universities and Scientific Research have signed an  agreement for a program, with funding of over 40 billion lire  (to be precise 42) over three years, for research covering the  entire environmental field. One of the four chapters of the  document is dedicated to the environment (the other three deal  with new technologies, Italian participation in the European  fusion program, and the development of the technical-scientific  support services at the ministry). According to the signatories  to the agreement, it will constitute a fundamental instrument  for the reinforcement of collaboration between the two bodies,  directing resources to the realization of projects with precise  goals. For the three years 1992/1995 the total resources amount  to 400 billion lire.    There are plans for the diffusion of advanced technologies  relating to the environment and for participation in  wide-ranging initiatives that already are in existence, such as  the national plan for environmental research and the Community's  EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] program. Some  sectors of intervention have however already been singled out.  In fact models showing climatic changes will be prepared. This  is a subject in which Italy is historically behind, and  technologies will be developed to reduce impacts on the  environment and manage the various types of monitoring. The  research will mainly concern the Mediterranean Sea, natural  risks to the environment (earthquakes, soil erosion), water  resources and radioprotection.</p>

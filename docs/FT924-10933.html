			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Zuckerman to take over NY Daily News A NEW YORK bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of the New York Daily News, the loss-making tabloid, to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the property investor and magazine publisher. Judge Tina Brozman said the sale was 'necessary and appropriate' shortly after she ruled in favour of Mr Zuckerman on a trade union dispute involving the paper's typographers. Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of the weekly US News and World Report magazine and The Atlantic, a monthly magazine, had warned he might walk away from the transaction if he had to honour a 20-year-old contract that guaranteed life-time employment for 165 typographers. Judge Brozman said enforcing the typographers' contracts 'would have a devastating effect on the sale and would probably kill it.' The fate of the Daily News, which was previously owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has been in the hands of the bankruptcy court since it filed last year for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.</p>

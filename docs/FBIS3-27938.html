			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Now that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono have agreed on a  revision of the political reform bills, the government is  expected to announce an economic stimulus package sometime  between 2 and 4 February. The ruling parties will hold a  meeting of representatives to deal with the question of reducing  income and resident taxes -- the topic of most concern to all --  and will also discuss whether to raise the consumption tax rate  in return. The outline of the 1994 taxation system reform plan  will be finalized 8 February. The Finance Ministry's budget  draft for 1994 is expected to be finished 10 February, and to  become the government budget draft on 15 February. The  government plan is to deal with all pending economic issues by  the 11 February Japanese-U.S. summit.    The overall economic package is made up primarily of  additional public works projects, increased purchase of  public-use land in advance, and assistance to housing  construction and small and medium businesses. Public  investments and loans for these projects are predicted to come  to almost 9 trillion yen. Detailed plans will be worked out on  them henceforth.    The reduction of taxes will probably come in the scale of  6-7  trillion yen as a way of promoting consumption, and it is likely  that even if the related bills on the measure are passed in  summer, they will become effective retroactive to January. Once  the Diet formally enacts the political reform bills, the  representatives of coalition parties will enter in-depth  discussions on the question of raising the consumption tax as a  source of budget revenue. As the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] is opposed to the concept, there is bound to be  tough negotiations with the Finance Ministry, which insists on  specifying the raising of taxes as a revenue resource.    After the representatives' meeting, if they decide to  entrust  the prime minister with making a decision, the prime minister  will make a decision on such points as the scale of the tax  reductions and the time lag between the reduction of the income  and residents tax and the raising of the consumption tax.    The government is likely to hold a Cabinet meeting to decide  on the overall economic stimulus package some time between 2 and  4 February. It will formulate and submit to the Diet the 1993  supplementary budget to implement the stimulus measures by  mid-February.    In the meantime, the contents of the 1994 taxation system  reform plan will also be finalized, and all ministries and  agencies will negotiate with the Finance Ministry on the scale  of their budgets, including defense expenses and official  development assistance in expenditures. Because of difficult  financial conditions, the budget scale will be contained as much  as possible, while expenses allocated to public works will be  raised to rev up the economy.</p>

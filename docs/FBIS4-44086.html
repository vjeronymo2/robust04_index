If this should happen  -- Greece's Papandreou, Spain's Gonzalez, and Denmark's  Rasmussen write -- they will do "everything in their power" to  prevent the next European Commission from being ratified by the  European Parliament. Up until now, this threat had been  repeatedly made only by Socialist European deputies or by  exponents of this political alignment. The difference now lies  in the fact that the warning has been subscribed to by the  Socialist parties' leaders who met yesterday morning in Corfu  before the beginning of the European Council meeting. Among  them, there were three who hold office in government and who, in  this capacity, are taking part in the European summit which  started yesterday evening. Jacques Delors -- who, as president  of the European Commission, sits at the table of the heads of  state or government -- was also there. With his, the signatures  subscribing the warning add up to four.    Perhaps no one will want to spoil the party by repeating the  warning in Berlusconi's face. However, it is written in black  and white in the resolution adopted yesterday morning: It  comprises 11 points, with the veto on "neofascists in the  European Commission" constituting Point 10. In presenting the  document to the press, Willy Claes -- the Belgian chairman of  the Party of European Socialists -- made the message even  clearer by explaining that the concern felt by his political  alignment "is due, in particular, to the situation in Italy."</p>

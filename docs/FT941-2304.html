			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / BBC to end Far East TV service BBC World Service Television broadcasts from London to northern Asia will cease in a month under a deal signed yesterday between the BBC and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The BBC will give up its broadcasts to north eastern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Mongolia on the northern beam of the Star TV satellite system from April 17. In return Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of World Service Television, has negotiated a contract extension to preserve broadcasts to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Both the BBC and News Corporation had the right to terminate the Star contract by the end of this year. Mr Murdoch, who bought control of Star last year, made it clear he wanted the BBC off the system. The BBC negotiated the compromise in return for vacating early the northern beam, which Mr Murdoch wants for a Chinese-language film channel aimed at Taiwan. An announcement on the channel is expected this month. The BBC will be able to continue broadcasting its news and information channel on the southern beam until at least the end of March 1996. No other satellites are available in the region at the moment but the BBC believes that before March 1996 there could be at least three. Mr Phillis said yesterday the BBC regretted the withdrawal or contraction of any service but the agreement with Star TV placed no restriction on the BBC's future access to the region. The BBC will now push ahead with plans to launch an Arabic language satellite service in the Middle East by the autumn. It has also finally signed a joint venture deal to launch a service in Japan. Ten thousand BBC technical and production staff are to hold a strike ballot over proposed changes to working practices and the introduction of performance-related pay. This follows the breakdown of talks between the management and broadcasting union Bectu.</p>

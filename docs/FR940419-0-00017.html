			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five comments were received in response to the proposal. Four were from vessel operators and interested industry members, and one was from within the Customs Service. A discussion of the specific comments follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The additional time proposed to submit documentation is needed and its addition is welcomed. However, a major and much more general review of the regulations should be undertaken. As for the proposal to require the submission of written cost estimates which may be in the possession of a vessel operator, that element should be deleted. Such estimates are not always accurate and inclusion of this element in the regulations may be interpreted by Customs officers in the field as a requirement for all vessel entries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Customs is planning to undertake a total revision of the vessel regulations, to include those governing vessel repair matters, as soon as practicable. As to the accuracy of written estimates, Customs prefers to have some written benchmark for establishing cost rather than just a best guess. Further, there are only three Vessel Repair Liquidation Units, all of which are familiar with and well practiced at applying the Customs Regulations. All three Units are in frequent contact with Customs Headquarters and thus any interpretive problems could be quickly resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The focus should be on elimination of the 50 per cent duty on foreign repairs to United States vessels. The duty is an operational and administrative burden to vessel operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment is non-responsive to the published notice and solicitation of comments. The Customs Service merely enforces the statute as enacted by the Congress. Any change regarding the amount of the vessel repair duty would require Congressional action. If repeal of the statute is desired, it would be appropriate to lobby the Congress and not Customs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While in general agreement with the proposal, it should be recognized that the final cost of foreign repairs is invariably less than the written estimates received from shipyards. It is unfair to liquidate entries 90 days after entry based upon such high estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the initial filing period, the regulations also provide for a 30-day field-granted filing extension as well as an additional filing extension of unspecified length to be granted by Customs Headquarters. These combined periods in addition to the initial 90 days should provide sufficient time to obtain final cost figures upon which liquidation may be based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The extension to a 90-day filing period is needed and welcomed. In regard to the additional element concerning the submission of cost estimates, the wording of the proposal should be altered to make it clear that actual estimate documents need not be submitted, and that only the estimated cost amounts are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Customs does not expect cost estimates to be obtained by all vessel operators anticipating the filing of vessel entries. However, to the extent that such documentation already exists, Customs does not believe it to be overly burdensome to require the submission of copies of those documents. Given the fact that the regulations allow five working days after arrival for the submission of a vessel repair entry, it should be possible to provide existing written cost estimates to Customs by the time the entry process is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The addition of 30 days to the filing time is unnecessary and will only serve to further delay the entry liquidation process. Further, the language of the proposal should have been written to require the submission of written estimates with all entries which are filed as incomplete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Customs disagrees. The proposal was limited to requiring the submission of existing estimated cost documents. Customs does not wish to require that each operator generate new documentation and submit it during the entry process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful consideration of all comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that the amendments should be adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above discussion, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, they are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

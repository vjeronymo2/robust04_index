This action requires a one-time ultrasonic inspection of a suspect population of propeller shafts for metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. This amendment is prompted by a report of an inflight propeller separation due to a metallurgical defect. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective August 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;07, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, 1000 Western Avenue, Lynn, MA 01910.

The FAA's investigation has revealed this population of propeller shafts may contain a metallurgical defect known as a pipe inclusion, which developed during manufacture of the shaft. This defect typically forms during the process of melting the ingot used to form the shaft and positions itself at either end of the ingot. During this phase of the manufacturing process cropping both ends of the ingot normally ensures complete removal of such defects. The FAA has determined, however, that for five heat lots of material, pipe inclusions may not have been completely removed from the material used to form the propeller shaft. The FAA has determined that suspect material was used to manufacture approximately 326 propeller shafts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received a report of a propeller separating from a SAAB&hyph;SCANIA SF340 series aircraft inflight following severe vibration. The FAA's investigation revealed that the propeller shaft separated due to a pipe inclusion defect positioned in a high stress location of the propeller shaft. That defect initiated a crack which propagated to failure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange outer diameter (OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore for detection of subsurface defects. In addition, Table 3 of this SB lists by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) a certain population of suspect propeller shafts to be identified by internal markings during a one-time borescope inspection. Those propeller shafts with markings identified as suspect in accordance with this SB must be ultrasonically inspected prior to further flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / 'We do not want the status of constables': The fight over prison officers' rights The Prison Officers Association will today launch a challenge to last week's High Court ruling that its members have the status of constables and therefore do not have the right to strike. The temporary ruling, if allowed to stand, would mean derecognition of the association as a union. To comply with the injunction the association has called off a three-day programme of industrial action over the government's market testing proposals. The action was due to start today and would have meant thousands of prisoners remaining in police cells. However, the association said it would not participate in talks hinted at by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, aimed at finding a way to maintain the present status of the association's members but allowing them to enjoy certain rights, such as access to industrial tribunals. Mr John Bartell, association chairman, said: 'It would be rank hypocrisy on our part to talk with Mr Howard. It seems to us he has belatedly realised what a mess he has landed himself in. He does not want us to be a trade union but we can have certain rights.' He added: 'We do not want the status of constables. We want to be recognised as a trade union.' Mr Howard has said that many questions need to be resolved - including relations with governors and other people working in prisons - to put industrial relations in the service on a proper footing. A counsel specialising in labour law said yesterday that last week's ruling meant the association had the status of a club, not a trade union. The association has long had a reputation for old-fashioned militancy. Generations of officers have realised they had substantial power by threatening to withdraw their labour. But industrial relations in the Prison Service have progressed in recent years. In 1987-88 the Fresh Start reform programme, while far from a complete success, produced some improvements in management and industrial relations structures. Since then, the Prison Service management has sought to devolve financial and personnel responsibilities to local governors. In June the association signed an agreement recognising the importance of resolving problems at local level. Until two years ago Prison Service management was highly centralised, with the pace of change determined by national negotiations between the Home Office and the association. Now the service is run by an executive agency. Companies managing Britain's private prisons do not have to recognise the association - Group 4, the biggest private operator so far, recognises the GMB general union instead. Future government market testing plans include transferring some public prisons to private management. Although under Tupe - the transfer of undertaking regulations - officers at these prisons would have continued employment rights, the private-sector companies would be under no obligation to continue recognising the association. With Mr Howard now challenging the association's ability to take industrial action, its leaders are likely to feel they have little to lose by fighting their case all the way in court - and little other choice.</p>

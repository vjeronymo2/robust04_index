			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: Clinton names 13 top officers - Appointments JUST 24 hours before becoming US president, Mr Bill Clinton yesterday announced 13 senior State Department appointments, thus deflecting criticism that his new government is unprepared to run the country. His aides said yesterday that as many as 100 sub-cabinet level appointments throughout the administration could be made this week. Some senior Republican appointees are also being either asked to stay on for specific interim tasks or retained as consultants. The State Department list contains a number of former and career foreign service officers but few surprises. The position of undersecretary for political affairs goes to Mr Peter Tarnoff, who served in the Carter administration and now works with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Mr Tim Wirth, the former senator from Colorado, gets a new role as counsellor to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, with special responsibility for a grab-bag of issues, including the environment, science and technology, human rights, refugees and narcotics. Among the more significant regional nominations is that of Mr Winston Lord, a Republican and 1985-89 ambassador to Beijing, to be assistant secretary for east Asian and Pacific affairs, a brief that includes China. Mr Strobe Talbott, a Time magazine journalist and Oxford classmate of Mr Clinton, becomes ambassador-at-large handling matters connected with the former Soviet Union, an appointment meant pto give a higher profile to relations with Russia and other former Soviet republics. Other appointments, all of which require Senate confirmation, include: Mrs Harriet Babbitt, wife of the interior secretary-designate, as ambassador to the Organisation of American States; Ms Lynn Davis, an arms control expert in the Carter administration and now with the Rand think-tank, as undersecretary for international security affairs; and Ms Joan Spero, an economist with American Express, who gets the international economics portfolio.</p>

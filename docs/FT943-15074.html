			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Guatemalan coffee deal heralds new era Fifty pence may not buy a cup of coffee in London, but for Guatemalan coffee workers, an agreement to increase their daily wage by around that amount is being heralded as the start of a new era in labour relations. The agreement, signed last week between the Guatemalan coffee association, Anacafe, and the National Unitary Council of Workers, increases the minimum daily wage from 10 quetzales (Pounds 1.14) to Q14.50 (Pounds 1.65). It also sets up a bonus scheme for higher productivity, and promises to improve living and working conditions for agricultural workers. It is the first time the coffee industry - the preserve of Guatemala's extremely conservative economic elite - has negotiated directly with workers, and the local press has pointed to the accord as a move away from the confrontation that has fuelled over 30 years of civil war. 'The coffee sector has been the most backward in its labour relations,' said Mr Mario Solorzano, a former labour minister. 'This is a message that it now has a new perspective.' Wage rises used to be negotiated through the Ministry of Labour - the last one was four years ago - but they were often ignored. Last week's agreement saw the formation of a bipartisan committee to ensure that the accord is enforced. International labour organisations and human rights groups have frequently criticised farm owners for failing to pay the minimum wage, imposing appalling working conditions, and, suppressing union organisations, often violently. Workers' council leaders believe the accord may have a knock-on effect on wages and the negotiations for the rest of the agricultural sector, which employs about 60 per cent of Guatemala's labour force. 'This is an historic agreement because it breaks with the culture of confrontation between workers and employees,' said Rigoberto Duenas, a council official.</p>

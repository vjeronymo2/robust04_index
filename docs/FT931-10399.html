			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Pits rescue may hinge on power deal: Government favours subsidising coal Go-ahead likely for electricity market reforms THE GOVERNMENT is expected to reject proposals to delay reforms of the electricity industry as a way of expanding the market for coal in order to save threatened pits. Postponing plans for more electricity market competition from next year was proposed in a cross-party Commons committee report to rescue at least a dozen of the 31 pits facing closure. Instead, the government favours an alternative pit rescue plan. This would involve the two largest electricity generators for England and Wales buying larger amounts of British-produced coal at subsidised prices even though there would be no guaranteed market for it. In return for asking the generators to buy up to 60m tonnes of coal over five years, the government would offer subsidies of up to Pounds 10 a tonne. This would bridge the gap between cheaper imported coal and the domestic product. It could cost up to Pounds 150m in the first year but far less later. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, who have been reviewing the controversial pit closure plan, are keen not to slow the impetus of electricity privatisation. Although slowing the pace of liberalisation could return to the agenda, a deal on extra tonnage with the generators is thought likely. The generators are, however, believed to be balking at the possible amounts. On top of the 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the subsequent four years which the generators have already tentatively agreed to buy, the government is thought to be pressing for them to take an extra 60m tonnes over the five years. This would save about 10 of the 31 threatened pits, initially at least. Talks with the generators are unlikely to produce a deal to provide all the tonnage needed to persuade MPs to support a government plan. However, a successful outcome would make a delay in market liberalisation unnecessary. Under the liberalisation plans, regional electricity companies (Recs) would be forced to compete from April for the custom of about 50,000 of the largest customers in England and Wales. Competition is currently restricted to the 5,000 largest customers in the country who use 1 megawatt of electricity in any half-hour; under the liberalisation plans the threshold would be lowered to 100 kilowatts. Expanding the competitive market would, however, make the Recs less sure about future markets and this is one reason they have been reluctant to buy as much coal-fired power as in the past. Delaying liberalisation would be a way of expanding the coal market and saving some pits designated for closure. However, Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator, has advised the government against adopting this course. A final decision on liberalisation will not be taken until the government succeeds or fails to negotiate a deal with the generators to buy extra coal. The white paper on coal is expected this month, possibly next week. Gas prices freeze, Page 18</p>

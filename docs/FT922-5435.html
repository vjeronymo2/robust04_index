			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Mitterrand backs defence freeze FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand has approved plans to freeze defence spending for at least the next three years and to delay several important programmes. The freeze at today's prices, which will amount to a decline in real terms, is contained in the six-year defence framework programme from 1992 to 1997. The programme, which lays out firm budget proposals for the first three years only, will be presented to parliament for final approval in mid-June. The defence budget is already rising below the rate of inflation, to FFr195bn (Pounds 19.73bn) this year. Yet French defence cuts do not run nearly as deep as those made by the UK, US or Germany in response to the break-up of the Soviet Union. Among the main points are a more than 20 per cent reduction in army numbers, which has already been announced and starts next year, and a 60 per cent reduction in heavy armoured vehicles, Mr Jean-Michel Boucheron, president of the defence commission, told Liberation newspaper. It marked 'a turning point in a new geostrategic situation.' The aim was to restructure, not to disarm too fast, he said. The main delays are for Dassault aircraft group's Rafale fighter jet, now to start deliveries two years late, in 1998, and the NH-90 helicopter, being developed with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, for delivery three years late, in 2002. Orders for the Leclerc tank, developed by Giat, the state-owned armaments group, are to be reduced and delayed and a new generation of nuclear submarines is to be shelved. Nearly 40,000 jobs were lost in France in April, when unemployment rose by 1.4 per cent from March to 2.9m people, or 10 per cent of the workforce, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Joblessness is one of the main problems facing Mr Pierre Beregovoy's socialist government. The rate has risen from 9.9 per cent in March and 9.4 per cent a year ago.</p>

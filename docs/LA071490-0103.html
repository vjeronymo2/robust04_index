			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRACTOR CALLS BLAZE A 'TREMENDOUS DISASTER'  </P> <P> Ronald N. Tutor, the hard-driving, outspoken boss of the Metro Rail's largest  contractor, called the fire that raged through the $35-million tunnel that his  crews were building a "tremendous disaster."  </P> <P> But he quickly added that the tunnel fire is "one isolated tragedy" in upward  of $2 billion in public works contracts completed by his company. Isolated  though the fire may be, the Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp. and its boss have  made their share of waves in a notoriously tough business.  </P> <P> Tutor and his firm have been enmeshed in scores of suits over the years.  Tutor-Saliba has been cited nearly 300 times for safety violations by Cal/OSHA  since 1979. A spokesman for the state's occupational safety and health agency  said 9.3% were considered serious, and a "very low" number of willful  violations.  </P> <P> The federal Occupation Safety and Health Administration also has cited the  firm. But in two inspections last year of the tunnel that smolders today, OSHA  apparently found no violations, said Marsha Grueber, director of OSHA in  California.  </P> <P> Tutor-Saliba, one of the largest contractors in California, has won many  lucrative and high-profile government contracts. Its jobs include a  $180-million piece of the New York subway renovation and part of the  $58-million overhaul of the San Francisco cable-car system.  </P> <P> The firm also was one of the lead contractors in the construction of the Tom  Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, the San  Diego Convention Center and the widening of the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> It found one of its biggest projects in the Metro Rail. Out of about 20 general  contractors working on the $1.4-billion Metro Rail, Tutor-Saliba has the  largest number of contracts -- five -- and its share is the richest -- $207.5  million.  </P> <P> RTD spokesman Greg Davy said if the investigation proves that the contractor  was at fault, "he'll probably have to eat" the costs associated with the blaze.  </P> <P> Tutor refused to discuss his theory about the cause of the fire.  </P> <P> In three of its separate Metro Rail contractors, Tutor-Saliba is involved in  joint ventures with Perini Corp., a Framingham, Mass., firm that is the  25th-largest contractor in the nation.  </P> <P> Perini is the main contractor on the renovation of the New York City subway  system. On $180 million worth of work, Tutor-Saliba is a partner. In November,  workers from the firms left debris on tracks, causing a small explosion that  shorted out a rail and resulted in major delays along the Lexington line.  </P> <P> Perini also is a target of a suit by the New York attorney general over the  1987 collapse of a New York State Thruway bridge that killed 10 people.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jennifer Toth in New York and Harold Maass in San Francisco  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

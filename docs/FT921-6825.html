			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Polly Peck administrator visits Cyprus The administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics conglomerate, have renewed their efforts to get the Turkish Cypriot government to open the company's records on the island to them. Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the administrator responsible for corporate finance, arrives in the Turkish-held sector of Cyprus today for talks with Mr Dervis Eroglu, prime minister of the internationally-unrecognised Turkish Cypriot administration. It will be the first time that Mr Stone, who has been trying to get Polly Peck's assets on the island unlocked since November 1990, has met the Turkish Cypriot leader. Last year the adminis-trators obtained a High Court order freezing Pounds 23m of assets held by the Turkish Cypriot Central Bank in London on the grounds that they appeared to have been improperly transferred from the company. There is speculation in London that the order could be dropped if the Turkish Cypriot authorities open up the accounts to the administrators.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Bonds: Investors remain positive towards the dollar sector Correction (Published 25th January 1993) appended to this article. CORPORATE and bank issuers dominated the Eurobond market yesterday, with deals spread across a variety of currencies. The lowering of asset quality partly reflects growing investor appetite for higher yielding paper, as interest rates edge further down. Dealers said there had been a lack of higher-yielding corporate debt in the dollar sector. Investors remain very positive on the dollar market, but the low interest rates in the sector appear to be fuelling demand for slightly higher yields, as was the pattern in the US market throughout last year. So far this year, only triple-A rated companies such as Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and General Electric Capital Corporation have tapped the dollar sector. Consequently, yesterday's Dollars 200m five-year issue for Electrolux, the A3-rated Swedish white goods manufacturer, was welcomed by dealers. 'It is the right sort of asset: lower credit quality, and higher spread,' said one underwriter, 'but the name could have been better.' However, the indicated pricing of the bonds to yield 106 basis points over the when-issued five-year Treasury was considered fair. The deal, arranged by Lehman Brothers International, is due to be priced today. In the sterling market, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a Pounds 150m issue of subordinated bonds due February 2018, via Credit Suisse First Boston. The deal did not suffer as a result of the weakness of sterling yesterday, since it was aimed at domestic institutions. The A2-rated issue was priced to yield 140 basis points over the comparable gilt, again appealing to investors' appetite for extra yield. In the Dutch guilder market, CSFB Finance launched a Fl 250m issue due 2000, via CSFB Nederland, which met strong demand due to lack of supply in the sector. Dealers said that the lack of swap opportunities - and of borrowers with a natural requirement for guilders - has severely restricted supply, in spite of investor interest in the market. A FFr1bn offering for Thomson-Brandt via Credit Commercial de France met reasonable demand, dealers said. The issue was priced to yield 77 basis points over the comparable French government bond. Turnover on Euroclear, the international securities clearing house, reached a record Dollars 10,000bn last year, up 71 per cent, reflecting higher international securities trading volume. Average daily transaction volume in the secondary market reached Dollars 50bn in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 32bn for the first three quarters. The high level of activity will result in rebates of Dollars 12bn for market participants, double the 1991 rebate level. Chemical Banking has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 3bn of debt securities and warrants, Reuter reports. The amount is part of a Dollars 3.1bn offering, of which Dollars 100m was previously registered. CORRECTION Market participants will receive rebates from Euroclear, the international securities clearing house, of Dollars 12m. The figure reported in Friday's edition was incorrect.</p>

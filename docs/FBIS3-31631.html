The review drawn up by the Chamber of Commerce shows that  60-80 percent of the products of "Jugohrom," "Zletovo," FENI and  the Skopje steelworks, intended for export, transit through  Greece, that is the Salonika port, and out of the total raw  materials and repromaterials, 50-60 percent are imported through  Greece.    Some 52,000 tonnes of crude oil are currently at the crude  oil installations of "Mamidakis" and "Jet Oil" in Salonika,  while 116 cisterns are loaded at the station in Salonika and  Idomeni.    A ship carrying 18,000 of phosphate for the smeltery in  Veles  was caught in the process of unloading, and only 28 wagons have  been dispatched, so far.    800 tonnes of ferro-alloys are ready to be loaded, a wooden  construction of 500 cubic meters has been stocked, and there are  also some 400 tonnes of sheet metal awaiting delivery, at the  same port.    As it was said yesterday, at the meeting of the Chamber of  Commerce, this points to an alarming condition and the need to  find alternative solutions. Certain businessmen said that the  government is giving out hopes of false optimism, and that  something much greater is behind this Greek move, and that a  strategy of reciprocity should be worked out. The idea to look  for a corridor for transit of the goods, through FR Yugoslavia,  was also raised.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Forum on training formed MORE THAN 100 national employers have formed a pressure group to represent their views to the government on the structure and funding of training. The National Employers' and Training Providers' Forum was established in Northampton last week by representatives from several big employers including British Gas, Eagle Star Insurance, IBM UK, Marks and Spencer, B&amp;Q and Royal Mail. Mr Roger Shaw of the British Printing Industries Federation, the forum's chairman, said: 'Unity among major employers and providers of youth/adult training is essential.' Mr Trevor Thornett, British Gas's senior training adviser, said: 'Basically we support the government's initiatives - including the proposed National Managing Agency - but we feel it is important to make our views on training provision and funding known.' G10, the group which represents the views of Tec leaders to government, has said it is 'delighted' that Tec budgets emerged largely unscathed from last week's Autumn Statement. Mr Edward Roberts, the chairman, praised Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary for the way she 'fought the Tecs' corner at a very difficult time'.</p>

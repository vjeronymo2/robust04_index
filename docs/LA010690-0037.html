			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMOVAL OF ROBERT TAYLOR'S NAME FROM A STUDIO BUILDING  </P> <P> Concerning the removal of Robert Taylor's name from a Lorimar Studios building  in Culver City ("4 Decades Later, Blacklist Furor Is Rekindled" by Shawn  Pogatchnik, Dec. 1):  </P> <P> There doesn't seem to be much difference in the behavior of the "witch hunters"  on either side.  </P> <P> Intolerance is intolerance.  </P> <P> Taylor was following his beliefs when he testified before the House Committee  on Un-American Activities. The fact that he was misguided about what was a  danger to the country doesn't negate his contribution to the movie industry.  </P> <P> It appears that while Lorimar doesn't agree with Joe McCarthy's politics, it's  willing to adopt his tactics.  </P> <P> BILL SERANTONI, Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

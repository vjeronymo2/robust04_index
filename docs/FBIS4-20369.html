			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments: "Analysis of 1994 Chinese </F> Integrated Circuit Market"]  <H5>  [28 Feb 94 p 7] </H5>   [Text] According to information provided by the relevant  department in the Ministry of Electronics Industry, China's  integrated circuit market will have the following  characteristics in 1994: Integrated circuits in home appliances  will become rather popular; the share of such investment  products as communications that utilize integrated circuits will  greatly increase; design of application specific integrated  circuits by China itself could reach something of a  breakthrough; and in the large market and high technology set  up, the competition of the integrated circuit area will open up  in every direction; science, industry, and trade.    It is estimated that this year, 569 million integrated  circuits will be sold on the consumer market and 445 million  investment type integrated circuits will be sold, for a total of  1.014 billion.    The use of integrated circuits in home appliances has become  more popular, opening up a vast area for the integrated circuit  market. According to analysis, with television producing  factories further improving the grades of products and  increasing various functions, the use of integrated circuits in  televisions can only increase. In 1994 it is estimated that 10  million color television sets and 11 million black-and-white  sets will be sold, and the demand for television integrated  circuits is expected to be 110 million to 120 million.    In 1993, audio equipment factories quickly adjusted and  upgraded their products as a result of improved technology and  changing consumer demand. The products are pocket-sized and  portable digital recorders with CDs and displays and  remote-control stereos. So, they use such circuits as noise  reduction circuits, Dolby circuits, and amplification circuits.  By the same token, radios also require multiple bands and  multiple functions. So, they need circuits such as time control  circuits. This trend will not change in 1994. It is estimated  that 138 million audio circuits will be required in 1994.    Electronic departments that make video tape-recorders  emphasize major administrative projects. Domestic production of  complete sets of CKD forms will formally commence and sound  cameras have been initially designated for test production  domestically at six sites: Beijing JVC, Guangzhou JVC, Shanghai  Sony, and Fuji Company, as well as Xiaxin and Shangguang. In  1994 batch products also could be promoted. Total estimated use  will be 161 million.    Camera circuits. Annual domestic production of cameras is  1.5  million, requiring such things as electronic focus and  electronic shutters. As the world's third largest electronic  clock and watch maker, circuits used in clocks and watches along  with those processed in Hong Kong together come to approximately  35 million.    The product types and the market for electronic games and  electronic toys will still expand in 1994. Total use of circuits  for such language circuits as electronic musical instruments to  make up Christmas and New Year's cards, handicrafts, and  electronic colored light control systems are 60 million to 65  million.    In 1994 home appliance integrated circuits will take a big  step. From January through October 1993, 4.69 million washing  machines were sold, 48 percent of them fully automatic.  Beijing's Longfu Building sold 1,094 washing machines in  October, 935 of them fully automatic for an 85.5 percent share.  A great many brands, such as Hefei's Rongshida [2837 0057 6671],  one after another are promoting microcomputer controlled fully  automatic models of washing machines. Shanghai's Shuixian [3055  0103] brand has a digital automatic checking system and Aide  [1947 1795] AQB45-2D brand utilizes six patents and initiates  six processes at once. It also can automatically arrange the  washing process and has four electronic clocks to set the time.  Jiangmen's Jinling Bawang [6855 6875 7218 3769] machine  automatically dispenses washing detergent. The Xiaoya Shengji'ao  [1420 7700 5110 0679 1159] fully automatic washing machine  controls the water level and turns on the machine and adds its  own washing detergent and even can add heat. Hangzhou's Jinsong  [6855 2646] brand uses fuzzy logic controls and can  automatically set the water level, automatically set the time,  automatically adjust the water flow and the washing process, and  automatically implement overheating protection. The Whirlpool  extra-sensitive washing machine can sense the fiber type and  automatically correct and can accelerate the speed. There  currently are some firms supplying the domestically designed  washing machine control circuits popular overseas. Southeastern  University's Microelectronic Center is researching and  developing all of this themselves from integrated circuits to  control panels.    Such things as wireless remote control air conditioners  (with  liquid crystal displays), highly sensitive gas sensors  triggering exhaust fans, computer fire protected hot water  heaters, microcomputer controlled dishwashers, safety  videotelephone doorbells, and fully automatic vacuum cleaners  are too numerous to mention. It is estimated that by the end of  1994, there will be as many as 50 million integrated circuits  used to control home appliances.  <H5>  [7 Mar 94 p 7] </H5>   According to information provided by the relevant department  in the Ministry of Electronics Industry, the use of integrated  circuits for such investment products as communications also  will greatly increase this year.    The development of high technology communications products  is  one of the basic conditions for an information national economy.  The year 1994 is an important one for China's communications  industry to form an economy of scale.    1. Programmable switchboards. It is estimated that 1994's  annual production of programmable switchboards will be 12  million lines, with 100 million to 110 million complete sets of  integrated circuits.    2. Telephones. China's current annual telephone production  capability has reached 30 million and actual production for  domestic and foreign sales is about 20 million. It is an area  that is ripe for batch production of a scale relative to the  market. Now ringing circuits, dialing circuits, voice circuits,  circuits to avoid raising the voice, liquid crystal drive  circuits, and recorded response circuits for use in telephones  all are being developed. The scale of this market is  approximately 67 million to 71 million.    3. Facsimile. According to a continuous line of planning  thought, this type of cooperative stock company is being planned  in the country. Facsimile integrated circuits have a high  technology content and metal content, and are rather difficult.  With each instrument calculated at 20 chips, a 300,000  instrument market can be figured at 8 million chips.    4. BP machines, dageda [1129 0766 1129], photoelectric  terminals, fiber-optic connector meters and other communications  instruments, and satellite earth stations will use 12 million to  16 million.    5. In addition there are automotive electronics, ship  electronics, traffic control projects, and mining electronics,  as well as electronics to control the electrical load to save  energy, electronic scales, electric meter circuits, medical  instruments, personal home computers, and textile electronics.    The various things listed above are provisionally estimated  at 240 million integrated circuits. From that it is forecast  that 445 million integrated circuits will be used in investment  type products and the share of investment type products will  rise to 43 percent from 39 percent in 1992.    This year, China's self-design of application specific  integrated circuits will reach something of a breakthrough.    China's integrated circuit microelectronics technology is  now  at a design breakthrough. Qinghua's 1 micrometer research and  development line is developing the fax machine thermo-sensor  head's LSI and the Qinghua Huahuan Electronics Company, Limited  is striving to research parts for use in the fourth and fifth  group of optical fiber equipment. The Southeast University  National Asic System Engineering Technology Research Center is  developing a Chinese BP machine circuit and the TP3040 and  TP3057 customer coding board circuits for the programmable  switchboard. The Shanghai National Microelectronic Engineering  Research Center has developed the Santana automobile oil  pressure warning circuit, the electronic speedometer circuit,  bank and telephone magnetic strip circuits, and touch on and off  circuits. The Central Research Institute of the Huajing  Electronic Group has developed the four bit microcomputer  circuit, the EWSD programmable switchboard circuit, the CTS-130W  color television remote control integrated circuit, and the  digital remote control tuning and sound circuits. The Beiling  [6296 1545] Company is developing a color television remote  control circuit and the 1240 programmable switchboard circuit.  The Beijing Integrated Circuit Design Center has developed the  world's highest grade 89C51 single chip processing circuit and a  liquid crystal drive circuit. Beijing University's  microelectronics department is working on a kilomega high speed  ECL circuit. China is presently making a concentrated effort to  research and test 2 micrometer, 1.65/1.2 micrometer, 1  micrometer, and even 0.8 micrometer product technology.  Moreover, units are closely integrating design and application  and linking them to domestic and foreign processing.    In addition, in the large market and in the high technology  set-up, competition in the area of integrated circuits will open  up in all directions; science, industry, and trade.    In 1994 foreign companies will take advantage of the  integrated circuit market, relying on their superior technology  and finances, and they will pay a great deal of attention to  service, even opening up the market for door to door service.  So, in 1994 integrated circuit market competition will not be  with illegally imported goods, but with authentic foreign  products and their agents, competition in science and  technology, between state enterprise and joint venture  production, in trade and information service, and in every  direction; science, industry, and trade.</p>

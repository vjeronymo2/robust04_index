			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S MENTALLY READY TO ATTACK IRAQ, BUSH SAYS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE PRESIDENT MEETS WITH CONGRESS MEMBERS AND RESUMES BLUNT WARNINGS  TO SADDAM HUSSEIN.  </P> <P> President Bush told members of Congress on Thursday that he is mentally  prepared to order an attack against Iraqi forces and that the best chance for  peace is for Saddam Hussein to understand that if there is war, "he's going to  get his ass kicked."  </P> <P> One day after a senior U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia said his forces will not  be ready on Jan. 15 to launch an attack, the President resumed what has become  his primary message: a blunt and almost daily warning directed at the Iraqi  president in the hope that he will recognize Bush's readiness to unleash a  massive attack.  </P> <P> To members of Congress just back from the Persian Gulf and facing the  likelihood of debate early next month over whether to support the use of force,  Bush made it clear he has "crossed the Rubicon" of deciding whether to order  the still-growing U.S. force into action, if necessary.  </P> <P> Emerging from one of two meetings Bush held with members of Congress on  Thursday, California Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the  House Intelligence Committee, said the President meant that "he's at peace with  himself, that if military force is necessary . . . he can live with it."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush "had crossed the Rubicon  in his own mind in terms of being willing and able to use force and to defend  the principles involved." But he said the President had, in effect, accepted  the possible use of force when he first ordered U.S. troops to the gulf last  summer, just after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The expression "crossing the Rubicon" comes from Julius Caesar's decision in 49  BC to lead his forces across the small river, the Rubicon, that divided Gaul  from the Roman Republic in what is now north-central Italy -- a move that began  a civil war.  </P> <P> With Bush and other Administration officials emphasizing the likelihood that  warfare will erupt if Hussein does not withdraw from Kuwait, the President in  recent days has been portrayed by his advisers as being at ease with his  decisions.  </P> <P> "I think he has worked this thing and wrung it out to such detail that he's  quite comfortable with where he has ended up with the options available to  him," one senior White House official said.  </P> <P> California Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Bush told one group of  House members that Hussein does not comprehend the force he would face.  </P> <P> "The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed confrontation is to  make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really aware that, to quote him (Bush),  that 'if we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,' "  Gallegly said.  </P> <P> The President was also said by his visitors to have challenged any suggestion  that economic sanctions be given several more months to pressure Hussein into a  withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should be waiting until next summer," Rep. Michael R. McNulty  (D-N.Y.) quoted the President as saying.  </P> <P> As he prepared to leave Washington today for Camp David, Md., where he is  planning to spend the next 11 days, Bush faced the increasing likelihood that  when Congress returns Jan. 3, the capital will become embroiled in a debate  over the use of force in the gulf.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Congress will probably  debate Persian Gulf policy early in January. But he said the precise timing of  such a debate depends on whether Secretary of State James A. Baker III goes to  Baghdad to meet with Hussein -- a visit that remains very much uncertain.  </P> <P> The White House has continued to make clear that it would not object to a vote  in Congress if it can be assured that such a vote would strongly support Bush's  policy and would mirror a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use  of all means necessary to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait if they have not been  withdrawn by Jan. 15.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said there have been "all kinds of discussions" over the possible  language of a congressional resolution.  </P> <P> "Every member of Congress that comes down here talks about the resolution, and  everybody's got their idea of what it should be. Every committee up there (at  the Capitol) has got 40 brilliant little staff guys running around, drafting  resolutions," he said.  </P> <P> At the center of the Administration's concern over a congressional debate is  the fear that it could suggest to Hussein that Bush lacks enough political  support to launch an attack, thus weakening the threats that Bush hopes will  lead the Iraqi president to retreat.  </P> <P> Mitchell said that in meetings with foreign leaders during his just-completed  gulf visit, he reiterated that the United States is united in the feeling that  Iraq must get out of Kuwait, by military force if necessary.  </P> <P> "The only question is whether this (use of force) will be the first resort or a  last resort," Mitchell told a reporter.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he favors continuing the sanctions, and he  cautioned that the United States would suffer two-thirds of the allied  casualties in any war with Iraq. But he said he agrees that if Hussein refuses  to leave Kuwait because of economic sanctions or diplomatic efforts, force must  be used.  </P> <P> "Our forces are prepared to win," he said.  </P> <P> Of a seven-member Senate delegation that included Mitchell and Simon, Sen.  Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) was the most hawkish.  </P> <P> "Our troops are ready," he said. "I have the feeling we're moving toward war,  and it depends strictly on what Saddam Hussein does. . . . I hope Saddam  Hussein will come to his senses. Sanctions will take too long."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prof. Ulrich van Suntum, director of the </F> Institute for Economic Policy and Business Research at the  University of Witten/Herdecke, and research associate Stefan  Huckemann: "High Growth Hardly Counts"]    [Text] Persistent unemployment in the Western industrial  countries has raised doubts as to whether the free market  economic system is at all capable of providing permanent full  employment. With the winding down of the postwar boom period in  the late 1960's, the old fear that sooner or later society would  run out of work after the most pressing demands of consumers  were satisfied appeared to be confirmed. Even in subsequent  recovery periods unemployment rates did come down on a sustained  basis. According to OECD estimates, nearly 35 million  people--that is, 8.5 percent of the entire labor force--are  without work in the Western industrial countries; in the 12 EC  countries, this rate will even climb to a record 12 percent.    Has the Western economic system therefore failed? Has full  employment become a chimera from an economic wonderland that at  best can still be achieved with the aid of massive state  employment programs or by way of a redistribution of scarce work  through reduced working hours? This question is by no means  being posed any longer only by those who have always had little  faith in the self-healing powers of the market. Resignation is  increasingly taking hold of the traditionally free-market  oriented economists of the leading international organizations  such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Yet it is  surprising how little attention is being paid in all this to two  circumstances that are of paramount importance to a careful  analysis of the problem:    For one thing, it is not true at all, for example, that jobs  have been lost in the last two decades. On the contrary, the  number of people gainfully employed has increased by more than  25 percent in the OECD area with the result that 76.5 million  more positions were filled in 1991 than in 1970. In Europe alone  a good 19 million new jobs were created, which, after all,  amounts to an increase of just under 3 percent. To be sure, this  increase did not keep pace with the simultaneous growth in the  numbers of persons seeking employment and consequently the  problem must obviously be formulated entirely differently than  it is in the simplistic and empirically false notion of a  permanent process of labor cutbacks. The question must be raised  as to the economic mechanisms that can actually satisfy the  demands for jobs by additional numbers of persons of employable  age who are coming onto the labor market and the question must  be asked as to why these mechanisms have functioned in a  progressively less satisfactory manner in the last 20 years.    The second and perhaps more important aspect concerns the  extremely varied successes of the individual industrial  countries in overcoming their employment problems. It is by no  means the case that all countries reacted to the challenge to  their employment policies in the same way; moreover they were,  as a result of their basic economic policy orientation, prepared  for it in different ways. The national rates of unemployment  also differ radically: Hidden by the average 7.3-percent  unemployment rate for the OECD countries in the 1980's are rates  ranging from 2.5 percent and less for Japan, Sweden, and  Switzerland, to that of a good 10 percent for Italy or even 18  percent for Spain. Development during the decade was also very  nonuniform: While Japan, for example, was able to essentially  maintain its low unemployment figures and even lower them at the  end of the decade, Italy, by way of example, with its  unemployment rate of 12 percent, was worse off in the last year  of the 1980's than in any previous year.    There must be reasons for such differences. In less  successful countries, special influences are quickly cited as an  explanation for the better performance of other countries. In  the case of Switzerland, for example, its role as a center of  and magnet for large capital flows is cited, as is its high  percentage of foreign workers that serves as a convenient  employment buffer. For Japan, the principle of lifelong company  employment--hardly reproducible in other countries--as well as  its large export surpluses are cited as special factors--often  in connection with explicit or implied recriminations of  protectionism.    A closer examination reveals the superficiality of such  explanations, however. In comparison with earlier times,  Switzerland has by no means "exported" more unemployed persons  in the past 20 years; the number of foreigners as a percentage  of the overall labor force during the recession of the early  1980's remained unchanged for all practical purposes. The  oft-cited Japanese system of lifelong employment exists there  only in the large corporations and thus affects only about a  quarter of the labor force. And, in the final analysis, it is  not only Japan that can show large export surpluses but, for  example, the Federal Republic as well, and yet nevertheless it,  in contrast to Japan, has not been able to maintain full  employment. Thus, to find the causes of such differences, one  has to dig deeper.    In so doing, it is reasonable to take the basic tenants of  current economic explanations for the origins of unemployment as  a point of departure. There is, to be sure, a considerable  number of relevant hypotheses and some of them are totally  contradictory. It is, for example, a highly controversial issue  as to whether technological progress is a jobkiller or a  jobfiller: On the one hand, it is almost always associated at  first with the elimination of jobs through rationalization, yet  on the other hand it reduces costs and creates margins for new  demand. Even the role of economic growth is evaluated in  completely different ways: To be sure, new demand is created,  yet it appears to have a progressively less beneficial impact on  the employment situation and thereby creates even more  ecological problems than it solves economic ones. There is also  controversy among the specialists over the efficacy of state  labor market policy--such as wage subsidies or job-creation  programs, for example. Is it necessary compensation for the  insufficient vitality of competition or does it, in the final  analysis, hinder the creation of private-sector jobs?    Such a plethora of opinions on the part of economists  literally cries out for empirical examination and there is  indeed no dearth of relevant research--for the most part  restricted to only a few countries or to individual hypotheses,  to be sure. To date, however, there has not been a study that  for once compared the most important fundamentals of the  theories and tested their validity in regard to the respective  employment trends on a cross-section of all the large industrial  countries. Our study, commissioned by the Berthelsmann  Foundation, makes that attempt. The questions were: What are the  causes for the differences in the employment trends of the 17  most important industrial countries since the early 1980's and  what lessons regarding economic policy can be learned from them?    The difficulties involved in such a comprehensive research  project are considerable. They begin with the issue of what  criterion should be used to measure the success of a country's  employment policy in the first place. Of course, a possibility  immediately presents itself in the form of unemployment rates  that are available for most countries based on a standardized  calculation. Yet the annual increase in employment should also  play a role: After all, higher growth in the number of jobs is  also to be considered a success even if it does not result in an  immediate lowering of the unemployment rate--for example, in the  case of a sharp increase in the size of the labor force. For a  specific case, a target figure--a combination of the  unemployment rate and the increase in the gainfully employed  population--was chosen as the measure of success. Of course, job  growth was given progressively less weight as the level of full  employment achieved by a country rose. In the final analysis, it  makes little sense to downgrade a country on the basis of  insufficient new job creation when the full employment target  there has been largely achieved.    It is, of course, far more difficult to identify the  operative factors that are critical to the success of employment  policy. Relevant hypotheses, if they are to be scientifically  validated, must fulfill at least three requirements: They must  be theoretically plausible, they must be quantifiable in a  comparative manner applicable to all countries, and they must be  statistically significant--that is, they must contribute in a  demonstrable way to explaining the success of the employment  policy. Out of the multitude of possible hypotheses, 10  operative factors ultimately emerge that satisfy all these  requirements. For purposes of better comparison, they were rated  on a point scale in which the country with the best individual  score (the highest rate of growth, for example), was given 10  points and the remaining countries were given correspondingly  fewer in accordance with their ranking.    Applied to the period under investigation--1980 to 1993--the  differences in the employment policy successes of the 17  industrial countries studied can be 80 percent explained by  these 10 performance figures, although, to be sure, the relative  importance of the individual factors are quite different. They  were grouped into four categories ("Unions/Labor and  Management," "Labor Market Policy," "Growth," and "Fiscal  Policy").    The greatest influence can be attributed to the behavior of  unions/labor and management. Viewed purely statistically, the  differences can be 40 percent explained on the basis of this  factor alone. To wit, it is of critical importance for the  situation on the labor markets whether unions/labor and  management respect the distributive margins created by growth in  productivity and utilize them in a cooperative manner or whether  they attempt--in the form of unproductive distribution  conflicts--to distribute more than growth provides--an attempt  that, after all, is ultimately doomed to failure. Nonetheless,  this is attempted repeatedly in Spain and Italy and in Canada  and Australia as well--all countries in which there is an  extraordinarily great willingness to strike as well as an  alarming growth in unit labor costs. Indeed, during the period  studied, an average of 667 working days per 1000 workers were  lost due to strikes in Spain compared to only 30 days in  Germany, all of four days in Austria, and less than one day in  Switzerland. At the same time, unit labor costs--calculated in  the national currency--rose in Spain by an average of 8.3  percent--far more than twice as much as in Germany (3 percent),  for example, or in Austria (3.9 percent) or Japan (2.3 percent).  Even though these differences were partially compensated for in  international competition by corresponding exchange rate  fluctuations, they demonstrate that the domestic distributive  margins in the countries in question were constantly  overstrained. The labor markets degenerated into closed  shop establishments for those who (still) had a job. As a  result, incentives and latitude for the creation of new jobs  could hardly be created.    Of course, the issue is not solely the average growth in  wages. The extent to which attention is paid to the differing  degrees of factory and sector productivity is just as  important--as is how flexible, for example, working hours are  arranged and terms of termination are formulated. All of this,  of course, can only be measured with difficulty. Nonetheless, if  the percentage of part-time jobs in the overall employment  picture is taken as the most important indicator of flexibility  of working conditions, then in this case too it is evident that  Spain and Italy--with rates of only a good 5 percent--rank at  the very bottom of the scale. In Sweden and Norway, on the other  hand, every forth job on average was a part-time job during the  1980's, and Germany too--with, after all, a good 13  percent--showed a rising trend.    As far as the two Nordic countries are concerned, they, to  be  sure, owe their comparatively good employment growth to another  circumstance--to wit, to an active and innovative state labor  market policy. In all the countries under comparison it has  obviously been beneficial when unemployment--once it had come  about--was not merely compensated for with commensurate subsidy  payments, but when active measures such as job-creation programs  are given emphasis. The latter in particular are highly  important because in this case the causes of difficulty in  placing somewhat older or very young unemployed persons are  directly attacked. On a purely statistical basis, about 30  percent of the international differences caused by labor market  policy can be explained. Here, of course, it must be borne in  mind that the employment relationships created in this manner  have a predominantly different quality than do jobs that are  created and can be sustained in the private competitive sector.  The example of Sweden in particular creates doubts as to whether  this course can be successfully pursued in the long term because  its negative consequences--in the form of excessive demands on  public finances, permanent jeopardizing of currency stability,  and lack of efficiency--have meanwhile become readily apparent  there. The Swedish unemployment rate has skyrocketed in the past  four years from 1.5 percent to 7.4 percent. The attempt to  change to a more free-market and stability-oriented course has  suddenly revealed the failures of past decades.    As far as growth is concerned, it is time to take leave of  the widespread notion that the employment problem can be solved  solely by high growth. Countries such as Australia, Italy, and  Canada that, to be sure, have all grown at faster-than-average  rates over the past 15 years yet at the same time are suffering  much greater unemployment problems than countries with weaker  growth, are examples that contradict this notion. Indeed  Switzerland, for example, had the lowest average growth rate of  all the countries but at the same time had the lowest rates of  unemployment. Growth is, of course, essential for countries such  as the Federal Republic that find themselves confronted with a  sharp increase in the size of the labor force. If the number of  persons seeking jobs grows, full employment without cuts in real  wages can only be maintained with the aid of investments and  high growth. This, of course, applies especially when income  expectations include additional increases. This explains why  economic growth--calculated across the board for all  countries--nonetheless proves to be responsible for 20 percent  of employment policy success.    But what is really important, after all, is not the absolute  level of economic growth but much rather the degree to which the  distributive margins that make it possible are respected. Not  only unproductive distribution conflicts between unions/labor  and management are at issue here, but also the demands that the  state places on the distributable national product. Since the  early 1970's, these demands have been progressively ratcheted  upwards in virtually all countries and, in the Scandinavian  countries in particular, they amounted on average over the  period studied to well over 50 percent--and in Sweden to even  more than 60 percent--of the national product. Along with this  came a progressively increasing burden on the citizenry in the  form of taxes and social security contributions that drove an  ever-greater wedge between what had to be earned on the job and  what in the final analysis remained leftover from real income.  To be sure, the importance of these burdens for explaining the  international differences in employment growth is, at about 10  percent, not apparently very high, yet that is probably due to  the fact that essentially all countries have embarked upon this  fateful course equally, and partially due to proliferating  national deficits. There are, certainly, two notable exceptions:  To wit, Switzerland and Japan, countries that with government  expenditure rates averaging only 24 percent and 32 percent  respectively for the years 1980-1993 rank at the very bottom end  of the scale. Is it a coincidence that these two countries have  by far the best employment situation?    All too facile monocausal explanations of the situation on  the labor markets should, of course, be avoided. None of the  cited factors can adequately explain the varying employment  policy successes in the industrial countries by itself and  examples can be easily found contradicting any such attempt.  Only when all performance figures can be viewed in context does  the picture become clearer. The 17 industrial countries studied  can then grouped into four fundamentally different categories  that in each case have adopted very different strategies.  Analysis shows that a direct correlation exists between these  strategies and the respective success of employment policy.    Japan and Switzerland, for example, are thus in both  respects--in regard to performance figures well as employment  policy success--ahead of all the countries, while conversely  Italy, Denmark, and Spain, for example, rank at the very end of  the scale in regard to both point scores for performance and  target figures. For the countries ranked in the middle, the  proportionate correlation is, with a few exceptions, striking.  If a mean value is derived from the point scores for target and  performance figures, a graphic ranking of the 17 industrial  countries results that illustrates both employment policy  success and the performance figures critical to it (see table).  Since it is, after all, based on mean values of a time period  spanning 14 years, it is to a great extent independent of  incidental--for instance cyclical--influences. The point scores  of the individual countries are derived from their performance  as it relates to the factors of growth, fiscal policy, labor  market policy, unions/labor and management, as well as the  increase in the gainfully employed population and the rate of  unemployment. The highest theoretical score is 10.0 points.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Employment Policy Results 1980-1993                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Switzerland                           |8.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Japan                                 |8.2                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Norway                                |7.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sweden                                |7.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Austria                               |7.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                               |6.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Portugal                              |6.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |United States                         |6.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Netherlands                           |5.7                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Australia                             |5.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |France                                |5.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Canada                                |5.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Great Britain                         |5.0                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belgium                               |4.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italy                                 |4.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Denmark                               |4.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Spain                                 |3.3                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      One thus has a basis for more precisely analyzing which  strategies countries have pursued in individual cases and how  successful they have been with them. Among the most successful  countries, one group can be initially identified which  includes--in addition to Japan, Switzerland, and  Austria--Germany and, with some qualifications, the United  States. They can best be characterized as stability-oriented  free-market economies because they have a high degree of social  and monetary stability and their employment policies rely  primarily on free-market economy instruments. The salient  characteristics of these countries are few strikes and a  relatively small increase in unit labor costs in association  with low inflation and comparatively modest overall tax and  revenue burdens. All this, of course, is interdependent. If  wage-price spirals could be avoided to a great extent in these  countries, then this has been due to the soundness of their  monetary and fiscal policies as well as to a sense of  responsibility on the part of unions/labor and management. Thus,  the vitality of their markets was sufficiently strong to create  competitive jobs that are not critically dependent upon labor  cost subsidies and government aid.    From the German perspective it may appear surprising that  West Germany (the new federal laender could not be taken into  account) is represented in this top group. In fact, the  situation on the western German labor market can hardly be  satisfactory, yet here we are dealing with a relative comparison  to other industrial countries--and as is well-known, among the  blind the one-eyed man is king. It should also not be overlooked  that the gap between Germany and the model countries Switzerland  and Japan is considerable and that particularly in recent years  Germany has diverged in many respects from the model of a  stability-oriented free-market economy--and not solely due to  the special burdens of German unification. Thus, unit labor  costs have risen alarmingly, and the burdens upon the economy  caused by social and fiscal policies have reached record  levels--even without nursing care insurance.    Germany, especially in respect to fiscal policy, has moved  in  the direction of a second group of countries that can most  appropriately be characterized as active employment policy  welfare states. This group, in which, in addition to Sweden and  Norway, Portugal can also be placed--at least for the first half  of the 1980's--also has, to be sure, comparatively good  employment policy results to show. It has achieved them in an  entirely different manner, however--namely, with the aid of wage  subsidies and job-creation and training programs as well as--and  not least of all--the expansion of employment in the public  sector. Whoever advocates imitating this course of a second or  third labor market should certainly pay attention to its  niceties as well: In both Sweden and Norway great emphasis is  placed upon ensuring that when a job or opportunity for advanced  training is offered at the employment office, it is accepted as  well--slackers are eliminated in this way. Above all, however,  this manner of providing employment as a function of government  is associated with extremely high costs and losses in  efficiency. The Swedish example makes the viability of it in the  long term appear doubtful.    Countries that have neither sufficient free-market economic  vitality nor an active labor market policy but simply attempt to  ameliorate the evil of unemployment through comparatively  generous social safety net systems are, of course, even worse  off. These welfare states that have passive employment  policies--which include Denmark, France, Belgium, and the  Netherlands--are caught in a true welfare trap: The creation of  new jobs is impeded by high taxes and social security  contributions while, on the other hand, the taxes cannot be  reduced because unemployment is high and because individual  incentives for reentering the labor market are often lacking.  The fact that the Netherlands, for example, with a million  work-disabled persons and an astonishingly large number of young  people among them, has the highest rate of work-disabled people  of all industrialized countries, has certainly less to do with  any particular health hazard in that country than it has to do  to a far greater extent with tangible negative economic  incentives. Once a country is deep enough in the quicksand of  the welfare state, however, the employment policy consequences  are not long in making themselves felt, as the poor showing of  the countries in question in the ranking list shows.    The employment situation is similarly miserable in a final  group of industrial countries which includes Australia, Canada,  Italy, Spain, and (at least until the mid-1980's) Great Britain.  Individually, these countries have admittedly very divergent  problems but their common characteristics are serious  distribution conflicts among the socially relevant groups and in  particular between unions/labor and management as well. They are  thus the exact opposites of stability-oriented free-market  economies: many strikes and permanent wage-price spirals usually  associated with a grim fiscal situation and little  imaginativeness in government labor market policy. That is the  scenario that gives rise to the highest rates of unemployment  and the lowest growth in jobs of all industrialized countries.  The poor ranking of the countries in question are thus not  surprising.    The upshot of all the research can be stated in summarized  form in one sentence: Social and monetary stability in  association with a government economic policy that is able to  unite social security with the preservation of adequate  performance incentives is the best guarantor for full  employment. This conclusion may not be very surprising to  economists, but the unambiguous manner in which it can be  extrapolated from international experience over the past 15  years probably will be. It seems that not only has full  employment been lost in the industrialized countries, but the  knowledge of relatively simple economic relationships that  should have been observed for the maintenance of a high level of  employment has been as well.

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (3): Pace gets a bit quicker - Politics THE SLOWNESS of Finland's political system is exasperating the international money markets. 'Our politicians are a lap behind in the race to keep up with events,' observed one senior commentator. But Finnish ministers are unused to having to make quick decisions on important issues. They like to take their time, consulting and negotiating as widely as possible. The building of consensus remains a vital ingredient of Finnish politics. This is why it can often take weeks, even months, before agreement can be reached on economic policy questions, rather than a matter of days. Such a leisurely tempo of work may or may not ensure better decisions are eventually reached, but what is becoming increasingly clear is that this is failing to impress the outside world. Earlier this year, Mr Aho's coalition appeared to recognise the need to speed up the process of decision-making. It proposed, and parliament agreed, that a sensible change had to be made to the constitution, which ensured in future that a simple and not a two-thirds parliamentary majority was needed for the passage of any measure to cut government spending. Ideally, this should make it much easier for Mr Aho's centre-right coalition government to secure the necessary parliamentary approval later this autumn for whatever tough economic cuts are planned for 1994 and 1995. But the ruptures and conflicts that may well break out both inside and between the political parties in the government, particularly in the aftermath of the October 18 local government elections, and these could threaten its already fragile existence. Some ex-ministers are already complaining that Finland is about to Americanise its social welfare system to please the money markets with cuts that will tear to pieces many cherished spending programmes. However, it still seems unlikely that the painful but necessary cuts that ministers will agree upon are going to polarise Finnish politics. The main Social Democratic opposition has moved a long way since earlier in the year to accept the need for cuts in public spending. Under its new leader, Mr Ulf Sundqvist, an ex-banker, it takes a robust free-market view of affairs nowadays. Although keen to see government action to keep down the level of unemployment, the party accepts most of the government's key economic arguments. 'We recognise we have a serious debt problem,' says Mr Sundqvist. 'We must cut our foreign borrowing and we also have to stabilise the markets. We need a broad agreement on balancing the budget over the next two to three years.' The Social Democrats would like to see an immediate government reconstruction and they favour their own early return to power in perhaps a broader-based coalition of national unity. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, is not so enthusiastic about such an idea. 'The most important point is not who is in the government but what the policy is,' he argues. 'There are still some serious questions to be asked about what the Social Democrats want.' Still only 36, the Centre party leader has come in for a barrage of widespread criticism, particularly in the Finnish media. He is accused of being too weak, too accommodating to his colleagues and not tough enough for the job. Such attacks are unfair. His government inherited a miserable economic legacy when it took office in April last year and it has tried belatedly to come to terms with what is needed to rectify the underlying problems. Moreover, it is often forgotten that Mr Aho led most of his Cabinet colleagues and his own rural-based Centre party into accepting that Finland should seek membership of the European Community. The conversion was slow and deliberate but it appears to have convinced most of the country. When the EC application was handed over in Brussels last April it was with wide support in parliament and with the backing of public opinion. More severe questions could be raised about the behaviour of President Mauno Koivisto. Although he is now half way through his second seven-year term, Mr Koivisto has seen his popularity fall away this autumn because of what is seen as his Olympian treatment of the economic crisis. Many outsiders might be forgiven for thinking that the Finnish president is essentially an honorary post, judging by Mr Koivisto's behaviour. However, under the constitution he has considerable powers, similar to those of President Francois Mitterrand in France. Mr Koivisto, a Social Democrat, however has kept his distance from events. His sporadic interventions in support of Mr Aho's government have done little to reassure the Finns. Many would like to see him take much more vigorous action by giving a lead in the flamboyant manner of Mr Urho Kekkonen, the famous post-war president who intervened on a number of occasions to restructure governments. Unhappily, Mr Koivisto appears to have taken a minimalist view of his constitutional powers. Indeed, some observers believe he has devoted more time at least in public to telling the newly independent Baltic states how to conduct their own internal affairs than in expressing a considered and distinctive view about the economic troubles of his own country. But his attitude may well change in the coming weeks if the economy fails to improve and the government parties suffer a severe setback in next month's local government elections. There are clear signs of a growing sense of national urgency in Finnish politics. The pace may not have quickened fast enough to please the markets but the allegedly time-consuming process of making decisions looks as if it is coming to an end.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           VOTERS' PREFERENCES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1991 election     May 1992     August 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Centre                  24.8%             18.9%        18.9% Conservatives           17.2%             17.9%        17.7% Social Democrats        22.1%             24.3%        23.7% Left                    10.1%             10.7%        11.0% Greens                   6.8%             10.8%         9.8% Swedish People's         5.5%              5.7%         6.4% Rural                    4.8%              3.4%         4.8% Christian People's       3.1%              4.4%         3.9% Liberals                 0.8%              1.1%         1.0% Others                   2.6%              2.8%         2.8%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------           ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------              1987   1990   May '91   Dec '91   Mar '92   Jun '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------- For EC       39%    63%    58%       43%       53%       50% Against EC   12%    12%    14%       24%       22%       31% Don't Know   49%    24%    31%       33%       25%       18%  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

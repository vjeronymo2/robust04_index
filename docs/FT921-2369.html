			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Female directors report widespread inequality THREE QUARTERS of female company directors believe women are discriminated against in the workplace, according to the first survey by the Institute of Directors of the views of its women members. A third of the directors said they had had direct experience of sex discrimination, particularly early in their careers. Male attitudes at work and employers' failure to take into account the child-care and domestic responsibilities of their employees were blamed as the chief causes of the discrimination. There was strong support for the institute's lobbying for tax relief for child-care costs. Lady Wilcox, a member of the institute's council who chairs the National Consumer Council, said there was evidence that, because of the pressures on women at the top, they were leaving it too late to have children. The survey reported that 43 per cent of the female directors were childless. Female directors strongly opposed any system of quotas or targets to boost the numbers of women in top jobs. Respondents feared they could be accused of not achieving their positions on merit. The issue of whether targets should be set for the employment and promotion of women surfaced last year during the preparation of the employer-led equality campaign, Opportunity 2000. The BBC, for example, believes strongly that numerical targets are essential, while as J. Sainsbury, the retail chain, is opposed. The institute has 2,600 female members in a total membership in the UK of more than 33,500. The survey was of a random sample of 200 women directors, more than 90 per cent of whom were executive directors. The main findings are: Men and women are not given equal chances at work according to 74 per cent of the female directors surveyed. Directors in the service sector felt this most strongly; 80 per cent in business services, for example, thought there was inequality, compared with 58 per cent in manufacturing. The most common reasons given for a lack of equal opportunities were male attitudes towards women (37 per cent); fewer opportunities for women in senior positions (33 per cent); difficulties with women returning to work, child care, flexible working (18 per cent); women's domestic commitments (18 per cent); and the difficulty of women proving themselves in the workplace (14 per cent). According to 87 per cent of female directors, women face obstacles not encountered by men. These are responsibilities to children (35 per cent); the need for career breaks (29 per cent); male prejudice (23 per cent); not being taken seriously (21 per cent); lack of child care (16 per cent); and domestic responsibilities (16 per cent). Thirty-six per cent of female directors thought they had faced obstacles not presented to men. They were: women having to prove themselves and work harder; the assumption that senior positions should automatically be filled by men; and men not taking women seriously. Eighty-nine cent said they would oppose the introduction of quotas in their companies and 69 per cent said they would oppose targets. More than half gave as the main reason that 'selection should be on merit'. Too little is done to encourage women to join and stay in the labour force, according to 67 per cent of female directors. Measures favoured were: retraining after career breaks (82 per cent); flexible working hours (79 per cent); workplace nurseries (77 per cent); career breaks (60 per cent); financial support for private child care (58 per cent). Actual practice is in sharp contrast to what female directors believe should happen. Of those who did not think their companies were too small to provide measures to encourage women, 21 per cent reported that no steps at all were taken. Only 2 per cent of companies provided workplace nurseries and career breaks were available in just 23 per cent of cases. There was a widespread feeling that tax relief should be provided on child care, with 68 per cent agreeing strongly with the idea and 17 per cent agreeing quite strongly. Of those with children under 16, 81 per cent agreed very strongly and 10 per cent agreed quite strongly. Women's Participation in the Workforce.

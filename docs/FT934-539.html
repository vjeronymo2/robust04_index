			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Scottish Life to end society ties Scottish Life, the mutual life assurance company, is to end its relationships with the Portman and Staffordshire building societies from the end of June and from the end of 1995 respectively. The company said yesterday that it would no longer use tied agents to distribute its products and would focus entirely on selling through independent financial advisers. IFAs already bring in about 97 per cent of its business. Scottish Life said the cost of the arrangement was disproportionate. Both it and the building societies emphasised that the decision did not reflect dissatisfaction with the working relationship.</p>

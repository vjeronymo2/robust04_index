			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAND TO DISBAND POLICE UNIT THAT QUELLED SOLIDARITY  </P> <P> A feared paramilitary force that once helped suppress the Solidarity movement  will be disbanded, Poland's Interior Ministry announced Friday.  </P> <P> The move came less than a month after the new prime minister, former Solidarity  activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, formed the East Bloc's first government that is  not controlled by Communists.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the ZOMO riot police force,  which wears helmets and high black-leather boots and carries shields and  batons, will be disbanded to save money and remove an "irritation" to society.  </P> <P> ZOMO will be replaced by special "preventive patrol units" of the civic  militia, as the police force is called, to be established in 22 of Poland's 49  provinces, the state PAP news agency said.  </P> <P> Interior Ministry spokesman Wojciech Garstka said the power to deploy police  will be reserved for the prime minister, a government presidium or the interior  minister.  </P> <P> ZOMO, formed in 1956, developed a reputation as a brutish enforcer and was  especially active after martial law was declared in December, 1981. It is  believed to have at least 12,000 members.  </P> <P> Also on Friday, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz told Parliament of moves by  the new government to reshape the ailing, centrally planned industries set up  under communism.  </P> <P> Poland, he said, will work toward creating "a modern market economy" along  Western capitalist lines.  </P> <P> Balcerowicz said the main task is to slash inflation by limiting excessive wage  increases and cutting state subsidies. He predicted that this program will  "unavoidably bring about troubles in the functioning of enterprises and  bankruptcies." However, he said it is the only way to win approval for loans  from international lenders to rebuild the economy.  </P></p>

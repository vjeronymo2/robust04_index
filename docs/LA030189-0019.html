			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A multimillion dollar TV ad campaign for Blake Edwards' new R-rated film, "Skin  Deep," has been toned down because all three networks found the commercials too  risque, which strikes the film's producer, Tony Adams, as ironic. "The biggest  hypocrisy is that when the networks promote their own movies, there are no  bounds. They show the most provocative sex scenes ever," Adams told The Times  on Tuesday. "We're an R-rated movie, so we know we couldn't air our ads until  after 9 p.m. 'L.A. Law' has more double-entendres and sex scenes than we were  showing. In testing the TV spots, we didn't get any negative reaction. But we  had to pull the whole campaign over the weekend." Edited and "milder" spots  began airing Tuesday and will blitz the airwaves prior to the film's national  opening Friday. John Ritter stars in "Skin Deep," which Adams describes as a  "typical Blake Edwards farce about how difficult it is for a man to change."  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A submittal from the State and local districts of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvable <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  SIP demonstrating attainment by the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline will enable EPA to rescind the FIP in its entirety. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that this rescission is appropriate even if the SIP for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area has other deficiencies (such as deficient RACT or NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules) which trigger separate FIP actions. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 110(k)(4) of the Act, EPA can conditionally approve a state plan which lacks adopted enforceable measures as long as the state has been made a commitment to adopt the enforceable measures within one year of the conditional approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Act allows states to replace FIP requirements with SIP measures, subject, of course, to EPA's approval of the SIP measures under sections 110(a), (k), and (l) of the Act. The Act provides that EPA is relieved of having to promulgate a FIP at all if the state submits and EPA approves a replacement SIP before the FIP must be promulgated. Section 110(c)(1) of the Act provides: ``The Administrator shall promulgate a Federal implementation plan at any time within 2 years after the Administrator [makes certain findings or disapproves a SIP] unless the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator promulgates such Federal implementation plan.'' Section 302(y) of the Act defines a FIP as ``a plan (or portion thereof) promulgated by the Administrator to fill all or a portion of a gap or otherwise correct all or a portion of an inadequacy in a State implementation plan.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' If a state fills a gap or cures an inadequacy in its SIP subsequent to EPA promulgating a FIP, the FIP may be rescinded or revised. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognized this principle in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Coalition for Clean Air v. EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (reported as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Coalition for Clean Air v. Southern California Edison <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ), 971 F.2d 219. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA wishes to emphasize that all existing and future SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations remain the responsibility of State and local agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> despite provisions in the FIP that may fulfill, in whole or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, these obligations. Thus, the State and the applicable areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the State are subject to the sanctions provisions of section 179  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any failure to submit a required plan or plan element, or upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disapproval of a required plan or plan element. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 179 of the Act, two principal sanctions are authorized: a highway funding restriction and an increased offset requirement for major new or modified sources. The highway funding sanction is enforced through an EPA prohibition on approval by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation of projects or grants in the area except where the Secretary has determined that the purpose of the project or grant is to improve a demonstrated safety problem. Section 179(b)(1)(B) also allows the Secretary to exempt certain projects and grants that are intended to minimize air pollution problems. The offset sanction requires that major new or modified sources in the area obtain at least 2 to 1 offsets before construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 179(a) requires EPA to impose one of these sanctions within 18 months and the remaining sanction within 24 months if: (1) The state has failed to submit a required plan or element; (2) the required submission is deemed incomplete; (3) EPA disapproves the required submission; or (4) an approved SIP provision is not being implemented. Section 110(m) allows EPA to impose these sanctions at any time after EPA has made one of these findings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While EPA's FIP promulgation process unfolds, the responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local agencies in Sacramento, Ventura, and the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast are developing their own plans under the schedule provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1990 Amendments. Depending upon the time EPA is able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve SIP replacement measures submitted by these agencies, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may upon approval of such measures either refrain from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating, or withdraw the corresponding portions of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 110(c) and 302(y).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the relationship between the FIPs and the developing SIPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evolves, EPA will confront a number of issues. One question that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been raised is whether the State may claim credit toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting progress or attainment requirements for the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions from FIP measures that apply to a limited category of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources over which State or local control is legally preempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue is whether the State, in its plan, may seek not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace these FIP measures, but rather continue to rely upon them,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the same time obtaining EPA's full approval for the state plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA has not previously addressed this specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question, a straightforward reading of the Clean Air Act's text and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure suggests that a state plan to be approvable must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate attainment of the relevant standard, without reliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on measures that EPA has promulgated solely pursuant to its FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. (Under this theory, a state could still rely on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures that EPA has promulgated under its independent authority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as Title II, as opposed to its authority under section 110(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assume California's waiver role under, for example, section 209.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See discussion of EPA's FIP authority, section III.A.2.a. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decide otherwise would require the conclusion that Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended FIP measures to remain in place, perhaps permanently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without sanctions being imposed on the state_a view arguably at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> odds with the Act's historic emphasis on the primacy of state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and the role of FIPs as temporary substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, it may be argued that, for a limited number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sources over which the federal government, when promulgating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP, demonstrably has sole legal authority, and over which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state is barred from exerting control, removing the FIP measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hence requiring the state to compensate for the lack of control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these sources may force it to impose unreasonably and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inequitably harsher controls on other sources. Thus, the argument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goes, EPA should consider whether there is any basis in law, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justification in policy, for carving out a limited exception to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not resolve this complex issue here, but intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to analyze and explore it. In this proposal we solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the legal and policy implications raised by this aspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the relationship between the FIP and the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1993, the State submitted Sacramento ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate-of-progress plans for the Sacramento Metropolitan Area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing the Act's 15 percent rate-of-progress plan requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sacramento area's 15 percent plans involved a coordinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the five local air pollution control agencies. Each of the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies developed a plan for their portion of the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reductions in Sacramento's 15 percent plans rely on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M program, measures that the State and local governments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have adopted or have committed to adopt, measures that the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government will have to develop and implement for the Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, and substitution of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for VOC reductions. However, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvable enhanced I/M program has not been authorized by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State legislature, EPA has decided preliminarily that it will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accept commitments for measures for purposes of the Act's 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent rate-of-progress provision, and EPA cannot credit NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in place of the necessary VOC reductions. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA cannot take action at this time to approve this submittal with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the Clean Air Act progress demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

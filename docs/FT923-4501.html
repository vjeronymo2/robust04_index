			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Russia takes hard line in Kuriles dispute HOPES of a breakthrough on the Kurile Islands row between Japan and Russia were further dampened yesterday when Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned Japan not to expect him to hand back any of the islands when he visits Tokyo next week. Failure to resolve the problem has become a stumbling block in efforts to improve ties. Japan has refused to contemplate large economic aid to Russia until it recognises Japanese sovereignty over the four islands. Mr Yeltsin was speaking on Japanese TV via a satellite link-up. An international report on the Kuriles plumps for transfer of the islands to Japan. The report was written by experts drawn from Russia, Japan and the US, co-chaired by academics from each of the three countries. It has no official status, but all three chairmen, Prof Graham Allison of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Prof Hiroshi Kimura of the International Research Centre for Japanese Studies at Kyoto, and Dr Konstantin Sarkisov, head of the Russian Centre for Japanese Studies, have 'ties to their countries' policy communities' and are likely to be taken seriously. They call on Mr Yeltsin to apply the principles of 'law and justice' to the issue by offering to hand over two of the four islands (the Habomais group, and Shikotan) at once, negotiating the handover of the remaining two (Iturup/Etorofu and Kunashir) within a fixed one to two years. The report proposes Japan set up a comprehensive economic co-operation and aid programme to help Russian reforms, at a cost of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 25bn) over the next 10 years. It urges Japan to lead the Group of Seven nations in providing assistance in converting defence plants to civilian use, investment and aid to the Far East region, and expertise on de-nuclearisation and environmental clean-up. Mr Yeltsin's overall tone was cordial. He wished to discuss a wide range of issues, not focus on the territorial dispute. 'Some people have been making hysterical remarks about the dispute, but I have no plans to cancel the visit,' he said. He is likely to find any talks rough going unless he brings a compromise on the islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kuriles in Russia. The experts' report argues that a referendum in Russia on the issue, sought by opponents of a handover, is not constitutionally essential. In an appended working paper, Mr Vassily Saplin, deputy director of the Pacific and South-East Asia department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, says opponents of the present government would blame Mr Yeltsin for 'capitulating'. This could 'become a serious destabilising factor for Yeltsin's government'.

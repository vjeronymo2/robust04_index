			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche manoeuvres for space - A look at the German carmaker's attempts to carry on the battle with the Japanese In Stuttgart lies a battered Porsche in a pool of red. It is not a car but the company. Porsche, whose products have been synonymous with the words sports car since the first 356 model rolled out of its Zuffenhausen plant in the 1950s, has been losing money heavily in the past three years. Its annual sales have plunged from a peak of 50,000-plus in the late 1980s to just over 14,000 last year. However, Dr Wendelin Wiedeking, the chief executive, insists not only that the damage is mostly superficial but that, refuelled by the DM200m (Dollars 118m) rights issue launched earlier this month it will soon be once again zooming along at the head of the world sports car pack. 'Porsche is not going to leave the world sports car market to the Japanese,' he says. Bald statistics suggest Porsche has not been having much choice in the matter. Last year it built just 12,500 cars compared with 50,000 in the mid-1980s. It sold 14,300; so at least surplus stock was being mopped up. But it is a measure of decline that in the US, the world's most important sports car market, only 3,700 were sold compared with peaks of 30,000. Its half-year results show that its car sales are at last turning up - the increase was 19 per cent over the year-ago period. Even so, when the current financial year ends in July, Porsche will have lost DM450m since 1991. It took nearly a decade for the world at large - or at least that portion of it with cheque books fat enough to warrant an interest - to conclude Porsche was the sports car market's emperor without clothes. Through most of the 1980s, as the whizz-kids of the financial markets in their thousands swelled Porsche's more traditional - and historically much smaller - customer base, it enjoyed cult status, based on the entirely solid foundations of its proud competition record and high quality. Two-thirds of all Porsches ever made are claimed still to be operational. However, Porsche began to believe the hype. Even in the enthusiast motoring press, it was getting away with making minor changes to its three-model range, grandiosely proclaiming them to be new and receiving an uncritical, adulatory response. Development of the fundamentally new products which are any car maker's long-term survival ticket languished, eventually the respected Car magazine commented: 'For the first time in my life Porsche is no longer interesting. Porsche is quite literally an also-ran. A maker of terribly old cars.' However, Dr Wiedeking is adamant that Porsche will escape the fate towards which previous management policies were leading it: a retreat ever further upmarket into more expensive products and dwindling volumes until there was nowhere left to run. A new two-seater, the Boxster, is to be launched in 1996 selling for DM70,000 to DM80,000 - the sports car market heartland where Japan is enjoying most success. The Boxster, predicts Dr Wiedeking, will achieve 16,000 sales a year. The 996, successor to the 30-year-old 911, will be launched a year later. Together, he insists, they will make Porsche a viable producer of about 30,000 cars annually investing regularly in new products - the lack of which has been at the core of Porsche's malaise. Finances will be further underpinned by assembling cars for other manufacturers, already being done with Mercedes and Audi. Some 2,000 will be built this year and the practice is to become a fundamental profit centre, with talks also currently going on with non-German car makers. In this scenario, continued independence under the Porsche and Piech families would be assured, Dr Wiedeking maintains. Introducing the two new Porsche models will cost DM1.5bn. That Porsche is rich enough to do so - helped by the impending DM200m rights issue - is itself a pointer to past under-investment. Dr Wiedeking has spent little more than a year in the job. But he has replaced almost the entire board, stripped top management from six to four layers, reorganised the global sales organisation and ejected or redeployed about a third of the management structure. 'He has put a bomb under the whole organisation and even admits to having changed senior managers' functions for no reason other than to make them feel uncomfortable', observes Mr Nick Snee, analyst with SG Warburg. Dr Wiedeking talks confidently of returning to break-even next year and of decent profits by 1997. However, according to Mr Uwe Loos, production director, 'we have to use the crisis to change things, not just saw off heads'. Much of a 30 per cent costs cut since 1991 has come from almost 2,000 job cuts. But Mr Loos is counting on the rapid establishment of a continuous improvement mentality to generate enduring competitive benefits. Component costs have to be brought down by an average 30 per cent and supplier numbers from 900 to about 300. That process is going ahead ruthlessly. Porsche says it wants change through partnership. But of 190 suppliers who have already been reassessed, 144 have been shown the door. According to Mr Loos, new suppliers have cut the cost of instrument panels and front seats by 80 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Production time for a 911 is almost 30 per cent lower than in mid-1991. The current 85 man-hours per car (50 among Japanese rivals) is to be cut to 60 by 1995. Most visible change is on the Zuffenhausen factory floor, where advisers Shin-Gijutsu, led by Toyota's former top engineer, Mr Yoshiki Iwata, have had free rein to make improvements. Dr Wiedeking maintains that workers are backing rationalisation unreservedly, after initial scepticism, and producing 'amazing' results. The new management's concern is to embed the philosophy of continuous improvement firmly enough to ensure that it will survive - even if, as it suspects, the workforce becomes less flexible when the worst of the crunch is past.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Japanese warrants are down, but not out - Derivatives As Mark Twain might have put it, reports of the Japanese equity warrant market's death are greatly exaggerated. True, symptoms of an ailing market abound: the supply of bonds with warrants attached has slowed markedly in recent months, warrants have severely underperformed the underlying stock market of late and volatility has declined sharply. In this environment, Morgan Stanley recently stunned the trading community with its decision to pull out of warrant market-making, the second defection this year after Baring Brothers withdrew in January. In the D-Mark sector, where only some 40 warrants are actively traded, Commerzbank announced early this week that it, too, would stop market-making. However, most market participants say the market is suffering only a temporary malaise from which it will recover when the environment improves. 'It's been a difficult time, but the market has survived tough times before and will do so again,' says a senior warrant dealer in London. The market for Japanese equity warrants - call options on stocks, stripped from bonds issued by Japanese companies and then traded independently - has had its ups and downs. Pushed to dizzy heights in the late 1980s by the raging bull run in Japanese equities, warrants slumped when the Nikkei 225 index plunged from a high of 38,295 to a low of 20,222 in 1990, falling as low as 14,309 in 1992. They have shadowed the stock market's lacklustre performance through the Japanese recession. Warrant issuance has fluctuated accordingly. From a high of Dollars 67bn in 1989, issuance slipped to Dollars 29bn in 1991, Dollars 16bn in 1993, and has totalled a mere Dollars 8.2bn in the year to date, according to data from Euromoney Bondware. Meanwhile, the expiry of more than Dollars 100bn of warrants in the past two years alone has meant that a significant number of maturing issues have not been replaced, thus reducing the absolute number of actively traded warrants. This year's uninspiring performance of the underlying market hasn't helped. After a spurt early in the year, the Nikkei 225 has languished in a narrow range between 19,000 and 21,000. 'When the stock market is static and volatility falls, this erodes the time value of the warrants, causing them to fall in price,' says Mr Cliff Benford, head of trading in Far Eastern markets at Fleming Securities. Warrants dramatically underperformed stocks in recent months. After reaching a high of 1,093 on June 17, the DE Shaw Warrant Index fell by 37 per cent to 689 this week, compared with a 9.5 per cent drop in the Nikkei 225 during the same period. But according to Morgan Stanley, its main reason for pulling out was that warrant market liquidity was drying up. 'We will continue to have a substantial presence in the market, both through our client business and proprietary trading,' says Mr Charles Stonehill, head of European equity operations at Morgan Stanley. 'But what we believe is unattractive is a market-making requirement in a market of declining liquidity.' Following the liquidation of large warrant positions this year, some investors' withdrawal from the market has rendered it less liquid, says Mr Stonehill. 'You can't run a market for the benefit of the market makers - you need to have some sophisticated investors. If liquidity comes from market-makers dealing with each other, that's false liquidity.' Others disagree. 'This is not a dealer-driven market, it's driven by institutional investors - the dealers just provide additional liquidity,' argues Mr Louis Salkind, managing director at DE Shaw Securities, one of the biggest warrant market-makers. Moreover, he adds, there is actually more liquidity in many warrants than in the underlying stocks. Some say it's not so much the market's liquidity but its profitability, or lack of it, that persuaded Morgan Stanley to stop making markets. They say that houses with a well-established client base have been able to weather the storm more easily than those with large proprietary trading books, largely the big US houses, which have suffered most from this year's downturn. 'The houses with huge hedge books have enjoyed great profits in the past, and this is the first cold bath they've taken,' says Mr Benford. Since Flemings' business is driven by institutional investor activity, 'we can sit out these droughts - we're not affected by the drop in volatility because we don't have a proprietary book', he says. Warrants, which tend to he highly geared, are a favoured way for hedge-traders to play the Japanese stock market. 'Warrants are a speculative vehicle offering fast, liquid and leveraged exposure to the market,' says one trader. Meanwhile, the 11 remaining market-makers are expected to continue providing a liquid market. The London-based warrant market-makers are Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura, Yamaichi, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Robert Fleming, BZW, Cresvale, DE Shaw and Smith New Court. However, despite a chorus of soothing statements from the market-makers, supply does remain an issue. New Japanese accounting rules, introduced in April, which require that bond and warrant portions of new issues be accounted for separately, were seen to increase the issuers' cost of funding and have slowed the flow of issues, with the convertible bond market taking up some of the slack. While the new rules do alter the playing field, they don't justify predictions of doom for the warrant market, according to Mr Salkind at DE Shaw. 'While warrant issuance has dropped off substantially since the new rules took effect . . . the recent shortage of warrant issues is probably more reflective of seasonal patterns and bearish sentiment in the warrant markets than a reaction to the changed regulatory environment.' Moreover, as the convertible market, which has seen a rise in issuance in recent months, approaches saturation, 'there is increased interest from issuers who perceive the warrant market as still open for issuance,' says an official at Nomura. According to several market sources, the coming months are likely to see some large dollar offerings which could revive the warrant market - provided the stock market also shows some improvement and volatility recovers. 'We need a pick-up in market volatility before we would regard the market as generally cheap,' the Nomura official says. Amid predictions of the market's recovery, even Morgan Stanley seems to be keeping its options open. 'Though we don't feel optimistic about any immediate change in market conditions, that could change,' says Mr Stonehill. 'Some of these factors may be reversible, and if so, we will re-evaluate our decision.'</p>

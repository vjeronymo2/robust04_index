			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 6 Jun (TANJUG) -- The talks on an absolute  cease-fire in Bosnia, which have been postponed since last  Thursday, should begin in the Palais des Nations in Geneva soon.  Yasushi Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams has officially  confirmed that "all Serb elements have left the 3-km exclusion  zone around Gorazde, as required by the UN resolution."    A joint statement confirming this has been signed in Gorazde  by representatives of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and the  Muslim side, Williams said. A meeting between Yasushi Akashi,  the UN secretary general's special envoy, and the vice president  of the Croat-Muslim Federation will be held in the Palais des  Nations first. The talks between the warring sides should  follow.</p>

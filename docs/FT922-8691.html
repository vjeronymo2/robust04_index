			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Altron earnings increase 19% ALTRON, the South African electronics and technology group, managed to lift earnings by 19 per cent in the year to February in spite of a slight drop in turnover. Turnover dropped marginally to R2.65bn (Dollars 926m) from R2.66bn the previous year, but operating income was 8 per cent up at R311.9m. Attributable earnings rose to R92.7m from R77.6m. Earnings per share were 19 per cent up at 488.9 cents, and the dividend was raised by 12 per cent to 159 cents. Mr Bill Venter, executive chairman, said the static turnover was the result of the depressed business environment and the rationalisation of certain non-performing assets and businesses. He said the group was well placed to fund acquisitions and organic growth, having accumulated a cash surplus of nearly R200m, up by R127m from 1991. The turnround in the interest bill - to income of R17.5m from a charge of R11m - and tight controls were the main reasons for the good operating performance. Altron has been hard hit in recent years by lower state expenditure on telecommunications and defence, but the results, achieved against a difficult background, suggest the worst is behind the group. Mr Venter said many new opportunities were being pursued as the group sought to broaden the base of its products and markets. Altech, the electronics arm of the group, lifted attributable earnings by 11 per cent to R92m. Mr Venter said a number of new product developments were nearing fruition and should contribute significantly to future performance. Earnings rose by 5 per cent to R43m at Powertech, the power technology subsidiary. Mr Venter said the company was well placed to take advantage of increased infrastructural spending by the South African government. Fintech, the information technology subsidiary, lifted attributable earnings by 114 per cent to R20m. Mr Venter said rationalisation in the group was largely complete and order books stood at record levels.</p>

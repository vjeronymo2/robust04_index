			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After a meeting with President Luis Alberto  Lacalle at the Libertad building, Senator Walter Santoro  yesterday morning resigned as president of the executive board  of the Herreraist faction. Lacalle demanded a political  definition from Santoro, who said he supports the presidential  candidacy of Dr. Alberto Volonte.    Santoro spoke to CX-8 Radio Sarandi shortly after the  meeting. He said he had been summoned by the president who, in  his capacity as leader of the Herreraist sector, wanted to know  Santoro's choice among the presidential candidates. The  president mentioned the two alternatives (Juan Andres Ramirez or  Alberto Volonte).    Santoro said he informed Lacalle that his choice was  Volonte.    The Canelones Herreraist leader was then asked if this  involves "a departure." He replied that he always considered  Lacalle the true leader of the Herreraist faction, and that for  this reason he also resigned the presidency of the Herreraist  executive board.    As for his political future, Santoro said he has for a long  time been in touch with Volonte, adding: "I practically created  his political position: I discovered him, I urged him, and now I  have the satisfaction of seeing the level to which he has risen."    He said: "I have no problem in supporting his candidacy."    As to the chances that the candidacy of Volonte might have  outside the Herreraist sector, he said the answer will come with  time. "We have so far maintained our party activities and our  work for presidential candidates within the Herreraist faction,  and we have never conversed with anyone outside this faction,"  he added.    "We have always tried to resolve the issue within the  Herreraist faction, to which we have always belonged and in  which we remain, because we believe that Herreraism goes beyond  merely electoral matters or personal positions," Santoro  explained.    He concluded: "We maintain that Volonte is a Herreraist  candidate and that we remain Herreraist faction members."  [passage omitted]</p>

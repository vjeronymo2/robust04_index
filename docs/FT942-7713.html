			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Racal pays Pounds 12.3m for Air Group division Racal Electronics has paid Pounds 12.3m for the information technology and security division of Air Group, the multimedia and wireless communications concern. Payment comprised Pounds 11.9m in cash and Pounds 376,854 in shares. The division, which includes three Airtech businesses, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 8m last year. Racal said it intended to combine the companies with its own IT security operations in Europe and the US to create a new force in the business. The new group, to be called Racal-Airtech, will be run by Mr Alan Lamb, Airtech's existing managing director. It will have initial sales of Pounds 18m a year. Racal expects revenues to double in three years. IT security has become an important issue as the dangers of hacking, fraud, accidental damage and operator errors in large computer networks have become apparent. The worldwide business is estimated at Pounds 1bn and growing rapidly. Mr Nick Randall, Air Group managing director, said the company would use the proceeds of the sale to develop its interests in multimedia software, where sales had grown from nil to Pounds 4m over four years, and the communications industry.</p>

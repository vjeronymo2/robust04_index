The session  was attended by managers of departments and organizations, the  Crimean Council of Ministers, oblast administrations, and the  Kiev and Sevastopol city administrations. Participants in the  session discussed the observance of border and customs  regulations, and the implementation of presidential and  governmental decrees concerning these issues. A resolution was  adopted outlining ways to resolve current problems.    The session also approved the employment program for 1994.  The aim of the program is to implement concrete measures  granting productive employment and efficient social care for  those categories of citizens unable to compete as equals on the  job market.    A concept for forming special free economic zones was  approved in general. The concept will provide a methodological  basis for adopting resolutions and drafting necessary documents  stipulating concrete free economic zones.    Participants discussed a draft national program for  eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident and  providing social care for citizens in 1994-1995, as well as up  to the year 2000. The document was forwarded on for completion.    The government approved and decided to submit for  ratification a draft presidential decree on forming a single  system of privatization organs in Ukraine.    The participants considered the issue of adopting a new  payment system for municipal services and rent, as well as  special purpose compensation for certain strata of society.  Propositions suggested by the State Committee for Housing and  Municipal Services stipulate that the share of people's payments  toward the general cost of municipal services will gradually be  increased by reducing subsidies for municipal enterprises.</p>

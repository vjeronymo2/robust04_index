			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Judge lets Lloyd's probe continue Regulators from Lloyd's, the insurance market, can continue with their loss review into syndicates 80 and 843, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Mr Justice MacPherson dismissed an application by Mr John Macmillan, the former underwriter for the syndicates, for the review to be stopped. Mr Macmillan said that if the loss review continued it would prejudice the civil case brought by Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - against his managing agency, RAF Macmillan. He said transcripts of his interviews could be used as evidence in court. The judge ruled, however, that the public interest in the review being completed outweighed any possibility that the civil action might be prejudiced. He said there was no risk of serious prejudice being caused and that publication of the interviews might assist all concerned in the action. About half of the 1,050 Names on the two syndicates are suing the managing agents for negligence over losses sustained in the 1988 year of account. They are claiming damages of Pounds 20m. The review into syndicates 80 and 843 is expected to be completed and published early next new year. The ruling provides Lloyd's with general guidelines about proceeding with other loss reviews when legal actions are running in parallel. The judge said issues of possible prejudice would have to be considered in each case. The loss review department is carrying out seven reviews. Lawyers for Mr Macmillan were yesterday considering an appeal against the ruling.</p>

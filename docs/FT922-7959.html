			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Continental Air moves back into the black CONTINENTAL Airlines, one of the middle-ranking US carriers and in bankruptcy since late 1990, reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 17.4m in the three months to end-March. This compared with a Dollars 181.3m loss in the same period a year earlier, when the Gulf war-related slump in traffic volumes drove the industry heavily into the red. However, Continental acknowledged that the profit resulted from a non-recurring gain of Dollars 52.8m - mainly as a result of the sale of slots and gates at New York's La Guardia airport. It did make a much-reduced operating loss of Dollars 3.7m in the period  - compared with the Dollars 138m deficit 12 months earlier. Revenues in the first quarter rose to Dollars 1.41bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in 1991.</p>

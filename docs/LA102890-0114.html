			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> 'HIGH &amp; LOW' SLUMMING;  </P> <P> WHY A RISKY AND AMBITIOUS EXPLORATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODERN ART  AND POPULAR CULTURE FALLS FLAT  </P> <P> The sumptuous debacle that is "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture"  should give the Museum of Modern Art serious pause. In fact, just half as much  pause as it gives an astonished viewer would suffice. For although the  much-touted exhibition ranks as the museum's resolute attempt to rejoin the  lively conversation of contemporary cultural life -- a vigorous discussion from  which the august institution has been largely absent for well over a decade --  the simple truth is this: "High &amp; Low" seems to be talking to no one but  itself.  </P> <P> Recently, the museum has undergone a changing of the guard at the  high-visibility helm of its department of painting and sculpture, and "High  &amp; Low" is that new director's inaugural presentation. Astonishment that  this is his idea of a show that would be of interest to anyone but an academic  pedant, one who gets electric jolts of excitement from footnotes more eagerly  than from works of art, is matched by the sinking feeling that the museum's  entrenched position as defender of an aging and ever more narrow canon will  continue into the foreseeable future. It's business as usual on 53rd Street.  </P> <P> "High &amp; Low" is a flop, but a flop worth analyzing for a consequential  reason. Its subject -- the relationship between the individual artistic  imagination and the world of popular and commercial culture -- demands an  expansive rethinking of 20th Century art. That rethinking has provided  considerable juice for much of the most substantive American and European art  since the 1960s. MOMA, though, has merely tinkered, and in ways that  demonstrate just how disengaged this former flagship museum really is.  </P> <P> Since its opening early in October, "High &amp; Low" has been almost  universally decried, but not for having been unable to gather together an  extraordinary group of paintings and sculptures. The sprawling display, which,  after closing in Manhattan on Jan. 15, will travel to the Art Institute of  Chicago in February and, in June, to L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, is rich  in works of individual excellence by whole rafts of 20th Century artists:  Picasso, Duchamp, Rodchenko, Miro, Brancusi, Cornell, Rauschenberg, Twombly,  Warhol, Lichtenstein and more. That's what makes the debacle sumptuous.  </P> <P> Nor is the disaster due to gross indulgence in shoddy scholarship. To the  contrary. Kirk Varnedoe, the new helmsman at MOMA, and Adam Gopnik, art critic  for The New Yorker and co-organizer of "High &amp; Low," have been diligent in  unearthing specific sources in popular culture on which artists have drawn.  Many are illuminating.  </P> <P> For instance, they've dug up copies of the newspapers that Picasso and Georges  Braque clipped in making their revolutionary Cubist collages, and they've  figured out punning references in those clippings. They've brought together  Francis Picabia's drawings with exactly those commercial advertisements from  which they derived, and they've assembled ads designed by Rodchenko for  commercial products. Convincing connections between Philip Guston's figurative  paintings and characters in comics by Al Capp and Robert Crumb have been  pinpointed, and the comic books are shown in the galleries with the paintings.  The curators even trace spiral paths of influence -- high into low into high  into low, like a twisting snake devouring its tail -- that such imagery has  sometimes followed.  </P> <P> Varnedoe's and Gopnik's assertions are by no means uniformly convincing. When  they claim that Picasso's great, 1906 portrait of a hulking Gertrude Stein,  complete with its archaizing simplifications drawn from models in ancient  Iberian sculpture, actually ranks as the first great example of the modern  influence of caricature on high art, then the term "caricature" has been  stripped of functional meaning. For Picasso's arresting portrait of his  intimate friend can be (and has been) called many things, but satirical and  ludicrous are not among them.  </P> <P> No, the show bombs for more substantive, structural reasons than occasional  flights of art historical fancy. "High &amp; Low" collapses beneath an  insistence that the history of art is nothing more than the history of  successive styles, and that modern art of the 20th Century is distinguished  merely by being the history of highly personal, individual styles.  </P> <P> "Modern art has liberated, as no art has before, the private imagination of the  artist," announces an introductory wall-text. "Yet again and again, modern  artists of all kinds have turned for inspiration to the public life around  them, and have adopted motifs and styles from commerce, entertainment and the  language of the streets."  </P> <P> Here's one example of the problem. By the 1940s, abstract painting had come to  symbolize the serious commitment of an American avant-garde. In 1966, the  widely admired Abstract Expressionist painter Philip Guston began a startling  repudiation of abstraction. The curators say, in the show's big, 460-page book,  that his shocking reversal is important because, given the public success of  Abstract Expressionism in general, "What Guston needed, like so many damaged  and visionary old men, was above all a private style."  </P> <P> To say Guston's attraction to mass-produced comics was a search for personal  style is not just bizarre, it's delimiting. Guston's new figurative art became  a touchstone for the epochal shifts of a younger generation for reasons of far  greater moment. In repudiating abstraction, he, like they, had begun to  question the assumptions on which modern art itself had come to depend.  </P> <P> Would that the curators had followed suit. The exhibition casts the artifacts  of popular culture as participating, to a degree, in this quest for personal  style. The show is at pains to identify, by name, the designers of these  usually anonymous forms. Yet, because the mass appeal of pop artifacts signals  the absolute antithesis of individual style, their principal worth is seen to  be as available fodder for artistic use. "High &amp; Low" doesn't really  consider the difficult relationship between "Modern Art and Popular Culture."  It's merely an annotated catalogue, plastered across the museum's walls, which  chronicles "Some Modern Artists and One Among Their Many Sources."  </P> <P> Twentieth Century artists climbed high, the show proposes, on the exponentially  growing mountain of low-culture trash. In the eyes and minds of Varnedoe and  Gopnik, popular culture could be colonized by great artists merely because,  like Everest, it was there. We're invited to join them in enjoying the dizzying  aesthetic view.  </P> <P> If this thesis sounds crashingly familiar, it's because its broadest outlines  once formed the creation myth of modern American art.  </P> <P> In 1939, the 30-year-old critic Clement Greenberg published his first essay on  art. "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" drew on the perceptive ideas of several earlier  writers to establish strict boundaries between advanced modern art and the  artifacts of popular culture -- between "high" and "low." And in 1961, at  precisely the moment those boundaries were about to be fatefully breached --  most obviously by a host of young artists whose disparate work was to be  gathered under an umbrella called Pop Art -- an anthology appeared of  Greenberg's criticism from the past two decades. "Art and Culture," which led  with his essay on the dangers of kitsch, stood on one side of a rift that soon  grew into a yawning chasm. Scores of challenging young artists lined up on the  other.  </P> <P> In the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg had championed the work of the emerging  Abstract Expressionist painters (most notably Jackson Pollock), in writings  that elaborated the distinctions first drawn in "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." Art  that made clear and precise the parameters of a medium's own nature -- the  flatness of a painting, to cite the most famous example -- and nothing more,  was successful for expressing moral honesty.  </P> <P> By contrast, artistic illusionism was claimed to be naturally dishonest, false,  a masquerade for art. And illusionism, from commercial advertisements to the  movies, was the stuff of pop culture kitsch.  </P> <P> Notice the specific terminology Greenberg chose to use, in 1939, as brackets  for "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." While the United States furiously debated its  possible entry into a European war, the critic's remarkable essay made subtly  suggestive equations for art. Greenberg lamented that the School of Paris had  lost its avant-garde leadership, and he worried whether American artists would  be able to pick up the banner. The French term, avant-garde, which had been  adapted for modern artists in the 19th Century from the military phrase for an  advance-scout team, was equated by the critic with a progressive tradition of  moral honesty. Kitsch, which described popular and commercial art, was a slangy  -- and pointedly German -- word that equaled treachery and falsehood.  </P> <P> Greenberg concluded his essay with a discussion of the tactics of Hitler,  Mussolini and Stalin and of why they suppressed avant-garde art and championed  popular culture, or kitsch. Politically, dictators could benefit by promoting  an illusion that the masses actually rule; so the art the masses enjoyed and  understood was proclaimed by fascist leaders to be the only true art, while the  avant-garde was squelched. (Hitler's assault on modern art, incidentally, will  be the subject of an eagerly anticipated show in February at the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art.)  </P> <P> In Europe, a battle for the soul of art was on. And if an as-yet immature,  American avant-garde was to blossom in any meaningful way, Greenberg believed a  prohibition against the "taint" of popular culture was essential.  </P> <P> The critic's opposing terminology was therefore compellingly descriptive, but  hardly neutral. Eventually, cracks formed in the creation myth. Art is not as  pure as Greenberg insisted. In retrospect, the use of morally loaded terms to  describe cultural products, followed by a claim that those descriptions are  somehow "natural," was plainly contradictory. Since the late 1950s, some of the  most compelling art has been engaged in questioning, probing and dismantling  this fiction, on which the very ascendance of American art in the postwar years  was based.  </P> <P> This is precisely the art which, from Pop and Minimalism onward, the Museum of  Modern Art has been most wary about embracing. A great irony in "High &amp;  Low" lurks in the near-total lack of self-reflection on the museum's own role  in the subject. The interplay between modern art and popular culture has  special meaning for the institution, for MOMA was founded in 1929 with a  special goal in mind: to popularize in America the art of the avant-garde, a  purpose the museum was to achieve with considerable success in the years that  followed.  </P> <P> MOMA had opened its doors within weeks of the great stock market crash, but the  timing wasn't all bad. The Depression turned out to be the era of great,  triumphant flowering for most of the mediums of popular culture we now take for  granted.  </P> <P> Movies began to talk. Network radio spread singular news and entertainment from  coast to coast, and rudimentary experiments in television commenced. For radio  (and later TV), effective commercial advertising became the very motive for  establishing a broadcast system based on the network principle. Two inventors  of new mass-culture forms emerged to wild success: Walt Disney and his animated  films in Los Angeles, and Henry Luce and his multiple magazines in New York.  And on a smaller but no less ambitious scale, the Museum of Modern Art began to  sell the public on the heretofore obscure idea of advanced art and design.  </P> <P> There's no need to rehearse here the well-known and hugely successful history,  from the 1930s on, of MOMA and its innovative touring programs of packaged  exhibitions. Let's just consider one example of the way its shows of modern art  were themselves disseminated as mass entertainments.  </P> <P> The museum's important 1936 exhibition, "Dada, Surrealism and Fantastic Art,"  introduced major aspects of the European avant-garde to America. It was also a  publicity blockbuster. Newspapers and magazines couldn't get enough of the  outrageous Salvador Dali, and Meret Oppenheim's sexually suggestive "Object" (a  fur-lined teacup) created an uproar. In movie theaters across the country,  Paramount and Universal showed newsreels about the exhibition, which itself  generated more press locally when it traveled to cities in Pennsylvania,  Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota and California. Russell Lynes, MOMA's  official biographer, opined that by the end of the tour the fur-lined teacup  was probably the best-known single object in America.  </P> <P> Somehow, none of this comes across today in the galleries of "High and Low,"  where the infamous teacup is safely ensconced in a case airlessly devoted to  the influence of shop-window display on modern sculptors. The museum's own role  as shop-window of a different kind doesn't come up. Perhaps the severest critic  of such an "us" and "them" attitude -- and in fact of the exhibition as a whole  -- is MOMA's own landmark building, which was elaborately renovated a few years  ago. Stand in the new greenhouse atrium for a while, watching streams of  visitors glide on sleek escalators up to the permanent collections or down to  the show's basement galleries, and the numbing triviality of the exhibition's  blinkered premise comes immediately into focus. Housed in a building whose  architectural style is best described as Shopping Mall Modern, its  "revelations" of art's sources in pop culture feel puny.  </P> <P> Blinkers narrow perspective. Imagine, if you will, the pure folly of attempting  to present a definitive thesis on the history of Baroque art and Catholicism  without ever going to Rome. Now, recall a lecture given by The New Yorker's  Adam Gopnik at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in June, at which the  co-curator of a mega-show predicated on an understanding of popular culture  allowed as he had never before been to L.A.  </P> <P> Imagine, more fatefully, the destiny of artists working in Los Angeles during  the postwar era -- decades that saw the final apotheosis of Southern California  as pop culture Eden. There's no need to list (yet again) the artists in L.A.  whose work has been grossly underrated during the last four decades. But how  could it be otherwise? Since prevailing critical rhetoric had sought to  eradicate any taint for the American avant-garde, the better to lift it to  prominence over European art after World War II, who could finally champion any  new art that was issuing forth from L.A., the crucible of kitsch?  </P> <P> Certainly not the standard-bearing Museum of Modern Art. One Southern  Californian is indeed represented in "High &amp; Low." Among the three early  works by the redoubtable Edward Ruscha is a pungent, 1962 word-painting, in Boy  Scout blue-and-yellow, that is a classic of the artist's pioneering fusion of  commercial graphic style with established, high art motifs, so crucial to the  1960s. "OOF," as this imposing canvas is descriptively titled, is the single  major painting by Ruscha in MOMA's all-important permanent collection. It was  acquired just two years ago.  </P> <P> OOF, indeed.  </P> <P> MOMA's traditional myopia goes in two directions. Kirk Varnedoe has added a  contemporary coda to his historically minded exhibition, which otherwise pretty  much ends with artistic developments in the 1960s. Work by three artists in New  York who emerged as important in the 1980s -- Elizabeth Murray, Jeff Koons and  Jenny Holzer -- is shown, in order to suggest that the source-mongering  tradition continues.  </P> <P> Worthy artists all. Astonishingly, though, it's as if the most salient  development of the 1980s art world -- its internationalization -- had never  happened. But not only did it happen, it was (and is, because it's still being  played out) intimately caught up in the issue at hand. The stunning return to  prominence of European art in the last dozen years stands as the flip side of  the smaller, and simultaneous, re-emergence of Los Angeles as a cultural force.  For if L.A. was created by the modern era as the great producer of American  popular culture, Europe, in the difficult rebuilding of the post-war period,  was re-created as its great consumer. Colonizing Europe with America's image,  "the Colonies" returned the favor. Artists on both sides of the Atlantic have  worked from that experience for a generation.  </P> <P> At MOMA, though, the smaller story of "Modern Art and Popular Culture" is  framed by the larger one the museum has told from the start: In the beginning  there was Paris (and a few artistic suburbs, such as Moscow and Berlin), and  when that was over there was the island of New York. It's fine with me if the  folks on 53rd Street want to keep flogging that tired tale. But after years of  Rip Van Winkle drowsiness, its influence in things contemporary has grown  mighty dim.  </P> <P> Indeed, it might be too much to expect a wholesale rewriting of the history of  20th-Century art from the museum, which has a lot at stake in maintaining The  Official Story. It's hardly possible to imagine them fostering a scorched-earth  revision that, say, went something like this: Abstract Expressionism wasn't the  fragile beginning of a modern, American avant-garde, but the triumphant end of  a European one; on this fresh foundation of a mature American art, the 1960s in  New York, Los Angeles and the established capitals of Europe witnessed the  early, fitful emergence of something else, something that is still taking  shape. Whatever that something might be -- Post-Modernism seems to have faded  as the aesthetic term of choice -- it clearly has to do with experience in an  entrepreneurial world of consumable images.  </P> <P> MOMA's curators began "High &amp; Low" with old convictions about the art of  the past, then tried to march forward with the banner. Had they begun with new  convictions about the art of the present -- convictions tantalizingly, even  startlingly announced at the end of the exhibition catalogue -- and then looked  back to see how we got where we are, they might have enlarged our vision of  history. What's in MOMA's show today would go where it belongs -- into the  catalogue, as background -- and what is now only suggested in the book's final  chapter ("Contemporary Reflections") would be fleshed out as a full-scale  exhibition. Whether or not visitors to such a show would agree with the  museum's choices about which art of our cultural moment really matters, and  why, at least there would be something to sink your teeth into. As it stands,  there's only predigested mush.  </P> <P> "High &amp; Low" amply demonstrates that the Museum of Modern Art isn't just  parochial, which is to be expected of any earth-bound institution. Instead, the  ghastly feeling of enervation in the show is caused by a creeping awareness  that its long period of disengagement has left the museum painfully, horribly  provincial.  </P></p>

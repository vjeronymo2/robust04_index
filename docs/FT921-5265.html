			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Further lead case on swaps is settled ANOTHER of the lead cases in the long-running litigation over interest-rate-swap agreements has been settled out of court. Samuel Montagu &amp; Co, the investment arm of Midland Bank, yesterday reached agreement with Welwyn Hatfield District Council, against which it was claiming Pounds 1.26m under two swap agreements. Welwyn has also settled its third party claims for Pounds 181,538 and Pounds 1.06m respectively against the London boroughs of Hackney and Islington. The terms of the settlements have not been disclosed. It is the third of the six lead cases to be resolved without a trial. Last month Samuel Montagu settled with Birmingham City Council, while Barclays and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its investment banking subsidiary, reached agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - in both cases on undisclosed terms. Another lead action in which Citicorp Investment Bank is claiming Pounds 521,323 against Sandwell Borough Council is due for trial next Monday. In third-party proceedings Sandwell is claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London Borough of Hackney, while Hackney has a claim for interest against the London Borough of Brent. The remaining lead cases of Chemical Bank and National Bank of North Carolina v Hammersmith and Fulham are scheduled to be heard after Easter. The lead cases were selected because they covered the great majority of the points of law that arose following the House of Lords' ruling in January last year that all interest-rate-swap agreements between banks and local authorities were invalid because they had been outside the councils' legal powers. The ruling left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on transactions with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover around a quarter of their losses by suing councils for the return of funds earned by writing swap contracts. The object of selecting lead cases - which are not strictly speaking test cases as a ruling in one would not be binding on any other - was to try to give guidance for the remaining cases and avoid multiplicity of litigation. A consequence of the out-of-court settlements is that such guidance is less likely to be available to any who are unable to resolve their differences without going to court.</p>

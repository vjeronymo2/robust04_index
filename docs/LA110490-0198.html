			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD SELECTS DEVELOPMENT HEAD  </P> <P> Inglewood officials Friday named a former Los Angeles County development  specialist, Jesse J. Lewis, as the city's new director of development.  </P> <P> Lewis, who will begin the new post Dec. 3, will help create new development  projects. He will also head the city's efforts to redevelop areas under the  flight path of Los Angeles International Airport and to build low- and  moderate-income housing, city officials said.  </P> <P> Development has been a key issue in Inglewood, which has experienced a boom in  residential building in some areas but lags in commercial projects in the  downtown area.  </P> <P> In his post with the Los Angeles Community Development Commission, Lewis worked  on projects that included a shopping center and single-family and multifamily  housing developments.  </P></p>

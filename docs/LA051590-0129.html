			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COMPANY FINDS AN ALLY IN FORMER FOE  </P> <P> Three months ago, Councilman Robert A. Curtis was battling for his political  life against the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> The giant development company was a major financier of the failed campaign to  recall Curtis, contributing more than $350,000 and a high-paid political  consultant to the effort. And Curtis fought back, accusing the Mission Viejo  Co. of trying to buy City Hall.  </P> <P> Now, these bitterest of foes have become unlikely allies. On Monday, the  developer released a statement announcing Curtis' endorsement of a  controversial 719-home development proposed by the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> "We see it as glasnost," said Wendy Wetzel, Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman.  "It's time to put the disruptions behind us and go on with what's good for  Mission Viejo."  </P> <P> After a series of meetings with company President Jim Gilleran over the  weekend, Curtis said he gave his endorsement in exchange for the company's  promise to abandon several housing projects totaling 392 units and to give the  city a potential City Hall site that both sides said is worth several million  dollars.  </P> <P> "They blew me away," Curtis said. "This proposal is an example of what can be  achieved through good faith cooperation and compromise rather than polarization  and confrontation."  </P> <P> Under the agreement, which would still need to be approved by the Planning  Commission and the City Council, the city would be deeded seven acres of prime  commercial land near Crown Valley Parkway and Interstate 5 for possible use as  a City Hall site.  </P> <P> The land is next to a proposed major commercial center planned by the Mission  Viejo Co. that would include a million square feet of high-rise office space,  restaurants, hotels and theaters.  </P> <P> The proposed 719-unit housing project would result in the destruction of  Naciente Ridge, the city's last undeveloped hilltops near Olympiad Boulevard  between Oso and Alicia parkways. The development plans have drawn intense  criticism from neighbors concerned about imperiled views, traffic and other  issues.  </P> <P> Curtis said he tried to address the ridge issue, winning a concession from the  company to build a slope above 40 of the 49 proposed ridge-top homes.  </P> <P> "Essentially it will be a manufactured ridge," he said. "Those who feel there  should be no homes at all will not be satisfied. But that hope is unattainable  and unreasonable."  </P> <P> Milt Jacobson, a member of the Citizens to Save the Ridge, said he has mixed  emotions about the deal negotiated by Curtis.  </P> <P> "I don't feel betrayed, but I also don't feel that the city of Mission Viejo  has won a victory," Jacobson said. "I kind of feel lousy about it, even though  we got more than I thought we would from the Mission Viejo Co."FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Salah al-Qallab from Aden] </F>   [Excerpts] It has become almost certain that the  anticipated meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will be held  in Amman.    A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making  arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several  leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR  that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for  signing the document of understanding take place in the  Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn  and the Jordanian people.    The source added that since the security situation precludes  the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to  see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and  his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King  Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the  balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the  outset.    The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will  be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be  Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab  League representatives after coordination is effected between  the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government.    It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making  arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan  Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah  al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah  'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the  reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held  within the past four days.    Given the current security situation, heightened tension,  and  several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that  it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in  Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take  place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid is opposed to signing the reconciliation document in  Sanaa.    Several Yemeni officials said that the security situation  and  mutual mistrust will prompt any official who will have to attend  this meeting to bring with him a large number of guards and  escorts to protect him, a number that could exceed  5,000--something which would make it impossible to get the  situation under control, and which might consequently cause a  security disaster. [passage omitted]    It is to be recalled that the Yemeni vice president has  welcomed the holding of this meeting in Amman. A senior  official of the Yemeni Socialist Party has said: In case it is  found to be impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting on  Yemeni territory, our first preference is to see it held in  Amman. (passage omitted]    AL-DUSTUR also learned that France expressed a willingness  to  host the reconciliation meeting on its territory. However,  Yemeni officials said that they prefer to see it held on Arab  territory if it is found to be impossible to hold it on Yemeni  territory. They added that they prefer to see it held in Amman  if an agreement is reached on holding it in an Arab capital.</p>

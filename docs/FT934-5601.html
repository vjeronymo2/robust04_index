			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (1): Better guidance is needed - The quest for quality software / Quality in the software business should be defined as customer satisfaction, suggests Alan Cane. Software disasters and customer dissatisfaction with the products of the industry are unacceptable the failure of the London Ambulance Service despatch system; the abandonment of Taurus in the City of London; questions over fly-by-wire systems, for example - are only the tip of an iceberg of dissatisfaction with software quality and reliability. This will surprise nobody; the evidence is abundant and compelling. Researchers studying computer-based banking systems believe that up to 40 per cent of the total investment is wasted; that more than 50 per cent of advanced projects fail. Geographical information systems (GIS), featured in the first section of this issue of Software at Work, use computer power to collate geographical and social data. They are potentially among the most useful of computer applications, yet users are hindered by inadequate quality of design. One study says: 'Current GIS software is often poor at providing useful, comprehensible error messages,' going on to point out that 'infrequent' and 'novice' users need better support and guidance through consistent control procedures. For 'infrequent users,' read everyone. As computer systems become ubiquitous, it will become increasingly necessary to be au fait with a variety of systems. No matter how expert the user is in the use of one computer system, there will always be another which will demand concentration and effort to operate properly. It would be comforting to think that ease of use for the infrequent user would develop in step with the broader distribution of computing power made possible by inexpensive personal computers and workstations. The experience of GIS users to date does not offer a lot of hope, however. They complain of lack of clarity in systems messages. For example: 'Press any key - but not one of those.' Manuals are voluminous but rarely useful: 'There are so many of them, they must be comprehensive. But the hardest thing is finding the right manual'. These problems with GIS are endemic to the industry. It is seeking ways of ensuring quality in products which are intrinsically difficult to test for flaws. The Institution of Electrical Engineers, in discussing safety-related systems, warns against claiming infallibility for any computer system: 'All systems have a probability of failing to a dangerous state, even though the probability may be extremely small'. At the same time, software disasters and customer dissatisfaction with the products of the industry are unacceptable. The principal approach has been to attempt to introduce formal quality assurance for software development coupled with ways of developing software that are more akin to engineering than to craft work. Mr Andrew J. Preston of T/Maker Company, quoted in a Price Waterhouse study of software industry practices, says: 'Quality assurance is the best investment any company can make.' THE study shows that among US software houses, some 80 per cent with 100 or more employees have a formal quality assurance program, confirming, it says that 'survey respondents do indeed place a high priority on customer satisfaction.' This is a key point and essential to the argument that follows. Quality in the software business should be defined as customer satisfaction. The companies replying to the Price Waterhouse survey were less enthusiastic about outside quality certification. Only 37 of the 929 companies questioned said they had been certified to standards such as ISO 9000 - equivalent to BS 5750 in the UK. These are general standards which measure a company's quality procedures - the consistency of its systems for dealing with customer orders, purchasing, stock control, manufacturing and delivery. Nevertheless, certification is becoming essential to do business with certain classes of customer, especially government departments. In the UK, there is a special form of certification for IT companies called TickIT. BS 5750 has its critics who complain that it is expensive to acquire and offers little real guarantee of quality products. Mr Robert Malcolm, formerly with GEC, CAP Group and now an independent consultant, takes the case further and argues that far from being good for a company certificated quality management systems may do it harm. His argument is that existing systems do not, in general, deliver quality where quality is defined as customer satisfaction. They do not, he says, address fitness for purpose and are often restricted to manufacturing methods. Customer satisfaction, on the other hand, is dependent on design, especially where bespoke rather than packaged software is concerned. Mr Malcolm argues that conventional product certification cannot work in these instances. He suggests, perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek, that certification of quality management systems should be discouraged and that suppliers should be encouraged to show evidence that they provide customer satisfaction. Customers for their part should be encouraged to demand that evidence from prospective suppliers and demand satisfaction from selected suppliers. While it would be retrogressive to discourage companies from considering certification, there is much in Mr Malcolm's argument. The key, as always, is the 'intelligent customer.' As Mr Joseph Alsop of the US company Progress Software Corporation told the Price Waterhouse survey: 'You hear a lot of talk about service, but customers will still buy products from companies with a lousy service record if they feel its product is the latest and the greatest'.</p>

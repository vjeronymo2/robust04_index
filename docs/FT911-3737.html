			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tory group reprimands secretary THE Bruges group, the Tory-dominated organisation opposed to a Federal Europe, last night reprimanded Mr Patrick Robertson, its secretary, for issuing a statement earlier this month attacking the leadership style of Mr John Major. The group stopped short, however, of accepting his offer to resign - leading to claims from some Conservatives that the group remained discredited. Mr Major was accused in the statement of 'wobbling' and of engaging in gesture politics over the Kurdish issue. At a special meeting, the group approved a tightening of rules for issuing statements on behalf of the group. Mr Robertson and Dr Alan Sked, who helped draft the comments, offered 'an unqualified expression of regret'.</p>

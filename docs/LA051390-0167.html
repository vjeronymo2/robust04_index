			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO EASY ANSWERS TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  </P> <P> It is refreshing to read a discussion of technology versus ecological  consciousness/correctness that acknowledges the give-and-take nature of  humanity's relationship with the Earth ("Cyberpunk and the Future of  Technology," April 19).  </P> <P> I'm tired of the knee-jerk extremists in both technology and ecology who refuse  to find a level on which to relate and successfully carry out their plans.  </P> <P> I hope indeed that all of the hype surrounding Earth Day does not simply  vaporize. It would be symptomatic of what Michael Schrage calls the "disgusting  attitude" so prevalent in the United States regarding environmental issues.  </P> <P> JEANNE G.

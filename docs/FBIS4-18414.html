			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "The Researchers in the Ruhr </F> Are Also Concerned About Air Pollution in China--The  Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 28 Feb--The government is short on  funds; the German research market has gotten tighter. Even the  Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) in  Essen, the smallest of the empirical economic research  institutes in the old laender, can feel the pinch.    "At the moment there are many good researchers to be had on  the market, so you really feel bad about not having the money,"  says Paul Klemmer, the RWI's president. There is no denying it:  the situation is getting tighter. The basic subsidy granted to  the institutes by the Federal Government and the host land  increases only nominally. In fact, the RWI got less this year  than the year before.    This is why Klemmer is looking for solutions  internationally--in keeping with the recommendation of the  Scientific Advisory Council composed of representatives of the  Federal Government, the laender, and science which sets the  guidelines for the German research community. One of the plans  being drawn up is a cooperative venture with China, financed by  the Federal Government. The RWI is to provide the Chinese with  know-how on preventing carbon dioxide emissions. In exchange,  Klemmer hopes to obtain data about the PRC "which is not  normally available."    In Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia an RWI  team is looking into the chances for the middle class. In the  case of on-site studies, the RWI researchers work jointly with  local institutes. But before they do they must "separate the  wheat from the chaff," Klemmer says in describing the  difficulties in determining who is who in research in Central  Europe. Klemmer's researchers cannot rely on already available  data. "You might as well burn" the statistical material, he says.    The Advisory Council would like to see the institutes  increase the amount outside clients spend on research. This  includes all the money earned from studies commissioned by  public sector agencies and business firms. The total RWI budget  for 1992 was 9.04 million German marks (DM). Outside commissions  accounted for DM2.4 million or 26 percent and in 1993 the  third-party share rose to 28 percent.    Like the other institutes on the so-called blue list, the  RWI  receives a basic subsidy. That subsidy which increased from  DM6.07 million in 1992 to DM7.29 million in 1993 was cut 3.3  percent this year to DM7.06 million. Income from membership fees  (the RWI is a nonprofit organization), publications, and rentals  accounts for about 6 percent of the total.    Third-party research projects raise problems for Klemmer in  personnel planning. Currently, the RWI has a staff of 72, of  which 40 are professionals. The better the researchers, the  longer the contracts Klemmer must offer them. If he operates on  a tight budget, personnel costs which account for about 70  percent of the total budget force him to "chase after every  contract" even if it does not fit into his research portfolio.  Klemmer does gain some flexibility by farming out occasional  research projects to university professors.    The economics ministry in Bonn is the RWI's principal  client.  In 1993, it paid the RWI DM440,000 for its work on the joint  economic forecast alone. The ministry's total RWI research  contracts amount to almost DM1.8 million.    One particular RWI niche is regional economic analysis.  Klemmer believes that this is the direction in which the  industrial base debate will go. These days the question no  longer is whether an investor can be lured to Great Britain or  Germany. Competition now is more among regions or large cities  such as Frankfurt or Milan. Researchers have looked into  regional opportunities for Baden-Wurttemberg, the city of  Muenster and the Bernau area. Klemmer considers it "exciting"  that hard factors such as geographic location account for only  30 to 40 percent of the attractiveness of a given region. As for  the rest, it is the region's image that counts--which is hard to  alter.    As far as regional research is concerned, the RWI team can  draw on the institute's past experience. Although the RWI  celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 1993 it was really  founded in 1926 by Ernst Wagemann, the president of the  then-Berlin Institute for Economic Research (today's German  Institute for Economic Research) and was then known as that  institute's "Western Department."  <H5>  Most Departments Work on Environmental Economics </H5>   Situated in the center of the Ruhr region, the institute's  principal emphasis was on coal, iron, and steel. When it became  an independent institute in 1943 the RWI began to concern itself  with extraregional issues as well. Since 1978 the Essen  institute has been issuing reports on economic structure in  rotation with the other research institutes.    In 1988/89 the RWI gained negative publicity when the board  of directors was accused of tax fraud. At that time, Horst  Siebert was set to take the place of RWI President Hans Karl  Schneider but eventually decided in favor of the Institute for  World Economics in Kiel. In early 1989 Paul Klemmer took over as  head of the RWI. Klemmer, 58, an expert in regional economics,  brought his specialty to the RWI from his professorship for  economic policy at Bochum's Ruhr University, a chair he still  holds today. A native of Freiburg, Klemmer characterizes his  political outlook as "pragmatic liberalism."    Like Siebert, he is interested in environmental economics  which has a bearing on the activities of all eight RWI  departments. Klemmer would like to see the other institutes to  "stand up and be counted" on the ecology issue. As for the RWI  itself, he calls it "not really tax friendly," taking a rather  dim view of ecology-oriented tax reform.    One traditional focus of RWI's interest are the crafts. The  institute has put out an annual report on that sector of the  economy since 1954. In addition, it regularly publishes the RWI  Economic Reports and Economic News.</p>

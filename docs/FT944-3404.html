			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technical trading takes Dow higher Wall Street US shares got an afternoon bounce from technical trading yesterday as investors positioned themselves ahead of the release of important economic statistics today and tomorrow, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.26 at 3,718.37. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.50 at 449.47, the American Stock Exchange composite gained 0.14 at 420.80 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.07 at 719.12. Trading volume on the NYSE was 287m shares. Trading was light as investors waited for data on producer prices, consumer prices and capacity utilisation due out today and tomorrow. Economists expected all the figures to show a robust economy, which may send a shock through the market as it could prompt the Federal Reserve to move sooner, rather than later, to increase interest rates. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year, and its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, told a Congressional panel last week that he would continue a tight monetary policy in order to hold the line against inflation. In the mid-morning, IBM announced that it would halt shipment of all personal computers based on the Pentium chip. This hit Intel, which makes the Pentium microprocessor, and other large technology companies on the Nasdaq, causing the index to lose almost 1 per cent of its value before rebounding to close nearly flat. Intel fell sharply and then regained some ground to close down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 60 3/8 on the news. Also falling were Dell Computer and Gateway 2000 - both computer makers that have shipped a high percentage of Pentium-based PCs. Dell dropped Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 38 5/8 and Gateway slipped Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 22. Shares in IBM fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 70 5/8 after the announcement and following news that the US Supreme Court would not hear the computer maker's appeal against a lower court ruling in an anti-trust case. Woolworth gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8 after announcing that it had recruited Mr Roger Farah as its chairman and chief executive. Mr Farah had previously been head of Federated Department Stores and RH Macy. Transco Energy gained Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 16 1/4 on news that it would be purchased by the energy company, Williams. Canada Toronto held its ground, despite a weak Canadian dollar and heavy losses in the Canadian bond market. The TSE 300 composite index added 10.76 points to close at 4045.09 with losers over winners 393 to 352. The trading value of CDollars 442.1m was down from Friday's CDollars 522.7m. Brazil Sao Paulo closed 1.7 per cent higher in light trading after news that that the Fipe inflation index had dropped to 2.6 per cent in the four week period to December 8. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares closed 819 higher at 48,132 in thin turnover of RDollars 233m (Dollars 276.4m) as brokers noted that falling inflation could trigger a new round of nominal interest rate cuts by the central bank.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 WILDFIRES BURNING OUT OF CONTROL;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY BLAZE FORCES CLOSURE OF OBSERVATORY  </P> <P> An 11,000-acre wildfire continued to rage out of control in San Diego County  Friday night and firefighters in Los Angeles County responded to a new blaze  that had threatened homes in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The fire near Mt. Palomar in San Diego County was reported 60% contained, but  U.S. Forest Service officials said temperatures in the 90s, low humidity, heavy  brush and the steep terrain of the Cleveland National Forest were hampering the  efforts of nearly 2,000 Forest Service, state Division of Forestry and military  firefighters to control the blaze.  </P> <P> Few fire roads penetrate the mountainous area where the fire has burned for a  week, and fire crews had to be airlifted by helicopter or march in on foot to  reach some of the hot spots.  </P> <P> About 400 of the firefighters were deployed around homes and the observatory  atop Mt. Palomar, where astronomers closed the big dome last Saturday to  protect the 200-inch mirror of one of the world's largest telescopes from  drifting ash. On Thursday, the rest of the complex was closed.  </P> <P> Forest Service Capt. Jim Van Meter said the deployment at Mt. Palomar was  largely precautionary. The flames were at one point about two miles away but  turned in another direction late Friday.  </P> <P> "We don't want to panic people, because there's no reason to panic," Van Meter  said.  </P> <P> Several hundred visitors were evacuated from camps on the flanks of the  mountain, but officials said none of the camp structures appeared to be in  immediate danger.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, a fast-moving blaze burned at least 500 acres and for  several hours threatened about 400 homes in the community of Green Valley,  about 50 miles north of Los Angeles in the Angeles National Forest. At one  point, flames burned to within 100 yards of some of the homes before being  beaten back.  </P> <P> About 350 county firefighters and 100 Forest Service personnel were moved in to  battle the fire, which broke out at about 11:15 a.m. near San Francisquito  Canyon Road, about a mile south of town.  </P> <P> Ken Soto, a county fire investigator, said the fire was about 50% contained by  nightfall and appeared to be burning away from the community.  </P></p>

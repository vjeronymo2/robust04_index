			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that Britain  supplies military equipment to south Cyprus. It has been  established that two British C-130 transport aircraft carried a  cargo of military supplies to south Cyprus in April. It is  feared that a certain quantity of "arms and ammunition" were  among the military supplies.    One of the planes was obstructed by the Turkish military  aircraft after it delivered its cargo. It was forced by Turkish  F-4 fighters to leave Turkey's airspace while returning to  Britain. Officials have said that Britain has not lodged a  protest because it does not wish the incident to be disclosed.  According to the intelligence units, two British C-130's landed  at the military air base in south Cyprus in April. Intelligence  units said that Britain may have instructed them to fly to south  Cyprus under the pretense of transporting military supplies to  the British bases.    One of the aircraft, which has flown to south Cyprus on  various days, was intercepted by the Turkish military aircraft  in Turkey's airspace while it was returning to Britain. Several  F-4 aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force Command in Eskisehir  identified the transport plane close to Dalaman. They then  forced it to exit Turkish airspace. The British plane left  Turkey's airspace and landed in Greece. It has been ascertained  that it has since flown back to Britain.</p>

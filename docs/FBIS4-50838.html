			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report on the political resolution adopted </F> by the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional  Commmittee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference on 21 May 1994; from the "Regional News Hookup"  program]    [Text] The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous  Regional Commmittee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Committee was held in Lhasa from  13 through 21 May. It approved the government work report  delivered by regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu; the report on  the implementation of the 1993 plan and on the 1994 draft plan  for economic and social development; the report on the  implementation of the 1993 budget plan and the 1994 draft budget  plan; and the work reports by the higher people's court and the  higher people's procuratorate.    The session held that in the past year, the people of all  nationalities in Tibet, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, earnestly implemented the 14th CPC National  Congress guidelines, and deepened reform and opening up wider in  close conjunction with the objective of establishing a socialist  market economic structure and of modernizing the region, thereby  quicking the pace of construction, promoting the development of  productive forces, and scoring fresh achievements in all fields  of endeavor.    The session held that the government work report has  factually summarized the work over the past year, objectively  analyzed the existing problems and difficulties, and explicitly  put forth the basic principles and fighting goals of the work in  1994. These principles and goals are inspiring the people in  their advancement and can be accomplished through assiduous  efforts by the people of all nationalities throughout Tibet.  Regional CPPCC committee members have expressed concern over,  and made suggestions and opinions on outstanding contradictions  and problems, such as high price rises, poor performance of  state-owned enterprises, low income of peasants and herdsmen,  disorderly cultural markets, inadequate medical and health  services in farming and pastoral areas, corruption of all kinds,  and crimes in some localities. They hope the regional  government will persist in the principle of fostering both  material progress and cultural and ideological progress and  attaching equal importance to both and adopt effective measures  to solve these problems.    The session held that 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to  carry out reform in an all-round way, to launch package reform  programs, to achieve breakthroughs in key areas, and to  accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy. We  must steadfastly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  guidelines as our guide; and must comprehensively carry out the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as  the guidelines of the fourth and fifth enlarged plenary sessions  of the fourth regional party committee. We must expedite the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure and do  everything we can to change Tibet's backward transportation,  energy supply, and infrastructure. We must turn our advantage  in resources into an economic edge for achieving a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the regional economy. We must  step up the building of democracy and the legal system, as well  as the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We must  improve party work style, promote a clean and honest government,  launch an in-depth struggle against splittism, safeguard the  motherland's unification, strengthen national unity, safeguard  political stabiltiy, and promote the progress of society in all  fields. The work in all fields must serve and be subordinate to  the overall interests of grasping the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability; and must be conducive to the proper handling of the  relationship between reform, development, and stability.    The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and  their members across Tibet to hold high the banner of patriotism  and socialism, to diligently study Volume 3 of the "Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping," to earnestly carry out the guidelines  of the current session, to bring into play their talent to serve  the central task of economic construction, to conduct effective  political consultation and democratic supervision, to take an  active part in the administration and discussion of state  affairs, to unite all forces that can be united and mobilize all  positive factors, to pool the efforts of all, and to make their  share of contributions to the maintenance of Tibet's political  and social stability.    The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and  their members across Tibet, to be led by the regional party  committee, to rally still closer around the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; to emancipate  their minds; to heighten their spirits; and to work hard and  advance in a pioneering spirit in striving for new victories in  Tibet's reform and opening up as well as the building of two  civilizations.</p>

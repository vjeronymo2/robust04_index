In a statement the embassy said the allegations are mere  lies  fabricated by counterrevolutionary terrorist groups.    The embassy also said that futility of the allegations will  become further clear to all when it is asked how it could be  possible that the sender of such a letter writes down his  address on the back of the envelope?    The statement stressed that it was time for the French  public  opinion to deliberate on the presence of terrorist groups who  have repeatedly committed terrorist acts in France and abroad.    AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE (AFP) in a report from Stockholm Monday  quoted the city police sources that a 45-year-old Swedish of  Iranian origin was injured the same day due to the explosion of  a letter sent to his wife.    According to the AFP report police sources declined to  identify the injured, introduced as an opponent of the Islamic  Republic of Iran. It also added that they did not have any idea  about the point of departure and exact type of the explosive.  However the same sources claimed the letter it was sent from  the Iranian Embassy in Paris.</p>

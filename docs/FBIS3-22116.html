The centre, to work as part of the operation staff of the  nuclear accident prevention government committee, is to  coordinate the national radiation monitoring, signalling and  control systems of the two organizations.    The network is to provide continuous information from 60  points throughout the country on the radioactive radiation  level. The measuring stations are to measure the gamma doses in  the air, which is termed harmful to health if measuring 500  nanosievert per hour. (measurements between 1000 and 5000 nsv  were registered in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear  accident.)    With the decline in the danger of nuclear explosions and  nuclear attacks, the accident information centre will mainly  focus on nuclear power plant accidents, the delivery of nuclear  materials, and possible meteorite impacts.    The majority of the measuring stations will be operated near  barracks, as they are affiliated to the army, however, the  Central Physics Research Institute of Budapest and the Paks  Nuclear Power Plant (southern Hungary) will also carry out  measurements. Data will be continuously evaluated and stored in  the centre, and if higher than average figures are reported,  immediate measures can be taken by involving the civil defence  and army units.</p>

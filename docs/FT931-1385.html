			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / EC telecoms groups in talks on liberalisation SENIOR executives of EC telecommunications operators meet in Brussels today to discuss European Commission plans to open domestic and international telephone calls to full competition by 1998. Brussels' telecoms directorate has produced a draft plan which would involve opening cross-border calls within the EC to competition by January 1, 1996. The same plan would set a target of January 1, 1998 for the controversial liberalisation of all calls - including those within individual countries and to countries outside the EC. Today's meeting with Commission officials will be followed by a similar round of talks tomorrow involving national telecoms regulators. The meetings mark the end of six months of consultations with member states, consumers, regulators and operators. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC telecoms commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition, will then have to decide whether to submit far-reaching proposals to their fellow commissioners and ultimately to EC telecoms ministers, who next meet on May 10. Both commissioners favour more liberalisation, to improve efficiency and competition, but they will probably want to safeguard operators' commitment to provide a uniform service for all consumers. The main battle among commissioners, and then among member states, is likely to be over the timing of such a plan. As drafted, it would go too slowly for some telecoms operators, such as British Telecom, and too fast for others, including the German state company Deutsche Telekom. Some member states with less well-developed networks, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, would probably be allowed to delay implementation of the proposals. But senior Commission officials say even the most reluctant telecoms operators - such as France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom - now accept that a final target of full competition should be set, partly because it would be practically very difficult to stop short at partial liberalisation. Under the draft plans, the first phase of any new approach would be to ensure the enforcement of existing directives liberalising certain services. Only later would member states have to consider the most controversial questions, such as whether to open the building of telephone networks to new companies.</p>

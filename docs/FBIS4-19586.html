			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Osman Ulagay from the "I Do Not Know" column: </F> "This Program Would Have Been Promising in 1992"]    [Text] The economic package that we had been nervously  awaiting for days has finally been announced. While watching  the ceremony described by Mrs. Ciller as "historic" I must admit  I was upset on a few counts.    First, I was upset because the ceremony, to which such great  importance was attached, was very badly organized. It was  difficult to discern any press members among the numerous True  Path Party [TPP] ministers, bureaucrats, and sympathizers who  kept on applauding Ciller and Karayalcin like soccer fans.  While nothing was said about the heavy applause, journalists  were not allowed to ask questions verbally. After the  conference, the journalists had to squeeze themselves through  the crowd to be able to get the text of the package.    The second reason I was upset was because the package failed  to give me and many other people any hope, even though it was  prepared by Ciller and her team with intense efforts and  probably with goodwill. With her purple scarf and an attitude  aimed at depicting determination, Mrs. Ciller repeatedly asked  everyone to "look forward, not back," but it is not easy to  forget the recent past so quickly.    The prime minister would have been more convincing had she  voiced serious self-criticism and had she made a more  comprehensive and realistic assessment of the situation. She  did not do that, and therefore failed to create the impression  that she will not repeat her past mistakes.    If you translate the headings of the measures into English,  you can say that the program looks like one that might draw the  attention of say, the IMF. Most of the following measures  constitute the basic elements of stability programs:     -  Real  reductions in budget expenditures, real increases in revenues,  and a very significant reduction of the budget deficit.    -  The  suspension of personnel hiring in the public sector, and the  prevention of real salary increases.    -  A legal reorganization that  will prevent the Central Bank from financing the public  deficit.    -  Adopting an approach that places the burden on the  various sectors of the community and demanding  sacrifices.    -  Announcing that the necessary steps will be taken to  close down the public economic enterprises that are incurring  losses.    Yes, all these are very important for stabilizing an  economy,  but unfortunately they were announced with a delay of at least  two and one-half years.    Had Mr. Demirel given instructions for a similar program to  be drawn up two years ago and let his then state minister  responsible for economic affairs, Mrs. Ciller, announce it to  the public, it would have been much more convincing. The  TPP-Social Democratic Populist Party coalition was not weakened  in the spring of 1992, and if it had announced such a program  then, the package would have been much more convincing and  promising both at home and abroad.    Today, this is not possible any more. Mrs. Ciller and the  coalition she is trying to keep alive are not viewed with much  confidence by anyone. Their performance of the past two and  half years is casting a shadow on any hope for the future.    Under these conditions, it is unfortunately very difficult  for the program to be promising because: -- its targets in  connection with the budget savings seem too ambitious, -- bills  regarding the public economic enterprises and the taxes will  have to be passed by the Assembly, -- and close to 100 sentences  in the written text of the implementation plan are in future  tense.    I hope that I am wrong, that the program will be  successfully  implemented even under the present conditions, that it will  achieve its targets in the first three months, and that the  Turkish economy will begin a stabilization process. I hope that  I can be happy, and not upset, about the package.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil levels and, if necessary, immediate replacement of the clutch assembly. Owner/operator checks are proposed after engine start and rotor engagement to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly and, after each engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still turning down, to check for abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the upper pulley that houses the clutch assembly. These proposed owner/operator checks do not require the use of tools, precision measuring equipment, training, pilot logbook endorsements, or the use of technical data not contained in the AD. Additionally, these owner/operator checks are considered part of the normal pilot ``Before Takeoff'' and ``After Landing'' checks and were allowed by the existing AD. These owner/operator checks are additional measures to ensure, between 25 hours TIS inspections, that sufficient lubricants are maintained in the clutch assembly and not lost through a leaking seal. These checks may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the clutch assembly at certain TIS intervals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 162 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $2,800 to overhaul or $10,500 for a zero-time clutch assembly per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be from $471,420, if only overhauled clutch assemblies are installed, to $1,718,820, if only zero-time clutch assemblies are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

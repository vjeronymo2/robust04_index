			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: Macleods of that ilk Who was really responsible for the mess at Western Isles council which invested Pounds 23m in BCCI and lost it? The obvious culprit, as two external inquiries agreed, was Donald Macleod, the council's director of finance, who did not act on warnings about BCCI and was lax in the management of his department. He accepted responsibility, was dismissed by the special disciplinary committee in December and had his appeal against dismissal rejected by the council's appeals committee a few weeks ago. But what about his superior, George Macleod, the chief executive? When the loss was revealed he said it was the first he knew of the council's investment in BCCI and hadn't realised the council had had such large reserves. Then, the day before the crucial council meeting to discuss the disaster, he announced that he was resuming his interrupted holiday. He was eventually coaxed back to work. The council's disciplinary committee dismissed George Macleod in December for not overseeing the finance department properly, for not checking that the finance director had stopped borrowing and on-lending after being reprimanded for this in 1988 and for his handling of the BCCI crisis. But last Friday the appeals committee decided by a majority of seven to five to let him off with a final warning.</p>

(``Dresser'') and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18). The Complaint alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in the manufacture and sale in the United States of drilling fluids, which Dresser, through its 64 percent partnership interest in M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids, Co. (``M&hyph;I''), and Baroid, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc. (``Baroid Drilling''), produce and sell. The Complaint also alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in the manufacture and sale in the United States of diamond drill bits, which both Dresser's Security Division (``Security'') and Baroid's wholly owned subsidiary DB Stratabit (USA) Inc. (``DBS'') manufacture and sell. Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are used by energy exploration and development companies to drill oil and gas wells. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, a permanent injunction preventing defendants from, in any manner, combining their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 23, 1993, the United States and defendants filed a stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the merger. Under the proposed Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, defendants would be required to sell, by June 1, 1994, either Baroid Drilling or Dresser's interest in M&hyph;I. By July 1, 1994, defendants would also have to divest Baroid's domestic diamond drill bit business, including a manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, as well as licenses for DBS patents and technology to make and sell DBS diamond drill bits domestically and to a significant extent throughout the world. If defendants should fail to complete either or both of the divestitures, a trustee appointed by the Court would be empowered to complete them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

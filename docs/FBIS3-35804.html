			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, arrived in beseiged Leningrad [as  heard] last night at the invitation of the Democratic Party of  the Serb Lands and the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society. Our  Belgrade correspondent, Vladimir Solovyev, reports:    [Solovyev] No aircraft fly into Yugoslavia because of the  sanctions, and the usual way here is by car from Budapest  Airport. Several thousand people gathered on the square in the  Serbian town of Subotica, the first town after the border, to  hear Zhirinovskiy. At his first news conference in the  restaurant of Belgrade's Hotel Jugoslavija, the democrats'  leader was given an ovation. In his usual declarative fashion  he said precisely what the people here have long wanted to hear.  In Zhirinovskiy's view, there is only one way to stop the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina: by withdrawing the entire foreign  military contingent from there and giving the Bosnian Serbs the  opportunity to finish the war victorious -- and even ultimately  by sending the Russian army in to help them. Vladimir Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy] said that NATO air strikes against Serb positions  would automatically be a declaration of war against Russia, and  anyone taking part in that sort of action would soon lose the  taste for it.    Zhirinovskiy will meet with the presidents of two Serb  provinces today -- Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic; he will  address rallies in Bijeljina and Vukovar and on Wednesday will  probably address a big rally in the center of Belgrade. After  that he will leave for Montenegro and the Serbian Autonomous  Province of Kosovo.</p>

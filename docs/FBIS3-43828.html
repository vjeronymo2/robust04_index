In a statement issued yesterday, Viljoen said the next two  weeks would provide clarity, but there were "strong indications  that the Afrikaner will shortly stand before his toughest choice  of the century". He rejected recent suggestions that his  position in the AVF had been weakened and that he might quit the  organisation. A right-wing source said recent comments by  Viljoen were simply an indication that he believed his political  role might be ending: "I imagine he was hinting at a military  role he might have to play," said the source.    He said there was "concern, discontent and frustration"  among  grassroots supporters at the lack of progress in negotiations  with the Government and the ANC [African National Congress].  They were saying to the AVF leadership: "I told you so...there  is no alternative to war." However, Viljoen said in his  statement that his role was not changing because of  dissatisfaction over his performance but because the ANC and  Government were limiting the options open to Afrikaners. The  fact that the nature of the struggle could change soon was not  his fault, but that of the Government and ANC who thought they  were dealing with people who "bark but don't bite". He also  claimed that the Government had shocked him by negotiating in a  "spineless" manner with the ANC and had been dishonest in its  dealings with the AVF.</p>

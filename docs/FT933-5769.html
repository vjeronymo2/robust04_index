			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (3): At the edge of prosperity - Foreign investment SUB-SAHARAN Africa has missed out on the surge in global foreign direct investment (FDI) during the 1980s. Investment inflows into Africa, relative to GDP, are half the level of those elsewhere. After averaging Dollars 1bn annually during the first half of the 1980s - of which three quarters went to oil exporting countries - FDI accelerated during the 1987-91 period averaging Dollars 1.7bn. Almost half (Dollars 830m) went to Nigeria, and another Dollars 190m to other oil exporters. The region's stock of foreign investment was estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at some Dollars 11bn, with South Africa accounting for a further Dollars 11bn. Zimbabwe and Nigeria each account for 19 per cent, with Gabon in third place (13 per cent), followed by Liberia with 12.5 per cent and Cote d'Ivoire with just under 10 per cent. Between them, these five countries accounted for three quarters of the region's foreign-owned capital stock. Not only is the region's foreign-owned capital stock small and highly concentrated, but it has also been falling. Excluding South Africa, the inward stock of foreign capital fell 45 per cent in the 1980s, mainly reflecting currency devaluation. In 1980, the sub-Saharan share of global inward investment was 4.5 per cent, but 10 years later it was 0.7 per cent. Inward investment declined from 7.5 per cent of the third world total during the 1981-86 period to 5.5 per cent, two thirds of which was oil sector investment. One reason is Africa's failure to broaden its investment base. While FDI flows to other continents have diversified into manufacturing and services away from resource-intensive activity, Africa's chief attraction remains its energy and mining potential. Sluggish economic growth, poor returns, a shortage of skills and small markets continue to deter investment. The key to attracting foreign inflows is the availability of relatively cheap skilled, technical and supervisory labour, crucial to meeting quality standards that are increasingly important in global marketing. Africa is also at a serious disadvantage in terms of both location and infrastructure. But the greatest deterrent to FDI inflows has been government hostility towards multinationals. That is changing, but the results - outside the energy sector - have been disappointing. Hardly surprising, for in the late 1980s, the return on capital was lower than anywhere else in the third world, except Latin America. But Africa's politicians now realise multinationals may not bring in substantial foreign capital but will provide the technology, expertise and market access Africa needs.  ---------------------------------- Efficiency of Investment 1988-92  ---------------------------------- All developing countries     18.2% Asia                         22.0% Middle East and Europe       20.0% Africa                       11.5% Latin America                 7.7%  ----------------------------------</p>

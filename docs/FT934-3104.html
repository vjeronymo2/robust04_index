			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Defeated MPs lick their wounds Opponents of Sunday shopping were nursing their bruises yesterday and dreaming of reversing in the Lords Wednesday's defeat or during the line-by-line committee stage. 'To tell the truth, we are all feeling a bit gutted this morning,' said one of the key organisers of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign. Mr Ray Powell, the Labour whip who ran the Commons end of the campaign, met retail and church supporters yesterday to discuss resistance to the successful six-hours option. Keep Sunday Special is unlikely to make a final decision about tactics until after a meeting next week, but it appears to have two options, neither of them promising. The first would be a guerrilla campaign during the bill's committee and report stages. The aim would be to toughen protection for workers who are unwilling to work on Sundays, and possibly to reduce the permitted opening time for big shops from six hours to four. But amending the bill may be difficult because the government will not allow a free vote on employment issues. In addition the campaign's retail supporters now accept that they will have to open on Sundays to protect market share. They may be unwilling to support employment-protection measures which would increase their costs. The second option would be an attempt to reinstate the Keep Sunday Special option in the Lords. The Lords have the right to amend the bill, but are highly unlikely to do so as it was a government manifesto commitment, and both the principle and the six-hours option were approved by big majorities in the Commons.</p>

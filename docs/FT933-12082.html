			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Belgium, Portugal defend currencies in ERM THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism continued to come under heavy strain yesterday, with the central banks of Belgium and Portugal raising short-term interest rates to defend their currencies and the French franc remaining close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European monetary system. Neither the Bank of France nor the Bundesbank intervened in currency markets yesterday to support the French franc, in marked contrast to their operations at the end of last week in which they bought francs for D-Marks in huge quantities. However, no early end to the crisis over the franc was in sight, and two other currencies - the Danish krone and the Spanish peseta - also came under heavy selling pressure. Foreign exchange dealers said the immediate fate of the French currency  - and perhaps of Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system as a whole - would rest on the results of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. The German authorities will come under strong pressure to cut their official interest rates to allow other European countries to do the same. Currency analysts and dealers believed the Bundesbank would have to cut its discount rate by at least  1/2 a percentage point this week - to 6.25 per cent - to stem the crisis. The Belgian authorities were forced to raise their seven-day advances rate from 6.7 per cent to 8.5 per cent after the Belgian franc came under strong selling pressure in the morning. The central bank of Portugal also raised its liquidity mop-up rate from 10.25 per cent to 13.39 per cent after heavy selling of the escudo last week. Belgium's move helped to restore the franc to a close of BFr20.73 against the D-Mark after it had been at BFr20.78 earlier in the day. But some analysts suggested that the heavy selling of the currency implied that some dealers believed the ERM might collapse. The French franc closed in London at FFr3.414 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.416. It was little changed in New York yesterday and in early trading in Tokyo today.

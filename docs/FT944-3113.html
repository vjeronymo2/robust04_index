			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Australia aims to check surging growth The Australian government was aiming for 'more acceptable' annual growth levels of between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent and would review fiscal policy when it conducted its mid-year budgetary review in January, Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, said yesterday. His comments came within hours of the decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise the country's official cash rate by a further one percentage point to 7.5 per cent when markets opened yesterday, in an effort to check the nation's surging economy. This is the third rise in four months - the previous increases of 75 and 100 basis points were in August and October respectively. Recent figures have shown that Australia's non-farm sector grew by 7.3 per cent in the year to the September quarter, and Mr Willis said this momentum had continued. 'It's clear the economy is growing very strongly in the December quarter.' 'Clearly, in these cir-cumstances we need to give further consideration to fiscal policy. . . we will do that in the context of the mid-year review,' he said. Although Mr Willis stressed that no decisions have been taken, many observers believe the government is preparing the ground for tax increases in the new year. These could mean a fight in the Senate, parliament's upper house, where the government lacks a majority, and will be hard to sell to the electorate. In the meantime, many private sector economists suggested that yesterday's rate rise would not be the last move on the monetary front for a while. 'The overwhelming strength of the economy suggests to us that there is another 100 basis rate rise to occur in the next few months,' Bankers Trust said. The Australian dollar seemed to reflect this view, finishing in local markets at USDollars 0.7774, its highest closing level for three years. The powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions sent a shot across the government's bows when Mr Martin Ferguson, Actu president, called for less reliance on interest rate rises to slow the economy and more emphasis on taxing the 'top end of town'. He added that any additional tax burden on the lowest paid could 'seriously put at risk' the accord between the union movement and the government. Under this, the unions pledge to seek wage deals which keep Australia's inflation rate in line with that of its trading partners.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Little dollar movement Yesterday was a day of consolidation in foreign exchange markets following Friday's excitement when a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve caused a sharp rise in the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. Expectations of further dollar gains against the D-Mark were not realised and the US currency ended trading in London at levels similar to those reached in after-hours' activity on Friday evening. Against the yen it weakened slightly from late Friday levels. As one observer noted: 'With all of the market looking in one direction - expecting the dollar to rise - not much happened.' The market was uncertain about the pace and extent of future rate movements in the US. Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, has a reputation as a gradualist and thus most observers expect further small increases, with the Federal Funds rate ending the year at 3.75 per cent or 4 per cent. Explaining the dollar's fairly sedate performance after some profit-taking during Asian trading, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, commented: 'The trend has changed, but the gradient of change looks like it is still going to be very shallow. So it is positive for the dollar, but not positive enough to give the dollar much of a kick, so long as German rates remain unchanged.' The US currency ended in London at DM1.7630 - the level at which it was trading late on Friday evening, but higher than the close of DM1.736. It finished against the yen at Y108.7050 after trading in a narrow range all day. In New York last night it closed at DM1.7586 and Y108.60. The D-Mark was under pressure yesterday, finishing lower against most other European currencies. Attention today will be focused on the repo announcement from the Bundesbank. If the central bank allows a variable rate tender, following a period of fixed rate tenders at 6 per cent, this will be taken as a signal that it is happy to sanction a softening of interest rates. Given the chance, the market would certainly try to drive rates lower. But any fall in the repo rate will be small, as the repo rate, at 6 per cent, is only 25 basis points above the discount rate, which acts as a floor for official German rates. However, the symbolic message that rates were on their way down would be a powerful one. Although the weak state of the German economy favours a cut in rates, the Bundesbank might not want to ease policy against the background of a weak currency. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, comments: 'There is a belief now in the market that the Bundesbank has got itself into a bit of a hole. It had various opportunities to cut rates which it passed up, and now it is going to be more difficult.' Mr Austin said it was not clear that keeping rates high now would help the currency. The recent history of the ERM suggests high rates have been ineffective in supporting a currency perceived by the market as weak. Most analysts argue that the market is more interested in measures aimed at stimulating growth. Few, however, are confident that the Bundesbank shares this view. Indeed, Mr Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank chief economist, said in Washington yesterday that the Bundesbank might hold off lowering interest rates at least until regional elections in mid-March, and could even raise rates temporarily if the D-Mark were to weaken too much. 'I would not fully exclude the possibility that the Bundesbank will increase short-term rates,' said Mr Walter. Yesterday, Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, speaking in his capacity as the G10 central bank governors' chairman, said G10 central bankers were not troubled by developments on foreign exchange markets following the US Fed's tightening of policy on Friday. 'Until now there is not much concern about the situation (on forex markets),' Mr Tietmeyer told reporters after the monthly meeting of G10 central bank governors in Basle. The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.62 to the D-Mark, down three centimes over the day, after the Belgian central bank trimmed interest rates. The Belgian National Bank cut its key central rate by 15 basis points to 6.70 per cent. The central rate is now at its lowest since July 2, when it was set at 6.70 per cent: the central bank later had to raise interest rates because of the ERM currency crisis in late July. Belgium's central rate was last reduced a week ago. Observers said yesterday's move was further evidence of EMS currencies decoupling interest rate policy from the Bundesbank when conditions allowed. Sterling had a fairly quiet day, trading around the DM2.61 level against a generally weak German currency. It closed at Dollars 1.4811 against the dollar, having moved in a fairly narrow range all day. Consumer credit news showing net lending up to Pounds 433m, against a Pounds 290m forecast, lent support to the view that the UK economic recovery is proceeding apace and hence that no rate cut is imminent. The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 650m of assistance yesterday. This was in line with its revised forecast of the liquidity shortage, adjusted upwards from its early estimate of a Pounds 500m shortfall.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Sport: Very wet, very cold and very fast - Yachting Icebergs, dense fog, speeds suitable for waterskiing, and boat damage are now daily fare for the yachts competing in the Whitbread round the world race. This weekend the fleet will pass King Edward Island, 1,000 miles south-east of Cape Town and the half-way point of the second leg. Intrum Justitia, the pan-European entry in the lightweight W60 class, is the yacht setting the pace - literally. On Wednesday, it posted a new Omega 24-Hour Challenge record for the 1993/4 race with a run of 376.6 miles. At one point in the day, the satellite results system showed Intrum holding a steady 22 knots. But the depression blasting it along weakened and the average speed dropped to a tamer 17 knots. Spray reached as high as the first spreaders on the mast, reported skipper Lawrie Smith, and the on-watch crew faced walls of green water coming down the deck. Much of it found its way below. 'These boats are notoriously wet, more akin to a submarine on the point of a dive than the surfing sailboards they've been described as,' said Smith. 'Everything is dripping down below. Floors, walls, clothes. Only the bunks are dry and I'm not too optimistic about them. It's horrible - but you can put up with it if you're winning,' grinned Smith on a live video link via Inmarsat. Aged 37, and Britain's top professional sailor, he has transformed the fortunes of Intrum Justitia since replacing Roger Nilson as skipper after leg one. The boat led across the start line out of Punta del Este, in Uruguay, two weeks ago and has stayed in pole position (in the W60 class) since. Sceptics in rival yachts refused to believe that changing one man could alter the fortunes of a highly technical campaign. Alan Gray might beg to differ. Gray's yacht, Jamarella, made a middling start in the 1989 Admiral's Cup campaign so he brought in Smith and the boat finished top AC yacht for the season. 'He's simply an excellent sailor and makes a big difference when he joins,' said Gray. 'It's motivation and experience, not just ability. Lawrie has grit and a bit of magic, plus huge technical ability to optimise things like sails. You can't quantify attitude but, if we were talking about the media or show business, you'd know he has star quality.' Ross Field, skipper of the fourth-placed Yamaha, 74 miles behind Smith, does not seem to be enjoying himself quite so much. 'Conditions are bloody unpleasant. It's very cold and the snow and fog are making it even more difficult,' he said. 'We've spotted icebergs and this snow is ahead of a new front coming through.' Yamaha was lucky to escape undamaged after being knocked flat in the 'big blow' that powered Intrum to its record run. Field said the broach happened in around 35 knots of wind and the yacht was on its side for nearly 15 minutes. 'We had the spinnaker up and were sitting at a steady 25 knots' boat speed without surfing. We broached and it was bloody terrifying. The crew were all clipped on, so there were no injuries, but we were all a little shaken.' After the experience of Tokio in the early days of this leg, there will scarcely be a Whitbread crewmember who is not wearing his safety harness. Tokio, which won the W60 class in the first leg of the race and is second around 20 miles behind Intrum Justitia, lost bowman Ken Hara overboard when he fell from the tip of the spinnaker pole without a safety line. Skipper Chris Dickson said: 'When we spotted Ken in the water, we were doing 13 knots away from him with two spinnakers up and a lot of work to do before we could turn the boat around. Hara's first thoughts on seeing the boat going away from him were: 'This must be a dream, this can't be happening.' He removed his boots and held them upside down for additional buoyancy. He was wearing only seaboots and thermal underwear at the time. 'This incident was not due to extreme conditions but through carelessness. All the crew is aware that, in different conditions and darkness, things might not have gone so smoothly,' added Dickson, who reprimanded Hara. The bowman is a hero in Japan, where he is the country's first big-time professional sailor in a nation that is gripped increasingly by yacht racing. The jury is still out on the question of whether the bigger 80ft maxi-ketches can hold off the challenge of the W60s on this 7,500-mile leg to Western Australia. The smaller yachts need consistent winds of more than 30 knots to break through but, so far, they have had only random 12-hour spells of heavy air. Nevertheless, Intrum Justitia has passed Merit Cup, the second-placed maxi, and has only New Zealand Endeavour 50 miles or so ahead. Pierre Fehlmann, skipper of Merit Cup, is candid in his anxieties about his yacht's inability to match the Kiwis despite having near-identical boats from the same designer. 'I am really wondering, do they have a hull that is somewhat better in surfing conditions? Do they simply have better helmsmen? Or do they push the boat one step further towards the risk limit than we do?' pondered a downcast Fehlmann.</p>

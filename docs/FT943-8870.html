			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Edinburgh This is Brian McMaster's third year in change of the annual three-week Edinburgh Festival, which opened yesterday. Several of the artists appearing in this first week are returning after their successes in one or both of his two previous festivals: Charles Mackerras (again conducting a Mozart opera in concert while preparing it for a recording), the mezzo Olga Borodina (in recital), the soprano Galina Gorchakova, the theatre directors Robert Lepage and Peter Stein. The fine Miami Ballet performs an all-Balanchine programme at the cavernous Playhouse Theatre, until August 20. Then on August 20 and 21, Mark Morris presents his masterpiece, 'L'Allegro' at the re-furbished and excellent Festival Theatre: absolutely not to be missed. Having chosen Beethoven as one of this year's featured composers, Edinburgh has nominated Wednesday as 'Fidelio' day. The difficult gestation of Beethoven's only opera will be examined through lectures and concerts, including a performance of 'Leonore'. In the evening the programme culminates with 'Fidelio' itself in Scottish Opera's new production, directed by Tim Albery.</p>

It is informed about the grand ceremony of welcome  of the President P. Ochirbat in Vientiane. As the newspaper  notes, the President P.

Lantuu, who is responsible for  construction in the capital of the hotel "Chinggis-Haan",  speaking about reasons for the dragging out for a long time of  construction works, explains this by financial difficulties and,  on the other hand, by annulment of the agreement with the  Yugoslav corporation "Genex". The annulment of the agreement  was connected with economic sanctions in respect to Serbia. L.  Lantuu notes that, judging by the world experience, for  foundation of such a hotel needed are approximately 30 million  dollars, but for building the hotel "Chinggis-Haan" in all  probability we have to spend about 70 million dollars. In L.  Lantuu's view, in case of taking the necessary measures it is  possible to put the hotel into commission in the current year.    The central newspaper of the Mongolian People's  Revolutionary  Party (MPRP) "UNEN" publishes an article by candidate of  historical science D. Altay "paradigm of development of  Mongolia". In the article it is said that the present  transition period of the country's development is notable for  that the Mongolian society is freeing itself from usual methods  of assessment of social and economic life. The author writes  that this is accompanied by a crisis, which has enveloped the  society as a whole. Mongolia, as noted in the article, has made  a historical choice-creation of a humane democratic society,  which is consolidated in the country's Constitution. In this  connection the author rises the problems, which should be  urgently solved, in her view, for realization of the planned  tasks.    As journalist J. Roozon writes in "UNEN", in Mongolia for  already fourth year deformations of social-economic life are  felt. In J. Roozon's view, such deformations are the growth of  forcible crimes, squandering of material values, in particular,  under pretence of privatization, oblivion of moral and spiritual  traditions of the Mongolian people.    The newspaper informs about the outcome of the international  free-style wrestling tournament "Mongol Gobi `94". About 100  sportsmen from China, Russia, South Korea and Mongolia have  participated in the tournament. The Mongolian sportsmen have  won 7 gold medals out of 10.</p>

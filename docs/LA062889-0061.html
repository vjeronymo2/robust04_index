Most shops in the Indian capital were  closed by the one-day strike called by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata  Party, but banks and government offices operated normally. A party spokesman  said the strike was intended to display "the deep resentment of the people" and  promised to press for "determined action in Punjab on terrorism."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: USING LEFTOVER BREAD FOR CROUTONS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have the greatest recipe for turning leftover French bread into  homemade croutons. They are wonderful to put in salads or for just plain  snacking.  </P> <P> The recipe calls for one-half loaf of French bread, one teaspoon of minced  basil (fresh is best), two cloves of minced garlic and one stick of butter or  margarine.  </P> <P> Preheat your oven to 275 degrees and simmer the butter, basil and garlic in a  sauce pan. While the butter mixture is simmering, cube the French bread and  place the cubes in a roasting pan. Pour the butter mixture over the bread cubes  and place them in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until they are  golden brown and very crunchy.  </P> <P> Store the homemade croutons in a tightly sealed plastic container.  </P> <P>  -- PATRICIA, Massapequa, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: If you have ever covered a pan of yeast dough with plastic wrap  to help it rise faster, you know how the dough can stick to the wrap. To  prevent this, I spray one side of the plastic wrap with non-stick vegetable  spray and put that side against the dough.  </P> <P> When the dough is ready to bake, the wrap peels off easily.  </P> <P>  -- LINDA, Springfield, Ill.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: If you have a pastry blender in your utensil drawer, you'll be  surprised at how many times one can come in handy.  </P> <P> They are perfect for mashing avocados, bananas or any other slightly soft food.  Try using it to mix up dips, cream cheese or anything that is too stiff to be  mixed in the blender. You can also use a pastry blender as a substitute wire  whisk for beating eggs.  </P> <P> I guarantee you'll love using it and will find a pastry blender to be one of  the handiest things around your kitchen.  </P> <P>  -- ROSEMARY, Baltimore, Md.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Before filling a store-bought pie shell with filling, I had to  remove the clear plastic protective shield from the pie crust. This is when I  came up with an ingenious idea for reusing it that I would like to share.  </P> <P> I washed and dried it. When the pie was ready to be placed in the refrigerator  for chilling, I inverted the cover over the pie and crimped the foil edges of  the pie pan over to hold it in place. The shield proved to be very useful and  could be taken off and on as many times as needed.  </P> <P> So, next time you buy a pie-crust shell that is protected by a plastic shield,  by all means don't throw it away.  </P> <P>  -- LOUISE, Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When preparing a whole chicken for frying, if you don't care for  the neck and giblets, don't throw them away. Try this: Boil them and freeze the  broth for future soup stock, gravies and sauces.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Levelland, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: After many years of my skinny silverware handles falling through  the basket in my dishwasher, I have finally found a simple solution.  </P> <P> I cut some plastic mesh (used for crafts) to fit into the bottom of the  silverware basket. This keeps the handles from falling through, and I am able  to place the handles down, the way I prefer to wash them.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE, Sun City West, Ariz.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I fix apples for my children's lunches, I like to cut and  core them to make them easy to eat.  </P> <P> To keep them from turning brown by lunchtime, I squeeze the juice of one lime  into a resealable bag, add the apple slices and agitate. The slices go into  another bag for lunch, and they stay tart and fresh.  </P> <P>  -- DON, Bryan, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Whenever I find a hint or a recipe, I clip it out and tape it to  the product. I taped a special recipe for a tuna casserole to the tuna can. If  I find a cleaning hint, I tape it to whatever has to be cleaned so the next  time I can try it. It works real well for me.  </P> <P>  -- GAY, Bradford, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I'm writing you about a letter from a reader who placed a  tablecloth on the table for her son's birthday party. Then she had the children  sign their names on it and she embroidered their names. You stated it could be  used for future parties.  </P> <P> I think it would be nice to put the date and year on the cloth, using a  different color for each year. After a while this could be quite a conversation  piece.  </P> <P>  -- P. C., Westerville, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Shopping used to be one of my favorite things to do. Now that I  have a small child, it can be something else. He would get quite cranky after a  couple of stores and I would end up going home without finishing my shopping.  </P> <P> So, we made a pact. If he behaves while I finish all my shopping, then he gets  to choose a store or other place that he wants to visit. This way he is more  tolerant of my shopping and looks forward to our shopping trips.  </P> <P>  -- BETTY, Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I appreciated the tip about using a skewer to get a small amount  of lemon juice, so I thought I'd return the favor.  </P> <P> For fresh and easy lemon, lime or orange peel, save the skins in a sealed bag  in the freezer. When a recipe calls for them, they're much easier to grate when  frozen and taste incredibly better than the expensive grated peels in bottles.  </P> <P>  -- ANN, Rapid City, S.D.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I'm an elderly citizen and sometimes forget that I have taken my  vitamins. I turn the container over after I have taken them for that day so I  will always know at a glance if I have taken them. Simple, effective and  relieves stress and doubt.  </P> <P>  -- HARRIET, Concord, N.H.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: So much for UK enterprise Sir, In the article, 'Tax officials told to be more sensitive in dealing with public' (April 13), on the work of the Inland Revenue adjudicator, Ms Elizabeth Filkin, she is quoted as saying that 'the Inland Revenue is the largest business in the country'. I cannot imagine a statement that would better sum up the situation presently applying to enterprise in the UK. James W Spenser, North Star, West Baldwin, Isle of Man</p>

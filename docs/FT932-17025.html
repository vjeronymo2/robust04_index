			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Difficulty of reading between the lines - Accounts reveal dependence on short-term borrowings at Queens Moat Houses for the year to December 31 1991 - give some indication of the financial difficulties facing the company. The document, however, is far from generous in the amount of information it provides for readers of the financial statements. What the accounts do reveal is a dependence on short-term borrowings, profits bolstered by property sales and enhanced by taking costs through the balance sheet. The balance sheet excludes significant liabilities from off-balance sheet financing. It is is now threatened by a downwards revaluations of substantial property assets. The short-term nature of the company's borrowings is shown from the note on bank loans, with Pounds 658m repayable other than by instalments between one and two years and a further Pounds 6m by instalments over the same period. The value of assets on the balance sheet may well have been substantially reduced during the current year. This is because the accounting policy notes shows that the company revalues its hotel and catering properties every year on December 31 by independent valuers. The tangible assets note shows that Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the surveyors, conducted the valuation at the end of 1991, which reduced group assets of Pounds 2.04bn by Pounds 83m. Given the softness of hotel values, a much sharper downward valuation is likely for the 1992 accounts which were due to be reported next week. The accounting note shows that the company - in common with a number of others in the hotel and leisure industries - chooses to revalue its freehold properties rather than depreciating them, which would add costs to the profit and loss account. Less commonly, Queens Moat also does not depreciate furniture and equipment. While replacement furniture and equipment is charged against revenue, these items are capitalised whenever they are up-graded. The tangible assets note shows that there was no depreciation of furniture and equipment, which was recorded at Pounds 153m. If that sum had been depreciated over seven years - the rate it uses for these items on short leasehold properties - that would have added Pounds 21m to costs on the profit and loss account. The leasing commitments note shows that the company entered into a series of sale and leaseback transactions during the year which run for five years. There is no indication of the value of these leases, which are 'off balance sheet'. Their inclusion would add to the group's liabilities. The chairman's statement reveals, however, that the company sold and leased back eight newly-acquired or newly-built hotels and two small office blocks for Pounds 104m. The source of funds statement - which is unusually placed after all the notes at the rear of the accounts - shows sales of fixed assets of Pounds 150m during the year. But the tangible asset note shows disposals of Pounds 124m. This means that the difference - Pounds 26m - probably represents profits on the sale of disposals, which constitute a highly material 29 per cent of the operating profits of Pounds 90m. But this sum is not separately disclosed in the accounts. The balance sheet shows Pounds 207m in convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares. Under the Accounting Standard Board's new proposals on capital instruments, these would be classified as debt, and would significantly increase gearing. The company capitalised interest payments of Pounds 14m in 1991, which added a net Pounds 4m to the balance sheet total of capitalised interest of Pounds 21m. This policy is not unusual, but substantially reduces the costs charged against the profit and loss account. There is no disclosure of the extent of exposure to foreign currencies, although the accounting policy says that any differences in foreign borrowings are taken directly to reserves. Taxation of Pounds 12m is an unusually low proportion of the Pounds 90m profit on ordinary activities at just 14 per cent, compared with the normal UK corporate tax rate of 33 per cent. The group auditor is Bird Luckin, an accountancy firm with 15 chartered accountants and offices in London, Dunmow, Witham, Braintree, Brentford and Chelmsford. The firm does not feature in any league table of the largest 50 accountants, and has no other quoted company clients. Total audit fees paid by Queens Moat - which includes the fees of other auditors to subsidiaries, such as Arthur Andersen for the German businesses  -were Pounds 400,000 in 1991. Mr Maurice Hart, who joined Queens Moat in September 1991 as a non-executive director and is chairman of its audit and remuneration committee, was formerly senior partner of Bird Luckin.</p>

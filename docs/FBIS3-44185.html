			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [ANC Statement on NP Allegations of Communist manipulation  issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] The National Party's [NP] hysteria about the  inclusion  of SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC  [African National Congress] election list is reflective of  undemocratic traditions which this party represents. It is  instructive that this campaign issues from parties of the white  establishment. The ANC remains convinced that this has nothing  to do with the 34 SACP members in the ANC national list of 200  for the constituent assembly nor the deliberate security police  type lie about the so-called "sleeping members".    It is quite clear that this is a pre-planned campaign timed  to coincide with the release of the ANC national list to the  public. The aim remains to divert people's attention from  crucial issues facing the downtrodden people: violence and the  dismal track record of the NP over the years. This is because  the NP has no answers to offer.    The ANC list includes persons of integrity who fought  against  the apartheid system: believers Christians, Hindus, Muslims,  Jews, communists, democratic nationalists and patriots who  believe in a non-racial democracy and a better life for all  South Africans. It is a truly South African list of democrats  chosen in a transparent and democratic manner.    All the candidates will campaign under the ANC banner,  pursue  the ANC platform and policy in Parliament. For this democratic  practice we owe the NP and its allies in the apartheid  establishment no apology.    What the ANC would like the np to tell the public, though,  is  how it is preparing its own lists- their silence in this matter  id deafening. We are extremely concerned at this witch-hunt  against illustrious fighters against apartheid. On the one hand  it has brought to the fore some of the worst characteristics in  the life of the NP:    Suppression from 1950 to the 80's had in its definition of  all opponents of apartheid as communists. Its fascist approach  to campaigns, that the more a "big lie" is told, the more people  believe it. We are therefore bound to ask: where is the new  National Party?    The ANC remains concerned that negative campaigns of this  nature, have in the past been followed by assassinations and  attempts on the lives of leaders of the ANC and its allies. We  genuinely hope that the media will not find themselves used  unwittingly for these machinations of the NP and its allies. We  wish to remind them that it was first the Communist Party in the  50's, then the ANC in the 60's, religious leaders and students  in the 70's and 80's and then the media, which suffered from the  political intolerance of the National Party.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The government plans to  review its long-term supply-demand projection for rice and other  key agricultural products to prepare for drastic changes in  agriculture under a new global trade accord, officials said  Thursday [16 June].    The current projection, approved by the cabinet in January  1990, calls for a food self-sufficiency rate of 50 percent in  the year 2000. But Japan's decision to end its decades-old ban  on rice imports last December in order to sign the Uruguay round  trade agreement has altered conditions on which the latest  projection was made. The agreement calls for converting  nontariff trade barriers such as import bans into tariffs but  allows Japan to have a six-year grace period before doing so on  condition that it imports 4 to 8 percent of its domestic rice  consumption during the period.    Japan is to negotiate what to do over its rice market  opening  after the moratorium, making it uncertain what the domestic rice  supply-demand will be after the year 2000.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is  studying several options in projecting the supply-demand  situation for rice and other key agricultural products after  that year, ministry officials said. They include one case in  which Japan will replace all import bans and quotas with  tariffs, and another in which the grace period will be extended,  they said.    To date, the ministry has reviewed its long-term  supply-demand projection for rice and other key farm products  every 10 years to set a guideline on domestic agricultural  production.</p>

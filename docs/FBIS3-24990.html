			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary From Poor Reception] "The subprefect of Boukoumbe  was kidnapped yesterday. In this connection, the Ministry of  Interior, Security, and Territorial Administration has issued  the following statement: There has been another criminal act in  the Atakora Region. The subprefect of Boukoumbe, Mr. (Francis  Hessou Tomlimeli) was kidnapped yesterday near [name indistinct]  27 km from Boukoumbe." The minister of interior, security, and  territorial administration is trying to find those responsible  for this act. In a statement issued this morning he said this  criminal act was the work of some armed bandits. "These armed  bandits supposedly belong to a gang of former torturers of the  Beninese people. According to the statement, this kidnapping  demonstrates clearly that the antidemocratic forces have not  disarmed yet. This is a very serious criminal act which the  Beninese people and government condemn strongly because they  want peace, tolerance, and security which are necessary for the  country's economic revival and the consolidation of the  democratic process embarked upon since the national conference  of the active forces. The Beninese Government warns seriously  the perpetrators of this sordid act as well as their accomplices  both within and outside the country and who are supporting and  assisting them against the consequences of their action and it  holds them responsible for the life and safety of the Boukoumbe  subprefect. The Beninese Government, therefore, demands the  immediate and unconditional release of the subprefect. In any  case, the statement went on, the Beninese Government is  determined to fight banditry in all its forms and it will take  necessary measures to annihilate these bandits who have  deliberately chosen to go against the desire of our people."</p>

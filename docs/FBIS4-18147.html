			<p>BFN     [Text] Diyarbakir, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic  Populist Party (SHP) mayoral candidate Vahit Yigit and  independent candidate Esref Tanriverdi filed a formal protest to  the election board as great numbers of stamped ballots were  found in a dump.    Yigit and Tanriverdi requested the nullification of the  election.    Officials of the Motherland Party (ANAP) filed an official  complaint because 6,000 ballots in the Black Sea city of Trabzon  were found. As the local election board rejected the objection,  ANAP officials said that they will apply to a higher board.    The candidate of fundamentalist Prosperity Party (RP) had  won  over the ANAP candidate with by narrow margin of 2,130 votes.    The former president of the high election board Orhan Aydin  said, after reports on huge amounts of ballots in dumps and  schools that the March 27 local elections might be canceled if  the ballots found would change the result.</p>

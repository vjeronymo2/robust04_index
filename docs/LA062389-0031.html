			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> P.V. ESTATES CITY MANAGER IS FIRED WITHOUT WARNING  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council abruptly fired City Manager Gordon  Siebert on Thursday, a week before his contract was due to expire. The council  gave no reason for the decision, which was made at closed council personnel  sessions before and after a morning budget meeting. Siebert, 38, who came to  the city on July 1, 1985, was paid $63,000 a year.  </P> <P> The council named Finance Director Bill Yeomans, 45, as temporary acting city  manager. "That means I'll keep the boat moving," said Yeomans, who joined the  city staff in January.  </P> <P> Mayor Ruth Gralow said the vote to fire Siebert was 4 to 1, with Councilman  James R. Nyman dissenting. She would not comment on what prompted Siebert's  firing, but some City Hall staffers and a person who spoke to Siebert said the  action surprised Siebert and the staff.  </P> <P> Some other council members declined comment. Councilman Raymond D. Mattingly  said attorneys for the city had advised them not to discuss the situation.  Nyman could not be reached.  </P> <P> Siebert was said to be in meetings and preparing to leave City Hall Thursday  afternoon and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The council said in a statement that it "is actively seeking both an interim  and permanent city manager to fill the position as soon as possible."  </P> <P> Gralow said Siebert has been on a year-to-year contract and that the current  agreement expires at the end of June. She said Siebert will be paid a financial  settlement but said the amount had not been clarified.  </P> <P> She said the council, at its meeting Tuesday, will publicly confirm "action  taken in closed session."  </P> <P> Prior to coming to Palos Verdes Estates, Siebert was public works director in  neighboring Rancho Palos Verdes. He also administered PV Transit, a  transportation service in three Palos Verdes Peninsula cities.  </P></p>

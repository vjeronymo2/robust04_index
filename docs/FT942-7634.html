			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Kravchuk vents anger over Crimea Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, yesterday lashed out at his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, accusing him of fomenting separatist tensions in Crimea. 'A president can only issue warnings to his own government bodies and ministers and not to the presidents of other countries,' Mr Kravchuk said, condemning Mr Yeltsin in an address to veterans in Kiev. He blamed Mr Yeltsin's advisers for aggravating tension and accused the Russian media of spreading 'rabid and dishonest' information about Crimea, where the local parliament has restored a 1992 constitution denounced by the Kiev authorities as an initial step to secession. 'This is a serious question because we do not accept state level attacks on neighbours with whom we want long-term friendly and equal relations, not just for a single day,' he said. Mr Kravchuk adopted a more peaceful stance in a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary. 'We have no intention of using force. I'd like to stress that,' he told Mr Hurd, adding that he hoped foreign support for Ukraine and its territorial integrity would continue. Since the Crimean parliament restored its 1992 constitution last Friday new troubles have erupted between the Russian-dominated peninsula region and Ukraine's central authorities. Kiev's parliament has issued a Monday deadline for Crimea to rescind its constitution and there have been rumours of increased military activity on the peninsula. Local militia are guarding the parliament building and broadcast centre in the Crimean capital. Simultaneous negotiations in Moscow and Kiev have failed to resolve the standoff. In Kiev, talks with Crimean politicians concluded unsuccessfully yesterday. Crimean MPs refused to withdraw their assertive constitution, but did agree to establish joint commissions with Ukraine for further discussions on issues such as economic policy. In Moscow, the Russian, Crimean and Ukrainian prime ministers held parallel talks on dividing the Black Sea fleet, based at the Crimean port of Sevastopol. The talks were said last night to have produced an outline agreement on basing the Russian and Ukrainian fleets in separate ports. Negotiations are expected to resume today. The official Tass news agency reported that a 'joint document was ready to sign after a final agreement had been reached' between Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, and Mr Yefim Zviagilsky and Mr Yevgeny Saburov, the Ukrainian and Crimean premiers. The Tass report said it was expected that 'in the final document precise conditions will be laid down for the division of the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet, and also for the issue of the bases for the national fleets'. Unconfirmed reports suggest there is agreement in principle that the Russian share will remain in Sevastopol - as long as it remains a Ukrainian city. Ukraine's navy, expected to be the smaller part, is to be based in Balaclava some 160km away, according to the Russian Information Agency. Ukraine's foreign minister, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, is eager to seek support for his country's position from the United Nations and other multilateral western organisations. Britain, the US and Germany have expressed support for Ukraine's current borders, but Mr Zlenko is pressing for a 'broader statement' that would show that the international community shows a clear understanding of 'the territorial integrity of Ukraine'.</p>

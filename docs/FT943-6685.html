			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Role in KPN flotation helps lift ABN Amro ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, posted a 14.3 per cent rise in first-half net profit, helped in part by its leading role in the June bourse flotation of KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal company. Net profit rose to Fl 1.16bn (Dollars 670m) from Fl 1.01bn, on total revenue up 7.7 per cent at Fl 7.46bn. Interest income grew by 9.2 per cent to Fl 4.8bn, due to volume growth in lending but also to a slightly higher interest rate margin overseas. At home, the interest margin was virtually unchanged. Commission income rose by an even stronger 14.7 per cent to Fl 1.95bn. Of this amount, securities commission - which includes fees earned as lead-manager of the KPN issue, the largest in Dutch corporate history - was up 32.3 per cent at Fl 942m. The first-half figures also showed that the bank doubled its profits in North America, enabling it to absorb lower results posted at home and in Europe. Earnings per share rose by 7.1 per cent to Fl 3.45, reflecting an increase in the number of shares outstanding. ABN Amro forecast a 'sustained' increase in earnings per share for the full year. In the Netherlands, pre-tax profit slipped by 5.2 per cent to Fl 945m. This was attributed mainly to a sharp fall in results from financial transactions.</p>

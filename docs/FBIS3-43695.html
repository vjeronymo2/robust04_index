Nigeria's chief of defence staff,  General Abdulsalam Abubakar, signed the agreement on behalf of  the head of state, General Sani Abacha, while Captain S.K.  Cumba, the Sierra Leonean under-secretary of state for defence,  signed for his country.    Abubakar said the accord was in line with Nigeria's policy  of  making Africa the centre-piece of its foreign policy as well as  with the objectives of the Economic Community of West African  States (ECOWAS) and the Organisation of African Unity.  "Equally, it will foster the attainment of mutual collective  security system for the defence of the West African sub-region,  in particular, and the continent of Africa in general," he said.    Cumba said his country requested the military assistance as  part of its efforts to battle rebels in its eastern border  areas. Nigeria sent troops to Sierra Leone last year to help the  government battle a rebel offensive.</p>

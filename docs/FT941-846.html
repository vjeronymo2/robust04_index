			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Painful spell ahead for fund managers - London This week will bring some painful experiences for fund managers as they face up to the outcome of the first trading quarter of the year. The fall of more than 9 per cent on the FT-SE 100 index over the quarter, and huge losses in government bonds, is bad enough; but the percentage loss on equities rises to nearly 12 points for those who bought at the market peak at the beginning of February. All these factors add to the agony caused by the underlying worries about interest rate trends and the sudden lurch downwards on Wall Street on fears of turmoil in Latin America. In market terms, these prospects have already been reflected in an absence of support at almost any price, although the underlying sentiment in equities is less negative than the index statistics might suggest. The big funds are simply not going to play until after Easter and the closing of investment ledgers on the first quarter of 1994, so share prices remain at the mercy of the global bond markets; and last week brought the currency markets back on to the scene. There is little point in looking for a break in the clouds before Good Friday. The positive view on the stock market is that rising corporate dividend and earnings trends are balancing out the swiftly fading hopes for that next cut in base rates, on which optimism was founded at the beginning of this year. At some stage, equities are going to make a convincing response to this view. But when? The stock market bounced successfully around the FT-SE 100 3,100 mark last week, but so it did around 3,200 on several previous occasions. Unfortunately, even after the market survives Easter, it still has to face the political future implied by the government's low standing in the opinion polls, the impending increases in personal taxation and the forthcoming local and European elections. However, Kleinwort Benson Securities believes that, given that the next UK general election could be delayed until April 1997, political fears may have been overdone; four years is a long time in politics. Bargain hunters abound in these troubled conditions, and it is no surprise that they should have concentrated on sectors inviting attention in terms of prospective yields. The stress is on prospective rather than historic performance, with dividend forecasts taken seriously. Inevitably, this puts the focus on sectors badly out of favour. Pharmaceuticals collapsed last year but are showing an increase in dividend growth forecasts. Glaxo, which was badly hit again last week as Ciba-Geigy threatened a challenge to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug, is unlikely to languish for long. Water stocks have taken a beating this year but are returning to favour as investors begin to prefer dividend growth stocks to fixed interest securities. Anglian and Wessex Water have been targeted by NatWest Securities.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> BOND SALE APPROVED FOR RECYCLING GEAR  </P> <P> The City Council this week unanimously approved the sale of $2.6 million in  bonds to pay for new equipment for the city recycling program.  </P> <P> The Placentia Disposal Co. will use the money to buy new equipment for the  recycling program scheduled to begin in July, City Administrator Robert D'Amato  said.  </P> <P> The money will be repaid through garbage collection fees, he said.  </P> <P> "By financing the equipment ourselves, we were able to save as much as 50 cents  per household," said D'Amato, adding that city financing at an interest rate of  7.5% is cheaper than the bank rate of about 12%.  </P> <P> The equipment will include a mechanical arm that picks up curbside trash bins  containing recyclables.  </P> <P> "The city will share in the profits from the recycled goods and will have a  share in getting top dollar for recyclables," he said.  </P> <P> The firm of Stradling Yocca Carlson &amp; Rauth was chosen to act as bond  counsel, with the firm of Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance acting as  investment banker. -- JULIE ESPY  </P></p>

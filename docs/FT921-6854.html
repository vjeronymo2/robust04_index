			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Management: Aztec acts swiftly as sky falls in - Training on Trial Judith Rutherford had barely got her coat off before the bad news broke: 'It was a complete shock, the worst possible start. But it handed us a massive challenge.' In December 1990, only one week into the job as chief executive of Aztec, London's first operational training and enterprise council, Rutherford was still preparing a strategy to assist economic growth in the London boroughs of Kingston, Merton and Wandsworth. Out of a clear blue sky, British Aerospace fired a devastating broadside into the heart of the local community. The company announced that it was leaving Kingston, an aircraft town since 1912 when pioneer aviator Tommy Sopwith built his prototype 'Camel' there. Generations of Hurricanes, Hunters, Hawks and Harriers were to follow, until the age of defence cuts arrived. The company, which at the time of the announcement directly employed more than 3,000 people locally in its military aircraft operations and accounted for one third of local manufacturing jobs, will be gone by the end of this year. The last Harrier airframe left the factory this month. With it went around 500 job opportunities a year, numerous skill training opportunities, more than Pounds 12m of spending power from local people's pockets and all hopes that the area could avoid the worst effects of the recession. 'It looked for a while as though most people, apart from the unions, were just going to sit back quietly and let it happen,' reflects Rutherford. What was a catastrophe for a relatively old, immensely experienced workforce at least provided Aztec with the chance to use its initiative and to employ its untested skills in mobilising a community into action. Rutherford says she has always seen a broad role for Tecs as brokers, acting as a catalyst to bring a range of local agencies together to help the business community fulfil its potential. Aztec's board of directors, drawn from the business world, did not think it fit to question the commercial decisions of BAe, which is spending Pounds 2m to help ease the pain of closure and advise on jobs, retraining and business start-ups. But the board was anxious to assess the impact and to consider a strategy for minimizing the damage. In the first public-private partnership of its type, Aztec joined forces with BAe, the three boroughs and other local bodies and set up a task force to address the issues. The first results have just emerged in the shape of a report which identifies the short-term consequences of BAe's departure from Kingston and which tries to establish its effect on longer-term economic trends in the area. The report, which should offer lessons for other companies and communities faced with similar upheavals, makes a detailed impact analysis of the closure and considers future uses for the Richmond Road site. But Aztec also hopes the document's value will be in providing a strategic framework for a programme of economic development in its area on which public and private sectors can co-operate. The authors believe that the creation of a more systematic approach to monitoring employment changes and economic activity will help the process of forward planning. In turn, that should encourage a better targeted approach to business support, training and other local economic development initiatives. For Aztec itself, the real challenge is to ensure that it maintains some momentum. It intends to keep the task force going, possibly broadening it with the inclusion of the trade unions and the local chamber of commerce. Together with the three councils, Aztec is now considering appointing an officer to trawl for EC funds to help them get on with their job. Immediate plans involve a further study to identify the prospects for inward investment and measures to help retrain older workers and relocate unemployed executives. There will also be courses for women having to return to work to supplement household incomes. With the local citizens' advice bureau swamped with requests for help, Aztec expects to have its own help-line operating in April. But all the good intentions and strategic objectives in the world run up, inevitably, against the expenditure restraints of which Tecs now increasingly complain. Rutherford admits there is a great deal of frustration over the inability of TECs to fulfil the valuable role for which they were established, adding: 'We are looking at a cake which will simply not begin to feed everyone'.</p>

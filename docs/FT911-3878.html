			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Names allege that Lloyd's kept them 'in the dark' A GROUP of Names were kept 'in the dark' about the true state of loss-making Lloyd's syndicates that they backed in the early 1980s, Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, alleged yesterday in the High Court in London. Mr Lyndon-Stanford, representing 24 Names on syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agents, now in liquidation, was outlining why the Names are taking action against the Corporation of Lloyd's. Nine other Oakeley Vaughan Names are consenting to the action while 15 more Oakeley Names are involved in supplemental actions. The case, in which the Oakeley Vaughan Names allege that the Corporation of Lloyd's was negligent in failing to supervise the Lloyd's insurance market, was adjourned yesterday until Monday. The delay is necessary to allow the judge, Mr Justice Gatehouse, to study extensive background documentation. The 24 plaintiffs suffered gross losses of more than Pounds 5m as a result of their membership of syndicates 168, 420/423, 551 and 862 in the 1980, 1981 and 1982 underwriting years. Total losses by the 250 or so Names who were members of the syndicates amounted to more than Pounds 30m. The Names are seeking to prove that Lloyd's owes Names a duty of care, and that in failing to supervise the Oakeley Vaughan agency properly, Lloyd's was at least partially responsible for the loss. Mr Lyndon-Stanford said that during 1980 and 1981 the authorities at Lloyd's received information indicating that the Oakeley syndicates were guilty of 'overwriting' - accepting more premiums than allowed according to Lloyd's rules - and also, along with Oakeley's sister broking company, breaching other market regulations. Following subsequent internal investigations, Lloyd's had taken disciplinary measures against a number of insurers linked to the Oakeley Vaughan agency. The Names say Lloyd's had not ensured that Names were informed of the problems. 'Names therefore continued to back Oakeley Vaughan syndicates in ignorance of its real position,' said Mr Lyndon-Stanford.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Fed warnings to banks on easier credit standards Top US Federal Reserve officials have issued a warning that banks may be unduly relaxing their credit standards and making risky loans that could turn sour. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday told the Senate banking committee he had received reports from Fed bank examiners that some banks under their supervision were 'competing more aggressively for loans, and . . . are relaxing their credit standards'. And Mr William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, warned in a recent speech against the temptation for banks to 'let the pendulum swing too far' by cutting their rates or easing loan restrictions as they try to rebuild lending operations after a very tight period. 'Pressure on pricing and other credit terms, such as loan covenants, must not be permitted to sow the seeds of a new round of asset quality problems down the road,' Mr McDonough told a symposium hosted by the New Jersey state banking department. Fed officials began to detect some cause for concern a while ago, but their suspicions have been fuelled by a recent survey of senior loan officers. Nevertheless, Mr Greenspan insisted: 'The condition of the banking system is sound and much improved.' Other Fed officials said they wanted to 'look beyond the silver lining' of the current good health of the banking industry. And Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, whose office supervises nationally chartered banks while the Fed oversees state chartered banks, said better bank profitability stemmed largely from improved credit quality. 'Banks have substantially recovered from their credit quality problems from the late 1980s and early 1990s due, among other factors, to the improvement in the economy,' Mr Ludwig told the Senate banking committee yesterday. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's latest quarterly survey, published yesterday, showed that the nearly 11,000 banks in the US made profits totalling Dollars 11.2bn (Pounds 7bn) in the second quarter of this year, level with their performance in the first quarter and nearly 9 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1993. Mr Greenspan also renewed his call for Congress to tear down more of the barriers which restrict banks from entering other sectors of the financial services industry, such as insurance and securities, and warned against excessively tight control of activities such as derivatives.</p>

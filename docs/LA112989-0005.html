			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOB PAYOFF FOR TEENS  </P> <P> Boston's business leaders made an intriguing offer several years ago. If the  public schools improved, high school graduates would be given the first shot at  jobs. The Boston Compact has paid off with a dramatic success in teen-age  employment.  </P> <P> Boston is the only city in the nation where white and minority employment is  nearly equal for recent high school graduates. The near parity dates back to  1985, three years after the compact began, a time when all high school  graduates faced a 19.5% unemployment rate, and minorities faced a 50%  unemployment rate. But in Boston, 61% of white high school graduates were  working and 60% of minority graduates also had jobs. There has been no letup:  90% of recent graduates are working or going to college.  </P> <P> Boston's success has led to many spinoff programs. The National Alliance of  Business is directing projects in 12 other cities with the same goals -- better  schools and a better-trained work force -- although the approaches differ. In  Detroit, according to the NAB, a sense of crisis motivated the business  community to get organized and back school reform. In Cincinnati, Procter &amp;  Gamble took the lead and top executives personally spent 15 hours a week to  launch an educational program that embraces preschool through high school.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the United Neighborhoods Organization and South-Central  Organizing Committee persuaded business, government and school leaders to sign  a similar compact for graduates of six public high schools. But the results  have been disappointing. The original criteria -- a 2.5 grade-point average and  a 95% attendance record -- focused on students who were more likely to go to  college rather than seek a job after graduation.  </P> <P> It is encouraging to note that the Los Angeles business community is taking the  lead with a new partnership, dubbed Work Force LA. The task force includes the  mayor, the state and Los Angeles superintendents of schools, the chancellor of  the community colleges and business leaders, including members of the  California Business Roundtable. Work Force LA will concentrate on Mayor Tom  Bradley's new program to place 1,000 at-risk youngsters in city jobs and  solicit commitments for additional jobs from major corporations. It is an  effort that deserves the community's full and long-term support.  </P></p>

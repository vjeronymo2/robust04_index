			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer by </F> Bernhard Blohm in Frankfurt; date not given: "Regarding the  Price Increase Rate This Year, a 2 Before the Comma Is Possible"]    [Text] [Blohm] Mr. Tietmeyer, you have been Bundesbank  president for three months now and have to defend an annual  result that is not very gratifying in stability policy terms.  The economic output decreased approximately 2 percent in 1993,  whereas prices increased approximately 4 percent.    [Tietmeyer] This result is definitely not what we would like  to see. But it is probably a transition situation that was  inevitable following the poor developments at the beginning of  the 1990's. Regarding the price trend, we have always made  clear that it is unacceptable for us and that we must return to  clearly lower prices. It is important, however, that while the  average annual increase was about 4 percent, the price increase  slowed down in the second half of the year.    [Blohm] What are you expecting this year?    [Tietmeyer] We assume that there will be a better result in  1994. We do not rule out that we will have a 2 before the comma  in the course of the year.    [Blohm] The Bundesbank's current policy has been described  as a policy of small steps. Do you think the 1993 end result  would have been worse if the Bundesbank had decreased the key  interest rates faster and more extensively?    [Tietmeyer] It is correct that we pursued a policy of small  steps. But this was urgently necessary, because it was  absolutely impermissible for us to jeopardize the positive  assessment of the German mark by investors, in particular  abroad, or the credibility of the German central bank's policy.  All in all, we have made considerable progress. On the one  hand, we have preserved the confidence of international  investors. On the other, we clearly lowered long-term interest  rates, and that is decisive. One thing is sure: Our interest  rate policy has not had a negative influence on economic  development, but has created the basis for an upward trend in  the next few years on a new and sound basis.    [Blohm] You said recently that in view of rapidly growing  unemployment, the dictate of the moment is to secure and promote  employment. Couldn't the Bundesbank do more in this respect?    [Tietmeyer] The Bundesbank has done what it could. It is  not primarily monetary policy that has to act, but decisions are  now required in the area of the companies themselves, collective  wage settlements, labor cost, and the area of public finances,  which essentially influence the framework conditions.    [Blohm] The word "social cuts" is the keyword in 1993. You  said that monetary policy cannot be the repair shop of public  finances. Does this mean that the Bundesbank welcomes the  discussion on entitlements and social cuts?    [Tietmeyer] I think that speaking of social cuts does not  describe the situation or the task correctly. The task is to  restructure the social welfare state and adjust it to the new  conditions, nationally and internationally. I think it is  important for us in Germany to return to the simple economic  truth that says that one can only distribute what has been  produced. In an open market economy system, entitlements cannot  be retained in companies or in the social system, if the  competitive conditions have changed. The most important thing is  for us to interpret the term of social justice also in light of  performance.    [Blohm] What do you mean by this?    [Tietmeyer] I mean by this that work must be remunerated  according to the results. Payment for work must have an  advantage over the distribution of benefits.    [Blohm] As of this year, the gasoline and diesel tax will be  considerably increased. In 1993, taxes were also increased, and  in 1995, we will again have to pay a solidarity surcharge. All  this will, of course, also have an effect on prices. Is the  state diminishing your stability successes?    [Tietmeyer] A restructuring of the tax system is in order,  if taxes are imposed on consumption rather than  performance-oriented incomes. An increase in the mineral oil  tax does not have to undermine stability policy or growth and  employment policy. However, it is of decisive importance that  this tax-conditioned price increase not be passed on or taken as  a reason for further income demands, which would then touch off  another spiral.    It is important for us not to increase the tax quotas in the  Federal Republic, one of the highest in the world, but to  consolidate the public budgets, including social security  systems, by restricting increases in expenditures.    [Blohm] Several days ago, the Bundesbank announced its new  money supply target for 1994. It envisages an M3 money supply  growth by 4 to 6 percent during the course of this year. Will  monetary policy be continued along the line pursued since  September 1992?    [Tietmeyer] It is certain that we will continue this course.  This also includes the option of further interest rate  reductions in case the money supply expansion slows down. We  assume that it will decelerate in the course of this year. Then  we will examine what the proper interest rate should be.    [Blohm] Are you still anticipating any leeway for interest  rate reductions on the capital market? After all, interest  rates on the capital market have already dropped far more  considerably.    [Tietmeyer] To begin with, viewed historically and  internationally, our capital market interest rates are  relatively low. Currently, our capital market interest rates  have almost reached their historical nadir. In the past, the  rate of inflation was close to zero. On this basis, some  observers do not expect another major decrease in interest rates  on the capital market. In my view, it will be of decisive  importance whether we will be able to maintain positive  stability expectations for the next few years. The more positive  they are, the more likely it is that long-term interest rates  remain at a low level or decrease even further.    [Blohm] This year, 1994, is the 20th time that the  Bundesbank  has announced a money supply goal. In the first 10 years, the  goal was missed five times, in the second nine years, six times.  We do not see any kind of learning effect from such statistics.  Why was this goal missed more and more often?    [Tietmeyer] More and more often is not correct. It is  correct that we have not always fully reached it, but we must  differentiate between a minor and a major deviation. There have  been major deviations in a few years only. We hold the view  that we must keep to the money supply concept because it  provides an orientation for our own policy and for the financial  markets. This is important for longer-term stability  anticipations. In addition, all our analyses show that there is  a close medium-term connection between the indicator, M3, which  is the money supply watched and controlled by us, and the price  trend. That is why we are convinced that it is the best  indicator, which can also serve as a yardstick for ourselves.    [Blohm] On 1 August, 1993, the so-called fixed exchange  rates in the European Monetary System were discarded. Now the  exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate plus/minus 15 percent in  the exchange rate mechanism. Does this make German monetary  policy easier?    [Tietmeyer] The decision of 1 August certainly makes German  -- and our neighbors' -- monetary policy easier. Now the risk  involved in speculation is much greater. For us it is important  that in our policy we must and will continue to consider what is  happening in Europe as a whole. But we are less restricted by  the tight corset of narrow bands. Our neighbor countries have  to again bear more responsibility.    [Blohm] Are you expecting a relatively early return to  narrower bands?    [Tietmeyer] Certainly not over the short term. For the time  being, it is important to create confidence on the financial  markets in the national monetary policy of the countries  concerned. It is important to create the economic bases  required for lasting exchange rate stability. In this respect,  we have made good progress since 1 August.    [Blohm] Under the Maastricht Treaty, the progress made  regarding fulfillment of the convergency criteria will be  examined by the end of 1996. Do you think that most member  states will then have met the prerequisites for European  monetary union?    [Tietmeyer] I do not think it is possible at this point to  forecast anything. Judging by the present data, it is not very  likely. I do not consider it appropriate to say today what the  situation will be by the end of 1996. The race has begun, and  everyone should have a chance to reach the goal in due course.    [Blohm] You said that at the third stage of European  monetary union, we will need a convincing and, if possible, also  well-tested monetary policy concept. In your view, could it be  different from that of the Bundesbank?    [Tietmeyer] To begin with, we think the Bundesbank's concept  is convincing and good. That is why we will fight to make sure  that this concept is made the yardstick and guideline of a  European concept. But we must talk about it with our partners  because other countries have totally different concepts. I hope  our arguments will be convincing, so that in the end, the German  monetary policy concept will be accepted as an orientation.    [Blohm] Frankfurt will be the seat of the European central  bank. At the beginning of this year, the European Monetary  Institute [EMI] has started work in Frankfurt. Are there any  contacts with the Bundesbank?    [Tietmeyer] The EMI is an independent monetary institute.  There is no special relationship with the Bundesbank. Of  course, the institute cooperates with all central banks, and its  council is composed of the presidents of the European central  banks. So I am a member of this body, and I therefore have to  codetermine this institute's line. However, the Bundesbank does  not have a privileged position compared with other central  banks. We hope, of course, that the Bundesbank's thinking and  experience will have the greatest possible effect on the EMI's  work.    [Blohm] What specifically will the EMI do?    [Tietmeyer] This institute has two tasks. The first task is  to help ensure good cooperation between central banks in the  next few years, and to help coordinate monetary policy to the  extent that this is possible in stability policy terms. The  second task is the specific preparation of the work of a future  European central bank system. In this respect, the concept, the  instruments, and the organizational things must be clarified.  But we must be aware of one thing: This institute is a  cooperation institute, and not a central bank.    [Blohm] If you want to cooperate with your counterparts in  the other European central banks, you just phone them. This is  the closest form of cooperation one can think of, isn't it?    [Tietmeyer] This will be continued in the future, but in  addition, we will meet in Frankfurt once every month, and not in  Basel at the Bank for International Settlements. But this is  only one side. The other side is that the European monetary  institute will have its own staff and will prepare its own  documents. In addition, there will in the future be a very  intensive form of cooperation below the level of central bank  presidents. This means that a large number of committees will  try to find common positions for individual areas of the central  banks' work. This is the form of cooperation that we want.  However, at the second stage, as long as we do not have  monetary union, the national central banks will in the final  analysis be responsible for their policy themselves. There can  be no majority decisions in the EMI that would bind a central  bank in its policy.    [Blohm] Does this also hold true for the currency reserves?    [Tietmeyer] It holds in particular true for the currency  reserves. There is an option allowing individual countries to  transfer all or some of their currency reserves to the EMI and  to ask the EMI to manage these reserves as an agent. The German  side does not intend to make use of this option. We can and  will continue, for the time being, to manage our reserves  ourselves.    [Blohm] There is talk everywhere about structural crises and  necessary adjustments in the economic sector and society. The  judgment on the Bundesbank ranges from "bronze rock" to a  creature from Jurassic Park. Where do you see the Bundesbank?    [Tietmeyer] For some people to see the Bundesbank as a  "bronze rock," seems to me to be an attribute that is not wrong.  However, the metaphor of the dinosaur is certainly  inappropriate. The Bundesbank has won a high degree of  credibility. I hope this will also play a relevant role  regarding the further European policy orientation. We will not  be those who want to determine everything, so to speak, but we  will bring in our arguments, and we will fight for our  experience being taken as a yardstick. The common goal is and  must be to develop a stability community in Europe.    [Blohm] Nonetheless, it is correct to describe the  Bundesbank as a preserving element in a rapidly changing  financial world.    [Tietmeyer] You addressed a right point. Compared with many  other central banks, we have pursued a more conservative  monetary policy -- conservative in that we have pursued our  policy in a stability-oriented way. I think our policy has  helped keep the financial markets in Germany more stable. They  have developed more calmly than elsewhere. You can see this by  the fact that in our country, long-term credit relations play a  much larger role than in other countries with lower monetary  stability. We want to maintain this basis because we know from  experience that this not only furthers the stability of our  currency, but is also an indispensable basis for growth and  employment.</p>

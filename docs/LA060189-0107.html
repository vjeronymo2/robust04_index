			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An American writer for the U.S. magazine Soldier of Fortune -- who once fought  alongside Afghan guerrillas -- died of gunshot and shrapnel wounds suffered  during battles between Burmese troops and border rebels. Lance Eugene Motley, a  32-year-old West Point graduate from Sacramento, was taken to Thailand's Mae  Sot Hospital where he died, medical aides said. Police said Motley apparently  crossed into Burma with ethnic Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo  Ra, which has been besieged by Burmese troops.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER GROUP GETS A SUMMER REPRIEVE FROM DISTRACTIONS  </P> <P> Community center Ping-Pong games that interrupt rehearsals. Bustling country  club kitchens that double as backstage areas. Noisy ice machines that plop  during dramatic pauses on stage.  </P> <P> This summer, for the first time since its inception in 1987, the Xanadu Theatre  Company is enjoying a reprieve from the aforementioned distractions that have  accompanied a company constantly on the move.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley-based, nonprofit troupe has finally found a home -- albeit a  temporary one -- at the 90-seat Little Theatre on the campus of Cal Lutheran  University in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Xanadu is performing in repertory Joe Orton's "Loot" and Tom Stoppard's "The  Real Thing" Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays through July 22.  </P> <P> About 40 volunteers are involved in the productions, which alternate each  night. Many of the actors and almost all of the technicians and support  personnel are residents of the San Fernando Valley area.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful having a place where all of the people involved in the company  can come to rehearse and perform on a regular basis," said Xanadu founder Naomi  Monroe. "We've had some real production adventures in the past, so this is  luxury to us."  </P> <P> Xanadu, which has no permanent home, secured the use of the Cal Lutheran  theater through Michael Arndt and Mike Roehr, both of whom are drama professors  at the university and members of the Xanadu board of directors.  </P> <P> "One of the things that makes theater so tough in this area is the community is  so new," said Roehr, a Canoga Park resident and the company's set designer.  "With a theater, when you start you usually find an old building that's not  being used and you move into it. But there aren't any old buildings out here.  So where do you go?"  </P> <P> Arndt, a Minnesota native who lives in Agoura Hills, has directed more than 80  professional and college productions, including several Xanadu shows.  </P> <P> The relationship between the company and the university is mutually beneficial,  said Arndt, who is directing the current production of "The Real Thing."  </P> <P> "One of the reasons for my becoming involved with this project is to hopefully  have a theater company that operates and builds in this community," Arndt said.  "Another reason is for the university to have a link with a  professional-quality theater because it provides opportunities for our  students."  </P> <P> In conjunction with the current productions, Arndt is teaching a summer course  through the university called "Professional Theatre in Performance." The class  includes weekly lectures covering production aspects of play writing,  directing, acting, stage management, design and technical production.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a class-workshop," Arndt said. "Students are able to talk to  members of the staff, actors and observe the process of -- even though we're  not getting paid -- what we label professional theater."  </P> <P> Monroe, a Newbury Park resident, started Xanadu after founding Actors for  Children, an adult touring company that has brought theater to Valley-area  children since 1984.  </P> <P> A New York native who started a theater company in New Jersey, Monroe said she  founded Xanadu to help fill a cultural void faced by adults in the Conejo  Valley.  </P> <P> "We came together because we felt there was an opportunity and a need for a  company in the area," Monroe said.  </P> <P> Xanadu's first production, "The Dining Room," was directed by Arndt and staged  with the help of a cultural grant from the city of Thousand Oaks at the Conejo  Community Center. Now, Monroe said, ticket sales fund the productions. Xanadu  usually budgets $2,500 for each show; the company is attempting to stage the  current productions for $4,000.  </P> <P> The company's next five productions, which included such shows as "Are You Now  or Have You Ever Been . . .," "The Foreigner" and "Lunch Hour," were rehearsed  and performed at community centers, libraries, schools and country clubs.  </P> <P> "In the past," Arndt said, "we've rehearsed in rooms where the actors had no  idea what the stage was really going to be like until we got into dress  rehearsal."  </P> <P> Said Monroe, "It was a hassle design process-wise because the sets had to be  struck and moved in 15 minutes so we didn't get charged overtime."  </P> <P> The CLU Little Theatre is providing -- temporarily -- shop, rehearsal and  performance space all in one location.  </P> <P> "When we say this is a theater," Roehr said, "part of what we mean is we can  leave the chairs up instead of taking them and the whole set down every night."  </P> <P> For Roehr, the current productions presented the challenge of constructing sets  that work for both plays and easily change over.  </P> <P> "It's basically the same physical set redressed with different furniture,"  Roehr said. "The design more than the execution is the tricky part."  </P> <P> The greatest challenge still facing the company, however, is its search for a  permanent site.  </P> <P> Once school begins in the fall, Xanadu is on the road again. The company will  present Tina Howe's "Painting Churches" at the Conejo Community Center.  </P> <P> "We'd like to be a theater in a space so people can identify us with one  space," Arndt said. "We're still looking for a home."  </P></p>

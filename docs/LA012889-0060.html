			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES. . .: 'MEMORY' TOUCHES  </P> <P> Anyone who heard the wizened outcast Grizabella sing "Memory" in the Los  Angeles production of "Cats," might be astonished to actually meet the singer  who immortalized her. With her whiskers off, Kim Criswell comes off more as the  bouncy antebellum Scarlett O'Hara (she has a touch of her native Chattanooga in  almost everything she says) than someone who's seen eight of her nine lives  used up.  </P> <P> Now that Criswell's no longer in "Cats" -- or any other musical for that matter  -- the New York-based actress is experiencing a certain creative renaissance in  her life. After a decade of singing lead roles in the original casts of such  Broadway musicals as "The First," "Nine," "Baby" and "Stardust," the 33  year-old performer is so seriously considering taking one of the TV and film  opportunities being offered her now that she's become an Angeleno for good.  </P> <P> But Criswell's not all smiles when it comes to talking about more personal  reasons for settling down in her Silver Lake cottage.  </P> <P> "New York has lost its vitality in the theater world," she explains, "in large  part, due to AIDS. We've lost Michael Bennett and Charles Ludlam and I've lost  so many friends. There's still a bit more life force in L.A."  </P> <P> So Criswell's made a mini-career of appearing in AIDS benefits across the  country, and a tradition of singing "Memory" in them, including at the AIDS  Benefit for Being Alive at the Wilshire Ebell Theater on Fridayin Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The figure I play in 'Cats,' " she says, "is not unlike a person with AIDS.  Just listen to the lyrics: 'Touch me, it's so easy to leave me alone.' "  DOUGLAS SADOWNICK  </P></p>

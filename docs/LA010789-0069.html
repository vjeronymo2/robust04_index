			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA GABOR ESCORTED OFF PLANE  </P> <P> Police escorted actress Zsa Zsa Gabor off a Delta Air Lines flight after she  refused to keep her dogs in travel kennels, an airline spokesman said.  </P> <P> Gabor, 69, was traveling from Los Angeles to her home in Palm Beach, Fla., with  an assistant and two Shih Tzu dogs when the confrontation occurred Thursday  night during a stopover at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.  </P> <P> On the plane she "removed her two (dogs) from their kennels," airline spokesman  William D. Berry said. "The Delta agent came aboard. He asked her six times to  comply. She refused to comply. Each time he was responded to with considerable  vulgarity."  </P> <P> Atlanta police were called to escort Gabor off the aircraft. Dogs are not  permitted to run free in the cabin of the plane, Berry said.  </P> <P> "Passengers complained," he said. "The captain asked her to put them back in  the kennel. All she had to do was leave the dogs in the kennel, but she would  not comply."  </P> <P> Gabor contended that the dogs were not disturbing anyone, and said the Delta  agent on the plane "was screaming at me like I was some criminal. I was so  upset you can't imagine. This is not the end of this," she said. "If I live to  be 100 I'll never understand why five policemen would have to come and take me  off the plane. As long as I live, I don't want to hear the word Delta."  </P></p>

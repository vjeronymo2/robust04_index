			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian call for Opec output cut gives oil market brief fillip OIL PRICES edged upwards yesterday in light trading in the run-up to Christmas, only to slip back again later in the day to close unchanged on the day. North Sea Brent crude for February delivery was at Dollars 18.55 a barrel. Prices got a brief fillip early in the day from reports in the Middle East Economic Survey, which quoted Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, calling for a 2 per cent cut in output by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. A 2 per cent cut in production would take Opec's ceiling to 24.09m barrels a day from its present level of 24.58m b/d. But many market traders are sceptical that members have even implemented the slight cutbacks required under their latest agreement. Traders at one international oil company said there was little physical evidence of Opec cutbacks. 'Iran is talking up the oil price,' said Mr Fareed Mohammedi at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, 'I can't see them getting anyone to agree to a meeting before February'. Oil prices have found some support in the past week after being extremely weak since October, but traders believe that, if Opec members fail to cut their production in the New Year, prices will continue to slide. Russia and Kazakhstan are looking at plans to join together energy producing states from the former Soviet Union in a 'mini Opec', the Reuter news agency reported yesterday. The agreement was reached at the weekend in talks between Mr Viktor Chernomydrin, Russian prime minister and Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's president. Russia and Kazakhstan were reported last month to be interested in joining Opec.</p>

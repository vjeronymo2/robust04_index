			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Caution greets lending increase BANK and building society lending rose unexpectedly last month, but certain factors cast doubt over whether the rise was a sign of economic recovery. The Bank of England reported that bank and building society lending to the private sector increased by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.1bn in January after a Pounds 74m drop in December. The increase was double City expectations and substantially higher than the Pounds 1.5bn average of the previous six months. But hopes that this might signal a robust recovery in demand were tempered by doubts about the methods of seasonally adjusting the figures. In addition M4, the UK's broad money measure that includes bank and building society deposits, increased by only 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to January. This was the lowest increase in the measure since records began and well below the government's 'monitoring range' of 4 per cent to 8 per cent growth. The British Bankers' Association, representing the UK's nine largest banking groups, said the groups' lending to the private sector increased by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.13bn in January after a fall of Pounds 1.71bn in December. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said the January increase in bank lending was the biggest since October. 'It would probably be unwise to interpret this welcome rise in lending as providing evidence of an upturn in the economy,' he added. City analysts said lending figures over the past year have established a pattern of weak growth or falling lending at the end of each quarter followed by sharp growth in each subsequent month. This indicates that the seasonal adjustment procedures are not working satisfactorily, they said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Afghanistan, President Borhanoddin Rabbani's  government has submitted a two-point peace formula for the  restoration of durable peace in the country. The formula  provides for the ceasing forthwith of rocket attacks on Kabul,  honoring the cease-fire, and opening up all highways leading to  Kabul. It also proposes the setting up of an authoritative  nongovernmental commission to initiate work on the  Representative Council and Grand Assembly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has no  intention to negotiate with the illegitimate government in  Rwanda. The chairman of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe,  has been in Tanzania to explain the RPF position that what is  needed in Rwanda now is not negotiations and mediation, but  Rwanda needs material aid. Rwanda also needs to bring to  justice those who are responsible for the massacres that have  been taking place in Rwanda.    The RPF chairman said that Rwanda does not need another  Arusha peace agreement. The peace agreement was signed after 12  months of negotiations only to be derailed by the same people  who are now calling for negotiations with the RPF. These are  the members of the self-imposed government in Rwanda. [passage  omitted]    It's only yesterday that this government murdered 21 orphans  and three Red Cross workers who were taking care of the orphans  in Butare Prefecture. While they call for negotiations with the  RPF, members of the illegitimate government in Rwanda are  holding the entire nation hostage. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  0311 GMT on 10 January broadcasts a correspondent's report on  interviews with members of the new State Duma about what the  first day of the parliament's work will bring.    Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord [PRUA] says: "I believe that the first session will be  fairly quiet." He goes on to say: "Various commissions will be  set up. One must remember, however, that the new Constitution  does not give the control function to parliament. Therefore,  commissions will be involved in preparing parliamentary hearings  on various issues. This is the parliament's right, and I am sure  that there will be many commissions on parliamentary hearings.  I believe that the emergence of coalitions in the Duma will  depend on the nature of questions at issue. There will be no  organized coalitions in the Duma, with a unanimous vote. Is  that good or bad?    "Speaking about all of this, I would always urge one to  compare the present body of deputies, albeit very imperfect,  with the body of deputies of the Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet of the previous convocation. According to Vitaliy  Vorotnikov, formerly chairman of the Russian Federation Council  of Ministers, democrats had 22 percent of seats in that  parliament. Now they have more seats, though less than 50  percent. Therefore, we are moving forward despite everything."    Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist faction, is then  asked for his view of the work of the new State Duma. He says:  "The coordination is proceeding with difficulty. Burbulis  stated recently -- it is no secret -- that they are not too keen  on developing contacts with others, including us, but I believe  that they are doomed to seek agreement, unless they plan to give  new orders to disband the Duma by force. Not only has their  position no future, I believe, but in the context of the recent  changes in public opinion and in attitudes to their course, it  is also dangerous for everyone. One should understand very well  that we all have very little time for all this coordination  because there are already mass stoppages of production. At many  factories, people will only work 10-12 days at most in January,  and will receive a small allowance. By spring, they will have  eaten up their supplies, they will have worn out the shoes  bought back in the times of developed socialism, and they may  then behave in a way totally different from what some of our  radicals think."    In conclusion, an independent deputy is then asked for his  views. He says that the independents will push the interests of  their districts. There are many young people in the Duma who  are keen on working but not on squabbles. Viktor Sheynis of the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc says that the Duma will have two  main levers affecting the state policy: legislation and the  budget.</p>

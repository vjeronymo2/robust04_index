			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commissions for brokers falling THE amount of commissions paid to UK stockbrokers is continuing to fall, even though the commission rates they charge have stabilised in recent years, according to research published by the London Stock Exchange yesterday. The exchange's latest annual survey of the costs of share trading in the UK shows that far more trades are being carried out net (free of commission). Also, many involve part of the commission being refunded to the investor - known as 'soft commission' arrangements. Nearly a third of all trades by value do not involve the payment of any commissions at all, the exchange's research shows. That is up from around a quarter in 1991. Soft commissions, meanwhile, account for 12 per cent to 13 per cent of stock exchange turnover, according to industry estimates quoted in the research. Institutional investors are negotiating more actively to make sure they get keener prices when trading - eating into the profits of market-makers. About 55 per cent of trades worth more than Pounds 100,000 are conducted inside the 'touch', or quoted price, pointing to negotiation over the price. For overseas equity trades, 60 per cent more are done inside the touch. The average commission rate paid by institutions, meanwhile, was 0.24 per cent, down marginally from the 0.26 per cent in 1991 but close to the average level of around 0.25 per cent paid since 1988. The research, to be published next week in the exchange's quarterly review, shows that overseas investors and individuals have become less active traders since the end of 1980s. Overseas investors now account for 11 per cent of UK equity turnover, half what it was two years ago, while individual investors' share of trading has fallen from a high of 27 per cent in the 1980s to 14 per cent.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): A threat to life may mean a big pay-out - The Experts' Panel / But 'critical illness' policies, which are the subject of heavy promotion, are not all alike The consumer is being bombarded with new financial services products every day, writes Philip Coggan. All too often, it is easy to be overwhelmed by detail and confused about the true costs and benefits of the policies on offer. So the Quarterly Review is launching an Experts' Panel. In each issue, independent financial advisers will be asked to review a particular policy field, and to recommend two or three products which seem to be good value. CRITICAL ILLNESS, or 'dread disease', policies have been the subject of heavy sales promotion during the past year, but there are enormous differences between the various products on the market. In essence, these policies are a variant of life insurance. Pay-outs are made when a life-threatening illness is diagnosed, rather than upon death. Sometimes the policies have been sold on the basis that people would be able to enjoy a 'spending spree' in their final months. One of our experts, David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott, chartered accountants, declined to recommend any individual policies. He said: 'There is a danger of these policies being oversold by salesmen preying upon the fears and ignorance existing in the general public's mind concerning long-term illness and disease.' In some cases, he adds, 'other existing and more cost-effective contracts would prove more beneficial.' Mr Harris says that critical-illness insurance 'must be considered to be additional to, and not a substitute for, life assurance, permanent health and medical insurance.' 'My reservations concerning the current schemes available may be the reason behind the seemingly low sales figures many life assurance companies have experienced to date,' he says. 'Perhaps if these companies were to concern themselves slightly more with producing a range of benefits that truly met the needs of the marketplace - rather than an all-singing and dancing product, covering illness and disease that the majority of the public deem irrelevant to their needs - they would attract more customers.' Another adviser with reservations about these policies is James Higgins, of financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe. 'The various policies are constantly being altered,' he says, 'and I note that Abbey Life, which has had the most claims experience, has one of the most restrictive policies. 'The newer entrants to the market are somewhat bolder. Skandia Life and Prolific, for example, provide a 10-year guarantee before any review of terms. Their premiums are significantly lower, and the range of diseases covered is far wider,' he adds. 'In addition to the diseases covered by Abbey Life's policy, Skandia also covers multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, loss of limbs, loss of sight, terminal illness, and Aids by blood transfusion within the UK. 'At first glance, the Skandia plan appears to be head and shoulders above Abbey's. However, the bolt-ons are quite superficial in terms of the underwriting risk, and are really additional selling points - for example, the chances of catching Aids by blood transfusion in the UK are now negligible. 'To confuse matters even further, companies have different definitions of what constitutes a valid claim. In relation to heart disease, Prolific will pay out for surgery to correct disease of the aorta while Skandia and Abbey will not.' 'The best place to start is to identify precisely what cover you feel you need. A husband who is the working partner may require income replacement and lump-sum benefits in the event of incapacity and subsequent death. Women tend to be longer lived, and may prefer to invest in longer-term care policies which provide for nursing. 'It makes sense to review your existing policies, to see just what cover you already have in terms of income replacement, medical cover and standard life-assurance. It is by no means certain that a dread-disease policy will be appropriate. If it is, then the newer, more competitive policies might be more attractive. 'Finally, you should be aware that the sales commissions on dread disease policies are particularly high (up to 80-100 per cent of the first year's premium).' John Edwards, a former FT journalist and now at Kidsons Impey Financial Services, in Hereford, says: 'My first choice is the Lifeguard policy offered by Pegasus Assurance, one of the oldest established companies in the critical illness market. What I like about Pegasus is that the company is a specialist in critical-illness policies; it is not just an add-on product to boost flagging sales of other more popular forms of life assurance. 'As a result of being a specialist, the Lifeguard policy offers one of the most comprehensive range of options, and can be specially tailored to suit individual cases. It is very flexible. 'A nice touch is that children of policyholders are covered free of charge for awards of up to Pounds 10,000 if they contract a critical illness between the age of 21 days and 18 years. 'However, because of the wide range of benefits - some to cover illnesses which are fairly unlikely to occur - Pegasus tends to be a bit pricey, especially for younger people. This is an important factor, since the cost of critical illnesses is fairly steep because of the greater risks involved for the insurance company. 'So my alternative choice, and often my favoured recommendation, is Skandia's Lifetime plan. Skandia is one of the newest companies in the market, and it therefore provides protection for a wider range of illnesses and injuries than most.' 'As well as being price-competitive, Skandia claims to be the only company that will meet a disability claim if you are unable to continue your normal job or profession. 'Normal should be underlined. With most critical illnesses policies you have to be virtually crippled, and unable to work at all, before a disability claim will be met. This is a potential time-bomb, when people who have been paying out large premiums have their claims refused. 'Under the Lifetime policy, Skandia will pay a disability claim if you are disabled to the extent that you are unable to perform your normal occupation 'as disclosed in the application form'. You have to be very specific about what your normal employment involves. 'This is obviously a big selling point for Skandia. There is a greater chance of them having to meet a disability claim, so the underwriting of the Skandia policy is a good deal more restrictive. However, Skandia this month has introduced the option of not accepting the permanent disability cover, which broadens the range of people who can be covered, although it removes the main attraction of the policy. 'Pegasus has a much broader definition of the ability to work, although it claims to take 'status' into account. In the words of its salesman: 'We don't expect a brain surgeon to become a road sweeper.' Nevertheless, Pegasus is less likely to pay a disability claim than Skandia. 'The bulk of claims are for specified critical illnesses, like cancer, heart attack or a stroke, which should be met whether or not you have to give up work.' Angela Cooper and Anita White, of financial advisers Noble Lowndes, say: 'When assessing critical-illness contracts, we look closely at the breadth of cover, rather than concentrating on price, commission and charges. 'From our analysis, three companies have been identified as leaders in the critical illness market: Abbey Life, Allied Dunbar and Prolific. In general, these companies offer wider definitions for the critical illnesses. For example, Allied Dunbar and Prolific cover all five major organ transplants, whereas some companies will exclude at least two. 'Initially, it may appear that some diseases are excluded. For example, Prolific and Allied Dunbar pay out specifically on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, but Abbey Life would possibly cover this condition under their permanent-disability clause. 'Similarly, Prolific will cover paralysis of two or more limbs, which Allied Dunbar and Abbey Life may cover under their permanent disability clause. Prolific covers for 'loss of independent existence', which broadly means that the insured cannot function on a daily basis without assistance. This is an unusual feature at present, but likely to become more popular. 'When selecting a critical-illness policy, it is preferable that the contract fully covers, say, seven defined illnesses, rather than numerous illnesses that have a narrow definition. It is essential that definitions and terms for payment of any benefit are clearly understood.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER: MONTHLY PREMIUMS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Maximum          Standard                    cover (Pounds)  cover (Pounds)   Guarantee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prolific               67.94           122.29       10 years Skandia                63.24           125.35       10 years Abbey                  95.55           151.88        5 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Under maximum cover, a smaller proportion of the premium is invested.

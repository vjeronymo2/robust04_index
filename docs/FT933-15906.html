			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Row looms over proposed limit on trial by jury THE government last night appeared to be heading for confrontation with senior members of the judiciary and the legal profession after the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice recommended abolition of a defendant's right to trial by jury. This was the most controversial proposal among 352 recommendations for change in criminal justice made by the commission yesterday and seems certain to cause a political storm if accepted by the government. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, had argued strongly for the change to save costs by cutting down on the number of cases tried at crown courts. Most of the 30,000 defendants who elect to be tried by jury each year change their pleas to guilty at the crown court, resulting in wasted court time and resources. The Lord Chief Justice and other senior judges are opposed to abolition of a right which stretches back to Magna Carta. Lord Taylor is expected to re- affirm his opposition to the proposal when he addresses the annual Lord Mayor's dinner for judges tonight. Last night, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the recommendation was 'very controversial', adding that he would not 'rush into a snap judgment on it'. The proposed curb on jury trials, combined with recommendations for the introduction of discounts in sentences for early guilty pleas and a requirement on defendants to disclose their case to the prosecution before trial, seen as an attack on the right to silence, led lawyers to suggest the commission had been more concerned with efficiency than justice. But the commission, which was set up in March 1991 after a series of miscarriages of justice rocked public confidence in the criminal justice system, also made several recommendations to prevent further miscarriages of justice. These were broadly welcomed by the police and the legal profession. The commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, calls for: an independent review authority to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer cases back to the Court of Appeal; an independent forensic science advisory council to oversee standards; maintenance of a suspect's right to silence; introduction of continuous video recording of police custody suites and interrogations; judges in exceptional cases to order selection of a jury containing up to three people from ethnic minority communities; judges to warn juries of dangers of convicting on the basis of confession evidence alone, but no requirement for confessions to be supported by other evidence.

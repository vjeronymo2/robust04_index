			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: PIERCE COLLEGE;  </P> <P> CHILD-CARE FUNDING IS SLASHED  </P> <P> Cuts in child-care funding at Pierce College and the other eight Los Angeles  Community College District campuses are limiting the schools' ability to serve  student parents, college officials said.  </P> <P> Kathy Ryder, Child Development Center director at the Woodland Hills school,  said the cost of this year's program at Pierce, if run at its present capacity,  will be $312,835. However, she said she has only about $290,000.  </P> <P> Pierce's center has a capacity of 60 children. Because of state regulations  regarding teacher-child ratios, six full-time teachers are needed to operate  the center at that capacity from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., Ryder said.  </P> <P> However, the center currently has only four full-time teachers and one  part-time teacher. In addition, one of the full-time teachers, Norma Silverman,  plans to take maternity leave in the next couple of weeks and the Pierce  administration has thus far refused to hire a substitute.  </P> <P> "Unless we close a class, we will be illegal in some way," Ryder said.  </P> <P> Speakers from throughout the community college district attended a district  Board of Trustees meeting Oct. 3 at Pierce to voice their concerns about budget  cuts for the child-care centers.  </P> <P> Michael Simone of East Los Angeles College said the district allotment of $2.3  million is about $572,000 less than last year's expenditure. "The colleges have  been left holding the bag," he said. "This bag is empty."  </P> <P> "I would not have the opportunity to be a full-time student if it were not for  child care," said Barbara Kime, a 28-year-old single parent attending Pierce.  </P> <P> The speakers asked the board to adopt a set of guidelines that would, among  other things, assure that child-care centers with two classrooms have four  teachers and those with four classrooms have six.  </P> <P> Pierce, along with four other district schools, has a four-classroom center.  The other four schools have two-classroom centers. DAN DOW  </P></p>

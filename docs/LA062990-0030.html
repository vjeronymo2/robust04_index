			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Curtain Falls Again on 'A Chorus Line': Despite generally favorable reviews,  the revamped version of "A Chorus Line" that opened at the Las Palmas Theatre  in May will close July 8. Representatives of the production, which opened right  after the closing of the show in New York on Broadway, said that fitting the  musical into the 392-seat Hollywood theater was part of Michael Bennett's  vision of bringing the show back to a smaller venue.  </P> <P> "But that proved to be the downfall because of the size and scale of the  production," said spokesperson Kim Garfield. It became too expensive to run a  show with a 23-member cast, 10-piece orchestra and crew of 20. Garfield added  that the royalties for the musical are among the highest in history, and that  crowds had been decreasing since the first month. "We had hoped the show would  run forever," Garfield said. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

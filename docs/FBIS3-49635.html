			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 12 (AFP) -- UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali has promised that planned UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] actions in the Bosnian towns of Tuzla and  Srebrenica will proceed "as quickly as possible," French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday. "Mr. Butrus-Ghali assured  us that the planning required for these operations would take  place as quickly as possible," Juppe said.    The other countries contributing troops for these missions  --  Britain, Canada and Denmark -- would be in touch with the UN  secretary-general to this end, he added. The United Nations  Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia plans to reopen the airport at  Tuzla and to relieve the Canadian UNPROFOR contingent in  Srebrenica.    "It is not a matter of launching air raids against Tuzla or  Srebrenica," Juppe said. "It is a question of organizing the  rotation of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica and clearly  warning the belligerents that if they prevent UNPROFOR's freedom  of movement, they will be exposing themselves to our reaction."  In Tuzla, Juppe said the main point was not "conquering the  airport" but "saying that we are installing ourselves at this  airport to assure its operation."    "If anyone opposes this operation, there will be an  immediate  reaction from UNPROFOR and from its aerial coverage," he said.  [passage omitted]    In Sarajevo Wednesday, journalists accused UNPROFOR of  applying a double standard in Bosnia after UNPROFOR military  commander General Francis Briquemont condemned Bosnian  Government forces for shelling Bosnian Serb forces Tuesday.  General Briquemont said in a statement that artillery units of  President Alija Izetbegovic's army had opened fire on Serbian  positions around 10.00 a.m. (0900 GMT) Tuesday, ending two days  of calm around the capital. The journalists said, however, that  shells had fallen on Sarajevo several hours earlier and that no  protest had been issued against Serbian forces following that  attack.    International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official  Jessica Barry said that a shell had fallen on the Red Cross's  Bosnian headquarters at 9.15 a.m. (0815 GMT), killing one person  and injuring two ICRC employees. UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman  said that government forces had fired 200 shells against the  Bosnian Serbs, who responded by firing 600 shells at Sarajevo.  "That's a large number of shells fired by the Bosnian side,  which installed artillery pieces near civilian objectives in the  centre of Sarajevo," Aikman said. [passage omitted]</p>

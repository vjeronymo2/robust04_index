			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / 1991 Results Season: Chairmen play poopers at optimists' party - The market may be picking up, but companies remain gloomy WHILE THE stock market is bathing in the sunshine of an economic revival - real or supposed - the chairmen of many UK companies appear to be deep in gloom. Judging by statements in many of the company results announced recently, trading conditions are still difficult and there are few, if any, signs of an upturn. The best chairmen say is that their companies will be well placed when the recovery comes. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, the chemicals group, typified many such statements in his annual report. He said that 'there is little doubt that the coming months will continue to be difficult' and predicted the recovery would be gradual when it did arrive. The results season, for calendar year companies at least, is now drawing to a close. The actual numbers have produced few surprises, if only because analysts had already cut their forecasts with guidance from the companies themselves. What was more surprising was the relative lack of dividend cuts, which had been feared in advance of the season. Companies have been reluctant to cut dividends, even if they are not covered by earnings, perhaps hoping to keep share prices up, or in the expectation that a recovery in profits will come in time to cover the next pay-out. If the dividends have been a plus point for the stock market, the chairmen's statements have been a definite disappointment. There were hopes that chairmen could produce some evidence for a pick-up in demand, allowing market strategists to base a more bullish view on some harder evidence. Now interest will shift to chairmen's remarks at annual meetings for signs that the anecdotal evidence of a post-election pick-up in activity is working through to companies. Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, did little to bolster such hopes this week, saying that house repossessions were going to be higher than his company had earlier expected. As a result of the gloomy statements, there is already a movement to reduce earnings forecasts for the current year, if only because profits for the first half are likely to prove dull yet again. Forecasters are not expecting much of a rise in output this year - with estimates of a 0.8 per cent GDP increase for the year fairly typical - with the second quarter, perhaps, marking the turn from minus to plus. SG Warburg, the broker, for instance, had been going for a 17 per cent rise in earnings from industrial companies at the start of the year, but has cut that back to 14 per cent. With the stock market on an historic p/e of 16 - a high level - some strategists feel it cannot go much higher than the current level of 2,600 or so on the FT-SE 100 without better news on earnings. A more bullish view is offered by County NatWest, which is expecting the FT-SE 100 to reach 3,000 by the year-end, although it forecasts a rise in industrial earnings of 10-12 per cent, which would keep the market p/e at around 16. It argues that the p/e is always high just at the start of a recovery, and then growth in earnings brings the multiple down. The optimists suggest that analysts were not bearish enough when companies were moving into recession and will underestimate the recovery when it comes. The work many companies have done to cut costs will mean that even without a pick-up in demand, profits will improve this year. Productivity has risen as companies were quick to cut employee numbers. When there is an uplift in volume, operational gearing could mean a sharp jump in earnings, they argue. But Mr Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura, counters that 'it will take a long time for earnings to justify this level of the market'. He is bearish about the current post-election euphoria, which he calls 'tenuous, at best'. He says that a clear Conservative victory in the election would inevitably and rapidly lead to an economic recovery was over-optimistic. 'You could have Snow White and the seven dwarfs in Number 10 and they would not be able to magic away the problems.' Others also fear that the high level of real interest rates will continue to delay recovery. Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming Securities, the merchant bank's broking side, is forecasting no economic growth in 1992 because of high interest rates. While some headlines suggest that the current strength of sterling will mean interest rate cuts, many in the stock market are more sceptical, believing that base rates will stay above 10 per cent for most of the year. There is a concern that now the government has been re-elected it can continue its fight against inflation without fearing the electoral consequences of high interest rates. Another damper is the corporate sector's need to raise money. This is particularly true if a recovery does come. Finance is needed to increase working capital and to invest for the recovery, and the banks are still reluctant to lend. So far this year there have been relatively few rights issues, although more companies have tapped the long-term debt markets. But more rights issues are expected. Adding those to new issues and a higher demand for funding by the government, much of the institutions' cashflow is already spoken for. 'I cannot reconcile what needs to happen to balance sheets with a rising equity market,' says Mr Warburton. There is agreement, though, that the recovery when it comes will be led by consumers. The late-cycle sectors like chemicals and building companies will have to wait until 1993 for much prospect of recovery. One of the few chairmen to speak optimistically when reporting profits was Sir Ian MacLaurin, head of Tesco, the supermarket group. He said last autumn had seen the low point for his business and that 'recession is moving away'. A similar story can be seen in the responses to the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. However, March was a dull month for retailers - put down to the calling of the election and the comparison with a good month last year. It's hoped The hope is that April will produce a better figure, with brisk Easter trading after the election. While some argue that there is pent-up consumer demand and that real wages are rising, others say that with house prices still falling - even if activity in the market is picking up - consumers' confidence is still fragile. Recovery needs confidence and the hope is that the defeat of Labour and its tax plans - although not making consumers better off in fact - will at least make them feel they are.</p>

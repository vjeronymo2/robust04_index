			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament has approved two bills providing for  deterrent punishment to hijackers. The Lok Sabha adopted the  bills yesterday which were approved by the Rajya Sabha earlier.  The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, said the new  legislation provides for the setting up of designated courts for  speedy trial of hijacking and other related offences. Bail will  not be granted without hearing the prosecution. Another salient  feature is that the burden of proof will be that of the accused  in cases where arms and explosives used for hijacking are  recovered. The center can now delegate the investigative powers  to any of its agencies instead of the local police.    The Lok Sabha has also passed the Human Organs  Transplantation Bill seeking to regulate removal and  transplantation of human organs. Already passed by the Rajya  Sabha, the bill received support from all sections of the house  and was adopted with certain official amendments in line with  some of the recommendations of the select committee of the  house. Replying to the debate, the deputy minister for health,  Mr. Pawan Singh Ghatewal, said with the passage of the bill  other states would follow suit to enact their own laws. He said  such provisions are now available in the states of Maharashtra,  Goa, and Himachal Pradesh. Participating in the discussion,  members welcomed the measure but cautioned the government to  ensure that the provisions of the bill should not be misused by  unscrupulous elements for illegal trading in human organs.    The house also passed the New Delhi Municipal Council Bill  yesterday along with some amendments. The proposed council will  have 11 members besides a chairperson. The council includes  three MLAs [Members of Legislative Assembly] and the MP  representing the New Delhi area.    Later, the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die. The house sat  late last night to pass six bills. The special session which  was summoned to consider the electoral reform bills ended ahead  of schedule as the government did not introduce the Constitution  Amendment Bill regarding electoral reforms.</p>

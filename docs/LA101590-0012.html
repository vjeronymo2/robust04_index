			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY SPECIAL TO PASQUALE BUT ALSO HURTS  </P> <P> He was like a heavyweight boxer who had been forced to defend his title by  knocking his former sparring partner senseless.  </P> <P> It was business, bloody business, and while all around him they crowded with  congratulations after the Chargers' 39-3 victory over the Jets, misty-eyed  Larry Pasquale was in no mood to celebrate.  </P> <P> "It hurts to see the guys go down like that," he said. "I love those Jets  players as if they were my sons. They were loyal to me."  </P> <P> Pasquale, the Chargers' special teams coordinator, was with the Jets from 1980  to 1989 before being released along with Coach Joe Walton.  </P> <P> Enlisted immediately by General Manager Bobby Beathard, Pasquale has helped the  Charger special teams earn respect after a disastrous year under Joe Madden.  </P> <P> While with the Jets, Pasquale was a favorite of both the players and the media,  and as he walked off the field Sunday, he was surrounded by admirers.  </P> <P> "I'm happy for our team that we won," Pasquale said, his voice cracking, "but I  feel for those other guys. I feel for (Kyle) Clifton, and (Jeff) Lageman, and  (Joe) Prokop, and (John) Booty, and (Erik) McMillan. I love them. They got  great character.  </P> <P> "But I'm also happy for the Chargers, because they deserved to win today. They  played hard, and they tried to do all the things right. Hopefully we can have  the Chargers' special teams do what the Jets' special teams have done in the  past. That's what we're working toward."  </P> <P> While with the Jets, Pasquale's special teams had the best punt coverage  statistics in the NFL from 1986-1988. But Sunday, it was the Charger coverage  team that hogged the spotlight.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, the Jet punter, Prokop, could not cleanly field a low  snap from center, and the Chargers fell on the ball at the New York 19. They  were eventually stopped at the goal line, but the Jets would not be so  fortunate on Prokop's next attempt.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, Prokop accepted the snap from center in his own end zone  and looked like a kindergarten teacher surrounded during recess. Had he  attempted to kick the ball, he might now be in a full body cast.  </P> <P> Prokop took off running and was tackled at the five. On the following play,  running back Marion Butts ran the ball in for a Charger touchdown.  </P> <P> "It was bad," said Foge Fazio, the man hired by the Jets to replace Pasquale.  "It was embarrassing. It's never happened to me before."  </P> <P> How good/bad day was it for the Chargers/Jets? For only the third time in  Charger history, the team did not have to punt.  </P> <P> "You know the speed of guys, you know the physical abilities of the guys,"  Pasquale said, "so there's no question I could stand in our meetings and speak  from certainty as to what the Jets might or might not be able to do.  </P> <P> "That's a tremendous help to our guys. But my God, I can't take anything away  from the Charger players. They stuck to the plan better than we have done all  year."  </P> <P> As if the Jets needed any further reminder of Pasquale's handiwork, running  back Darrin Nelson returned a Prokop punt 33 yards to the New York three. The  Chargers didn't score, but for the booing fans, it didn't matter.  </P> <P> "Our players were totally focused on doing the job today, and I think we're  coming together as a team," Pasquale said. "I think our special teams guys are  getting a feel for one another, just like the Jet players had a feeling for one  another."  </P></p>

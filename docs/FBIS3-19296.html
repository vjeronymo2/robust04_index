In his statement from NATO headquarters here, Supreme Allied  Commander General George Joulwan gave no details as to when the  handover would take place.    The commander in chief of the southern European sector of  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's forces is responsible for  the alliance's operations in former Yugoslavia.    These include Operation Deny Flight, which enforces the  no-fly zone over Bosnia, and the seaborne Operation Sharp Guard,  carried out in conjunction with forces of the Western European  Union to ensure the embargo is not violated from the Adriatic.    Boorda was named Monday by President Bill Clinton as  commander in chief of the U.S. Navy. Smith is currently  Washington's deputy chief of naval operations.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Russian state revenue to fall short by half The desperately strained condition of the Russian budget was revealed yesterday by Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, who said government revenue this year would amount to only Rbs64,000bn. This is a little over half the planned figure of Rbs124,500bn and a third of planned expenditure of Rbs194,500bn. Mr Alexashenko, who with Mr Sergei Dubynin, the acting finance minister, occupies the hottest seat in the Russian government, said the number of 'dissatisfied' people would be large but that 'the government and within it the Ministry of Finance intend to adhere strictly to our chosen line - of restricting inflation and achieving macroeconomic stability'. He appealed to the parliament to pass the budget for 1995 - which has not yet been presented to the parliamentary leadership - and said it should not waste time attempting to revise the 1994 budget, in spite of cuts the government has made in its spending. Some opposition leaders have threatened to try to overthrow the government by blocking next year's budget, which aims for a monthly inflation rate of 3 per cent, while some ministers in the cabinet have argued for extra expenditure. Forecasts produced by the Finance Ministry show that industrial output is expected to be 20 per cent down by the end of this year on 1993 levels - one of the main reasons for the inability of the state to gather taxes. The other key reason is the more rapid fall in inflation, to 4 per cent last month, although Mr Alexashenko expected it to rise to 6-7 per cent this month. In a speech in the town of Krasnogorsk yesterday, Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, said the government expected the production slump to slow; he blamed its steepness on deep cuts in military expenditure. He said expenditure in the defence sector had been reduced by 70 per cent in the past two and a half years, while general investment in the economy had been reduced by 65 per cent in the same period. One of the casualties of the budget cuts this year has been the military, whose allocation of Rbs40,600bn was reduced to Rbs32,000bn. The daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper reported yesterday that General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, is to appeal for more funds, basing his case on the incident earlier this week in which Moscow's main early warning nuclear facility suffered a cut in electricity because it had not paid its bills. The arrears in back pay in many sectors would, said Mr Alexander Smirnov, head of the Finance Ministry's treasury department, be addressed by the allocation of Rbs1,000bn to a wages fund before the end of the year.</p>

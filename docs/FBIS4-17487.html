			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev called to drop the threat of NATO air strikes on  Bosnia, especially of the massive ones which can make "the  conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside  Bosnia-Herzegovina".    "In the military sphere NATO air strikes did not bring any  results and will not bring them at present", he told a press  conference on Monday.    The minister believes the major way to settle the conflict  is  to hold in the near future a meeting of the leaders of Russia,  the United States, EU countries and the UN. The summit,  according to Grachev, can be held in any European state and  should involve also the political leadership of the whole of the  former Yugoslavia.    Grachev urged to strengthen the peace-keeping forces in  Gorazde and to avert bloodshed in the city itself. He informed  that a 19-men strong Russian platoon will be transferred to  Gorazde. The minister said it is also necessary to promote  normal humanitarian provision for the population there.    Grachev is categorically against the withdrawal of Russian  peace-keepers from Bosnia. "This would be an untimely and  inappropriate decision fraught with a further political  isolation of Russia in the world community. It is possible to  pull out Russian forces from the region only after the  settlement is reached by political means", he said.    The Russian minister believes it is not only Serbs who are  to  blame for the current crisis in Bosnia. Both conflicting sides  are to blame, according to him.</p>

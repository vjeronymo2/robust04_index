			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Rabin ready for Golan concessions to achieve peace MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday said he was ready for territorial compromise in exchange for peace with Syria, the clearest indication to date that he would make significant concessions on the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and later virtually annexed by Israel. Mr Rabin was careful not to go beyond a general commitment, which fell far short of the complete withdrawal from the Golan demanded by Syria. He also stressed that territorial concessions would only be discussed once Syria committed itself to the principle of a full peace treaty with Israel. 'We have said that in exchange for a peace treaty which promises an end to war and opens the borders between Syria and Israel, diplomatic relations and normalisation, Israel is ready to implement (UN Resolutions) 242 and 338 . . . This implies, of course, some sort of territorial compromise,' Mr Rabin said. Since the Washington talks broke for a 10-day recess earlier this month, Mr Rabin has spoken almost daily of what he calls 'important progress' made in the last round with Damascus. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, called it 'nearly sensational'. As if to prepare public opinion for Israeli concessions, Mr Rabin has warned that 'peace for peace' would be impossible to achieve. He says he is willing to consider interim steps if a full peace treaty is not immediately available. Israeli hopes of a breakthrough have been prompted by a document presented by Syria in Washington, which Israeli officials said expressed for the first time in writing Syria's willingness to make peace, and acknowledged Israel's security concerns. One possibility being canvassed in Jerusalem is that Syria might accept a period of continued Israeli control in most of the Golan in exchange for a formal acknowledgment of Syria's sovereignty over the strategic range of hills. This would allow Jewish settlers on the heights - increasingly concerned for their future - to stay at least for some time. However, Damascus has given little indication so far that it will settle for anything less than a complete return of the heights. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, reiterated yesterday that his country would make no territorial compromise with Israel on the occupied Golan Heights. He said the implication of some sort of territorial compromise was 'completely unacceptable and contradicts the substance and the spirit of the peace talks . . . that aim for a full withdrawal.'</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Poland cracks down on TV Polish police yesterday closed down six unlicensed television stations belonging to a chain controlled by Mr Nicola Grauso, a media owner from Sardinia. The crackdown on the stations in six cities including Warsaw - which had been broadcasting on frequencies reserved for the military - came after Mr Grauso failed to get either a national or regional broadcast licence in allocations earlier this year. The Polonia 1 network of 12 regional TV stations had continued to broadcast a popular diet of soap operas and films in defiance of broadcast legislation passed last year. A justice ministry official said police closed those stations broadcasting on frequencies reserved for the military, but stressed that the others would also be shut down shortly. 'Police officers and prosecutors visited the illegal stations, ordering that they be closed. . . and in cases of no compliance they turned the equipment off themselves,' the official said. Mr Grauso also owns the Zycie Warszawy daily newspaper and says he has invested in excess of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) in Poland. The network claims a 30 per cent share of the audience and is favoured by President Lech Walesa, who sees it as a potential ally in his second-term presidential campaign due late next year. The president has made no secret of his opposition to Polsat, the Polish-owned station which has been granted the country's only national commercial TV licence. This decision is being contested in the courts by rivals seeking a licence.</p>

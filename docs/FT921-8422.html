			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics in Brief: Welcome for new EC deal with Efta BRITAIN'S financial-services sector should be one of the main beneficiaries from the new agreement between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association (Efta), Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, told the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. He envisaged that the agreement would lead to 'significant economic gains' for British industry and for British consumers. Mr Sainsbury said there would be free movement of capital, services, goods and people in the single market. There would be a mutual recognition of professional qualifications, covering accountants as well as other specialists, throughout the area. Welcoming the agreement from the Opposition front bench, Ms Joyce Quin emphasised that the parties to the new agreement should seek to promote world trade as a whole and seek to dispel ideas of a 'fortress Europe'. She hoped that the agreement would be used to strengthen economically deprived regions in Britain and other countries. Mr Kenneth Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the cross-party trade and industry select committee, urged the European parliament not to look for ways of obstructing the agreement. ***** PROPERTY THEFTS: Mr John MacGregor, lord president of the council, said yesterday there had been a considerable reduction since Christmas in the number of reported thefts of MPs' property. Responding to a question from Ms Alice Mahon, the Labour MP for Halifax, he said he had not discussed the thefts with the security services but had seen no evidence to support recent allegations. Ms Mahon asked whether Mr MacGregor was satisfied the security services were not trying to smear Opposition MPs. ***** HUNG PARLIAMENT: Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday that Labour or the Tories should try to form a coalition government with minority parties in the event of a hung parliament, rather than making a 'fast dash' to a second contest.</p>

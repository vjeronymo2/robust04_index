			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BID FOR ANTENNA SPARKS A CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission says local governments cannot prevent  amateur radio operators from having antennas of "reasonable" height. The  commission notes the public safety role that ham operators sometimes play, and  says their right to free speech is also involved.  </P> <P> But the commission has never defined reasonable, and what is reasonable in a  hilly Rancho Palos Verdes neighborhood near Peninsula Center has become a  matter of bitter disagreement.  </P> <P> Aerospace engineer Walter F. Ordway, a member of the Palos Verdes Amateur Radio  Club who is active in the city's emergency communications network, contends  that he needs an 85-foot antenna tower for his ham radio operations.  </P> <P> But some of his neighbors and few hundred others in the city who have signed  petitions opposing it assert that the antenna would be an eyesore, a hazard if  it blew down and a precedent that could open the door for big antennas  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It's too high and will interfere with our view," said Lucian S. Rochte, a  retired Air Force colonel who lives behind Ordway's Grayslake Avenue home.  "This is a high-density residential area with small lots. . . . The distances  are so short. I'd be 75 feet away."  </P> <P> In October, after residents protested the city staff's approval of the tower,  the city Planning Commission, in response to concerns about it obstructing the  view, required that the device be lowered to 23 feet when not in use.  </P> <P> But last week, after a 3 1/2-hour public hearing in a meeting room packed with  protesting residents, the City Council put off a decision on the tower until  Feb. 7 and asked Ordway to provide more justification for the tower.  </P> <P> "He's got to make a case for it," said Mayor Jacki Bacharach.  </P> <P> Ordway said after the council session that he needs a pole of at least 70 feet  for clear radio reception. A city ordinance requires permits and justification  for any radio tower higher than 40 feet.  </P> <P> "The issue is his need for an antenna of this height versus neighborhood  concerns," said Robert Benard, city environmental services director.  </P> <P> The antenna controversy has resulted in vandalism to the Ordway home and the  theft of two ham radios from Ordway's van, according to his wife, Joanne, and  neighbors.  </P> <P> Joanne Ordway said the home was pelted with eggs four or five times, and that  last Thanksgiving, wet newspapers were spread over the front lawn. "There were  two trash barrels full," she said. The culprits were never identified, she  said.  </P> <P> "This has created a situation that we have not experienced during my time in  the neighborhood, and I've been here 25 years," said George W. Kacirek, a  retired Mobil Oil marketing manager who opposes the erection of the antenna.  "I've never seen a group of people as irate."  </P> <P> But the Ordways have some neighbors on their side too.  </P> <P> "I wonder what all the uproar is about," said Carol McLennas, who lives across  the street. "They want one single vertical tower to put an antenna on and it  will be lowered to 23 feet. There are plenty of trees in everybody's yard  taller than that."  </P> <P> She said youthful radio enthusiasts come to the Ordway home to learn about the  hobby. "It's good to get the kids involved in that, rather than drugs and  alcohol."  </P> <P> Some critics assert that the city is overemphasizing Ordway's free-speech  rights at the expense of neighborhood quality because three officials involved  in the decision -- Planning Commissioner Peter Von Hagen and Councilmen Melvin  Hughes and John McTaggart -- are members of the same amateur radio club that  Ordway belongs to.  </P> <P> Russell Harrison, another Ordway neighbor who fears that the antenna will  reduce the value of his $600,000 home, has asked Hughes and McTaggart to  disqualify themselves from council consideration of the issue. He contends that  the club "will use this antenna" -- Joanne Ordway denies that -- and has  something to gain from approval.  </P> <P> "They can't be objective," Rochte said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Conflict'  </P> <P> Hughes disagrees. "There is no conflict of interest," he said. "I am a ham  radio operator, but this does not mean I won't make a decision that weighs all  the issues fairly. I hold a driver's license, but I should not disqualify  myself from issues related to highway safety, parking or street construction."  </P> <P> He called the pending decision a "balancing act" between "allowing all  reasonable communication" and responding to community concerns.  </P> <P>  Community Correspondent Ann Johnson contributed to this article.  </P></p>

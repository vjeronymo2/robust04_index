			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique from the Guatemalan Government Ministry and the </F> National Police on the murder of Constitutionality Court  President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon; issued in Guatemala City  on 3 April -- read by announcer]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On 1 April 1994, in a failed  vehicle robbery attempt, Mr. Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon,  president of Guatemala's Constitutionality Court, was murdered  in the presence of his wife and youngest son. [passage omitted]    Because we live in a democracy, and because Mr. Gonzalez  Dubon's activities were transparent, he readily refused to be  escorted by security guards which, unfortunately, proved to be  an advantage to the criminals.

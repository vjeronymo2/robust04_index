			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Uncertainty behind BPB dividend cut BPB Industries, the UK's largest plasterboard manufacturer, yesterday cut its interim dividend in spite of declaring that prices were again rising after a five-year price war. Mr Alan Turner, chairman, said there was unprecedented uncertainty over the short-term outlook for business prospects and the company could not continue to pay an uncovered dividend. Interim pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 24m to Pounds 27.5m on sales up 6 per cent at Pounds 544.7m. Earnings per share fell from 3.9p to 3.7p and the interim dividend is cut from 4p to 2.7p. BPB's shares fell 18p to 172p. The reduced dividend would re-base the annual payment at a level from which a progressive dividend policy could be resumed, Mr Turner said. Mr John Maxwell, chief executive, said that after five years of falling plasterboard prices, there was now growing evidence of 'sustained pricing recovery' and that increases in France, the UK and Germany were sticking. BPB's operating profit margins have fallen to about half the levels prevailing before the price war began with Lafarge Coppee of France and Krauf of Germany five years ago. BPB had answered certain questions from the Office of Fair Trading after the Federation of Master Builders complained about the price rises in the summer. The company was not expecting to hear any more from the OFT. Gearing in the period rose from 36 per cent to 38 per cent on total borrowings of Pounds 264m. The building materials division, which includes plaster board and plaster, enjoyed a sharp increase in margins with operating profit rising 31 per cent to Pounds 37m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 464.9m. On the paper and packaging side, despite a volume increase, profits were 41 per cent lower at Pounds 6m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 79.8m, because of price erosion and lower profit margins. Mr Turner said that plasterboard remained one of the few building materials for which there was still significant growth potential in Europe and Canada even without economic recovery. BPB had only benefited from the French price increase during the first half; the other price rises would feed through in the current half. See Lex</p>

The semiconductor industry has become one of the leading  players in the economy's upward movement, thanks to the  expanding world chip market and the competitive edge of Korean  chips in quality and price over their rivals on the world market.    A semiconductor department official at Samsung Electronics  Co. said, "the state of meeting 80 percent to 90 percent of our  orders is continuing into this year. Our exports in January are  likely to exceed the year-on-year rise of 80 percent we recorded  a year earlier because exports in January last year were not  very brisk."    The automobile industry is also enjoying brisk business.    A Hyundai motor official said his company's exports and  domestic sales in January should increase 50 percent and 15  percent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, though January  and February are usually the off-season for the car industry.    "We expect domestic sales in January to increase 25 percent  from a year earlier, and I think exports will start increasing  sharply in March though they were slow in January," said Kang  Yong-ho, a Daewoo Motor board member.    The improving electronics and automobile industries are  pulling up the steel industry, as they are major users of steel.    Yi Ku-taek, executive director of Pohang Iron and Steel Co.,  was happy about the improvement: "Business started improving in  January, and we expect sales of steel plates and sheets to  increase more than nine percent this year."    The consumer electronics industry anticipates that it will  achieve growth of 10 pecent to 15 percent in the coming year.    "The strong yen and the resulting hardships facing Japanese  firms, the U.S. market's recovery, labor peace, low oil prices  and the stabilized exchange rate of the won against major  foreign currencies will push up exports of consumer electronics  goods more than 20 percent in 1994," Yi Pyong-song, a board  member of Goldstar Co., predicted.    Seoul's department stores, which ran a 10-day sale last  month, expect to record sales growth of more than 30 percent in  January. With the lunar new year season coming in the second  week of February and the spring fashion sales in March, they  anticipate no recession in 1994. The situation is just the  opposite, however, in the traditonal marketplaces. Although  lunar new year's day is only 10 days away, Namdaemun Market  merchants are complaining that they alone remain mired in  recession.    A dealer in children's clothes said, "my sales these days  are  less than half of what I sold a year ago."    The shipbuilding industry, which enjoyed a big boom last  year, is not very optimistic about its prospects for the coming  year. The industry has enough orders to keep it busy until the  end of next year but the Japanese, who are striving to recapture  their place as the world's top shipbuilders, pose a formidable  challenge. Moreover, the cargo shipping industry shows few signs  of expansion or a business upturn.    Kim Yon-sin, planning officer of Daewoo Shipbuilding and  Heavy Machinery, said, "we can hardly expect as good a business  in the new year as we enjoyed last year. One of the reasons is  that shipyards' excessive competition for expansion makes  shipping firms put off placing orders for new ships until the  race is over."</p>

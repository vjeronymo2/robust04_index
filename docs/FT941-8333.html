			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Romania acts against pyramid craze: Branch closure hinders efforts to keep money pouring in to controversial scheme The Romanian authorities have taken public measures against Caritas, the money-spinning pyramid scheme, for the first time in its 22-month existence. The scheme's branch at Snagov, outside Bucharest, was open for just eight days before local authorities found a reason to close it last week. Caritas, which at its peak last year attracted some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) in deposits from a total of 4m Romanians, did not have a legal lease on its premises, they said. The move foils a bid by Mr Ion Stoica, the head of Caritas, to keep money coming into the scheme by opening new branches around the country. Mr Stoica was forced to move further afield after investor confidence in the Transylvanian town of Cluj, where he founded his 'society for mutual help', evaporated when the scheme stopped making regular payments in the autumn. Since then only a handful of the hundreds of thousands who were promised a seven-fold return on their money in three months have received their 'winnings'. Many have been left penniless after investing their life's savings in the scheme in the hope of protecting themselves against annual inflation of 300 per cent and rising poverty. Mr Stoica, on the other hand, is believed to have collected Dollars 100m in commissions alone. Press reports of poverty-stricken investors and warnings from President Ion Iliescu have not been enough to kill off the Caritas craze. Thousands of naive and desperate Romanians have continued to put cash into new branches or in the many other similar schemes which have sprung up in its wake. At Snagov, some 5,600 investors sank the equivalent of Dollars 840,000 into the Caritas branch within just four days of its opening, according to company ledgers examined by financial police. Many said depositing early would increase their chance of winning. 'I was one of the first in Cluj and I won 500,000 lei (Pounds 231),' one factory worker said. 'That's why I'm here again at the beginning.' Others had lost money in Cluj but, spurred on by Mr Stoica's promise to relaunch the scheme in Bucharest, now hoped to become winners. Mr Stoica's promise was relayed to the country in a half-hour interview on state-controlled television aired at prime time which would have cost Dollars 20,000 if run as a commercial. Free advertising time is just one of the many favours Mr Stoica has enjoyed on the way to amassing his fortune. In Cluj, Caritas enjoyed the patronage of the mayor, Mr Gheorghe Funar, who is also president of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party. Caritas, which was given offices in the town's sports stadium, boomed after Mr Funar endorsed it alongside Mr Stoica on television and at rallies. 'Donations' from the scheme paid for the mayor's grandiose public works schemes. Mr Funar's party is now negotiating with the ruling party to form a new governing coalition. In recent weeks, local authorities in other towns have closed down smaller rival pyramid schemes and arrested organisers on grounds of fraud and embezzlement. But Mr Stoica, who says he has a list of MPs and other senior officials who have profited from Caritas, remains free.</p>

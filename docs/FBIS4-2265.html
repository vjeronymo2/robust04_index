Last  year, the whole province conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; implemented in an  in-depth manner the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; further emancipated the minds; sought truth from  facts; seized each and every excellent opportunity to quicken  the pace of development; and maintained rapid and vigorous  national economic growth with the result that the province's  total GNP exceeded 68 billion yuan, up 15.8 percent on the  previous year, while the province's total industrial and  agricultural output value reached 122.1 billion yuan, up by 27.5  percent, and total financial revenue 6.56 billion yuan, up by  30.8 percent. Despite serious natural calamities, the province  still reaped a good agricultural harvest with the total grain  output reaching 30.34 billion jin.    Wu Guanzheng went on: Last year, Jiangxi also successfully  and comprehensively improved economic efficiency with the result  that the total amount of profits and taxes realized by budgetary  industrial enterprises registered a 46 percent increase. The  province's total social commodity retail volume reached 27.9  billion yuan, up by 21.2 percent. The subsistence income of the  province's urban residents rose by 26 percent while the per  capita net income of the province's peasants went up by 13.3  percent. In 1993, Jiangxi absorbed a total of $1 billion in  foreign funds and actually used $343 million of foreign funds.  Moreover, Jiangxi also successfully kept the natural population  growth rate within its planned limit.    Reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Wu  Guanzheng maintained: This year, we should try to handle  relations between reform and development correctly on the one  hand and stability on the other; seize each and every excellent  opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push forward  development, and maintain stability; work in a down-to-earth  manner; promote industrial development on the basis of  agricultural development; and lay a solid foundation for  Jiangxi's future development. This year is a crucial one for  deepening reform aimed at building a socialist market economic  structure and an important year for concentrating on building  basic facilities and pushing the province's economic growth onto  a new stage at a faster pace. On the premise of improving  economic efficiency, readjusting economic structure, and  quickening construction pace, we should strive to keep Jiangxi's  economic growth rate at a level higher than the country's  average. We should strive to attain the following national  economic and social development tasks in 1994:    1. Increase the province's GNP by 12 to 14 percent.    2. Increase the province's total industrial and  agricultural output value by 18 percent, of which total  agricultural output value is to be increased by 5 percent and  total industrial output value by 23 percent.    3. Increase the province's financial revenue by 12 to 14  percent.    4. Increase per capita net income of the province's  peasants by 100 to 130 yuan.    5. Keep the province's natural population growth rate  within limits set by the state.    In order to attain these goals, Wu Guanzheng stated, first  and foremost, we should conscientiously implement "The CPC  Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" and waste no time in  pushing ahead with reform; second, we should strive to improve  the productive forces layout and concentrate on successfully  building such basic facilities as electrical energy,  communications, telecommunications, water conservancy, and so  on; third, we should strive to quicken both the pace of economic  exploitation and the pace of inviting foreign funds and  expanding opening up; fourth, we should strive to develop, more  successfully and more rapidly, a high-yield, high-efficiency,  and high-quality agriculture, township and town enterprises, and  large and medium state-owned enterprises with an eye to bringing  about rapid and highly efficient industrial growth; sixth, we  should strive to carry out in-depth circulation system reform,  open up more markets, invigorate circulation, and build a new  market circulation system as well as a new market management  system; seventh, we should strive to actively integrate science  and technology into the economy and train a strong contingent of  qualified personnel with a view to infusing the provincial  economy with new vitality; and eighth, we should try to step up  building spiritual civilization under the conditions of a  socialist market economic structure and strive to create a  favorable environment for reform, opening up, and economic  construction.    Wu Guanzheng concluded by stating: The work we are doing at  the moment is aimed at promoting economic growth, improving  people's livelihood, and pushing ahead with Jiangxi's  comprehensive development. We should arm our minds with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; adhere to the party's basic line; unite as one;  enhance cooperation; focus more on furthering in-depth reform;  push ahead with economic construction; and make greater  contributions to Jiangxi's overall development under the  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the core!    More than 100 people attended this morning's meeting as  nonvoting delegates. [passage omitted]</p>

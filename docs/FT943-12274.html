			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Search begins for cause of blaze at Texaco refinery Investigators will today move into the stricken Texaco refinery at the Welsh port of Milford Haven to ascertain the cause and extent of the 36-hour blaze which forced the plant to close. The main fire was extinguished last night, and two smaller fires were being allowed to burn themselves out. But investigators had to wait for temperatures to cool before they could approach. There were no serious injuries from the fire, though the explosion which caused it on Sunday damaged nearby buildings and caused some minor injuries to Texaco staff. The fire was centred on the catalytic cracker, a key part of the process for making petrol at the refinery. Texaco said last night it hoped to have a preliminary indication of the extent of the damage done to the plant by late this afternoon. The fire is thought to have been caused by a lightning strike. The US oil company said the damage would have no immediate effect on its ability to supply its network of service stations in the UK or its contracted commercial customers. It also said that it would be able to maintain product quality. News of the blaze caused a small rise in the price of petrol in the wholesale market yesterday morning. According to Platts, the information service which monitors trade in petroleum products, petrol rose about Dollars 5 a tonne to Dollars 190. But generally, petrol companies doubted that the closure of the refinery, which accounts for about 10 per cent of UK refining capacity, would have significant repercussions, even though the blaze has struck at the height of the summer motoring season. There is a 5-10 per cent capacity surplus in the UK, and all the leading petrol companies have product exchange arrangements to deal with shortages. The UK is also a large petrol exporter, and supplies could be diverted back on to the domestic market if need be. Alternatively, imports could be brought in from the Continent where stocks are plentiful. 'We don't expect there to be any significant effects on supplies,' said a spokesman for Shell, the UK's largest petrol retailer. Texaco is a large supplier to supermarkets who have recently begun to attack the petrol market. However, Tesco said last night that Texaco was only one of many suppliers. 'We don't anticipate any problems in supply, and we still aim to be the cheapest in any given area,' a spokeswoman said.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): How Daf rose again from the ashes - The new image of the Dutch truck maker, back in business after a spell in receivership Most of the constituent parts of the old Daf group are back in business despite the collapse into receivership of the former Dutch truck maker in early 1993. The ownership and financing structure of the new companies are radically different, and more than half of the jobs in the old group have been eliminated, but to the customer at least the new federation of Daf companies is seeking to present an unchanged image. The product range - one of the most modern in Europe and sold under the Daf name in continental Europe and Leyland Daf in the UK - is little changed, and the group has sought to hold on to the core of its European dealer network. The old Daf group filed for protection from its creditors in the Netherlands on February 2 with total debts of more than Fl 3bn, while Leyland Daf, its UK subsidiary, went into administrative receivership in the UK a day later. Daf was brought down by the severity of the recession in the UK, its main market, by doubtful financing operations and by an over-ambitious product development programme. Lacking the sales volumes - and the financial resources - of its bigger competitors, Daf still tried to match its rivals in the breadth of its product offering. As a result, it spread its resources too thinly. It suffered total accumulated net losses in the three years from 1990 to 1992 of Fl 880m, before any account was taken of an envisaged restructuring charge of Fl 700m for 1992 chiefly to finance the closure of its UK van operations. As its problems deepened, Daf had already cut its workforce by more than a quarter from 16,782 in 1989 to 12,289 in 1992 including 5,401 in the UK, 4,906 in the Netherlands, 1,461 in Belgium and 521 in the rest of the world. The various companies that have been formed out of receivership now employ around 6,200, including some 2,700 jobs in the UK. The core Daf heavy and medium-weight truck operations based in the Netherlands and Belgium have re-emerged under the ownership of the newly-formed Daf Trucks, with majority state ownership by the Dutch and Flemish governments. In the UK Daf Trucks has also taken over the sales and marketing arm of the former Leyland Daf operations in order to secure control of its distribution and dealer network in the UK. The remainder of the UK operations has been rescued by a series of management buy-outs in the case of the former Leyland Daf van and truck operations, and management buy-ins for the parts operations and the components businesses in Glasgow (Albion) and Leyland. The crucial first step in restoring the viability of the former Daf group was the rescue of the Dutch and Belgian operations. The newly formed Daf Trucks has an equity capital of Fl 385m, of which the Dutch and Flemish governments have subscribed Fl 209m, with Fl 75m coming from a group of banks, Fl 80m from institutional investors and Fl 21m from private investors, including some components suppliers, dealers and importers. Including subordinated loans, Daf Trucks has a total risk-bearing capital of some Fl 450m. A group of banks including ABN-Amro, Rabo Bank and Credit Lyonnais have provided credit facilities of more than Fl 500m. Daf Trucks has managed to hold on to a share of around 7 per cent of the west European heavy truck market above 15 tonnes, and Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the management board of Daf Trucks - as he was of the old Daf group - maintains that the dealer network has remained largely intact. It now has a network of some 250 main dealers and around 750 sub-dealers and service outlets. The new Daf Trucks includes the manufacturing, product development and sales operations in the Netherlands, the cab and axle plant and local sales operations in Belgium, as well five wholly-owned sales operations in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. The workforce now totals around 3,500 with about 2,500 in Eindhoven, 750 in Westerlo, Belgium and 250 in the various sales organisations outside the Netherlands. The organisational structure has been kept 'as flat as possible', insists Mr Baan, with a relatively small number of staff in non-production jobs. Of the total workforce 2,440 are engaged in production, 340 in research and development, 610 in sales and marketing and 120 in the central staff. Daf Trucks is aiming at a production level of around 40 trucks a day at the Eindhoven plant, although by November it was still only producing 30 trucks a day, as it was working to reduce its stock levels and was supplying from stock especially in Germany. The formation of Daf Trucks allowed the receivers in the UK to proceed with the rescue of the British operations. The formation of Leyland Trucks Manufacturing through a management buy-out team depended crucially on reaching a supply contract with Daf Trucks, which continues to sell the UK-built Daf/Leyland Daf 45 series light truck through its European sales network. The rescue of the truck operations also created a viable business base for the UK parts operations and components manufacturing, which have bought by management buy-in teams. Only the UK van operations have been saved outside this federation of companies. The management buy-out team at Leyland Daf Vans in Birmingham is not selling its products through the new Daf Trucks dealers but through its own network, which is largely confined to the UK.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WESTERN EUROPE: THE TREND IN SALES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             1991       1992       1993       1994       1995      1998  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     LIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES (up to 6t GVW)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany  235,520    333,288    249,927    260,846    278,329   292,007 France   341,817    328,827    263,239    281,153    337,082   383,756 UK       163,967    158,577    153,274    168,776    184,640   223,927 Italy    151,719    146,500    112,470    110,216    127,760   151,154 Spain    158,702    155,312    107,770    150,286    185,196   199,598 Total* 1,335,109  1,403,618  1,131,994  1,224,168  1,393,033 1,577,924  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            TRUCKS (over 6t GVW)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany  105,509     98,641     65,039     56,187     58,468    69,701 France    43,872     34,983     27,781     31,842     36,901    41,963 UK        29,774     29,335     33,349     37,014     41,109    50,742 Italy     25,256     21,569     17,406     16,806     20,904    26,968 Spain     20,378     17,737     11,138     12,742     15,083    20,140 Total*   274,845    246,874    188,559    191,254    215,283   261,689  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes other countries Source: DRI Europe  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Majority in Favor Is Still </F> Holding"]    [Text] The referendum on membership in the European Union  [EU] remains exciting to the last. The latest Gallup poll shows  there are still 37 percent of Austrians who are undecided  whether they should vote "yes" or "no" on 12 June. This is the  highest proportion of undecided people that has ever existed for  a political vote in Austria such a short time before the  decision is made.    Nevertheless, the majority in favor of EU membership, which  has been obvious for months, remains in effect: Two weeks  before the European referendum, 50 percent of Austrians say they  will vote "yes." In the interviews for the poll 36 percent said  that they will vote "no." When asked about the referendum, 14  percent say that they do not have any preference.    In its studies on the EU Gallup is asking additional  questions concerning Austrians' certainty regarding their  decisions. Most recently, the following findings were  made:     -  In addition to the 14 percent whose voting behavior  is "completely open," there are 10 percent who want to make a  final decision only in the voting both and another 13 percent,  who might still be persuaded one way or the other by arguments  or events -- this means: During the last week one has to  struggle for 37 percent (more than one out of three  Austrians).    -  Another detailed Gallup analysis shows how exciting  the race is: Of the 50 percent who will vote "yes," four-fifths  say that they are "firmly decided." This means: At the moment,  the government can rely only on 40 percent of definite "yes"  votes for the time being. Among the opponents only about  two-thirds are firmly determined to vote "no." Thus, Haider and  company have only 23 percent of definite "no" votes. Says  Professor Fritz Karmasin [of the Gallup Institute]: "At the  moment any result is possible!"     In this poll, currently the most extensive one on EU  membership in Austria (each week 1,000 personal interviews,  representative for all of Austria -- plus 500 telephone  interviews to show topical trends), Gallup also investigated the  mood of Austrians two weeks before the EU decision. It is  surprising that the mood of the population still seems to be  clearly in favor of the EU, despite signs to the contrary. The  details: -- A total of 54 percent of all Austrians believe  that the referendum on 12 June will end in a "yes" -- only 16  percent believe in a majority "no."     -  A total of 47 percent  of Austrians believe that "positive effects" will dominate in  case of EU membership. Only 37 percent primarily see negative  effects.    -  However, only 30 percent of Austrians polled think  shortly before the referendum that they are "well informed" --  particularly bad is the level of information among retirees (26  percent), workers (25 percent), and Austrians with net incomes  of less than 12,000 schillings.     In fact, despite the general approval for the EU of 50 to 36  percent, EU rejection is becoming increasingly clear among the  problematic target groups:     -  As many as 49 percent of people  with wages below 12,000 schillings -- who are a particularly  important group because of the high degree of determination to  vote in the referendum -- are against the EU, only 35 percent  are for it.    -  Among the farmers approval for the EU has slightly  risen most recently -- 35 percent intend to vote "yes" -- but  "no" still has a clear majority of 53 percent.    -  There is also a  slight trend toward "yes" among retirees: According to the  latest poll, 44 percent are in favor, 40 percent against joining  the EU. Last week, the opponents were still slightly ahead with  43 to 42.    -  However, the situation in some provinces is a  threatening omen for the advocates of EU membership. The change  in the mood in eastern Austria, above all in Lower Austria,  which was noted already in last week's NEWS, is consolidating  with great speed. In Lower Austria and in Burgenland already 52  percent intend to vote against EU membership and only 42 percent  for it. This is a difference of 10 percent, which is beyond any  statistical fluctuations.    -  The frontlines are stabilizing among  the party followers. Among the voters of the Social Democratic  Party of Austria the proportion of "yes" votes (61 percent) has  stayed the same, among voters of the Austrian People's Party it  has even increased by 5 percent (now 60 percent). In contrast,  the voices in favor of EU membership became softer among the  opposition parties. Only 34 percent of the followers of the  Freedom Party of Austria (last week 40 percent) are in favor of  EU membership and 15 (18) percent of the Greens.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Gender equality advocate  Ryoko Akamatsu retained her portfolio as education minister and  is expected to continue her campaign for greater recognition of  women's rights.    Akamatsu, 64, who has served as director general of the  Labor  Ministry's Women's Bureau, once remarked that the lack of a  woman on Sumo's Yokozuna Promotion Council is "strange" and has  called for equality in the government's system of conferring  decorations.    Since becoming education minister last August, Akamatsu has  worked to overcome some of the ministry's conservative  administrative policies based on decades of Liberal Democratic  Party guidance. She once remarked that she "shuddered" at the  rule in junior high schools requiring boys to have their hair  closely cropped, touching off a public debate over the issue and  other school policies seen as restrictive by educational  reformers.    An Osaka native, Akamatsu graduated from Tokyo University to  begin her career in the Labor Ministry in 1953.    In 1978, she was put in charge of women's issues at the  Prime  Minister's Office and the same year was appointed minister at  the Japanese mission to the United Nations.    Akamatsu was government representative to the 34th U.N.  General Assembly that signed a pact abolishing discrimination  against women and in Japan worked to enact legislation on equal  employment opportunities for women in May 1985. She became  Japan's second woman ambassador in 1986 when she was sent to  Uruguay, where she served until 1989.</p>

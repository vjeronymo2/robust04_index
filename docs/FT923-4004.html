			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: William Baird ahead 8.5% as interest charges decline WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering company, produced first half profits 8.5 per cent higher at Pounds 10m, against Pounds 9.2m, as a result of a lower interest charge following last year's rights issue. Mr Donald Parr, chairman, warned that the economic recession was worsening with demand continuing to fall beyond the end of the half year. 'We experienced a steady first quarter followed by a second quarter in which demand from all our major UK markets declined. There are signs of further deterioration during July and August,' he said. Turnover for the six months to June 30 was slightly higher at Pounds 242.7m, compared with Pounds 239.1m. Earnings per share came to 6p (6.4p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3.55p. Sales at the Darchem engineering business were hard hit. They fell from Pounds 50m to Pounds 47m, partly as the result of the disposal of three small non-core businesses. Operating profit fell by Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 3.2m. Three more unprofitable business should be sold by the end of the year, and these and other closure costs will be indicated by a Pounds 3m exceptional charge in the full accounts. Textiles turnover rose from Pounds 188.9m to Pounds 195.3m but operating profit was static at Pounds 8.8m. 'Our margins have been squeezed across the board,' said Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, finance director. The health of second half sales depended on the present bout of cool and wet weather continuing The interest charge fell from Pounds 3.13m to Pounds 1.56m, partly because the proceeds of the 1991 rights issue only cut borrowings from May of that year. COMMENT Baird is taking a double hit: from a strong dollar, which cheapens textile imports, and from the recession, which cuts capital goods sales of its engineering division. Disposals of non-core operations from Darchem are taking longer than expected. It is a bad time to sell businesses but delays mean Baird will have to make further provisions - and these will be taken above the line, in accordance with new Accounting Standards Board rules. Thus, the company will struggle to make much more than Pounds 27m at the pre-tax level, compared with Pounds 25.1m last year. Earnings are forecast at about 16.5p for a prospective p/e of 12, roughly the sector average. Longer term prospects are rosier, given the strong post-rights issue balance sheet. An imaginative acquisition or two would bolster investor confidence.</p>

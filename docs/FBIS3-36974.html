			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- The State Duma adopted  today a revised draft resolution on the legal basis for the  election of state bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation,  as well as local government bodies, and on ensuring electoral  rights of citizens. The discussion of the first version of the  draft law several days ago was too passionate, and the draft law  did not get the needed number of votes. Today the document was  approved by the majority of deputies.    Following the coming into force of the new constitution and  the need for bringing legislative acts of subjects of the  Russian Federation into line with it, as well as in connection  with elections to the representative bodies of power and local  government bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, at  which violations of the federal legislation took place, the  State Duma resolved to give some recommendations to the  president of the Russian Federation as the guarantor of the  constitution, of human rights and freedoms.    It recommended to the president to take measures for putting  an end to the violation of electoral rights of individuals and  the rights of local government bodies in the legal acts of  subjects of the Russian Federation, adopted by their executive  authorities, including a possible suspension of those legal  acts. In the opinion of the State Duma, it is also necessary to  take measures for bringing into line with the new Russian  Constitution the presidential decrees and normative acts of  subjects of the Russian Federation, which regulate general  principles of the organisation of representative and executive  bodies of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation, as  well as of local government authorities.    It was suggested to bodies of state power of subjects of the  Russian Federation, the Russian prosecutor-general and the  Central Electoral Commission that they take measures for  bringing into line with the Russian Constitution and legislation  legal acts of subjects of the Russian Federation on the election  of bodies of state power and local government authorities.    The Committee for the Affairs of the Federation and Regional  Policy and the Committee for Local Government Problems of the  State Duma were assigned to work out as a matter of priority  federal draft laws on general principles of the organisation of  the system of state bodies in subjects of the Russian  Federation, as well as local government bodies.</p>

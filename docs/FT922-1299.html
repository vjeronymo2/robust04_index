			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / The tiger refuses to leave its cage India has been characterised as a caged tiger. Just release the energies of this powerful beast, it is argued, and it will startle the world. It turns out that the promise is easier to make than to deliver. The proposed formula is familiar. Liberalise the economy. Privatise the extensive public sector. Open the sub-continent to trade with the outside world. Introduce competition from abroad. End the monopolies and cosy deals that cushion domestic manufacturers, with the consequence that they produce low-quality goods at a high cost. Sweep away the regulations that stifle the free development and growth of our potential new Asian economic superpower. Then watch. There is a flaw in this line of thinking. It is best put in a remark attributed to an Indian politician. 'The door is open,' this sagacious fellow is supposed to have said, 'but the tiger will not come out of the cage.' During the decade just passed, successive Indian governments have attempted to release their country's entrepreneurial spirit. Mrs Indira Gandhi began to flirt with such a strategy. Her son Rajiv took it further. Both failed. A year ago, a new prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, initiated the most far-reaching programme of economic reform yet undertaken. His finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, devalued the rupee and later, in his recent budget, made it partially convertible. The projected deficit was slashed. A large chunk of the 'permit raj' - the mass of regulations that made the corruption of officials a necessary cost of investment - was swept away. Foreign money was welcomed; joint ventures with outsiders were most assiduously courted. A start was made on lowering the tariff walls that protect domestic industry. Now, it seems, confidence in the sustainability of this little revolution is beginning to ebb. If the government does not stay the course, if Mr Rao and Dr Singh do not pursue liberalisation with the vigour with which they began, the tiger will remain stuck. I believe that it is too early to make such a judgment. Indians, and India-watchers, are natural pessimists. Their gloom is understandable. When you consider the history of this huge republic over the half-century since independence, there is much to be pessimistic about. The mood of a conclave of India specialists held at Ditchley Park, the international conference centre in Oxfordshire, at the weekend was, however, cautiously optimistic. Those present included economists, diplomats, a sprinkling of politicians, and academics. Most of them came from India, Britain, or the US. It was generally although by no means unanimously agreed that the Rao government is right to pursue its programme of economic reform, but there was sharp debate about its motives. One flatly expressed view was that it is all a sham - that the country was broke when Mr Rao was propelled into the top job at the age of 70 and that he had no option but to go to the IMF and the World Bank to borrow money. The terms insisted upon by those Washington-based global missionaries are well known. The gospel of liberalisation, free markets and prudent budgeting must be embraced. Then the heathens will receive their beads. Others were less world-weary. They insisted that genuine conviction motivates India's most prominent enthusiasts for liberalisation, of whom perhaps a dozen could be identified as sitting in key positions in the administration. The reforms are backed by the great longing for western comforts and standards of achievement that is so evidently felt by India's relatively affluent 'middle class' ('actually upper class' said someone at the weekend). Middle or upper, the latter group constitutes an aspirant nation within a nation. It numbers somewhere between 80m and 200m people, depending on definitions, in a country of 850m. If you think of the central core of this bourgeois India as comprising 15m families, then every one of them has at least one relative abroad, mostly in Britain, the US, or Canada but actually spread around 42 countries. This huge diaspora of 'non-resident Indians' is the subcontinent's window on the world. It is difficult to believe that with such a force behind it the attempt to modernise in a western way will be abandoned. In truth, there is no other hole to go to. For most of the near half-century since independence, India has run a mixed economy - mixed between the huge state-owned sector and a hugely protected and inefficient private sector. The republic's principal trading partner, and the supplier of many of its early ideas on economic planning, was the Soviet Union. That entity no longer exists. Some Indians look with a mixture of envy and apprehension upon China and wonder whether an authoritarian regime plus freer markets may not be the way. To India's great credit its own lively democracy is too deeply embedded for that. In the long run, therefore, that tiger will be sprung. What is questionable is the immediate future. A bad monsoon could sweep the Rao government out of office. Assuming it survives, it has to move to the agenda of unpopular decisions. Cutting the immense subsidies that clog the economy could lead to rioting in the streets. Sacking workers from inefficient industries, the 'exit policy', is something from which any government would shrink. Increased social spending, which is vital if the poorest third of the population is to be brought into the modern economy, may mean higher direct taxation of the 'upper' class. Yet it is urgent that more money is spent on such social programmes as the spread of female literacy, the single factor most likely to reduce the birth rate. At the same time, India's foreign policy, evolved under Nehru, must be reshaped to meet a single goal: the furtherance of its economic development. This means abandoning old delusions of grandeur, based on leadership of the now-redundant 'non-aligned movement'. The quarrel with Pakistan must somehow be settled; solutions to the almost intractable problems of Kashmir and the Punjab sought. Then the military budget can be trimmed - after the Russians have been paid for what they have already supplied. I suspect that Mr Rao understands all this, but that he has enough on his plate managing domestic politics and keeping his economic reform programme moving. He has to keep his balance while India conducts a national debate. For all the assumptions upon which all post-independence decisions have been based are now under question. That is why the tiger is stuck. It is still thinking.</p>

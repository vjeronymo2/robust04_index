			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Eastern springboard for western manufacturing - Investment in east For companies doing business across Europe, the former members of the communist bloc have become vital elements in the international economic equation. Since the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989, western companies have made about Dollars 9bn of capital investments in Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia, the four most developed economies of central and eastern Europe. The OECD says the lion's share has gone to Hungary, with roughly Dollars 5.5bn invested there so far. About 60 per cent of this investment has been geared to serving local markets, according to estimates by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. But large companies are increasingly using their eastern manufacturing bases as springboards for exports to the west. For the moment, central and eastern European exports to the west are very limited. According to the latest data, for 1992, the four countries' sales to the EU made up only 1.4 per cent of EU members' overall imports. Despite agreement last summer to improve eastern Europe's access to EU markets, exports are still being held up by barriers in areas such as steel, chemical and textiles. But in view of the region's low labour costs and increasingly modern production facilities, eastern Europe could become an important source for the west of goods such as consumer products and manufacturing components. Mr Niall FitzGerald, director in charge of worldwide detergents operations at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, points to the particular attractions of Poland - where the company is investing heavily in raising production of detergents and edible oils and fats. 'With investment in new technology and relatively low labour costs, its industrial operations are potentially more competitive than those in the west.' Unilever is starting to service the Czech and Slovak markets with Polish-made detergents, and eventually could sell to Russia and western Europe, he says. But some plans to source foreign markets from eastern Europe have soured. Volkswagen has cut planned investment in Czech carmaker Skoda from DM7.1bn to DM3.7bn. VW had wanted to sell a third of its production on the Czech and Slovak markets, a third to other eastern European countries, and a third to western Europe. But recession and protective tariffs in Poland have upset plans. In Hungary, several companies aim to build up sales to western markets. In buying Hungarian light bulb producer Tungsram for Dollars 550m, General Electric of the US acquired both a competitive production base and an established 7 per cent share of west European lighting sales. According to Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman: 'In the European manufacturing sense, Hungary will be our principal base.' GE says wage costs in Hungary are only a third or a quarter of levels in the UK, where it is closing lighting plants. Another company increasing Hungarian production is Oesterreichische Kabelwerke, an Austrian subsidiary of Germany's Siemens. After gaining a majority stake in Magyar Kabel Muvek, it plans to shift much of its cable production to Hungary . Audi, part of VW, starts production of engine components this summer at its DM300m plant in north-west Hungary. All production is to be exported to the Audi assembly plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Audi says Hungary had a 15 per cent cost advantage over other shortlisted sites in Austria and eastern Germany - an indication of the ground companies in the west must try to make up.</p>

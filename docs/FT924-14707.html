			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Top Magna executives to leave THREE senior executives who played a leading role in Magna International's financial turnround are leaving to become full-time consultants. But Magna, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, says it had signed consulting contracts with all three. The company said its focus was shifting to 'operational matters'. Mr David Copeland, Mr James Nicol and Mr Werner Czernohorsky were respectively chief financial officer, vice-president corporate development and chief administrative officer. All three sat on a five-man executive management committee set up in 1990 when Magna faced bankruptcy with growing debt and sliding profits due to the recession. Now Magna says it has drastically reduced debt and will resume 'disciplined growth'. For the year ended July 31, profit was CDollars 98m (USDollars 79m) on sales of CDollars 2.4bn.</p>

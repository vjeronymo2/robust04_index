			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'GHOST': WHY IT'S STILL SCARING UP REPEAT BUSINESS  </P> <P> Paramount Pictures' "Ghost," which opened in early July, just won't vanish.  Last weekend -- its 18th -- it even jumped 34% over the previous week, coming  in third for the week with grosses of $4.3 million. Its take to date: more than  $186 million, making it the year's top-grosser.  </P> <P> To investigate the "Ghost" phenomenon, Paramount has taken out classified ads  in a handful of Los Angeles papers, including The Times, looking for fans who  have seen the film six or more times. There have been hundreds of responses,  says a studio spokesman, "and they're still coming in."  </P> <P> Many of those surveyed gushed about the love story. Some said they were  "intrigued" by the theme. A number singled out Whoopi Goldberg's performance as  the clairvoyant who reunites ghostly Patrick Swayze with earthly love Demi  Moore.  </P> <P> Outtakes talked to a few of the "Ghost" fans directly:  </P> <P> Julie Richey -- Burbank mother of two and an insurance property examiner --  plans on seeing it today for the 18th time. "'It's really strange, isn't it? I  think that before, the most I'd ever seen a film was five times -- back when I  was a teen-ager. I'm in my mid-30s now. Who'd have guessed this would happen?  My husband says, 'Oh no, not again!' "  </P> <P> She says she loves the story -- "the idea of what happens after death" -- and  the performances, especially Swayze's. "I think this is a case where everyone  was well-cast. And the story, well, it makes you feel so good. One time when I  saw it, a man sitting in front of me -- a total stranger -- turned around at  the end and said, 'They should make more movies like this.' Of course, I  agree."  </P> <P> Nelson Meza -- a bank section manager from Los Angeles -- has seen it eight  times. "It's a great fantasy that seems totally real. That's what you go to see  a movie for, isn't it? It reminds me of some of the films of the '30s. You  leave it feeling great."  </P> <P> Susan Irvin -- a nurse from Ontario -- has racked up a dozen screenings. "I've  had a lot of deaths in my family this past year -- eight people who were close  to me. Because of the way the movie presents death, it's been so comforting --  it's actually helped me to deal with a lot of things.  </P> <P> "I love the love story, too. I love the idea that love enables people to go on  -- and that the people you knew and loved are still out there, somewhere . . .  even helping you to go on." "  </P> <P> "Ghost" has even made its way into lectures. Marianne Williamson, who teaches  what she calls "A Course in Miracles" -- "spiritual psychotherapy" -- through  the L.A. Center for Living in California, says she sometimes mentions both  "Ghost" and "Flatliners" because of the issues they raise regarding death.  </P> <P> She attributes "Ghost's"' popularity, in part, to her belief that it "validates  the deeper convictions of the heart -- that a relationship is more than two  bodies coming together, it's the joining of two hearts."  </P> <P> Williamson, who counsels an HIV-positive AIDS support group, saw the film with  her group -- which gave it a thumbs-up. "Everybody loved it. Because it's about  the triumph of love, beyond death, beyond the body. When you think about it,  love is really what everyone wants."  </P> <P> Still on 1,713 screens, "Ghost" will stay in the marketplace, says Paramount,  "as long as it continues to make money."  </P> <P> At present, the studio says there are no tangible plans for a "Ghost II."

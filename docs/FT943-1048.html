			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Hong Kong Investors will be keeping a wary eye on tomorrow's FOMC meeting, while Japan could also be an influence, with a possible sell-down of Asian equities accompanying its half-year end, writes Louise Lucas. Domestically, property stocks will be in the spotlight as the developers announce their final results, wrapping up the current reporting season. There is also likely to be a spate of switching among Hang Seng index constituent stocks as investors welcome newcomers, announced on Friday, to replace the five Jardine stocks that are delisting.

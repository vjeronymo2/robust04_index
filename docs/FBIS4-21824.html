			<p>BFN     [Text] Diyarbakir, Turkey, March 27 (AFP) -- Fourteen  people were killed and over 20 injured in an explosion in the  village of Kocagili in south-eastern Turkey, well-informed  sources in the regional capital of Diyarbakir said on Sunday [27  March].    According to injured survivors in Diyarbakir hospital, the  village was attacked on Saturday by fighter planes of the  Turkish airforce.    But authorities in the region denied this version of events,  saying instead that a minibus had hit a mine near the village.    Also in Diyarbakir, a grenade was thrown at a school being  used as a polling station in Sunday's municipal elections,  slightly injuring two people.    By close of polls at 4:00 PM (1300 GMT), this was the only  violent incident in the city directly linked to the elections  despite threats against voters by Kurdish separatists.</p>

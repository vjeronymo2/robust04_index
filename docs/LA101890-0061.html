			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS CIVIL RIGHTS BILL; VETO PLANNED;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE IS DESIGNED TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE.  PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO HIRING QUOTAS.  </P> <P> The House on Wednesday approved a major civil rights bill designed to combat  job discrimination and sent it to President Bush, who promised a veto on  grounds that it would lead to hiring quotas.  </P> <P> "I hope that President Bush will reconsider the unwise and unjustified course  he is on," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said following House approval of  the bill, 273 to 154.  </P> <P> The margin was 12 votes short of the two-thirds needed to override a veto and  pass the bill over the President's objections. Thirty-four Republicans and 239  Democrats voted for the bill, while 15 Democrats and 139 Republicans were  opposed.  </P> <P> Despite months of efforts to forge a compromise, civil rights forces succeeded  in gaining just one vote beyond their total on Aug. 3, when the House passed an  earlier version, 272 to 154.  </P> <P> "We're somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the additional  compromises that were made since the vote last time would have picked up some  votes," said William Taylor, a longtime Washington civil rights advocate.  </P> <P> The Senate on Tuesday approved the bill but also fell short of the support  needed to override a veto. Somber civil rights forces planned a final campaign  to persuade Bush to relent and sign the bill.  </P> <P> "Give us these measly crumbs from the table," Rep. Craig Washington (D-Tex.)  said as the House debated the measure, which had been nine months in the making  and softened repeatedly in efforts to woo Bush's support.  </P> <P> The bill represents the civil rights movement's top priority on Capitol Hill  this year. It would overturn six decisions on job discrimination that created a  furor when the Supreme Court handed them down last year.  </P> <P> Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive  damages in extreme discrimination cases.  </P> <P> The greatest controversy, however, came over complex changes in rules on how  job discrimination cases are decided. They would make it easier for minorities  filing suit to win and harder for employers to defend themselves.  </P> <P> President Bush said in a letter delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday that the  changes would "have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring  and promotion." He said that if the bill reached his desk, he would "be  compelled to veto it."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday morning that Bush  planned to veto the measure and send it back to lawmakers with an alternative  version attached. Civil rights leaders, however, have been saying the chances  of passing an alternative this year are virtually nil.  </P> <P> In recent months, they had been holding out hope that Bush would relent and  sign the bill. After weighing Tuesday's missive from the President, however,  civil rights leaders sharpened their rhetoric.  </P> <P> "His announced intention to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990 shows that on  issues of race and sex discrimination, George Bush is a Ronald Reagan in  sheep's clothing," said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership  Conference on Civil Rights.  </P> <P> "While his style and rhetoric may differ, his substantive civil rights policies  are just as deadly to those who are victims of job discrimination," Neas said.  "Indeed, with respect to key parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, President  Bush's positions are even more extreme than Ronald Reagan's.  </P> <P> "Regrettably, President Bush has capitulated to the right wing," he said.  </P> <P> There is nothing in the bill that would require employers to hire by quota. In  fact, the measure contains a disclaimer specifically saying that it would not  "encourage" the use of quotas.  </P> <P> Business groups and Bush Administration officials say, however, that the bill  would make employers so vulnerable to discrimination suits that they would turn  to quotas to provide themselves with a ready-made defense in case they were  taken to court.  </P></p>

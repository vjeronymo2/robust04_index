			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lendu losses Pre-tax losses at Lendu Holdings, which invests in irrigated and dryland cotton, cereal and beef cattle production in Queensland, were Pounds 87,000 for the year to June 30. Turnover was Pounds 589,000. Losses at the interim stage were Pounds 126,000. The company said widespread drought in eastern Australia had led to a lack of any significant cotton crop, but this was partly offset by a better than expected wheat crop. Earnings per share were 0.29p and the recommended dividend is halved to 0.25p. Lendu achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.15m for the 18 months ended June 30 1993 on turnover of Pounds 1.95m, including Pounds 549,000 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 8.68p. The change in the year end was to coincide with the cropping cycle of cotton.</p>

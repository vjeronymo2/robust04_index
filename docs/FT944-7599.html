			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Orders for durable goods fall in value Sharply lower orders for new cars and aircraft pulled down the value of US durable goods orders in October, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York and Washington. Orders fell 1.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 152.8bn (Pounds 97.3bn) after a revised 0.3 per cent rise in September. Wall Street Economists had forecast a 0.4 per cent gain in October. It was the first decline in three months - caused entirely by a sharp decline in transport goods orders, which plunged 9.4 per cent to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 35.2bn. Excluding transport, orders rose 1.1 per cent after a 0.4 per cent September increase. Analysts said the fall in could signal early signs of fatigue in the US manufacturing sector. 'This is a warning sign for smokestack America,' said Mr Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley. Some areas of the report displayed surprising weakness, said Mr Roach, particularly non-defence capital goods orders, which fell 2.9 per cent after a 3.6 per cent rise in September. 'This suggests the capital goods rate of growth will probably moderate from the vigorous gains we had earlier this year,' he said. However, others expressed caution in interpreting the figures. 'I'm surprised by the marked weakness in transportation orders, but I hesitate to read too much into it,' said Ms Carol Stone, economist at Nomura Securities International. She pointed to other sectors, such as industrial machinery, which continued to advance at a brisk pace. Officials said the value of durable goods orders excluding transport was a record Dollars 117.6bn. Defence orders fell in October by 16.9 per cent after rising 11.6 per cent in September. Electronic and electrical goods orders rose 0.5 per cent after a 4.3 per cent September gain. Shipments of durable goods were down 1.2 per cent in October after a drop of 0.8 per cent the month before.</p>

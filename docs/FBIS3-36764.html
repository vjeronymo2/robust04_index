Gorbachev knew that Boris Yeltsin, as President of the  Russian Federation, had no intention of signing the Union Treaty  on August 20, 1991, and that he was about to liquidate union  structures, Shenin told the Military Collegium of Russia's  Supreme Court on Tuesday. According to the former Central  Committee member, Gorbachev informed him of this in a telephone  conversation on July 29, 1991.    "The Soviet Union's disintegration could have been prevented  had Gorbachev imposed a state of emergency himself, instead of  letting others do it," Shenin said. However Gorbachev preferred  to sit it out in Foros, and refused to be flown to Moscow,  Shenin declared.    According to Shenin, Gorbachev had nothing against the  imposition of a state of emergency. "The wrong people are now  charged with high treason," he said.    The court adjourned until Friday morning.</p>

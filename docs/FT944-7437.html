			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: BA and ANA in talks on strengthening ties British Airways and All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan's biggest domestic airline, are in talks on forging closer links, notably on schedules and slots for flights between Tokyo's Narita and London's Heathrow airports, ANA said, Reuter reports. BA and ANA began co-operating on frequent flyer programmes last month with a group of other airlines. However, ANA stressed that the current talks excluded the possibility of equity swaps. BA declined to comment, beyond noting that the airline's chairman, Sir Colin Marshall, had recently noted that the ties 'didn't add up to plans for any greater alliance'.</p>

A decision concerning Boris Fedorov's  remaining in the government has not been taken yet.    Fedorov advanced a number of conditions, largely concerning  individual officials, for his joining the reorganized Cabinet,  Shokhin noted.    "I know that the prime minister and the president have  different views as to the possibility of meeting Fedorov's  conditions," Shokhin said.    Fedorov had said he would join the government if Deputy  Premier Aleksander Zaveryukha, responsible for agriculture, and  the Central Bank Governor Victor Gerashchenko leave the Cabinet.    According to Shokhin, the candidacy of another first deputy  premier (one of these posts has already been reserved for Oleg  Soskovets) is under consideration now. "This job will obviously  not remain unfilled," Shokhin said.    When asked whether Fedorov is likely to become the other  first deputy premier, Shokhin said, "I don't know."</p>

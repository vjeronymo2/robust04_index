			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PETER SENIOR SCORES SECOND CONSECUTIVE VICTORY  </P> <P> Peter Senior shot a three-under-par 69 Sunday for a five-stroke victory in the  $800,000 Australian Golf tournament, his second consecutive victory and third  in five weeks.  </P> <P> Senior finished with a 276 after four rounds at Royal Melbourne and earned  $144,000.  </P> <P> Greg Norman shot a 67 and finished second after Howard Clark of Britain bogeyed  the final hole. Clark shot a 71 for a 282 total.  </P> <P> Masters champion Nick Faldo of Britain, Frank Nobilo of New Zealand and Bob  Shearer of Australia tied for fourth at 283.  </P> <P> Senior, an Australian, won the Australian PGA title at Riverside Oaks last  month, ending a two-year winless streak, and won the Australian Open last week.  </P> <P> "I'm very impressed with him," Norman said. "'Very few people in the world  could go out and do what he has done. The courses here are a lot tougher than  in the U.S. He could shoot any number around the courses there, and it will be  interesting to see what he does."  </P> <P> Senior began the final day with a three-shot lead over defending champion  Rodger Davis of Australia, who shot a 75.  </P> <P> Senior birdied the the second, third and sixth holes on the 6,977-yard Royal  Melbourne course. He gave back two strokes at the ninth and 11th but had  birdies at 12 and 14.  </P> <P> "I did what I set out to do early on, make a couple of birdies and hang on to  it," he said. "No one was making a charge, but it was still difficult out  there."  </P> <P> Nobuo Serizawa shot a 2-under-par 70 and beat David Ishii of the United States  by four strokes in the $570,000 Daikyo Open at Onnason, the final event on the  1989 Japan PGA tour.  </P> <P> It was the first victory this season for the 30-year-old Serizawa, who finished  with a 271 and won $102,000.  </P></p>

According to the aeronautics minister, there are  various problems now to complement the studies and decisions on  the company's privatization process jointly studied by his  ministry and the Finance Ministry. He noted: "All this budget  and social function problem is strongly engulfing us." Embraer  Superintendent Ozires Silva again stressed that the company's  situation is very serious and requires a quick decision.    Embraer's directorate eagerly views the delay and  confirmation of a new date, which still has not been set. Less  than one month ago, the date was moved from 25 to 24 March.  Ozires Silva emphasized: "Privatization represents the only  short-term solution for Embraer."    In 1993, Embraer's sales were four times lower than its  financial debt, estimated at $890 million. The Embraer director  emphasized that it is necessary to guarantee the entry of income  and manage a maximum debt of $200 million in order to again put  the company on a sound footing and make it competitive and  attractive for those interested in purchasing it. Nevertheless,  the debt's capitalization systems still are being discussed by  the federal government.    The only organization that benefited from the entire lack of  decision on Embraer was the Embraer Defense Commission -- No To  Privatization [Comissao de Defesa da Embraer -- Nao a  Privatizacao], an organization of professional associations and  trade unions. This organization's goals now have been enhanced  because they are part of the campaign speeches delivered by PT  [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.    The Embraer Defense Commission -- No To Privatization has  scheduled a meeting with Minister Viana Lobo early next week.  During this meeting, an Embraer economic-financial feasibility  study will be delivered and a retrogression in the company's  privatization process will be discussed.</p>

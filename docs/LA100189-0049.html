			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADOPTION  </P> <P> President Bush's proposal to give tax incentives to parents who adopt the  mentally retarded has gone largely unnoticed; it needs serious thought, but  only once.  </P> <P> Adults who care for children -- be they disabled or otherwise -- do so because  they want to, not because of financial incentives. There are already tax  incentives for parents with children, yet couples do not say: "Gee, honey, we  need another deduction next year, let's have a kid!" Similarly, those that want  to adopt a mentally retarded child will do so regardless of any short-term  incentive. Instead, the incentive will open the door for exploitation by those  who would only consider adoption for the monetary benefits. Those who abuse and  exploit children will be encouraged to adopt for financial gain. They are not  the type of parents that we need.  </P> <P> Taxpayer dollars would be more successfully spent on medical care, birth  control, education and prenatal care. Studies continue to show that for every  dollar of prenatal care that is spent, many times that amount is saved  postnatally. Yet public health funding continues to decline. The mentally  retarded and all other Americans would be better served if the education and  medical fields were better funded.  </P> <P> Let's encourage better, healthier lives for all children and continue to be  selective about who is privileged enough to adopt. A majority of mentally  retarded births are not preventable, but abuse of the system and abuse of the  children are.  </P> <P> RONALD A. MOSSLER  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

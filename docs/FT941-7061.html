			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Renold rolling along for more than a century - David Blackwell on a chainmaker for fairgrounds, forklifts, supertankers and jump jets The bush roller chain, invented for the bicycle more than a hundred years ago, must qualify as a design classic. It is a simple concept that works well, and has been around for a lot longer than many acknowledged classics such as the Zippo cigarette lighter and the Anglepoise lamp. It was patented in 1880 by Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, a year after he founded a company in Manchester to make chains for bicycles. Its applications in the late 20th century include the mechanism for controlling the vector thrusts in Harrier jump jets, fairground rides, car engines and printing machinery. The company that still bears his name no longer makes bicycle chains, but it remains the second biggest chain producer in the world, after Tsubaki of Japan. While the Renold group also makes gears and compressors, chains still represent 61 per cent of sales, which totalled just over Pounds 125m in the year to end-March 1993. Last November, Renold announced a trebling of interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.4m on turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 65.4m. Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the company was beginning to reap the benefits of its capital investment programme. City analysts are looking for pre-tax profits for the current year of about Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 1.2m in 1992-93 and a loss of Pounds 3m the year before. While the basic components of inner and outer sideplates, pins, bushes and rollers have remained unchanged, the method of manufacture has changed dramatically. Mr Ian Trotter, group director for chains, points out that a chain is a linked section of bearings, and needs the same precision in manufacture as bearings do. 'That's where Renold's expertise is highly regarded.' Over the past three years Renold has reorganised its chain manufacturing into three main centres. The biggest factory is at Einbeck in Germany, where all the medium chain -  1/2 inch to   3/4 inch - and forklift truck chain is made. The plant at Calais makes the timing chain used in car engines to drive camshafts. The market for this is increasing in spite of falling world vehicle production as chain retakes market share from belts. The Manchester operation concentrates on large chain, from 1 inch up to 5 inch. It moved from Burnage, where manufacture and assembly were carried on in two separate factories, to Bredbury in 1990. The investment in the new factory and cellular production was part of the group's Pounds 33m capital investment programme between 1989 and 1992. Since the move, production of all 1 inch and 1 1/4 inch chain has become automated, cutting out at least three production processes. Most of the volume sales from Bredbury are in 1 inch chain, which is used extensively in machinery in many industries, such as packaging and processing. However, links for the bigger chains, whose uses range from marine diesel engines for supertankers to fairground rides, are still assembled by hand by operators using large presses. The cost of automating the manufacture of the larger chains would be prohibitive, according to Mr John Allan, group finance director, because of the lower volume of production. Bredbury also pioneered the cellular production system which is now being applied throughout the group. The new linear system both made the product flow more visible and gave more effective control. The group has spent Pounds 9m on the factory, which employs 275 people compared with 350 on the old site. While the machine tools are Japanese, Renold's expertise has gone into the production engineering and tooling, and the cellular approach to production. Mr Allan believes the factory, which also makes toothed wheels on which its chains run, is now very efficient. However it has substantial additional capacity, subject to extra manning. Mr John Kelly, manufacturing manager at Bredbury, said that the reorganisation and investment in new machinery had cut lead times from 26 days to 5 days and improved productivity by 30 per cent in the past two years.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Singapore admits pollution hazard For the first time in its modern-day history, Singapore has had to admit it has a pollution problem. The island republic's environment ministry said this week that air pollution had reached an unhealthy level. Those with serious heart and lung ailments should stay indoors; some healthy people might experience skin and eye irritations. The pollution has been front page news in a city which has prided itself on its clean and green image. The authorities say a thick haze which has enveloped the city over recent weeks has been caused by forest fires raging in nearby Indonesia. Many thousands of hectares of tropical rainforest are reported to be ablaze on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. More forest fires are reported in East Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo. Singapore's leaders go to considerable lengths to ensure that the city state is kept squeaky-clean. Those who drop rubbish are liable not only to heavy fines but also to being dressed in luminous litterbug jackets and paraded in front of television cameras. Singapore has some of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws. The sale of chewing gum is prohibited in order to combat any unsightly mess in public places.</p>

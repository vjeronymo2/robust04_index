			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- There is now a  thriving real estate business in south China's Guangdong  Province after seven years' construction, according to the  provincial Land Administration Department.    Land-use rights for 15,100 ha were transferred last year  alone, creating profits of 11 billion yuan.    According to Yuan Zheng, director of the Land Administration  Department, land use rights for 25,000 ha [hectare] were  transferred during the past two years in Guangdong, generating a  total profit of 20.5 billion yuan.    Foreign investment absorbed through the transfer of land-use  rights has made up 42.6 percent of the total amount of overseas  capital utilized by the province.    So far, 72 development zones have been set up in this  southern province, taking up 13,000 ha. Some 18 billion yuan  has been used to introduce 3,300 projects into these zones.    Yuan stressed that the macro-economic control measures for  real estate implemented by the central government and the  provisional regulations on land value-added tax that began to  take effect this year do not mean restriction of the development  of the sector but its standardization to ensure that its  development is steady and sound.    The modern market system in Guangdong that has gradually  been  set up during the reform and opening-up over the last 15 years  will surely further promote the rapid development of real  estate, yuan added.</p>

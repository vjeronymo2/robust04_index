			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES DIP IN REACTION TO ECONOMIC DATA  </P> <P> Bond prices finished mostly lower Tuesday, weakened by a new report on U.S.  manufacturing showing that the pace of economic decline has slowed.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or $1.87 for every  $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, increased  to 7.99% from 7.97% on Friday.  </P> <P> The market was closed Monday for the New Year's Day holiday.  </P> <P> Analysts said bond prices were tipped lower by a new report by the nation's  purchasing managers showing that the industrial economy slowed in December for  the eighth straight month but at the lowest rate of decline in six months. The  National Assn. of Purchasing Management, which charts economic trends by  polling its members, said its index registered 48% in December, up from 46.6%  in November but down from 57.3% in December, 1988.  </P> <P> "It indicates that the decline in the manufacturing economy has probably  bottomed out," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds  Inc.  </P> <P> Bond traders believe that the Federal Reserve is more likely to relax credit  and allow interest rates to fall if the economy is slowing. The report of a  pickup in the economy led them to believe that the Fed would not push rates  downward.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight  loans, was quoted late in the day at 8.50%, up from 7.50% on Friday. Analysts  said the steep jump was due mainly to technical market factors.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Makes Gains as Gold Declines  </P> <P> The dollar ended the trading day with a strong advance against most major  currencies despite reported efforts by the Federal Reserve to drive it down,  particularly against the Japanese yen.  </P> <P> Gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery  settled at $399.60 an ounce, down $2.90 from late Friday. Republic National  Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $399.75, off $3.25 from Friday.  </P> <P> Although domestic and most European markets reopened Tuesday, trading was  described as thin as Tokyo extended the New Year's Day holiday and many offices  in New York and abroad remained partially staffed.  </P> <P> Therefore, currency dealers said, it remained to be seen whether the dollar was  on its way up again after an extended decline in the last weeks of 1989.  </P> <P> The dollar was selling at 146.15 Japanese yen in London late Tuesday, up from  143.40 in Tokyo last Friday. In New York, the dollar soared to 146.40 yen from  143.85 yen.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.6115 late Tuesday, unchanged from Friday.  Sterling fetched $1.6085 in New York, less than Friday's $1.6105.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Crude Oil, Gas Up; Precious Metals Fall  </P> <P> Crude oil and gasoline prices rose sharply, as did orange juice futures, while  precious metals fell sharply.  </P> <P> Crude oil and gasoline rose in reaction to production slowdowns, plus  technically triggered buy signals.  </P> <P> Spot unleaded gasoline soared nearly 4 cents a gallon on the New York  Mercantile Exchange to 65.69 cents, while the spot price of benchmark West  Texas Intermediate crude surged $1.07 a barrel to $22.89.  </P> <P> Energy traders said gasoline futures started the rally as traders bought  unleaded gasoline and sold heating oil. Forecasts for milder weather across the  United States, which would reduce heating oil demand, encouraged selling, they  said.  </P> <P> Last week's crop-damaging freeze has left Florida, but orange juice futures  continued higher out of fear the damage will produce shortages and higher cash  prices, traders said. Florida produces about 70% of the U.S. citrus crop.  </P> <P> Frozen concentrated orange juice futures traded on the New York Cotton Exchange  rose the 8-cent-per-pound daily limit again in deferred contracts. Spot January  was up 4.60 cents at 170.25.  </P> <P> U.S. shortages spurred Brazil, a leading orange juice exporter, to raise  prices, adding fuel to the futures rally, traders said.  </P></p>

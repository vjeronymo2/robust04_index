			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] has requested the immediate  establishment of the international verification mechanism agreed  on with the government on 29 March and condemned the  assassination of Constitutionality Court President Eduardo  Epaminondas Gonzalez.    On 5 April, a URNG communique revealed that "compliance with  the Global Agreement on Human Rights and the prompt  establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the United  Nations constitute the first trial by fire" of the negotiation  process. The human rights agreement includes UN verification of  respect for constitutional rights in Guatemala and compliance  with the agreement's points.    In addition, the URNG asked the government of Ramiro de Leon  Carpio to clarify the incident against Constitutionality  President Gonzalez on 1 April. According to Guatemalan  authorities, Gonzalez died on 3 April after being shot by  unidentified people while driving to his home in Guatemala City.    In the communique released in Mexico City, the URNG asked  "that the assassination be cleared up as soon as possible,"  considering this incident "is within the jurisdiction and scope  of the security forces, where it originated." In the guerrillas'  opinion, the slaying of Gonzalez "constitutes flagrant  provocation of Guatemalan society and the international  community," following the signing of the Global Agreement on  Human Rights in Mexico City on 29 March.    In the communique signed by the four URNG commanders, the  rebels rejected the implementation of a state of exception,  which they consider part of "a preconceived plan to limit the  freedom of expression of civic forces." The URNG General Staff  urged the government and the Guatemalan Army to comply with the  human rights agreement, which it called a "fundamental step" in  the negotiation of the peace process in Guatemala.    The URNG believes the presidential offer to grant the rebels  amnesty reflects "existing contradictions (within the  government) and contravenes the negotiation process." Shortly  after the signing of the agreement was disclosed, President de  Leon Carpio announced the possibility of granting the URNG  militants amnesty, an offer rebel leaders believe "calls into  question the government's will to conclude negotiations."</p>

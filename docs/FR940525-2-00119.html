FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County, New York  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 20, 1989, as supplemented January 16, 1990, January 3, 1992, January 30, 1992, May 5, 1993, May 26, 1993, and March 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This application for an amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications proposes new Safety/Relief Valve (SRV) performance limits to take credit for the currently installed SRV capacity. Specifically, three changes to the existing SRV performance limits are proposed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The first permits continued plant operation with two SRVs out-ofservice. Since 7 of the 11 SRVs at FitzPatrick are also automatic depressurization system (ADS) valves, this reduces the number of ADS valves required to be operable to 5. Current specifications permit only one SRV out-of-service for 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Secondly, the setpoints for all 11 SRVs are changed to a single nominal setpoint. Current specifications stagger the setpoints from 1090 to 1140 psig.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The third change increases the maximum permissible setpoint tolerance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one to three percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Limiting Safety System Setting (LSSS) for reactor coolant system overpressurization protection (TS 2.2.1.B), as a result of these changes, now requires that 9 of 11 SRVs be operable at a common setpoint of 1110 psig plus or minus 3 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety analyses were performed, using a conservative SRV setpoint of 1195 psig, which demonstrate that these proposed changes are acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other changes, not associated with SRV performance, clarify selected portions of the Technical Specifications and correct minor typographical and editorial errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This ``Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing'' (Notice) supersedes the related Notice which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 15, 1990 (55 FR 20228).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. A bounding analysis (NEDC&hyph;31697P, ``Updated SRV Performance Requirements for the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant'') of the revised SRV performance requirements considered plant operation with 9 of 11 SRVs operable and with a common valve actuation pressure of 1195 psig. The analysis demonstrates that a 50 psi margin exists between the maximum anticipated pressure and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code upset reactor vessel pressure limit of 1375 psig. The analyses of NEDC&hyph;31697P also demonstrate that the new SRV performance limits have no significant impact on thermal limits, ECCS/LOCA performance, HPCI/RCIC operability, containment response, containment integrity, or 10 CFR [Part] 50 Appendix R alternate shutdown capability. The analyses also considered simmer margin and downward setpoint drift. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five miscellaneous changes clarify terminology, correct typographical errors, remove a surveillance requirement which should have been deleted as part of Amendment 130, clarify when SRV manual actuation is performed, and delete a duplicate specification. These changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not impact previously evaluated accidents or equipment malfunctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Ccreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The new SRV performance limits are primarily administrative changes. The only physical changes involve recalibration of SRV setpoints and operation with 2 SRVs/ADS valves out-of-service. The operation and function of the pressure relief system and [are] unaffected. No new failure modes are introduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The new SRV performance limits slightly reduce the existing margin to vessel overpressure and the margin to the 125% mechanical overspeed trip for the HPCI and RCIC turbines. However, the reduction in the overpressure margin is insignificant (approximately 25 psi) and the plant's response to transients and accidents remains well within the limits established in General Design Criteria (GDC) 15, Standard Review Plan Section 5.2.2, and FSAR Section 4.4. The reduction in turbine overspeed margin is negligible (less than 1%), because it is within the allowable tolerance of the trip settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and do not involve a reduction in safety margin. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reference and Documents Department, Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Charles M.

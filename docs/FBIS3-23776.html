			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elkond Libman under the rubric "Faces of the </F> Week": "Portrait of `Repairmen'"]    [Text] Well, repair of the government, the need for  which the ruling majority has been bringing up for so long, is  for all practical purposes an accomplished fact. An elegant  touch: The names of the new ministers follow one another in  strict keeping with the Latin alphabet: J (Jurgenson), K  (Kannik, Kranich), and L (Luik).    TOIVO JURGENSON. A man of pleasant manners, with a  quiet voice and a shy smile. At 36, he is the oldest of the  foursome. According to the parliament's deputy speaker, Tunne  Kelam, he worked extensively and fruitfully in the parliamentary  commission on the economy. Some of the results have been felt  quite tangibly by Tallinn residents: It was at his initiative  that the State Assembly cut to a minimum subsidies for public  transportation in the capital. In the Isamaa he was considered a  leading specialist and ideologist on the subject of agriculture.  In the fall, when angry peasants staged a siege of the  parliament building, he looked out of the window and said that  Estonian agriculture was still in the hands of socialist  structures, which had "lobbied" this action.    INDREK KANNIK. Was considered an Isamaa ideologist  but, in the public eye all the time, has not qualified for the  fame of a "gray cardinal." Aside from the prime minister, he was  affected by well-known scandals less any of Isamaa's other top  people. After the most sensational of them--the "vodka  scandal"--when the subject of changing of the faction leadership  came up, he was rumored to be a prime candidate for the  parliamentary leader of Isamaa. This did not happen, however.  Perhaps even then he kept in his sights the far-reaching aim of  a ministerial portfolio. Numerous remarks at parliamentary press  conferences on issues of the national security concept are  probably the only link between the name of Kannik, who has never  served in the military--like his predecessor, as a matter of  fact--and the job of minister of defense. That, and his obvious  character trait of decisiveness.    HEIKI KRANICH. While being a member of the ruling  coalition, he was not a member of Isamaa faction of late,  joining instead the liberals faction that recently split from  Isamaa. One of the "fathers" of the current tax system. By the  way, it was he who stubbornly insisted on the need to apply  turnover tax to periodicals. Unlike the aforementioned, he was  up to his neck in the "vodka scandal" since, together with Illar  Hallaste, he was a member of Liviko's administrative council. He  is still involved in litigation with the RAHVA HAEL newspaper on  the subject of an item, which, he contends, inflicted moral  damage on him to the tune of half a million kroons. He seeks to  exact the half million from the offender in his lawsuit.    JURI LUIK. This name is probably more familiar to  the reader than the rest. Head of the Estonian delegation at the  negotiations with Russia, he looked almost like a boy, albeit  bearded, next to the cleanly shaven and experienced Vasiliy  Svirin. His remarks to journalists after each round of  negotiations were not always diplomatic, sometimes prompting  even the usually restrained and polite Svirin to a verbal  skirmish. As time went by, he became less overtly emotional, and  learned diplomacy--not just a diplomat's polish but also  experience--which even his rivals in the negotiations  acknowledged. His tenure in the job of minister of defense was  so short-lived, however, that it did not leave any publicly  visible trail.</p>

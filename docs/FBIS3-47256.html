KEA wants to complete its talks with the Federation of  Korean  Trade Unions (FKTU) by the middle of February and finish company  talks before the end of March, Hwang said.    "As the government has set this year's goal at strengthening  international competitiveness of the nation and has a strong  will to control prices, price hikes will not be so considerable  a reason for wage increases," he predicted.    Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok and Labor Minister  Nam Chae-hui told FKTU Chairman Pak Chong-kon on Saturday [8  January] that the government intends to control prices, and Pak  said FKTU will seek to end its wage negotiations with KEA as  early as possible if prices are controlled.    KEA will draw up wage demands by the middle of this month  and  select negotiators to meet with FKTU late this month.    "Government, management and labor met in October and agreed  to change ties between management and labor to autonomous and  cooperative," an FKTU spokesman said. "Moreover, workers share  the view that increasing competitiveness is the only way for  Korea to survive in a competitive international arena."    KEA and FKTU agreed on a unified wage hike plan in April for  the first time.</p>

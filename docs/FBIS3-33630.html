			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text]  <H5>  Letter to the media </H5>   The purpose of this letter is to report on the public  finance  situation to the Executive Branch through the media covering the  following aspects:    1. The imbalance that has occurred due to the balance in  hand situation, taking into consideration the 1994 budget  compared to what is really available.    2. The direct dependence between the investment budget and  foreign credits resources.    3. The structural problem of the government budget where  current resources do not cover the costs of operations.    4. The public debt service which, in the future, will become  one of the economic and fiscal topics of most importance for all  Panamanians.    5. An explanation of why the Comptroller General's Office  did not reserve 22 million balboas of the so-called  "parliamentary initiatives."    6. The Finance and Treasury Ministry's responsibility of  obtaining the necessary resources for complying with the budget  of current resources.    7. The need to take measures to control public expenses as  of right now, so we will spend only what we can afford.    Panamanians are confronting several challenges and problems  which we must extensively analyze to try and find the best  solutions. We have decided to send you this note, and we  apologize for not sending a copy to each person individually,  but we wanted you to know to whom we sent a copy so as to guide  public opinion in a responsible manner.    At first, we thought of inviting you to a meeting at the  Comptroller General's Office to give you more details and  explanations, but we think it would be difficult at this time  because of your many duties. We are at your service for any  additional explanations you may need.    Yours truly,    [signed] J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General  <H5>  Report to the president </H5>   Your Excellency:    Early in January 1994, you asked me to present our  preliminary impressions of the 1994 national budget and the  country's fiscal situation before the Cabinet Council. When some  changes took place in the Cabinet Council in early 1994, you  once again expressed concern for the difficult 1994 fiscal  situation of the government, and you asked us, on Thursday, 3  February, to present before the new cabinet during its first  formal session a report on the 1993 budget implementation and  our comments for 1994, which we are doing in writing in this  note.    1. The constitutional framework: Budget Equilibrium.    Article 267 of the Constitution of the Republic establishes  that expenditures will balance with revenues in the budget  prepared by the Executive Branch. Therefore, the Constitution  requires that the budget is balanced.    2. Law 32 of 31 December 1993.    This is the law by which the national state budget was  approved. Article 135 says: "The general state budget consists  of estimating revenues and the maximum authorized expenditures  that central government institutions, decentralized entities,  public enterprises, and intermediator financial organizations  can commit to for the corresponding term. [no closing quote  marks as published]    The Comptroller General's Office is not responsible for  preparing the General Budget of the nation. This law establishes  the state general budget in the amount of 3.9044 billion  balboas, of which 1.9286 billion balboas correspond to the  central government budget (Annex No. 1).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Revenue and Expenditures Budget of the Central Government is as follows (|  |in billions of balboas):                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Revenue                         |1.9286                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Current Revenue                       |1.4158                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capital Revenue                       |.5128                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      [Text]The estimated capital revenues include:    -- Resources from foreign credit in the amount of 324.3  million  balboas (loans from international financing institutions,  credits,  and donations from governments and other institutions.)    -- Balance in hand and in the bank for 96.2 million balboas.  (Annex No. 2)    Details of the expense budget are as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Operation costs                       |$ 1.5479 billion                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Public debt)                         |(493.0) million                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Operation transfers)                 |(269.5) million                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investment costs                      |380.67 million                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The $1.5479 billion in operation costs includes $493.0  million in public debt service expenses and $296.9 million in  transfers to other agencies.    3. Why does 1994 start with a projected fiscal deficit of  $79.6 million?    It is necessary to indicate that the budget process begins  several months before the end of the fiscal year so cash balance  estimates are subject to variations and adjustments, especially  during the last two months of the year when public agencies  expedite their bids and requests for the submission of prices,  as well as the issuance of contracts and payments.    The 1994 budget included an estimated cash and bank balance  of $96.2 million, but this did not happen. The fiscal year which  ended on 31 December 1993 showed a cash and bank balance of  $16.6 million, which immediately results in a budget shortage as  follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Law No. 31, 12/31/94                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cash and bank balance                 |$ 96.2 million                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Comptrollership General of the Republic, 31/12/93                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Budget shortage                       |16.6 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Budget deficit or shortage            |$ 79.6 million                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      4. How is the 12/31/93 cash balance determined?    We have implemented strict expense controls since we assumed  the post of comptroller, without affecting government  operations. By 10 December, we had a projected deficit of $28.4  million for 31 December 1993. The measures we adopted include  the following:    4.1 We canceled 1990, 1991, and 1992 purchase orders which  had not been formally made. This represented $10.2 million in  our books.    4.2 We also proceeded to annul the 1990, 1991, and 1992  budget reserves. This represented $23.2 million in our books.    4.3 Additional contributions to the 1993 budget came from  IPAT [Panamanian Tourism Institute], the National Beneficent  Lottery, and the National Mortgage Bank.    4.4 Savings from November and December public expenses.    4.5 We continued to finance the 1993 cash and bank balance,  $83.6 million, including government agencies' debts, which have  yet to reimburse the central government for the amounts paid to  the IFI's [International Financial Organizations] on their  behalf. (Annex No. 3)    5. Why were all financial allotment requests not registered  in 1993?    The comptrollership general received financial allotment  requests, which were to be included in the 1993 fiscal year,  from ministries and agencies and legislative projects for $72.9  million. (Annex No. 4)    These reserve requests are listed as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Operation reserves                    |$ 13.2 million                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investment reserves                   |59.7 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Logically, the $72.9 million could not be reserved.  Therefore, the comptrollership general reserved the following:    -- Formally signed contracts.    -- Formally signed purchase orders.    -- Projects subject to public bids.    -- Subsidies to decentralized entities.    A total of $16.8 million were reserved for formally signed  documents.    6. Why were all the legislators' projects not registered?    Legislators had submitted requests, through notes, to  reserve  $22.7 million for their "parliamentary initiatives." (Annex No.  5, listed by legislator)    The reserves were not created because of the following  reasons:    6.1 There were no documents on public bids.    6.2 There were no written requests for reserves.    6.3 If the reserves had been created, this would have  resulted in a fiscal deficit which would have reduced the cash  balance and increased the budget deficit for the 1994 fiscal  year.    6.4 Legislators have the opportunity to request that their  "parliamentary initiatives" be registered for the 1994 fiscal  year.    7. What is the financial situation of the 1994 budget?    By not having the estimated cash balance of 96.2 million  balboas and with a budget imbalance of 79.6 million balboas, the  Comptroller General's Office has established the 1994 budget  situation 11 months ahead of time, and is asking all ministers,  deputy ministers, and all public institution directors and  assistant directors to curb public spending, especially in the  following areas:    Personnel (appointments and promotions).    Public services (Institute of Hydraulic Resources and  Electrification, National Institute of Telecommunications, and  National Water and Sanitation Institute).    Per diems and trips abroad.    Fuel.    8. What does execution of the investment budget depend on?    There is a structural problem in the Panamanian state's  public finances. Panamanians do not save; the government does  not [two previous words in upper case] save or collect  sufficient income through taxes and its institutions are not  profitable. Consequently, public investments must be financed by  putting ourselves in debt and thereby increasing the debt  service.    The central government's 1994 investment budget is 380.7  million balboas, of which 318.9 balboas are from direct  investments. How will these investments be financed? By putting  ourselves more in debt.    According to estimates, the country will receive 324.3  million balboas in foreign credit. It will be broken down as  follows:    8.1 Conditional loans from IFI's, 183.9 million balboas.    8.2 Financing without conditions, 76.7 million balboas.    8.3 Agreements with foreign governments, 63.7 million  balboas.    Mr. President, the question is: What will happen if this  financing is not obtained as expected? Will we meet the IFI's  requirements to obtain its disbursements?    9. What is the great responsibility of the Ministry of  Treasury and Financing?    The central government's budget estimates current revenue  collections will total 1.4158 billion balboas, which will be  allocated to cover, along with other income, the central  government's operating expenses, estimated at 1.5479 billion  balboas.    What will happen if the Ministry of Finance and Treasury is  unable to collected the budgeted amount? From now, this Ministry  must take appropriate measures to avoid tax evasion, contraband,  etc. so as to obtain the estimated current revenues. Otherwise,  the 1994 deficit will increase.    10. The Public Debt Service    Whoever governs Panama in the future will face one of the  most serious problems in public finances, the government, the  economy, and the country in general. The public debt service.    The 1994 budget contemplates 493 million balboas for  servicing the internal and external public debt. This figure,  which is already high, does not include debt servicing of the  San Jose Pact, Japanese and European bonds, or commercial banks.  When agreements for restructuring the previously mentioned debts  are achieved in the future, servicing the Panamanian public debt  will be one of the most serious economic, financial, and fiscal  problems for future leaders and the Panamanian people. The debt  corresponds to the country and its inhabitants and not the  administration that may be in office.    11. The important role of the MIPPE [Ministry of Planning  and Economic Policy], Ministry of Finance and Treasury, and the  Comptroller General's Office.    Article 147 of Law No. 32 establishes the following: If at  any given time during the fiscal year, MIPPE, together with the  Ministry of Finance and Treasury and the Comptroller General's  Office, considers that revenues may be lower than the total  expenses authorized in the government's budget, it will present  a spending reduction plan before the Cabinet Council to avoid  incurring a deficit. This presentation will be followed by  appropriate legal actions, including the corresponding approval  of the Legislative Assembly Budget Commission. This action,  after approval has been duly granted, will be considered a  modification to the state general budget, as set forth in  Article 205. In light of this situation, we present, we think,  Mr. President, that those of us who have the legal  responsibility to take appropriate action must begin our task.    12. Can funds not used in 1993 be reallocated?    We suggest the remaining 1993 budget reserves, which were  not  used due to the aforementioned reasons, be considered for  inclusion in the 1994 budget. This will allow them to be used so  as to take advantage of the institutions' 1993 efforts.    13. Special 1994 credits against current revenues.    Given the 1994 financial situation, it is necessary to point  out the limitations we are facing for addi?ional credits, whose  financing will come from current revenues in 1994. Consequently,  the Comptroller General's Office will not approve said credits  if the current situation does not improve.    On this lengthy but necessary note, we wished to state, in  detail, the fiscal situation, with the desire of observing the  wise popular saying, which goes: "We must use only what we have  at hand."    Respectfully and truly yours,    J. Chen Barria, Comptroller General</p>

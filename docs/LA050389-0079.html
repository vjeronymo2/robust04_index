			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Lebanon's Christian leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said he may compromise with  Muslim militias to end the fighting in Beirut but will pursue diplomatic  channels to oust Syrian troops from Lebanon. Aoun, commander of Lebanon's  mainly Christian army, said he will consider lifting a blockade of three ports  operated by Syrian-backed Muslim militias to try to end the current round of  bitter fighting. As he spoke at a news conference, shelling duels continued  between Christian gunners and an alliance of Druze militia and Syrian troops  who have ignored Friday's cease-fire call by the Arab League. Police said at  least two people were killed and eight wounded in the day of conflict.  </P></p>

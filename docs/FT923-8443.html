			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Manchester's Olympic bid YESTERDAY felt flat. The return to normal life, after two spectacular Spanish weeks of colour and international competition, must have induced a sense of loss in all but the most fervent anti-Olympian. But shrug off that morning-after-the-fortnight-before depression. Preparations to recreate the Barcelona spirit in Atlanta in 1996 are advanced, and the race to host the 27th Olympiad in 2000 is under way. The competition will be fierce, with Sydney and Beijing leading the field. At this stage, Manchester looks like a plucky outsider. It requires a sober head to assess the economic merits of hosting the games. Good parties are great to attend; but they can be costly to throw. The citizens of Montreal are still paying the bills for the 1976 Olympics. British tax-payers will have to provide much more than the Pounds 55m that the government has so far pledged. Yet the Olympics have become an increasingly attractive economic prospect since Los Angeles infused them with some American enterprise in 1984. It is too early to assess the final economic impact of this year's Olympics on the economy of north-east Spain. But the organisers claim strong ticket sales, and Barcelona expects to repay six years of hard work with a small profit. .TX- Intangible benefits The wider economic impact is expected to be much greater. Direct investment in the games amounted to Pounds 5.2bn, of which 82 per cent came from the public purse. Most of this was spent on motorways, communications and low income housing while only 11 per cent directly related to sports infrastructure. A city of Barcelona report estimates that the total extra spending in the Catalan economy will total almost Pounds 16bn over the entire 1987-92 period. Add to this the intangible benefits stemming from the success of the Barcelona games - the publicity and stature it has gained in the international community, the confidence and pride it has breathed into the region. These are tempting dreams for Manchester which, like Barcelona, is a second city. A study commissioned by the Manchester bid team from the Manchester Business School claims that the games could attract Pounds 2bn in investment and create 50,000 new jobs. This would hardly solve the region's chronic problems, but it would certainly help. As important, a successful Manchester bid could do wonders for the region's morale, redressing the damaging imbalance that tilts so many resources into the south-east. If Britain is to bid at all for the Olympics, it is best that the proposed location is somewhere other than London. Worthy aspirations Yet Barcelona has also demonstrated that hosting a modern Olympics is no small commitment; and, despite the worthy aspirations of the Olympic organising committee, the circus is likely to get bigger rather than smaller between now and the end of the decade. Manchester and its surrounding region, unlike London, has the space and the basic transport infrastructure to cope with the huge scale of a modern Olympics. But against Barcelona's huge investments, the bid committee's estimate that a Manchester Olympics would cost about Pounds 1bn looks misjudged. Public investment is forecast to cover only a third of that cost, considerably less than in Spain. The recent sorry experience of public-private sector partnerships for infrastructure investment in London's Docklands shows that these arrangements can go badly wrong. Now that the Barcelona party is over, the Manchester committee has its work cut out. In framing a fully detailed proposal, it will have to establish private-sector deals so that the government can come clean about the scale of public expenditure potentially involved. So far, the prime minister has spoken vaguely of pro-viding 'substantial public funding'. A millennial Olympiad as exuberant and rewarding as Barcelona's would be wonderful for Manchester and good for Britain. The next 14 months will determine whether the International Olympics Committee will give Manchester its chance. That period also needs to be used to ensure that Manchester's bid is more like Barcelona's than Montreal's.</p>

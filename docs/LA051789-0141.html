			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1,000,000 PROTESTERS FORCE GORBACHEV TO CUT ITINERARY;  </P> <P> THE CENTER OF BEIJING IS PARALYZED  </P> <P> More than a million demonstrators in Beijing and legions more in almost every  provincial capital of China took to the streets today in the biggest  anti-government protests since the 1949 Communist revolution.  </P> <P> The center of Beijing was paralyzed almost all day, forcing visiting Soviet  leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to change his schedule completely in what diplomats  said was a humiliating experience for China's leaders.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader had to cancel a visit to the Forbidden City in central  Beijing and to move the news conference from the Great Hall to the guest house  where he was staying.  </P> <P> "All these rallies made us nervous," Gorbachev said in an interview broadcast  by Chinese television. But he said his visit, which has produced a  normalization of Sino-Soviet relations after a 30-year chill, was going well.  </P> <P> With no formal meetings scheduled today, Gorbachev delivered a keynote address  to Chinese intellectuals, tramped around the Great Wall with his wife Raisa and  held the news conference at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in western Beijing.  </P> <P> The protest was dominated today for the first time by workers rather than  students. The march began in central Tian An Men Square, the site of a hunger  strike, to the sound of firecrackers set off under the huge poster of Mao  Tse-tung at the entrance to the former Imperial Palace.  </P> <P> Many demonstrators carried banners and shouted slogans demanding the  resignation of 85-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping for not resolving the  plight of students who called the hunger strike for democratic freedoms.  </P> <P> "I would not take on myself the role of a judge or deliver assessments of what  is going on," Gorbachev said after arriving two hours late for a news  conference, the site of which had been hastily changed to the official guest  house.  </P> <P> "There is a difficult but genuine dialogue under way between the Chinese  leaders and the students and other groups in Chinese society. . . . We should  welcome the fact that there is a political dialogue and we must hope that  solutions will be found," he added.  </P> <P> Pressed to comment on the protests, Gorbachev told reporters the process of  reform in communist countries is sometimes painful.  </P> <P> He declined to answer directly when asked what lessons he might take back to  the Soviet Union, itself in the throes of a radical political shake-up that has  brought demonstrators into the streets of Moscow and other cities.  </P> <P> "I think that in the Soviet Union, as well, if such a situation arose -- and  problems of a similar order could arise -- we would look at them in a concrete  fashion and find political methods to solve them," he said.  </P> <P> In Shanghai, where Gorbachev is due to meet the local Communist Party chief  Thursday on the last day of his four-day visit to China, about 20,000 students  and some workers were demonstrating outside government headquarters.  </P> <P> The peaceful protests were the climax of mounting anti-government sentiment  which engulfed Beijing in wave after wave of marching students, factory  workers, shopkeepers, civil servants, teachers, journalists, peasants and even  uniformed recruits from Beijing's police academy.  </P></p>

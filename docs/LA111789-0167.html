			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SAVANNA HIGH PROPERLY BARRED FROM TOURNAMENT, COURT RULES  </P> <P> The football season for Savanna High School ended in Orange County Superior  Court today when a commissioner ruled that the team had been properly kicked  out of postseason play for fielding an ineligible player.  </P> <P> The court ruling came on the heels' of an appellate court decision Thursday  ousting Huntington Beach's football team from the postseason tournament for  similar reasons. (Story, A1.)  </P> <P> The Savanna Rebels' booster club went to court Thursday to get the team  reinstated. The Rebels were disqualified for using a player who was in his  fifth year of high school. The rules of the California Scholastic  Federation-Southern Section, which govern local high school athletics, allow  only four years of eligibility.  </P> <P> "I see no abuse of discretion or violation of the rules," Commissioner Julian  Cimbaluk said in denying Savanna's request to be reinstated. "They (league  officials) didn't arbitrarily disqualify the team. They had the right to do so  under the rules."  </P> <P> Cimbaluk also questioned whether the booster club even had legal standing to  sue on behalf of the football team.  </P> <P> "The courts will not interfere with the discipline or expulsion of members of  private organizations or associations where the action was taken in good faith  in accordance with its rules," Cimbaluk said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A TRIO IN THE NAT KING COLE TRADITION  </P> <P> Members of Triple Treat, who converged on Catalina's Bar &amp; Grill on  Thursday for a four-day run, had not played together in three months, yet from  the first two-bar riff of Horace Silver's "Sister Sadie" it was as if they had  never been apart.  </P> <P> The reason was simple: The men are Monty Alexander, Ray Brown and Herb Ellis,  mature veterans (at 46 Alexander is the youngest) who, after years of  intermittent collaboration, have achieved the precision of a Swiss watch. The  metaphor may be a trifle misleading, since there is no semblance of  clockworklike rigidity in their uniquely loose, consistently swinging  performances.  </P> <P> As is often the case with piano-guitar-bass groups (a jazz tradition that began  half a century ago with the Nat King Cole Trio) the pianist seemed to be the de  facto leader, yet there was not a tune in which Brown's bass and Ellis' guitar  failed to contribute significantly.  </P> <P> The blues seemed often to be a centrifugal force that drew them together, even  when the 12-bar idiom was not precisely followed, as in an Alexander original,  "Think Twice," routined with tempo changes and a darting solo interlude by the  composer; and again in a double-time blues that sounded like a variation on "Hi  Heel Sneakers" that brought the set to a gospel-tinged finale.  </P> <P> At a time when so many groups shamelessly plug their albums, it was a surprise  to observe that Triple Treat goes to the other extreme; not a word was spoken  from start to finish, leaving listeners to wonder whether this or that tune was  a standard or an original, and why certain numbers seemed vaguely familiar. The  latter speculation may have applied to the delectable waltz "Always," to which  Alexander applied additions and redefinitions far beyond the harmonic  imagination of Irving Berlin, who wrote this basically simple melody in 1925.  </P> <P> Other chestnuts in the first set were Ray Noble's "The Very Thought of You"  (1934), with a spellbinding Ray Brown solo; and "I Want to Be Happy," a Vincent  Youmans ditty to which the trio appended one of those repeated-riff tags that  seemed to imply a reluctance to stop.  </P> <P> Ellis, for whom this instrumentation is second nature (he and Brown toured  together for five years with Oscar Peterson), soloed with his accustomed  age-proof, blues-informed ease. In short, Triple Treat lives up to its name and  to the illustrious reputations of its components. The gig ends Sunday. LEONARD  FEATHER  </P></p>

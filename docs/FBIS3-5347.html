Commenting on  this, MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined commentary says it is the  scream of a fool reckless of his position.    The paper continues:    With the agreement on four immediate steps of simultaneous  action for a package solution of the nuclear issue at the  DPRK-USA contact in New York, a prospect that the peaceful  solution process of the nuclear issue may be again on the right  orbit has opened.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying to get rid of his  secluded  position by excusing himself for failing to participate in the  DPRK-USA talks for a resolution to the nuclear issue. However,  his attempt only betrays his ignorance of the outbreak of the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the way of its  solution.    For a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue as well as  improvement of the North-South relations, such a fool as the  traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed without delay.</p>

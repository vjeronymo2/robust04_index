M. Pei building in the heart  of Beverly Hills, attorney Peter Dekom's elegant wood-paneled office high above  Sunset Boulevard, or Jake Eberts' table at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills  Hotel, where the London-based producer frequently resides.  </P> <P> Ovitz, Dekom and Eberts are part of an elite corps of Hollywood insiders who  have served as location scouts for Japanese investors eager to get into the  glamorous -- but risky -- world of moviemaking. Not content to rely only on New  York investment bankers, the Japanese have turned to Hollywood's insiders to  advise them on talent and movie projects, to sort out the charlatans and  self-promoters from the true success stories, to make introductions to  trustworthy business partners.  </P> <P> "The history of outside investments in Hollywood has been a fairly unfortunate  one," says Christopher Murray, an O'Melveny &amp; Myers attorney who worked on  the recent formation of Media International Corp., a $200-million consortium of  major Japanese companies that will fund everything from movie production to  sports programming. Adds Robert Cort, president of Interscope Communications:  "A lot of people who have come into Hollywood have done so with a real sense of  arrogance."  </P> <P> The Japanese want to avoid the mistakes of past investors.  </P> <P> In Hollywood, reality is rarely what it appears to be. An executive producer  credit can mean no more than that the lucky recipient finagled part of an  option on a movie script. A movie that looks like a box-office hit can actually  be a money loser. A star with a household name could be at the brink of a  career slide.  </P> <P> "Investment bankers can evaluate the worth of an investment on the basis of  economics," says Lee Rosenberg, a partner with Triad Artists talent agency. "We  see things from a different perspective -- the human element, the creative  side."  </P> <P> That's where Japan's Hollywood-based contacts come in. Forty-three-old Dekom  cuts his own swath in the cliquish world of Hollywood. He and his firm --  Bloom, Dekom &amp; Hergott -- are known for doing more than simply giving legal  advice to such clients as actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Kim  Basinger, directors George Lucas and Ron Howard, and producers Don Simpson and  Jerry Bruckheimer. Dekom and his partners also know who's up and who's down,  which companies are in need of cash, and which studio executive is coming in or  going out (Universal Pictures Chairman Thomas Pollock was a partner in the  firm, and clients have included 20th Century Fox chairman Joe Roth and former  Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel).  </P> <P> About three years ago, JVC/Victor Co. of Japan joined the firm's roster, with  Dekom and his partner Melanie Cook doing general legal work for the company.  Then JVC officials said they wanted to invest in Hollywood. Dekom looked around  at the options, but didn't like what he saw.  </P> <P> "In those days, people were submitting things to Japan (for financing) that  they couldn't get any other way," Dekom recalls. So Dekom proposed what he  calls his "home-grown" solution. He introduced JVC to another client, producer  Lawrence Gordon. The Japanese last year agreed to invest $100 million in equity  and debt guarantees in a new company called Largo Entertainment to be run by  Gordon. Dekom designed the business plan (in return he was given a small  ownership position), and JVC agreed to cede total creative control to Gordon.  </P> <P> Eberts was no stranger to international financing or moviemaking. The former  Canadian chemical engineer and financier founded the independent film company  Goldcrest, which released such Oscar-winning pictures as "Chariots of Fire" and  "Gandhi" before its demise (which Eberts has chronicled in a new book, "My  Indecision Is Final"). Eberts has strong ties to such English film people as  David Puttnam and Richard Attenborough and has raised money for filmmaking  efforts from overseas sources.  </P> <P> Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown -- a joint venture between the Japanese securities  giant and an American financing firm -- plucked Eberts' name off a short list  of major Hollywood producers and put him to work looking for investment  opportunities. "He was a consultant, advising us on the inner workings of the  industry." says Richard Koffey, managing director of Babcock &amp; Brown, the  San Francisco firm that has teamed with Nomura Securities Co.  </P> <P> Eberts helped the company settle on a strategy of cautiously wading into  Hollywood's murky waters with a couple of $100-million investments in  well-capitalized independents. Murray served as Nomura's attorney.  </P> <P> After Eberts made the introductions, Nomura Babcock invested $100 million in  Morgan Creek films (now distributed by Warner Bros.) and committed to at least  $100 million investment in Interscope movies to be distributed and co-financed  by Disney. Both independent companies have enjoyed strong success: Morgan Creek  with films like "Young Guns"; Interscope with hits like "Three Men and a Baby."  </P> <P> Eberts, who declined to discuss the details of either deal, noted that once an  introduction is made, the Japanese -- or their American partners -- take over  the negotiations and his role is phased out. Morgan Creek chief executive James  Robinson, for example, has negotiated directly with Nomura Babcock since that  first introduction more than a year ago.  </P> <P> "The Japanese have a tendency to do a lot of reconnaissance," says Robinson.  "While initially they use intermediaries, once they get into a deal, they will  use their own people."  </P> <P> The point man who has made the biggest splash is Ovitz, now advising Matsushita  Electric Industrial Co. on its hoped-for buyout of MCA, owner of Universal  Pictures -- a deal that could be worth anywhere from $6 billion to $8 billion.  Industry sources say CAA has been advising Japanese companies for five years  now, but it wasn't until Ovitz's name popped up in Sony's search for a studio  that some details about his sideline business surfaced.  </P> <P> In late 1988, Sony hired Ovitz as a consultant once it began shopping in  earnest for a Hollywood studio. His connection to Sony came through the former  chief of Sony's CBS Records unit, Walter Yetnikoff, according to industry  sources. Yetnikoff's relationship with Ovitz dated back to his movie deal with  Disney, which Ovitz had brokered. (Out of that deal came just one movie credit  for Yetnikoff -- as executive producer on "Ruthless People.")  </P> <P> According to insiders, Sony officials who met Ovitz were particularly impressed  by his early and accurate predictions of box-office and Academy Award attention  for "Rain Man," a film starring CAA clients Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise and  directed by CAA client Barry Levinson.  </P> <P> Sony already had an investment bank on retainer -- New York's Blackstone Group  -- but it needed Ovitz to give an insider's view on studios that it was  interested in buying, particularly MGM/UA, Columbia Pictures and MCA. His  efforts included assessing each company's movie slate and valuing the studios'  ties to talent.  </P> <P> Sources close to the deal say Ovitz also smoothed rough waters between Sony's  Yetnikoff and then-Columbia chief executive Victor Kaufman.  </P> <P> Ovitz's efforts apparently were impressive enough to earn a job offer from Sony  once the Japanese company settled on Columbia Pictures. Ovitz turned it down,  however, and Sony -- following Yetnikoff's advice -- hired producers Peter  Guber and Jon Peters.  </P> <P> Ovitz's role in leading Matsushita to MCA came as no surprise to those familiar  with that Japanese company's corporate style. "(Matsushita executives) are not  real risk takers," said Steven Clemons, executive director of the Japan America  Society. "They are using Ovitz because he was successful with Sony."  </P> <P> There remains widespread speculation inside Hollywood that Ovitz will  eventually take a top job at MCA if the deal goes through, though CAA officials  say there are no current plans for him to do so. Still, the speculation has  been greeted with glee by competing agents, who are hoping that an Ovitz  departure would weaken CAA, and some studio executives, who blame CAA's  aggressive dealmaking on behalf of clients for the rise in movie production  costs.  </P> <P> Regardless of Ovitz's future plans, these Japanese connections could be quite  lucrative for CAA. It is unclear what the agency earned for its Sony services  -- or what it will earn if Matsushita's bid for MCA goes through. But  knowledgeable industry sources say it is possible that CAA could make the  equivalent of an investment banker's fee, or .5% of the total deal. On an $8  billion buyout of MCA, that fee would be $40 million. (While CAA's total  revenues are a closely guarded secret, some very rough estimates put them at  about $70 million.)  </P> <P> Given the potential earnings from acting as Japan's tour guides, it's little  wonder that other talent agencies also are turning their attention in that  direction. ICM has advised some Japanese media concerns in the past and is  expected to do much more in the future. Triad's Rosenberg has made trips to  Japan to drum up business for his agency.  </P> <P> At this point there appears to be plenty of business to go around. When  attorney Murray spoke at a Tokyo seminar on Hollywood investment last spring,  the room was packed with representatives of industries as diverse as steel and  energy. "Even Osaka Gas sent several representatives," he noted. "That would be  like SoCal Edison investing in Hollywood."  </P> <P> </P> <P>  BACKGROUND  </P> <P> In the last three years, major Japanese companies have started financing  Hollywood movies and looking for takeover targets among the major studios. The  electronics giant Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures last year for $3.4  billion. Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. is now considering a buyout of  MCA, which owns Universal Pictures, for a reported $6 billion to $8 billion. In  these, as well as much smaller deals, the Japanese have turned to Hollywood  insiders to provide needed expertise on movies, actors and entertainment  executives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE POWER BROKERS AND THE ROLES THEY PLAY  </P> <P> MICHAEL OVITZ  </P> <P> Chairman of Creative Artists Agency  </P> <P> In late 1988, Sony hired Ovitz as a consultant once it began shopping in  earnest for a Hollywood studio.  </P> <P> PETER DEKOM  </P> <P> Attorney  </P> <P> Dekom helped JVC/Victor Co. of Japan finance its own production company, run by  Dekom client Lawrence Gordon.  </P> <P> JAKE EBERTS  </P> <P> Producer and financier  </P> <P> Eberts helped Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown settle on a strategy of investing in a  pair of Hollywood independents.  </P></p>

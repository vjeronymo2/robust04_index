			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Observer: Say it ain't so Towns in the American west change their names at the drop of a cowboy hat. Early in the century, two Utah towns were so keen to win a philanthropist's library that one called itself after him, Bicknell, with the other assuming his wife's maiden name, Blanding. And 40 years back, Hot Springs in New Mexico took the shilling of a hit radio show and became Truth or Consequences. Now the obscure hamlet of Ismay has followed the same opportunistic path, renaming itself for America's most famous football player. Welcome to Joe, Montana.</p>

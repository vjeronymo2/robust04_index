			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: THE BEST WAY TO WHIP CREAM  </P> <P> Our Back to Basics column on beating egg whites prompted a request for a  similar technique -- whipping cream correctly. Once again a wire whisk can be  used for the task, but those lacking a strong arm may opt for an electric  mixer.  </P> <P> It's important to begin with a bowl and beaters that are not only spotlessly  clean but chilled in the refrigerator at least two hours. The whipping cream  also should be well-chilled and at least a day old (hardly a problem for the  average consumer). Fat content of the cream must be between 30% and 40% for it  to whip satisfactorily.  </P> <P> The cream will double in volume during whipping, so place it in a bowl large  enough to accommodate this increased amount. Begin beating on medium-high  speed.  </P> <P> After a few seconds the cream will become frothy (Photo 1). This is the stage  to begin adding sugar or flavorings, if desired. As the cream begins to  thicken, lower the mixer speed and watch carefully, periodically stopping to  check the progress.  </P> <P> Cream beaten to the soft peak stage (Photo 2) is soft, still glossy and  incorporates well with other ingredients. When the beaters are lifted, the  cream folds in soft peaks or drops in large globs. This is comparable to the  stiff, but not dry, stage of beaten egg whites.  </P> <P> If the cream is to be used decoratively, continue beating to the stiff peak  stage (Photo 3) . It may then be spooned in dollops, sculpted or placed in a  pastry bag with a decorative tip.  </P> <P> Overbeaten cream (Photo 4) will eventually clump and turn to butter. If only  slightly overbeaten, however, it's possible to recover the product by adding  one to two more tablespoons cream and continuing to beat.  </P> <P> It's best to whip cream just before using. If it must be prepared ahead, some  sources suggest adding a small amount of powdered sugar during the beating  process. The cornstarch in this type of sugar acts as a stabilizer. Other  references suggest adding a packet of unflavored gelatin, softened in one  tablespoon water, for each cup of whipping cream. Beat the gelatin in as the  cream begins to stiffen.  </P> <P>  Requests for explanations of cooking techniques may be sent to Back to Basics,  Food Section, The Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

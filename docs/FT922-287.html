			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Russia's reformers must disguise their success THE INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund is at present trying to draw up an economic agreement with the Russian government on the basis of, at best, crude and partial economic information. But the scale of Russia's task means that even the statistics that do exist are tricky to interpret. The Russian economy is shrinking and unemployment is rising.  But does this prove that the reforms are failing, as opponents argue?  Or, conversely, that a rapid economic transformation is under way? Confusion over measures of success and failure have dogged every reform-minded east European government. Even more than in the west, Russian policy-makers and headline writers have been educated to believe that rising production is good and unemployment is bad. Reports that industrial output fell by 13.2 per cent in the first five months of 1992, compared to the same period a year ago, or that unemployment has risen by 140 per cent since last December, must bring beads of sweat to Mr Boris Yeltsin's brow. Unemployment in Russia is, in fact, very low by western standards.  The government reports 151,000 registered unemployed in April, just 0.2 per cent of its 75m workforce, although many of these employees are at present on semi-permanent paid holidays. Once credits to enterprises dry up, and some go bankrupt, this hidden unemployment will emerge. The government has forecast a sixty-fold increase in unemployment to between 3.5m and 4m by the end of this year, while the International Labour Organisation, an arm of the UN, expects 10m-11m. But even if the UN's pessimism proves correct, an unemployment rate of 14.5 per cent would not be much higher than in many western European countries and lower than in both Spain and Ireland. A western-style unemployment rate in Russia is necessary to control the pressure for inflationary wage increases, argues Professor Richard Layard, of the London School of Economics, and currently an adviser to the Russian ministry of labour. 'Responsible monetary policy works by creating enough unemployment to control inflation. . . substantial unemployment is in fact an inevitable price that is paid for freedom and prosperity.' Yet while the unemployment side-effect of tight monetary policy in Poland has proved similar to that of Germany in 1948 or Spain in the late 1970s - Polish unemployment had to rise further because it started lower, as the chart shows - its output response has been very different. Output per worker rose in both Germany and Spain from the beginning of their stabilisation programmes, although Germany had experienced falls in output in the years before 1948. But rising unemployment in eastern Europe has been accompanied by sharp falls in output. Yet Russia, unlike Spain in the late 1970s, does not need rapidly rising industrial output. Indeed, it needs the opposite:  de-industrialisation and the transformation of much of what remains.  Many Russian enterprises are unviable not because their wage bills are too high but because the market for their products has disappeared, particularly in the defence industry or where they relied on intra-eastern European trade. Falling industrial output, far from being a sign of failure or a necessary evil, will allow the puny service and retail sectors to expand. Rising unemployment, far from being a necessary evil, will encourage workers to change jobs. The Russian government has to ensure that economic upheaval occurs at a politically acceptable pace. 'As a matter of political economy,' argues Professor Stanley Fischer of MIT, in a forthcoming Brookings Institute paper, 'a very rapid decline in production, even production that has ultimately to disappear, may stop a reform programme in its tracks.' The Russian government is disguising the true level of unemployment by paying subsidies to unviable enterprises. The success of its stabilisation programme will depend on whether it can continue to so until privatisation nurtures alternative opportunities but without financing its budget deficit by printing money. Enter the IMF.</p>

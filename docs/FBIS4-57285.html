			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The PRD was harshly criticized when its  presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano met  yesterday with the general command of the EZLN in Guadalupe  Tepeyac, Chiapas State. Subcommander Marcos said that a better  Mexico might surface if EZLN demands are taken into  consideration.    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] We want to thank all  the men, women, children, and old folks, who got together to  receive and feed Mr. Cardenas Solorzano and the persons  accompanying him. These children, old folks, women, and men are  the true support of our EZLN, its [words indistinct]. If any  government were to be based on them, it would be a good  government. [end recording]    That is what Subcommander Marcos said. In addition, he told  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas that the PRD is not a democratic party.    Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential  candidate from the National Action Party, ruled out any  possibility of meeting with Subcommander Marcos. Diego  Fernandez de Cevallos says he cannot meet with a person who  covers his face, even though his reasons may be justified.</p>

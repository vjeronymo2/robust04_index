			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Dispute delays EC push for Japan trade A EUROPEAN Commission initiative to try to open up Japanese markets for European companies is well behind schedule because of disagreements between the Commission and the Japanese government over how it should be conducted. A joint working group to monitor EC trade with Japan is likely to get under way by late spring next year, far later than the Commission had hoped. The analysis of EC trade with Japan, which the Commission proposed in May as a central plank of its economic dialogue with Tokyo, was supposed to provide the basis for an annual ministerial review of the issue. The project could provide the first test of whether the general joint EC-Japan declaration on political and economic co-operation adopted at The Hague last year will lead to detailed economic policy recommendations. The Japanese government reluctantly agreed to set up the working group in response to the European Community's mounting concern about its growing trade deficit with Japan, which is likely to reach record levels this year. However, the working group has yet to start work because the scheme has been dogged by disputes over the proper statistics to use. The initiative has been delayed in part because it has taken much longer than expected to collect the relevant information from Community member states. The scheme was heralded as the start of a more comprehensive and rigorous EC approach to trade with Japan when it was announced in May in a Commission report to the Council of Ministers. The proposal was partly a response to the development of bilateral trade talks between the US and Japan which Community officials fear will disadvantage European companies in the Japanese market. The US has been reviewing access to the Japanese market through the Structural Impediments Initiative launched in 1989. The Commission's report noted that the Community's exports to Japan fell by about 4 per cent last year, while the EC's trade deficit with Japan rose by 25 per cent to Ecu29.5bn (Pounds 23.98bn). Japan's trade surplus with the EC was worth Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10.7bn) in the first half of this year, fuelled by an 11 per cent rise in Japanese exports to Europe. Under the plan, the Commission would identify obstacles which EC companies face in the Japanese market, partly by comparing their performance in Japan with their exports to similar markets. The Commission says it will 'then proceed to a regular and systematic evaluation with the Japanese authorities of the results of the analysis. This analysis should lead to recommendations on the measures required to advance the penetration of Japanese markets by Community companies'.</p>

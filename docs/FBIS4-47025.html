			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid </F> Mukhametshin, by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA staff correspondent Dmitriy  Mikhaylin, special to IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA; place and date not  given: "Farid Mukhametshin: 'There Were No Sensations...."]    [Text] [Mikhaylin] Farid Khayrullovich, the 20th session of  Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet, about which there had been so much  talk and of which so much had been expected, finally took place.  Did it meet your personal expectations?    [Mukhametshin] Yes, both the people's deputies and republic  voters, and especially economic managers, had been waiting for  this session. Waiting with some anxiety, especially with respect  to the main issue--the government program for getting the  republic's economy out of the crisis.    The government was unable to prepare such a program. But as  the first step it offered "Priority Measures on Stabilization of  the Republic of Tatarstan Economy." Later, these measures, after  taking into account people's deputies' proposals and comments,  ought to grow into a normal economic program.    Of course, one month (and this is how long the Supreme  Soviet  gave the government at the previous session) is not enough to  prepare such a program. They needed to analyze the state of the  economy, appraise the potential of the republic itself and of  implementing the economic aspects of the treaty and agreements  with Russia, and look into real opportunities of attracting  foreign investment.    There were no sensations at the session, of the kind many  had  expected and predicted--such as the government's resignation.  Nevertheless, the deputies did some serious work; in the near  future all their proposals and suggestions will be summarized  and submitted to the government for consideration in developing  the big program.    [Mikhaylin] So it will still be a program of anticrisis  measures?    [Mukhametshin] It was outlined quite well by the president  in  his speech; he said, in particular, that it will be a program of  the Republic of Tatarstan's socioeconomic progress. It will be  broader than merely an anticrisis program. The subject here is  not only the stabilization of the republic's economy, but also  its progress.    [Mikhaylin] While it is under preparation, can the  government  be guided by the "Priority Measures...," which were adopted as  the basis?    [Mukhametshin] Yes; by adopting this document as a basis, we  gave the government the "green light." And generally, as one  deputy put it, we should support even the smallest steps on the  part of the government toward economic stabilization.    About 10 draft laws necessary for the implementation of  these  measures have been submitted to the Supreme Soviet now, along  with draft presidential edicts, which should be put into action  in the very near future. Then the government, on the basis of  the "Priority Measures..." developed by it and approved by the  parliament, will be able to work normally.    [Mikhaylin] The "auxiliary" measures apparently also include  granting additional powers to the president, do they not?    [Mukhametshin] The president needs them precisely in order  to  speed up the adoption of anticrisis measures. The Supreme Soviet  has certain procedures for adopting laws: discussion in  commissions, adoption in the first draft, second draft, and so  on. Such a painstaking process produces quality laws, but it  does stretch out the process of their adoption. We do not have  all the time now. Therefore, the president was given the right  to issue laws aimed at stabilization of the republic economy.    [Mikhaylin] Now let us go back to the beginning: What is the  substance of the economic stabilization measures adopted by the  parliament?    [Mukhametshin] If you recall, at the previous Supreme Soviet  session, during the discussion on the republic budget for the  current year, the deputies raised the issue of the state of the  republic economy and the need to take urgent measures to  stabilize it. A corresponding decree was adopted, which set the  work in this direction in motion. It boils down to a compromise  between the need to radicalize the reforms and our proclaimed  policy of "soft" entry into a market, protecting both goods  producers and the consumers, that is, the population. Therefore,  it is only natural that questions of social protection were  considered simultaneously with the discussion of "Priority  Measures...."    Our situation has changed dramatically as compared to last  year. Altogether, last year was not a typical one for us: The  treaty with the Russian Federation was not yet signed, which  means that we shared taxes to a considerably lesser extent; we  sold oil at sufficiently high world prices, while this year they  dropped; the level of oil production also has dropped. There are  also a number of factors that enable us to speak of serious  economic decline.    Therefore, now, whether we want to or not, we will have to  live "frugally," count every budget penny. It will also be  necessary to reduce the government, reduce the state vehicles  pool....    [Mikhaylin] Apparently this "frugality" will also affect  some  social programs?    [Mukhametshin] It is clear that no new social programs will  be implemented in the near future. But neither will those  programs we had approved when closing the budget be completely  folded. Moreover, during the recent visit of the Russian  president, an agreement was reached that some programs will be  elevated to the status of federal programs and will be paid for  from the Russian budget.    [Mikhaylin] At the previous session of the parliament, and  even earlier, there was much talk about worsening relations  between it and the government. Have your positions been brought  closer at this session or, on the contrary, has the schism  deepened even more?    [Mukhametshin] Well, I would not put it this way. There is  always some criticism inherent in relations between the  parliament and the government. After all, the Supreme Soviet is  a body elected by the people, and it simply is its  responsibility to oversee and criticize the government for some  or other shortcomings.    It is another matter that by vesting certain powers in  socioeconomic issues with the president, we, I think, diminish  the role and the place of the government itself. This can happen  in two instances: when the government is not doing its work  properly, or if the task is to shift the burden of  responsibility for dealing with these tasks onto the  president....    [Mikhaylin] What stage of its life is Tatarstan entering  now?  If in the past it was a "soft" entry into a market and defining  relations with Russia, what strategic goal does the republic  leadership set for itself now?    [Mukhametshin] Recently, before signing the treaty with  Russia, we devoted too much attention to politics--fighting for  sovereignty, additional powers, defining the status, and so on.  We spent more than two years on this.    The time has come when we have to pay the closest attention  to our own economy. This is where the deputy corps will focus,  and the government, too, I think.    The time has come to search for a model of economic reforms  in Tatarstan, kicking the market mechanism into full gear. We  have to stop talking about getting the reforms going and  actually do it.    The substance of reforms, in my opinion, should boil down to  getting enterprises of all forms of ownership--both private and  the remaining state sector--to work; in adjusting the tax system  in such a way that would produce an increased tax flow into the  budget but at the same time would not place an undue burden on  goods producers. As a third defining measure of this new  economic policy, we must adjust the flow of finances, so that  money would not just make more money, but participate in  economic revival, activating the formula "money--goods--money."  The fourth measure should be redistribution of labor resources  between sectors, between enterprises, and so on--in order to  avoid a sharp increase in unemployment.    The "soft" entry into a market has done its part. The  reforms  did not hit our citizens as badly as has happened in many other  regions of Russia. Now, however, we have to quickly and firmly  launch new economic mechanisms, because this is precisely a case  in which delay is equivalent to death.    [Mikhaylin] And the last question which we cannot fail to  touch upon--the leaving in effect until 1 January 1995 of the  law "On Extraordinary Measures of Combating Crime...."    [Mukhametshin] Yes, this is indeed a serious question. Many  deputies demanded its repeal, but most interestingly, did not  offer anything instead. At the same time, we cannot leave the  crime situation as is. There probably are some abuses on the  part of the militia. But this law not only gives the militia  rights--it places responsibilities on it.    We constantly monitor the implementation of this law; we  believe that it should not make a single innocent person suffer.  Because otherwise a law written with the aim to help people will  actually turn against them. We cannot allow this, just as we  cannot allow the economic reforms that we are about to begin  implementing to deal a blow to the well-being of our citizens.</p>

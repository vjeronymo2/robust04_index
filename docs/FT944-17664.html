			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Fresh setback for Indonesian press Attempts to invigorate Indonesia's battered media received another setback yesterday when the government threatened to ban a relaunched weekly tabloid, which had been forced to close in June. The official state-backed journalists' association, the PWI, withdrew its support for the editor of Simponi, a reorganised version of DeTik launched on Monday. Journalists say the association is acting on instructions from the ministry of information and the move 'lays the ground for an eventual ban'. According to the many rules laid down by the ministry of information, a publication's editors and journalists must be endorsed by the PWI to obtain a publishing licence. Critics say the ministry is simply looking for a technical excuse to close down Simponi, arguing that almost all publications in Indonesia hire employees not members of the journalists' association. Mr Subrata, director-general of press and graphics at the department of information, was not available and other officials declined to comment. Simponi went on sale on Tuesday with an initial print run of 150,000 copies, featuring a cover story on the role of former President Sukarno in the 1965 coup d'etat. The tabloid's staff is made up of some 60 former DeTik journalists, banned in June with two other leading publications, Tempo and Editor, in what amounted to the most severe media crackdown in years.</p>

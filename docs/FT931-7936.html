			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Salvation Army not so silent Sir, The FT ('Bank probed in Britain and US', February 20) gives a misleading impression in saying that the Salvation Army has 'remained silent' over developments in its attempts to recover Dollars 8.8m missing in an alleged fraud. The Army's intention to be open about the matter was reflected by the fact that it issued a statement on February 16, which was widely reported in the media. It issued writs against 15 defendants. Extracts from these writs have been widely reported. The Army now has to balance the public's right to know the facts with the need to recover the missing money. Its lawyers have advised that, to go beyond the statement already made, could jeopardise that recovery. John Larsson, commander, UK territory, The Salvation Army</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US and Japan put off talks as scandal widens JAPAN and the US have postponed a meeting, due to begin tomorrow, to review foreign access to the Japanese construction market, as each side argued that a gathering was futile when the other was unwilling to compromise. The postponement comes in the midst of a broadening Japanese political scandal, which has seen prosecutors unearth evidence to support past US claims that bid-rigging is common and that the contract process lacks transparency, leaving it open to unfair manipulation. But the US says the scandal was not the cause of the disagreement between the countries. Both had prepared proposals for discussion at the meeting, called to examine technical standards for contracts, but the two sides were so far apart that there was no point in proceeding. The meeting, scheduled to be held in Washington, was not expected to deal with the even more sensitive issue of whether Japan will increase from 34 the number of projects for which simplified bidding procedures have been adopted for foreign contractors. A Japanese construction ministry official said there is a 'big gap' between the two countries and the 'US shows no intention of wanting to narrow that gap'. The fresh differences suggest that the issue may be high on the agenda when Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, visits Washington next month. Japanese officials are concerned that the political scandal, arising from an investigation into Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, will encourage US officials to take a tougher stand on market access. Mr Miyazawa said told the Japanese parliament yesterday that 'all possible measures' would be taken to ensure the transparency of public works bidding procedures. He is under pressure to introduce reforms, as prosecutors found materials suggesting that companies awarded construction projects routinely donated a small percentage of the revenue to the LDP.</p>

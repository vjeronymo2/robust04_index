			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks here this afternoon  with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who arrived here  today for a working visit.    They exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and nuclear  issues on the Korean peninsula.    Kakizawa briefed Qian on Japan's views regarding the current  situation.    Qian said that on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, it is  China's basic goal to promote denuclearization and maintain  peace and stability in the region, which are in line with the  fundamental interests of all the countries in Northeast Asia and  should be the starting point of resolving the current problems.    Qian pointed out that at present serious concerns over the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula have arisen, for which  China has much concern. "We express our regrets at the move  taken by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) on June 10 to stop its technical assistance  to the DPRK and the results brought about by the move," Qian  said.    Facing the difficulties, Qian continued, parties concerned  should keep calm, exercise restraint and not close the door of  negotiation hastily, trying every means to leave room for  solving the problem through dialogue.    Qian noted that sanctions, which would not help solve the  problem, could only intensify the contradictions and even lead  to results that all parties would not like to see.    "We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open  dialogue, mitigate contradictions and seek a way of settling the  problem step by step," Qian said.</p>

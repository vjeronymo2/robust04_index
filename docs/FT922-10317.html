			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Business optimism rises worldwide, says survey OPTIMISM about future sales and profits growth in Europe and North America has driven worldwide business hopes sharply higher, according to a survey published yesterday. A survey of more than 11,000 busines executives in 15 countries by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, found that expectations for higher sales and profits in the second quarter in Canada, the US, Germany, the UK and New Zealand, boosted worldwide optimism in spite of a sharp decline in Japanese expectations. In Japan, expectations for higher sales fell for the seventh consecutive quarter with more businesses expecting their sales to decrease than to rise. However, optimism about higher sales increased sharply in New Zealand and remained flat in Australia pushing overall expectations in the Pacific basin slightly higher. 'Japan is almost certainly entering a period of virtually no economic growth,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, vice president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet. In Europe, business optimism for higher sales and profits rose or stayed flat in all of the eight countries surveyed, except for Italy. The survey, which was carried out in February and March, also showed that optimism rebounded sharply in the UK, before the general election on April 9. Mr Duncan said increased sales and profits optimism in Germany reflected recent signs of economic growth in eastern Germany.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Dangerous </F> Relations"]    [Text] President Carlos Menem does not leave for tomorrow  what he can destroy today. Taking advantage of President Itamar  Franco's absence at the end of the Ibero-American Summit, the  Argentine chief of state devised a broad support base for the  candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is leaving the  Mexican presidency next September, to director general of the  World Trade Organization (WTO). President Menem ignored the  candidacy of current Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero  formally presented to the organization that will replace GATT.  Menem trampled over the basics of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], which includes the adoption of common action on subjects  of common interests. He tread on good manners by taking  advantage of the Brazilian delegation's absence to accomplish  his scheme. With this he obtained Latin America's informal  support for the Mexican candidate, but he also harmed relations  between Brazil and Argentina. Brazil's immediate reaction was to  cancel the visit of Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  on 27 and 28 June to Brazil: Brazilian authorities will not  have time to receive the Argentine minister.    The mood of the bilateral relations has therefore been  established. What could Brazil expect to save from the remnants  of a relation whose vitality was in the economic field, and  which Buenos Aires insists on damaging in the political field?  The impression is that Menem and his political advisers are not  capable of designing a policy of rapprochement with the United  States without harming relations with Brazil. Given that a  policy of rapprochement with the United States is not  incompatible with a good relationship with Brazil, the hostility  -- invariably unfounded -- with which we are treated is more  shocking.    The Cartagena episode is just one of a series. Before it  took  place, Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion had said  Argentina would not support Brazil's intention to obtain a  permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Minister Cavallo got  sick and tired of telling the Brazilians how to conduct their  economic affairs. When establishing regulations for Mercosur,  the Argentines went back and forth endlessly. A common external  tariff has not been established so far because Buenos Aires  hindered the process and blamed Brazil for structural  distortions that were rather due to the frozen Argentine  exchange rate, an essential part of the Cavallo Plan.    The Argentine Government knew beforehand about Minister  Ricupero's candidacy to the WTO. Argentina maintains close trade  relations with Brazil, a fact that is the embryo for a more  serious economic, social, and political integration. Menem's  underhanded action -- considering the circumstances in which he  performed it -- demonstrate an unsustainable position. The  Brazilian authority who from now on accepts the political and  moral commitments assumed by this Justicialist administration in  relations with Mercosur at face value would be foolish; the  Brazilian authority who considers Argentine policies  foreseeable, a quality that is the basis of trust, would be  irresponsible.    The Argentine Government has made its choice regarding  Brazil. It has exchanged the excellent relations we had for a  move that could end in granting Mexico, therefore NAFTA,  therefore the United States, the general direction of the World  Trade Organization. We have nothing to object to the candidacy  of Salinas or the United States, the largest world power. What  is repugnant to our conscience and goes against our good sense  is the shameless maneuver that disqualifies its author and  places its beneficiary under suspicion.    Everything indicates that President Menem will be reelected  for four more years in office. This obliges Brazilian diplomacy,  as of now, to treat Argentina with the seriousness the situation  demands and with the politeness with which we have not been  treated. In order to prevent the negative trade balance from  affecting the results of the Cavallo Plan and Mercosur, Brazil  has been purchasing from Argentina what it could buy elsewhere  with greater political gains. Mexico could supply us with the  same oil we buy from Argentina. Canada has the wheat we obtain  from Argentina. Those two countries are NAFTA members and if  the example set by the Casa Rosada [Argentine Government House]  is correct, the future is in the north and not in the south.  There is no reason for purchasing goods from Argentina just to  maintain a balance of accounts. That is the exclusive problem of  Argentina. Let us just center on the cost-benefit relation in  our trade and policy and do just what is totally gainful for us.  Argentina has so far established the terms of our relations,  clearly demonstrating that it believes that a special  relationship is a one-way path. Brazil does not have to shoulder  such a burden.</p>

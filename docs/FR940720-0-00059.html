			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2) provide signature requirements for corporate indemnity agreements as well as authorizations and affidavits to assure a corporation is bound to the terms of the agreement. The Federal regulations require that two authorized corporate officers for the applicant as well as the parent corporation execute the agreements; whereas the State's rule does not require two signatures of all the indemnitors. In the preamble to the final self-bonding rules (48 FR 36418, August 10, 1983), OSM explained in response to a comment that ``OSM does not consider it a burden on the corporation to obtain the signatures of two corporate officers on the indemnity agreement. For such an infrequent and important action, the approval of two corporate officers will better assure that the corporation and OSM are protected from possible unauthorized actions of an individual. This requirement is retained.'' The Federal regulations require an affidavit from the corporation(s) certifying that entering into the indemnity agreement is valid under all applicable Federal and State laws. Pennsylvania lacks this requirement for all of its indemnitors. In addition, this section of the Federal regulations also requires that the signatories provide the regulatory authority with documents that evidence their authority to bind the corporation (e.g. board of directors resolutions) and authorization for the parent corporation to enter into the indemnity agreement. Again, Pennsylvania does not require this. Even though the State requires the applicant and the parent to be co-indemnitors under the self-bond, the Director finds that the proposed rule is less effective than the Federal rule because it lacks all the requirements discussed above. Accordingly, the Director is requiring that Pennsylvania amend its program to be no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Pennsylvania at subsection 86.159(1)(3) requires each person with a beneficial interest in a partnership, joint venture or syndicate to be a party and co-indemnitor under the self-bond. This is substantively identical to the Federal requirement at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(3) and is, therefore, no less effective than the Federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m. Section 86.159(m). Pennsylvania proposes at subsection (m) that each indemnitor under the self-bond shall be jointly and severally liable. As the proposed amendment is substantively identical to language found at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(1), the Director finds it no less effective than the Federal rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n. Section 86.159(n). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (n) the types of security interests that may be used to secure the self-bond. In addition, this section sets out the standard the Department will use in determining the acceptability of the security interest being pledged. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o. Section 86.159(o). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (o) that during the period of the self-bond and until released in writing by the Department, the parties to the self-bond who are indemnitors may not take action which would adversely affect the Commonwealth's rights, title or interest in the security interests pledged to secure the self-bond. This proposed rule provides for default if the applicant takes action that would reduce the value of the pledged assets. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, this provision provides protection for Pennsylvania's security interests, hence the Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. Section 86.159(p). Pennsylvania proposes at section (p) that in addition to the indemnification and security required in subsection (j), the Department may require a third-party guarantee of an applicant's self-bond. A third-party guarantor shall guarantee and become surety for the performance of the parties who are indemnitors under the self-bond required by subsection (j). The guarantor must submit a perfected security interest that is acceptable to Pennsylvania. It should be noted that these third-party guarantors under the Pennsylvania program are not the same as a non-parent corporate guarantor under 30 CFR 800.23(c)(2), since the applicant and/or its parent must still meet the financial qualification regardless of any third-party guarantors. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> q. Section 86.159(q). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (q) that when the Department determines that an event of default or forfeiture under the self-bond has occurred, the determination shall also constitute a determination of the applicant's inability to self-bond. There are no counterpart Federal self-bonding regulations. However, the Director finds that the provisions of the proposed rule are not inconsistent with the bonding requirements under 30 CFR Part 800. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

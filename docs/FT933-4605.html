			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / High price to pay for drifting off course: Japan's steelmakers face lean years if there is no domestic recovery A decade of diversification has led Japanese steel-makers back to where they began, confronted by declining demand for core steel products, a bloated workforce, and the prospect of several years of red ink. In forecasting a loss for the year, Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, admitted yesterday that a restructuring begun in the mid-1980s, in response to rapid yen appreciation, had drifted off course. The yen has strengthened this year, but the diversification projects intended to carry the steel industry through the difficult times have become a burden. Nippon Steel and other leading makers expanded well beyond their expertise into leisure, including an artificial beach and ski slope, burglar alarms and a mushroom farm. Many of these projects were affordable as long as sales were rising for steel products, which profited in the late 1980s from a surge of orders from the construction, car and electronics industries. From a low of 98m tonnes in 1986, crude steel production rose to 110m tonnes in 1990. But the good times are definitely over. Crude steel production last year slipped back to 98m tonnes, and demand is still falling from traditional customers within Japan. Even exports to China, which doubled in the first half, are fading as a result of Beijing's attempts to slow its speeding economy. Mr Minoru Udono, steel industry specialist at James Capel Pacific, said the leading steelmakers may face two or three years of losses, unless there is a strong domestic recovery. Nippon Steel's decision to skip its interim dividend 'is a bad sign', according to Mr Udono. 'It means they are not expecting to return to profits very quickly. 'The unprofitable diversifications must be ended. The diversifications have been doing worse than the steel business. They face very difficult decisions on reducing their workforces.' Mr Udono estimates that the steel industry has a 17 per cent surplus of workers, but cannot afford to establish new new non-steel subsidiaries in which to park them, as is traditional in Japan. Nippon Steel hinted yesterday that it would cut administrative staff to reduce costs, and other makers may be forced to do more than allow workers to retire voluntarily. Kawasaki Steel said this week that about 200 workers aged 20 to 30 would be transferred from steelmaking to other companies in the group. Most transfers in Japan are of workers over of 45, who are put out to pasture in affiliates or subsidiaries. Japanese media interpeted the decision as a sign that other parts of the group did not want the middle-aged, middle-managers, but would take lower paid, younger staff. Kawasaki Steel said the programme was intended to 'strengthen the management of group companies'. Kawasaki's response reflects the industry's sensitivity to suggestions that Japan's lifetime employment system could crumble in the steel industry. But a call last month by Nippon Steel for a cut in salaries is an indication of the extreme pressure on steelmakers to reduce costs. Cost-cutting is needed partly because the companies are facing an increase in depreciation charges, another by-product of their investment binge during the 'bubble days'. At Kawasaki, capital spending rose from Y72.8bn in the year to March 1989 to Y184.8bn in the year to March 1991. These investments gave the company new plant and equipment just as the economy was slowing. Capital investment was trimmed in the year to March 1993 to Y139.8bn, but depreciation charges in the same year were Y121.1bn, rising from Y117.1bn and Y102.4bn in the two preceding periods. Kobe Steel has already revised its long-term management plan, drafted in December 1991. Capital spending over the next three years is estimated at around Y60bn annually, down by about half from the 1990-1992 period. If domestic recovery does not come quickly, the steelmakers may have to abandon part or all of their most cherished diversification, the excursion into electronics. All five leading steelmakers are making semiconductors or computer-related equipment, and must decide whether they can afford the enormous outlays needed to keep pace in these industries. The steelmakers have always seen themselves as the producers of Japan's 'industrial rice', and their interest in semiconductors was prompted by the belief that this sector would provide the 'industrial rice' of the future. For this year, at least, the harvest does not look promising.</p>

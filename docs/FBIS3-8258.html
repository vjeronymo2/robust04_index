			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zdenko Vranjes] </F>   [Excerpts] Mostar has been completely peaceful today.  [passage omitted]    Croatian Defense Council [HVO] formations in the Lasva river  valley have placed their heavy guns under UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] supervision at the UN base in Bila, in the  municipality of Vitez, but HVO military sources said that the  same action was not taken by Muslim soldiers. The command of  the HVO Vitez operational zone lodged a protest with UNPROFOR  because the Muslim side in that area had not placed a single gun  under UNPROFOR supervision. [passage omitted]    Herceg-Bosna Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic and Chamber of  Deputies President Ivan Bender had talks with French Ambassador  Henri Jacolin today. In their talks they put forward a demand  for Mostar not to be placed under European Union administration  but to be included in the Croat Grand County, with a separate  Muslim municipality within it. They also put forward a proposal  by the Croat side that the Croat Grand County be given a land  link with Herzegovina.</p>

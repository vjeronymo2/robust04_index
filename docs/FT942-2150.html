			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Post Office makes record profit: Royal Mail contribution of Pounds 296m to total Pounds 306m exceeds government target The Post Office yesterday reported record pre-tax profits for the year to March 31, but claimed its future was nonetheless in serious jeopardy because of the government's failure to reach a decision on privatisation. At Pounds 306m, pre-tax profits were 8 per cent up on the 1992-93 figure of Pounds 283m. The Post Office's core Royal Mail delivery business contributed Pounds 296m  -far ahead of its government target of Pounds 225m. However, Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, said the 'prolonged waiting game' over privatisation was causing 'planning blight which leaves us totally in limbo'. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, highlighted investment shortfalls and a 'worrying' dip in pillar-box mail as further evidence of the need for a sell-off. Although mail volumes reached a peak of 64m items delivered daily, a 2.6 per cent rise on the previous year, the increase was caused by a surge in pre-sorted bulk mail. The volume of posted and franked mail fell by 1 per cent, its first decline for more than a decade. Although it retains a monopoly over the delivery of addressed mail priced at less than Pounds 1, the Post Office claims it faces strong competition in the distribution of pre-sorted bulk mail, particularly within large cities. Mr Cockburn warned: 'Some of our major customers are being targeted by foreign post offices.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to publish a green paper setting out privatisation options early next month. Post Office Counters, which comprises high-street post offices run by the Post Office and the village sub-post offices run on a franchise arrangement, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m, ahead of its government target of Pounds 15m. However Parcelforce, the parcel-delivery service, made a loss of Pounds 19m, Pounds 6m more than the previous year. Mr Cockburn said that at least Pounds 10m of business had gone to competitors, and blamed a shortfall in investment. More than 91 per cent of first-class letters were delivered the day after posting, slightly below the Post Office's target of 92 per cent but far ahead of its 74.5 per cent record four years ago. Mr Heron said no stamp price increases were planned.</p>

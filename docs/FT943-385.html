			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Williams pleases with acquisitions' progress Williams Holdings yesterday announced its fifth acquisition in a year and also told institutional investors that five recent purchases had improved their profits contribution by an estimated Pounds 13m since joining the group's stable. Silvani, an Italian fire protection group, is being acquired for Pounds 16.5m. Mr Roger Carr, chief executive of Williams, said Silvani was 'an essential part of the jigsaw' in building the group's fire protection operation into a global business. It would add new products and markets, and provide a solid base for further acquisitions in the sector. His comments came at an institutional briefing, during which Williams sought to set itself apart from the ranks of other diversified industrial groups. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Williams had evolved into a focused industrial manufacturing group, serving three sectors - fire protection, security and building products. The shares added 7p to 344p. Mr Carr gave a progress report on five recent acquisitions in each of the divisions, which together had cost Pounds 200m and had returned profits of Pounds 19m. After reorganisation, at a total cost of Pounds 16m, the businesses were generating an estimated Pounds 32m. 'And there are further benefits to come in 1996,' said Mr Carr. The charges for Solvay Woodcare, purchased for Pounds 64m in July, would be slightly higher than expected at Pounds 6m.</p>

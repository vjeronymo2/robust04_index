			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Flotation values Thai construction group at Dollars 2.3bn Italian-Thai Development (ITD), south-east Asia's largest construction contractor, was valued at Bt58bn (Dollars 2.3bn) when its shares were floated on the Thai stock exchange yesterday. Shares in ITD, part of the Italian-Thai group of companies, closed at Bt230, compared with an initial public offering price of Bt175. Foreign stockbrokers noted that the closing price gave the company a prospective price/earnings ratio for 1994 of 34, well above the overall market average of about 20. The Karnasuta family which controls Ital-Thai has strong political connections, and the company is expected to win a substantial share of forthcoming Thai infrastructure projects in the absence of significant local competition. However, some brokers still regard ITD as overvalued. 'It's a case of take the money and run,' said one stockbroker, advising those holding shares to take profits. ITD has announced first-half net profits of Bt715m, compared with Bt575m in the first half of 1993, although revenues fell to Bt5.5bn from Bt5.7bn. The figures suggest that ITD may find it difficult to meet its full-year revenue forecast of Bt16.3bn, particularly now that the start of work on a Dollars 1.5bn elevated railway for Bangkok - for which ITD is the main civil contractor - has again been delayed. Gross margins rose to 26 per cent from 21 per cent, exceptionally high by the standards of construction companies elsewhere in the world. ITD's principal shareholders decided to sell 10 per cent of the company to the public to allow ITD to raise funds for 'build-operate-transfer' concessions through the stock market, rather than bank borrowing. Italian-Thai is the dominant Thai contractor for ports, dams, power stations, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure projects. It is part of the group founded by the late Giorgio Berlingieri, an Italian marine engineer, and Mr Chaijudh Karnasuta, a Thai-Chinese doctor turned businessman. Mr Berlingieri's relatives now have only nominal holdings in the group.</p>

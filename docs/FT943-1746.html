			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: CANTV on tip of a debt iceberg - The Venezuelan telecoms group is rescheduling Compania Anonima Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV), Venezuela's national telecommunications company that owes more to foreign creditors than any other private concern, has rescheduled its foreign debts due to Venezuela's foreign exchange controls imposed in June. Mr Bruce Haddad, CANTV president, said his company began negotiating what he called a refinancing programme after it missed a payment on an international loan in August. Mr Haddad did not give a precise figure for CANTV's external debt, but said it was 'hundreds of millions of dollars'. CANTV, privatised in 1991 by an international consortium headed by GTE of the US, had external obligations in bonds, notes, commercial loans, trade credits and others, Mr Haddad said. Over 40 financial institutions from the US, Europe and Japan are involved. Mr Haddad said exchange controls announced by the government on June 27 had hurt the company's capital investment programme and made rescheduling a difficult proposition. 'We have no doubt whatsoever about CANTV's ability and willingness to service its debt on time,' said one international banker who works with the company. 'But the exchange control bureaucracy is excruciatingly slow and entirely beyond the company's control.' Bankers here said they knew of no large sums disbursed by the government to cover private sector foreign debt. However, the government is aware of the problem and reportedly allotted Dollars 400m for private external debt. But it is not clear how soon the government will begin supplying the funds. The public sector is apparently servicing its own debt normally. However, CANTV's dilemma is only the tip of the iceberg. Strict foreign exchange controls and slow processing of applications for US dollars to service external debt has hurt many Venezuelan companies, including local subsidiaries of multinational concerns. CANTV was planning a Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m eurobond issue in June, but cancelled the offer because of exchange controls. 'We have a huge problem here,' commented one international banker based in Caracas. 'Our clients cannot obtain foreign exchange to keep their debt payments current, and we have hundreds of millions of dollars in overdue loans.' Mr Julio Sosa, minister of finance, said Venezuela's private sector external debt stood at about Dollars 5bn, but the total could be higher. A large devaluation of Venezuela's currency and high inflation forced CANTV to cut back its capital investment programme this year. Mr Haddad said the company had reduced this year's projected capital spending of Dollars 705m by Dollars 125m, and next year's planned capital outlays of about Dollars 700m would be cut 'by over 50 per cent'. Quarterly rate increases for CANTV's services this year have been below inflation, and cannot come close to offsetting the higher local currency costs of imported capital goods caused by devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar this year. The government questioned CANTV's most recent request for rate increases, and set up a special commission to study the matter. Regular rate increases to compensate for inflation are stipulated in the concession agreement signed by CANTV and the last government. Inflation in Venezuela last year was 46 per cent. The government is predicting 65 per cent inflation this year, but private sector estimates suggest it may reach 84 per cent, even with widespread price controls in place. The consortium that manages CANTV, Venworld Telecom, was carrying out a Dollars 6bn capital spending programme for Venezuelan telecommunications when unfavourable economic circumstances forced it to make reductions in capital and operating expenditures. Venworld is the largest foreign investor and the largest private investor in Venezuela. The group, which paid Dollars 1.89bn in 1991 for 40 per cent of the government's shares in CANTV and operating control of the company, includes GTE, with 51 per cent of the consortium; Telefonica Internacional de Espana; La Electricicad de Caracas, Venezuela's largest private power company; CIMA, the Banco Mercantil group and AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group.</p>

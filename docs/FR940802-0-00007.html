The amendments made by this interim rule will provide: greater clarity; enhance the administration of CCC programs by providing uniformity between CCC price support programs; eliminate obsolete provisions; provide more authority to State and county committees in administering the programs; lessen administrative actions CCC imposes on producers who violate the loan and LDP agreements; and correct errors.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective August 2, 1994.

See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict with these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. The provisions of this rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support programs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information collections have previously been cleared under the current regulations by OMB, and assigned OMB Nos. 0560&hyph;0087 and 0560&hyph;0129. The content and format of the information collections have not changed as a result of this amendment to 7 CFR part 1427; however, the frequency of reporting has been reduced. ASCS will submit a burden correction worksheet to OMB for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since producers are currently making decisions regarding upland and extra long staple cotton which may be pledged as collateral for CCC price support loans, it has been determined that it is impractical and contrary to the public interest for CCC to engage in proposed rulemaking requirements with respect to the provisions of this rule. Accordingly, the provisions of this interim rule are effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Comments are requested, however, and will be taken into consideration when developing the final rule. This interim rule will be scheduled for review so that a final document discussing comments received and any amendments required can be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for CCC price support programs. CCC price support programs are intended to stabilize market prices and provide interim financing and assistance to producers in the orderly marketing of eligible commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends regulations found at 7 CFR part 1427 to provide rules for administering CCC price support programs for the 1994 and subsequent crop years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

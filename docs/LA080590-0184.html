			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOPER COULD BE LATEST LAKER WITH A NEW HOME  </P> <P> Michael Cooper, a key performer in Showtime for more than a decade, may have  finally run out of time.  </P> <P> The Lakers reportedly have told the 34-year-old guard that he might not be back  for a 13th season, that he could be traded or put on waivers.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Corriere Dello Sport, an Italian newspaper, reported that Il  Messaggero Roma of the Italian league has offered Cooper a $900,000-a-year  contract. The paper, as well as La Gazzetta dello Sport, reported the deal  hinged on whether the Lakers would match the offer.  </P> <P> "But (the deal) can be considered a sure thing and will be announced early next  week," Corriere Dello Sport reported.  </P> <P> Team president Carlo Sama was quoted as saying: "He could be the right man for  Messaggero.Because of American rules, we have to wait a few more days. "  </P> <P> Contacted at his home Saturday, Cooper responded that "as far as I know, I'm  still a Laker. I heard these rumors about Italy earlier this year and nothing  happened."  </P> <P> Laker General Manager Jerry West is on vacation.  </P> <P> His assistant, Mitch Kupchak, said the team has "never considered Michael  Cooper expendable. He's been a true-blue Laker as far back as I can remember.  We plan on having him back next year. He's under contract and we fully expect  him to play."  </P> <P> Would that mean he would not be traded?  </P> <P> "We look at every situation as it comes up," Kupchak said. "That (Cooper's  departure) would be a decision Michael Cooper would make along with Dr. (Jerry)  Buss."  </P> <P> West has indicated he'd like to make a deal before the start of training camp.  Rumors have run through the summer that the Lakers, despite a league-high 63  victories last season, are ready to break up the team of the '80s to build a  team for the '90s.  </P> <P> Friday, the Lakers traded forward Orlando Woolridge to the Denver Nuggets for  two draft choices.  </P> <P> The removal of Woolridge and, perhaps, Cooper, could free up money the club  might need under the salary cap to obtain a high-priced player.  </P> <P> Cooper, known for his Coop-a-Loops early in his career, game-breaking  three-pointers in the later years and tough defense throughout, is one of two  remaining Lakers to have played throughout the '80s.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson is the other.  </P> <P> Johnson, of course, will be back. At this point, no other player can say that  with absolute certainty.  </P></p>

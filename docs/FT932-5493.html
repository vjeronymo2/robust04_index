			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale placing and offer to raise Pounds 1.95m BIRKDALE Group, which is involved in advertising, public relations and marketing, is raising about Pounds 1.95m net through the placing of 21.78m new ordinary shares at 10p. The shares have been conditionally placed subject to an open offer to shareholders by Apax Partners on the basis of 11-for-9. The proceeds will be used to reduced indebtedness and provide additional working capital to enable the group to continue trading. The group's shares fell 28 per cent yesterday, from 25p to 18p. Following the placing and offer, the company proposes to subdivide each existing share into one new ordinary with a nominal value of 5p and one deferred share with a nominal value of 20p, which the company proposes to buy back and cancel. Birkdale has also entered agreements with Stax Investments International as a development partner for Thanestead Farm near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. An extraordinary meeting is being held on June 25 to consider the proposals. Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on June 28.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a session in Mostar today, the Presidency of the  Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  discussing the present political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Geneva talks. Zdenko Vranjes reporting:    [Vranjes] Speaking about the Geneva talks, Kresimir Zubak,  president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and president of  the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna,  said the most important thing agreed was that the question of  corridors would be resolved in such a way as to give equal right  to the use of corridors, i.e. to the linking of territories, to  all three sides. The new proposals also contain ideas about  gray zones and blue paths, i.e. the territories and paths that  will be under international control until the final solution is  reached.    Making the resumption of talks conditional upon the  withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde turned out to be a good  thing. They had to withdraw from Gorazde and give in and accept  a one-month cease-fire--which was Croatia's proposal, said  Zubak. He also said that the united Croat-Bosniak stand at the  talks turned out to be successful. Zubak added that the  political platform that the federation's delegation advocated in  Geneva implied the survival of the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which would be organized as a federal [slozena] state,  consisting of the federation and the part presently under  Serbian control. In such a federal state the constituent status  of the Croatian people will be reflected both in the federation  and in all the parts of the federal state. This option could be  proposed by the Contact Group, together with the maps, according  to the take it or leave it principle, said Zubak.</p>

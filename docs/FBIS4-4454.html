			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Senate Revolt Is a Lesson for the Chuan </F> Government"]    [Text] The opposition parties scored a political victory  over the Chuan government yesterday by joining hands with the  Senate to ram through a controversial charter draft which they  claimed was aimed at national unity. It plunged the fragile  coalition into its most serious political crisis.    Members of the coalition were evidently embarrassed when  senators and the opposition collaborated to defeat the  government on a procedural vote over which amendments to take  first. They eventually voted together to get the opposition's  bill adopted by the Parliament in its first reading. Two days  before the extraordinary session was due to begin, the  opposition tore up a gentleman's agreement made on Feb 15 --  that eight of the 25 proposed amendments would be introduced  first, and after they had been passed, the others would be  considered.    What happened yesterday was indeed an eye-opener. That the  opposition is serious about national unity is certainly a joke.  Promoting democracy is definitely the last thing on their mind  and wanting to give a facelift to the Constitution so that it  incorporates the aspirations, rights and liberties of all Thais  was, and never has been, on their agenda. The many technical  flaws which are obvious in the hastily drawn-up charter draft  only dilutes the opposition leaders' claim that it was a serious  piece of legislation.    Chat Thai leader Praman Adireksan, who is also the  opposition  leader, said the opposition was not bargaining for anything in  introducing to Parliament a new charter draft. The opposition  has carefully studied the changes for the people's interests, so  he claimed.    We have to take this with a pinch of salt.    The opposition has chosen the 1978 Constitution as a model  for a new charter because it would benefit senators, bureaucrats  and political parties. Ordinary citizens come last.    The 1978 Constitution sets the size of the Senate at three-  quarters that of the Lower House, which means that the number of  senators would remain at 270 and not be reduced to 120, as had  been agreed upon by the government and opposition on Feb 15. It  allows senators to submit interpellations to Cabinet members and  allows a nonelected official to become prime minister.    The opposition in fact baited the Senate to garner its  support and it comes as no surprise why the Upper House fell  hook, line and sinker for it. Without doubt, the interests of  senators, many of whom are military men and senior bureaucrats  whose vocabularies do not include the word democracy, would be  protected.    On Tuesday, the opposition announced it wanted to do away  with the-present Constitution because it was a legacy of the  National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC) which staged the February  1991 coup. The irony of ironies is that yesterday they had no  qualms about joining hands with the Senate which was appointed  by the military junta in early 1992. Rather embarrassing to our  fledgling democracy, which was won on Rachadamnoen Avenue in May  1992, has been the Senate which has been described as an  unwanted legacy of the NPKC.    They have, all this while, withstood any attempts to revamp  their selection methods, curb their powers and reduce their  numbers.    As the saying goes: Birds of a feather flock together. That  the "satanic" character of the opposition should again rear its  ugly head is indeed no surprise.    In 1992, some of them were clearly in the NPKC camp and,  prior to the shootings of prodemocracy demonstrators on  Rachadamnoen Avenue, were backing then prime minister Suchinda  Kraprayun to the hilt. The fact that all the key military  leaders, including Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak and Army  Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit, voted for the  opposition's draft yesterday should have a far-reaching impact.  But it is too early to draw a conclusion that they are  deserting the coalition in favour of the opposition.    Technically speaking, with only 193 votes in Parliament, the  government is really in for a hard time, especially when it can  no longer count on the Senate for support. However, it has to  be remembered that this is the government for which blood was  shed in May 1992. In the September 1992 elections it was voted  into power on a mandate of popular support.    The Senate's revolt yesterday should serve as a rude  awakening for the Chuan government. Its initial vacillating  over the amending of the charter has disappointed many people  and paved the way for the opposition's offensive. The coalition  has to take equal blame for what happened yesterday.    It is obvious that the opposition's ultimate aim is to force  Chuan to dissolve the House with the hope that it can return  with more seats in a snap election. Of course, it would be  foolish to believe that a new election will bring in a new  generation of MPs with an "angelic quality". The sure bet is  that most, if not all, of the politicians associated with money  politics will be able to buy their way right back into  Parliament.    Our hope is that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and his  government learn a lesson from this latest political episode.  It is still not too late for him and his coalition members to  leave behind political bickerings to seriously set their sights  on tackling issues besetting the nation. Only through serious  work can the coalition hope to regain the public's faith which  is fast dwindling. What can save the Chuan government now is  not how it can outsmart the opposition, but how it can win over  the hearts of the people.</p>

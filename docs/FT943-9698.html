			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / PolSat continues broadcasting Poland's privately-owned PolSat TV plans to continue transmission despite a Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) ruling suspending its licence for nationwide broadcasting, a PolSat official said yesterday. The court made the decision on Friday at a closed session, citing numerous legal challenges the station faced. The National Radio and TV Council, Poland's broadcasting authority, suggested the ruling infringed its responsibility and said it licence to PolSat in January, rejecting bids from from several foreign-Polish media groups. It said it preferred PolSat because it was fully Polish-owned. However, the challengers said they had been offering better programming and had sounder financial foundations. Among PolSat's critics was President Lech Walesa, who reportedly tried to remove the chairman of the broadcasting council for giving the licence to the station.</p>

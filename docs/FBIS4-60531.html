			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Split in Sudanese Opposition's </F> Military Arm"]    [Excerpts] London, AL-HAYAH -- A group of military members  of the "Sudanese Army Military Command" organization, the  military arm of the opposition Democratic National Grouping, has  announced the dismissal of its leadership and the formation of a  new leadership, "because the present leadership has not carried  out any military action against the regime over the past five  years -- which has caused it to lose a great deal and prompted  many people to abandon it."    A statement issued by the group and distributed in Cairo  yesterday, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said that the  leadership of retired Lieutenant General Fathi Ahmad 'Ali, the  Army's former commander in chief, "has not moved from the  theorization stage to the implementation stage -- which has  adversely affected its performance, reputation, and status  inside and outside the country. In fact it has focused  primarily on political action and ignored its main duty, thus  losing its credibility and status in opposition action."  [passage omitted]    The officers decided to "dismiss Lt. Gen. Fathi and Major  General al-Hadi Bushra (the third man in the organization) and  to form a new leadership committee after consulting with the  organization's offices in Europe and Britain." The breakaway  group stressed that it "has nothing to do with any agreements,  decisions, or statements issued by the leadership. And we  stress our commitment to the principles and charter of the  Democratic National Grouping" [passage omitted]</p>

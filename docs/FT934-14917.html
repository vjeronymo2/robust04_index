			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Living Dangerously; Have Fish Had Their Chips (BBC1, 8.30) takes an old-fashioned anthropomorphic look at the seal, one of the many sea animals in competition with fishermen. The Dog's Tale (BBC2, 9.30) continues to turn up good things, albeit in a disjointed fashion. Tonight investigates canine ESP, which many dog-lovers swear by. One of them is a woman whose dog, oddly named Ribbon (because he is a bow-wow?) is apparently able to predict when she is about to have an epileptic fit. Connoisseurs of religious ritual may want to stay up to watch Relighting the Candle (BBC1, 11.35), a ceremony which takes place at Bevis Marks, the oldest synagogue in Britain. The spiritual home of the Sephardic Jews in this country, Bevis Marks has twice been damaged by IRA explosions in the City. Notables will be attending, not least Alan Yentob, the controller of BBC1. Midnight Jazz (BBC 2, 12.00) features McCoy Turner and the highly regarded Julian Joseph quartet, followed by Arena profile of Billie Holiday (repeat),(BBC 2, 12.40).</p>

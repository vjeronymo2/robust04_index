			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Technology: Smart structures top of the class Intelligent materials that respond to their environment are the basis for an emerging technology that adapts the substances into structures and products. These 'smart' structures alter their shape or strength in response to changes in the conditions surrounding them. They could range from intelligent artificial bones and intelligent clothes to aircraft that repair themselves in flight. These ideas are still at an early stage of development. More immediately, smart structures are likely to be used in aircraft and in manufacturing technology where materials will be able to indicate when they have been formed correctly. Manufacturers, research agencies and universities in many countries are pursuing the technology, with the US, Japan and Britain leading the field. Japan's Science and Technology Agency is promoting work to create new substances and materials with in-built intelligence. 'It is necessary for the (Japanese) government to promote fundamental research in these fields, which represents a challenge with fantastic feasible targets,' according to the agency. The Japanese government wants companies to accelerate the development of intelligent materials, 'as a driving force for technology innovation'. In Britain, Strathclyde University opened its Smart Structures Research Institute in February and launched a company, Smart Structures Limited, to exploit work with industry on the development of intelligent materials for commercial products. In the US several organisations and companies are involved, including Stanford University, Virginia Polytechnic, Florida Institute of Technology as well as United Technologies, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas, Hughes Aircraft and Nasa (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Canada has a fibre optic smart structures laboratory in Toronto. According to Nabil Zahlan, a researcher with ICI's advanced materials laboratory on Teesside, smart structures have some of the same characteristics as people. 'They have signal processors for brains, mechanical actuators for muscles and sensors for nerves,' says Zahlan. In intelligent materials for smart structures, the nerves could be in the form of optical fibres, embedded in composite materials and able to sense changes, such as cracks in a structure, and send signals to actuators, the 'muscles' in a smart structure. Smart structures could also be made from intelligent materials such as 'perceptive composites'. These use piezo-electric elements that change shape when an electric current passes through. Smart structures can cope with other changing circumstances, such as additional stress, and can prevent cracks developing that would destroy a structure. Applications include bridges, buildings and aircraft where structural failure could be catastrophic. Fiona Underwood, an engineer with British Aerospace, says smart structures would also help manufacturers to reduce the life-cycle costs of a product, by reducing inspection requirements. An aircraft would indicate when a wing had cracked, for example, and would strengthen itself to cope with the crack. BAe is also working on a smart aircraft 'skin', which would have radar and communications equipment built into the aircraft. Underwood forecasts that this material could be flying within five years. The Strathclyde Smart Structures Research Institute has identified applications for smart structures in transport, civil engineering, manufacturing and in the design of consumer products from fishing rods and golf clubs, which could stiffen on contact with a fish or ball, to toys. In transport smart structures can be used to monitor the structural integrity of satellites, aircraft, cars, boats and trains. It can also help in vibration control on spacecraft and active suspension systems for vehicles. In civil engineering, smart technology could help in traffic control on roads, in the real-time monitoring of pipeline integrity and in the automatic damping of buildings and bridges subject to vibration.</p>

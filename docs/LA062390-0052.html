			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN EXCESS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP IN 'MOSAICS'  </P> <P> "The Art of Mosaics: Selections From the Gilbert Collection," an exhibition of  19th-Century Roman and Florentine decorative arts at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art, illuminates two little-known schools of virtuoso craftsmanship  -- and demonstrates what can go wrong when technical wizardry outstrips  aesthetic content.  </P> <P> At the beginning of the 18th Century, the frescoes in St. Peter's had  deteriorated so badly that they had to be replaced with more durable mosaics.  The artisans in the Vatican workshops refined their techniques until they could  fit up to 1,400 tesserae, or fragments of spun glass, into a square inch of  surface. (Their workmanship was so subtle that many visitors to St. Peter's  don't realize they're looking at mosaics rather than paintings.)  </P> <P> After the restorations in St. Peter's had been completed, the artisans began  decorating table tops, cabinets, coffers and jewelry with scenes of Italy and  images copied from ancient mosaics and Renaissance paintings. The Victorian  upper classes loved anything that smacked of classical antiquity, and furniture  set with Roman mosaics soon became a favorite, if pricey, souvenir for visiting  Russian czars and wealthy English milords.  </P> <P> The furniture and jewelry in the exhibition constitute a tour de force of  craftsmanship. Necklace medallions are set with delicate micromosaics that  resemble petit point embroidery. Table tops inlaid with elaborate garlands of  fruit and flowers rival the finest 18th-Century marquetry.  </P> <P> The large mosaic panels that suggest ersatz paintings are considerably less  successful. It reportedly took Gioacchino Rinaldi more than five years to  complete his 5-foot landscape, "The Ruins of Paestrum," but the labor needed to  assemble those millions of bits of glass overwhelm its artistic content. The  viewer looks at it and thinks, "Well, he lived to finish it."  </P> <P> The Florentine mosaics represent a different tradition that dates to the late  16th Century. Rather than fuss with tiny shards of glass, the craftsmen in the  Medici workshops cut semi-precious stones into intricate pieces and fit them  together like an opulent jigsaw puzzles. The resulting pietre dure, or  hard-stone mosaics, recall the small figurines that the Faberge artisans made  from the same materials: agate, onyx, colored marble, obsidian, quartz, jasper.  </P> <P> The Florentine mosaics are also most effective as decorations. The panels of  landscapes with ruins set in an 18th-Century English cabinet suggest miniature  Tiffany windows. The mottled colors of the stone evoke a cloudy sky or the  leafy crown of a tree, the way Tiffany's elaborately textured glass does.  </P> <P> Conversely, the attempts to use pietre dure techniques to simulate paintings  veer perilously close to kitsch. "Two Little Tykes," a self-conscious study of  a small boy and his dog by Mario Montelatici, looks like an early-day Saturday  Evening Post cover.  </P> <P> No antique buff or student of the decorative arts should miss "The Art of  Mosaics," which remains on display indefinitely. Like Faberge eggs, these  tables and necklaces are products of a time when skilled labor was cheap and an  apprentice artisan might spend a decade or more learning the secrets of his  craft. No one could duplicate these pieces today, even with the most  sophisticated computer technology.  </P></p>

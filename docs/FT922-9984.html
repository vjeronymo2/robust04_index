			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Pay and conditions of work should not be dictated by EC Sir, Your reporting of the working time debate at the Social Affairs Council ('Social Europe', April 30) focused on the 48-hour maximum working week and the designation in principle of Sunday as the day of rest. It should be remembered that these aspects of the draft directive were proposed, by France and Germany respectively, some considerable time after the proposals were originally published by the Commission. Employers throughout the EC have unanimously condemned them since their original publication. In the increasing debate that will take place between now and the next Social Affairs Council meeting on June 24 we should not lose sight of the principle that pay and conditions of work, including the organisation of working time, should be matters to be determined between an employee and an employer and should not be dictated at EC level. The only tolerable intervention that is acceptable is on objective health and safety grounds, as Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, proposed. If it is endangering the health and safety of engineering technicians to work more than 8 hours per night or more than 48 hours per week, so is it unacceptable for hospital workers or President Delors. The latter two, of course, will not be covered by this directive. So much for objectivity. Peter Reid, head of employment policy, EEF, Broadway House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NQ</p>

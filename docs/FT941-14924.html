			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Observer: Economy class only Those who feel that airline flights leave them feeling more dead than alive should consider linking up with USAir, which has started a frequent flyer programme for the existentially-challenged, otherwise known as deceased. USAir now offers funeral directors one free round trip flight in the US for every 30 bodies they ship on the company's flights. It's big business; no less than 3 per cent of USAir's cargo traffic consists of the transport of corpses. The airline - which claims to be the number one carrier to the pension paradise of Florida - is particularly active flying the remains of retirees back home. The programme is part of USAir's Tender Loving Care scheme, launched last October. It's obviously working; custom has increased by 30 per cent since it was started. USAir, whose public relations staff imaginatively describes this niche market as 'healthy and profitable', says it carries several thousand bodies each month.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Gota Bank seeks damages from former board members Sweden's Gota Bank will today open a civil court action to demand damages from former board members in the government's latest attempt to hold bank executives and directors accountable for the loan loss crisis that hit the financial system last year. The Bank Support Authority (BSA), the state agency established to manage the crisis, said the suit - relating to loan activity during 1990 - would be filed against several former directors in the Stockholm district court. Gota Bank was one of the biggest victims of the bank shock. It was taken over by the state after running up credit losses of SKr13bn (Pounds 1bn) in 1992. It is to be merged with Nordbanken, also taken over by the state, on January 1 after a rescue and recapitalisation operation that has cost taxpayers SKr30.4bn. Mr Stefan Ingves, chief executive of the BSA, said further investigations of loan practice at Gota Bank during 1991 and 1992 were under way. The government, as shareholder, has also refused to absolve Gota directors of their legal responsibilities during 1992 pending a separate inquiry into the management of the bank. Meanwhile, the BSA is still in dispute with the Gota parent company over the worth of the bank at the time of the government takeover. The BSA claimed the bank was only worth SKr1. Last week, a former chairman of Nordbanken, four former senior executives and several former board members agreed collectively to pay the government SKr16m - partly made up of 'golden parachutes' paid to them when they left the bank - in a settlement in which they admitted wrongdoing in the administration of loans during 1990. In addition, the state prosecution office is scrutinising 156 individual loans worth SKr37.8bn made by all the leading banks except Svenska Handelsbanken, on suspicion of criminal malpractice. No charges have yet been brought. The bank crisis erupted after a spate of bad loans, mainly related to property. The banks have improved performance this year, but the government has committed SKr92.1bn in bail-outs. It has also put SKr110bn of Gota Bank and Nordbanken's bad loans in so-called 'bad banks', which will remain in state hands after Nordbanken is re-privatised.</p>

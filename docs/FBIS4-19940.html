			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn/Berlin (DPA) -- The number of illegal  border-crossings continues to decline at the German borders to  East Europe. In March 1,300 persons were detained within the  sphere of responsibility of the Border Protection Presidium  East, which is about 150 fewer than in February (1,453), Eduard  Lintner (Christian Social Union), parliamentary state secretary  in the FRG Interior Ministry, stated in Ahrensfelde in Berlin on  Friday [22 April]. In 1993 the number of persons detained  declined from 35,000 during the first half of the year to 19,000  during the second. [passage omitted]</p>

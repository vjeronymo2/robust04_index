			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Moreira] </F>   [Text] The narcotics trade in Rio de Janeiro has not  changed since the home of numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade  was raided on 30 March. Marijuana and cocaine continue to be  sold at a rapid pace despite state attorneys' revelations that  numbers game people are linked to drug trafficking. Last week, a  truck coming from Bolivia ensured a 30-day supply of cocaine to  all the southern districts of Rio de Janeiro and to some of the  northern districts. The truck, which carried hardwood, brought  100 kg of the drug from the Chapare Region, where there are  large coca leaf plantations.    Drug trafficker Joao Matuto, a narcotics trade leader in the  Rocinha slum, was responsible for this shipment. Matuto sent a  message to the state attorneys: "This business about Castor de  Andrade has political roots; it will end up as nothing."    Half of the cargo that arrived in Rocinha is enough to  supply  the slum for one month. The other half will be stored or resold  to drug traffickers linked to Joao Matuto. The drugs were  purchased for $1,500 per kg in Bolivia, but will reach  consumer's hands at a price almost seven times higher. It will  be sold for an average of $10 per gram.    A drug trafficker linked to Matuto asserted: "If there are  indeed links with the numbers game people, it must be in  relation to international drug trafficking. It has nothing to  do with us." Without worrying about defending the numbers game  people, the drug traffickers explain that the retail sale of the  drugs does not require financing to reach the streets. "Those  who are trusted can simply take the drugs and pay for them  later. The sales profits guarantee that those who sold the  drugs will pay for them," he added.    Drug traffickers Joao Matuto, Jorge Luis of the Acari slum,  and Miltinho da Ilha are considered the Rio de Janeiro State  drug trafficking barons. One step below are drug traffickers  Orlando Jogador from Leopoldina District and Pedrinho Maluco of  the so-called Western Zone of the city. They are the only ones  capable of ensuring the arrival of large shipments of drugs,  similar to that which arrived in the Rocinha slum last week.    The rest of the drug arrives in the country thanks to mules  (or matutos) who travel to Bolivia or Colombia, which are drug  producing countries, and then bring the drugs to the slums in  their backpacks. There are nearly 300 of these small drug  traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. They always carry drugs, but  never more than 5 kg of marijuana or cocaine.    According to arms traffickers, the weapons market functions  in a slightly different manner. Most of the arms enter the  country through the airport, and depend on federal police  cooperation. Arms circulation, an illegal weapon can change  hands between policemen and drug traffickers several times,  makes it less necessary to import arms than drugs. Policemen  seize AR-15 rifles, HK submachine guns, and 9 mm pistols from  criminals. Policemen then sell these arms, and they end up in  the hands of the criminals again. Currently an AR-15 rifle is  worth $4,000, an HK submachine gun $3,500, and a pistol $1,500.    The arms that do not arrive on planes are brought to the  country by the mules (or matutos) and follow routes similar to  those followed by the drugs. They can come from Paraguay,  Bolivia, or Colombia. The number of arms mules is much smaller  than that of drug mules. In the Rocinha slum, for example,  there are only four or five arms mules.    To reach the slums with marijuana or cocaine, the drug  traffickers must duck policemen at the control posts along the  highways connecting Rio de Janeiro to foreign borders, and count  on the policemen's cooperation to do so. Today, the highways  that are used most often to bring drugs or arms into the country  begin at the Bolivian, Colombian, and Paraguayan borders and  cross the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and  Sao Paulo.    Bolivian cocaine crosses to the Brazilian side through the  town of San Matias. From there on, the trucks follow a dirt  road up to the city of Caceres, 180 km from Cuiaba (Mato Grosso  State). There they find the first obstacle: a Federal Highway  Police control post that has to be eluded with the help of the  local farmers, who allow the mules to cross their land.    The route then crosses Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul  State, along the BR-163 highway. The route then follows BR-262  highway up to Tres Lagoas on the Sao Paulo State border, and  reaches Rio de Janeiro through the Presidente Dutra Highway.  The strategic points in the most used highway arms route are  Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, and its neighboring Brazilian  town of Ponta Pora. To reach Rio de Janeiro, the arms cross  Dourados and Nova Alvorada (Mato Grosso do Sul State), and  Presidente Epitacio (Sao Paulo State).    Other drugs and arms shipments arrive in small planes that  fly from Colombia to Sao Paulo and then land in small  clandestine airports at the town of Angra dos Reis on the  so-called Green Coast. The shipments then reach Rio de Janeiro  through the Rio-Santos highway. The shipments are obtained from  the producers through a trust system: The drug is paid for only  after it is sold to consumers.</p>

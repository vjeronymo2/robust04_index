			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Sellars' Pelleas - Holland Festival No doubt of the main novelty at this year's Holland Festival, which runs throughout June. For good or ill, every opera production that Peter Sellars undertakes is a news event. The latest to be subjected to scrutiny is an intriguing choice - Pelleas et Melisande, which Sellars has directed for Netherlands Opera; Simon Rattle is the conductor. The programme book for the new staging is promisingly larded with literary references - extracts from Baudelaire, Barthes, Bachmann and Pinter, as well as the writings of Debussy and Maeterlinck. But all that proves to be peripheral, for the result is yet another addition to Sellars' anthology of American fables. The slice of late 20th-century life refracted through this Pelleas is taken from the US West Coast - Malibu perhaps, or Big Sur; Golaud and his benighted family belong to the super-rich, living on the beach in architect-designed luxury, insulated from the real world by domestics and security guards. George Tsypin's monolithic set peels away the walls of the split-level dream home like a doll's house. Arkel is seen in an upper room, confined to a wheelchair and waited upon hand and foot by his nurses; on the floor below lies the inert form of Pelleas's father, one of opera's great unseen characters finally making an appearance, kept alive on a drip and visited from time to time by the ever solicitous Genevieve. The lighting is flat and fluorescent and scene changes are minimal, requiring Sellars to invent business to cover Debussy's orchestral interludes; that generally involves a trio of vagrants (the beggars from the third act) who seem to live around the estate. From the opening moments it is clear this is not a happy home; the curtain rises during the prelude on Golaud with a revolver to his mouth apparently contemplating suicide; no explanation is offered but his discovery of Melisande, it's suggested, saves him from himself, and perhaps explains the unreasoning jealousy that he ferments through the opera. Otherwise, though, the dramatic treatment, like the visual one, is purely cosmetic, short on insights and psychological elucidation. The opera is sung in French with Dutch surtitles; the text is unimpaired and, Sellars appears to be presuming yet again on the language barrier providing him with the necessary suspension of disbelief to get away with his reworkings. Yet such precise pictorial realism in an opera already heavily charged with symbolism turns almost every utterance, every action, into tendentious metaphor; Maeterlinck's characters never say what they mean anyway, and adding yet another layer of inference just compounds the problems. If Sellars genuinely set out to provide hard-edges to this elusive story he has only succeeded in blurring them further. What redeems the show, however, is the musical performance. Where in almost every other Sellars production I've seen there has been a feeling that the musical parameters had been determined as much by the director as by the conductor, the partnership with Rattle seems much more an equal one. The main characters are all taken by British-based singers with whom Rattle has worked regularly and from whom he obtains beautifully moulded, if not always linguistically fluent performances. Willard White's smouldering, physically aggressive Golaud is the focus, powerful and frightening in everything he does. The Pelleas is Philip Langridge, employing a very wide range of vocal colour which incorporates an almost toneless parlando at one extreme, the Melisande Elise Ross, who has moments of instability but many sweetly turned phrases as well, even if they do not make the youngest-looking pair of lovers one could imagine. There is the familiar forthright Arkel from Robert Lloyd, a strong, compassionate Genevieve from Felicity Palmer; Gaele Le Roi is the Yniold, singing sensibly and without affecting childish squeaks. Binding the cast together, though, is Rattle's command of the score; he obtains playing of wonderful depth and security from the Netherlands Philharmonic. Every scene is paced with extreme care, each is given a perceptible backbone, a sense of inevitable unfolding. Without ever resorting to rhapsodic excesses Rattle communicates a sense of numinous wonder in the work; he catches exactly the ambiguity of an opera which can underpin a tale of horrifying human cruelty with such ravishing music. Muziektheater, Amsterdam; further performances until June 23</p>

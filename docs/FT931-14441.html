			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Experts say missiles' earlier target was nuclear facility INTERNATIONAL experts said yesterday they had no doubt that the military-industrial plant near Baghdad hit by US cruise missiles on Sunday was part of Iraq's nuclear programme. Meanwhile, it has emerged that machine tools equipment made by European companies was found by United Nations inspectors who visited the Zafaraniya complex in 1991. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, head of the United Nations team responsible for monitoring Iraq's nuclear programme, said equipment at the complex was used in the manufacture of calutrons, necessary for the electromagnetic enrichment of uranium. Iraqi officials have protested that the site, which comprises dozens of factory buildings over a wide area, produced only fixtures, moulds and dies and had no military significance. Mr Zifferero, speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Vienna, said that while factories on the site did turn out such products, his inspectors had tagged for destruction heavy lathes and milling equipment there. Those inspectors had visited the site four times. He added that the site, along with the nearby al-Dijila complex, which produced electronics components identified as being part of Iraq's nuclear programme, was one of the six main centres in Iraq's project to develop nuclear weapons. 'The Iraqis themselves have admitted to us that these tools had been used in the manufacture of calutrons,' he said. Mr David Kay, secretary-general of the London-based Uranium Institute and a former chief UN nuclear inspector in Iraq, said yesterday he had visited the Iraqi site on three occasions. He described it as 'a very impressive and advanced machine tool layout'. Western-made equipment included computer numerically-controlled machine tools. US officials described the site as a multi-billion-dollar complex which Iraq would be unable to replace. As well as finding equipment made by European companies at the site, the UN inspectors who visited it in 1991 also found equipment bearing the name of the British company Matrix Churchill. According to a US government document obtained by the Financial Times, the inspectors also found machinery made by a German company. Mr Paul Henderson, former managing director of Matrix Churchill, said last night the company did not supply any machinery from the UK for the Iraqi nuclear programme. He said, however, that Iraq had manufactured lathes under licence from Matrix Churchill. 'We had no idea where those machines went,' he said. The Matrix Churchill exports to Iraq from the UK, he said, were for use in the manufacture of shells, fuses and a multiple rocket launcher project. Of the Matrix exports, he said: 'I know where they went and I know where they were installed and none of them went for nuclear.' Matrix Churchill, which was owned by Iraq before it went into receivership and was split up last year, has featured in politically sensitive court cases in Atlanta and London.</p>

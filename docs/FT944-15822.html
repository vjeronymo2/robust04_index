			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Staff canteen 'perk' worth Pounds 300 a year The staff canteen is a 'substantial perk' worth at least Pounds 300 a year to workers, a report says today. The survey of 800 businesses by the Industrial Society and Touche Ross Management Consultants says more workers than ever use office restaurants because of the harsh realities of the economic climate. Most of those surveyed contracted out catering services, with companies paying an average subsidy of Pounds 328.90 a year per worker.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- "I want to see the  examination of the so-called case of the SCSE [State Committee  for the State of Emergency] through. The people must know the  truth about the August 1991 events," General of the Army  Valentin Varennikov, former commander-in-chief of the land  forces of the USSR, told a RIA correspondent. He is the only  member of the SCSE to have rejected the amnesty announced by the  State Duma. He demanded that the trial of his case should be  continued, and its examination is to be resumed on June 21.    Varennikov thinks he is perfectly guiltless. "I shall be  able  to do my duty in court, to defend my honour and to give the  names of those who are actually guilty of disintegrating the  Soviet Union, an epochal event in the eyes of world history,"  the former commander of the land forces pointed out. He said  that the court will have to summon as witnesses Mikhail  Gorbachev, Dmitriy Yazov, Oleg Shenin and a number of other  persons. "In my turn, I intend to invite to the court some  politicians involved in the August events, particularly the  president of Russia, and to testify as witnesses," Varennikov  added. The general also said that lawyer Dmitriy Shteinberg  will be his defence attorney, as before.</p>

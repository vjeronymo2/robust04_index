			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE NOMINATES ADVISER FOR OIL REFINERY;  </P> <P> SAFETY: THE COUNCIL SELECTS A NONPROFIT RESEARCH FIRM AS ITS CHOICE TO BE  SAFETY ADVISER AT MOBIL'S REFINERY. MOBIL HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER FIRM.  </P> <P> Torrance City Council members on Tuesday selected a nonprofit research firm  from Menlo Park as their nominee for safety adviser at Mobil Oil's Torrance  refinery.  </P> <P> Describing SRI International as "clearly the best" out of an original field of  30 candidates, council members said they were impressed by the firm's  experience analyzing safety in the petrochemical field and in a number of other  industries.  </P> <P> The safety adviser position is a major component in the October pretrial  settlement of a public nuisance lawsuit Torrance filed against Mobil in 1989.  Under the terms of the agreement, the adviser will analyze safety at the  refinery, make recommendations to improve safety measures and oversee the  phasing out or modification of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid at the plant.  </P> <P> Mobil, however, has chosen another nominee for the position, and  representatives of the company and the city will now try to work out a  compromise.  </P> <P> Councilman Tim Mock cast the only vote against SRI's selection, saying he  wanted further details about a safety audit the firm conducted recently for an  unnamed oil refinery. SRI's contract for that audit prevents the consultant  from revealing who the client was or where the refinery is located.  </P> <P> City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said city officials know only that the client was  not Mobil Oil.  </P> <P> The City Council's discussion of the safety adviser candidates took place  behind closed doors, but the 6-1 vote was taken in public. State open-meeting  laws prevented council members from conducting private interviews of the  candidates, and council members said they did not want to conduct such  interviews in public.  </P> <P> Instead, a committee of city officials -- including the city manager, city  attorney, fire chief, fire marshal and outside legal counsel -- screened the  consultants. SRI was their unanimous recommendation from a list of four  finalists, Nelson said.  </P> <P> Mobil informed the city last month that its nominee for the position is  Westinghouse's Energy Systems Business Unit, which is primarily involved in the  design and service of commercial nuclear power plants but which also provides  risk assessment for the nuclear and petrochemical industries.  </P> <P> Mobil's Torrance refinery manager, Joel Maness, said Mobil is withholding  judgment on SRI.  </P> <P> "It's hard for me to say much at this point because I'm not at all familiar  with SRI," Maness said. "We'll interview them and see what kind of experience  and expertise they can bring to the role and then I'm sure we'll have more to  say."  </P> <P> City officials, who had until Wednesday to notify Mobil of their nominee, now  must meet with Mobil representatives to try to work out a compromise on which  consultant ultimately will serve as safety adviser.  </P> <P> If the two sides cannot agree -- which Nelson said is likely to be the case --  the decision will be made by retired Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, who  is overseeing the consent decree.  </P> <P> Nelson said compromise negotiations will not begin until the second week in  January.  </P> <P> Council members criticized Westinghouse as having little experience with  refinery audits.  </P> <P> "A lot of these organizations can go out and get you the expertise you want,  but when somebody already has the experience, that's better than having someone  else go out and put together a team for you," Councilman Bill Applegate said.  "We feel that SRI is the best firm available to do the job."  </P> <P> Nelson said the city will remain open-minded during compromise discussions.  </P> <P> "When we sit down (to talk), we may hear about experience that Westinghouse has  had that we did not know about," he said. "Westinghouse is very, very good. I  think SRI is a whole lot better."  </P> <P> Founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute, an arm of Stanford University,  SRI gained prominence for its pioneering research in radar and laser technology  for the U.S. Defense Department after the Korean War. The firm became  completely independent of Stanford in 1970, said Dennis Maxwell, vice president  for corporate marketing and communications.  </P> <P> Now one of the largest nonprofit research firms in the United States, SRI  employs more than 3,500 people in laboratories ranging from Princeton to  Australia. At least 2,000 workers are employed at the company's headquarters in  Menlo Park near Stanford.  </P> <P> "We do everything from pharmaceutical research . . . to policy work for  economic competitiveness of states and countries to health care cost  containment to physical sciences work and engineering work," Maxwell said.  </P> <P> If selected to be safety adviser, SRI would view the project as a cross between  health and safety consultation and environmental risk assessment, said William  Ralston, manager of environmental business programs.  </P> <P> "The primary objective of the consent decree is to protect the health and  safety of both employees and the local residents," Ralston said. "We have  worked for companies in the past who have asked us to do similar types of  reviews of their facilities, really with the same objectives in mind. . . .  This is right up our alley."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS-RELATED FILM TO DEBUT IN O.C.  </P> <P> A feature film about a heterosexual doctor who re-examines his life after he  tests positive for AIDS -- filmed in Orange County, financed by an Orange  County doctor and directed by a graduate of Orange Coast College -- will,  fittingly enough, have its premiere in the county.  </P> <P> The producers of "A Different Life" are still looking for a distributor, but in  the meantime they have booked the film into the Valley View Twin Cinemas in  Garden Grove for a one-week run, today through Thursday.  </P> <P> "A Different Life" is based on a story by physician Jay Amin about "a  heterosexual doctor who panics when he tests positive for AIDS." But as it  turns out, the test results were faulty. Amin, who has practices in Santa Ana  and Tustin, is also the movie's executive producer.  </P> <P> The film stars John Mansfield in the lead role, along with such film and TV  veterans as Karen Black, Lyle Waggoner and Burt Ward. "A Different Life" marks  the directing debut of Orange Coast College graduate Kent Blakely.  </P> <P> Show times for the film are 5:30, 7:30 and 9:15 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday will  add matinees at 11:30 a.m., 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. The Theater is at 12111 Valley  View St., Garden Grove. Information: (800) 397-1476.  </P></p>

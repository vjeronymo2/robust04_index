"We're looking at the situation in Japan closely," U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said. "Obviously it's a  fluid situation in which no one is quite sure what the outcome  will be."    Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic  policy and the White House point man coordinating the  "framework" trade negotiations was more brunt.    The upper house's rejection of Hosokawa's initiative to  overhaul the Japanese electoral system is a "significant  setback" for the Japanese Government, cutter said in an  interview on CNBC cable television.    Hosokawa's political troubles came as senior officials from  the two countries were gearing up for a final round of trade  talks ahead of a summit meeting in Washington with President  Bill Clinton on February 11.    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky said  the  trade talks would proceed as scheduled. Like Kantor, she  declined to comment on whether Hosokawa's political troubles  would cloud prospects of the summit meeting.    Some U.S. political analysts were less circumspect.    "The political situation in Japan has become very dicey,"  said Douglas Paal, former special assistant for Asian affairs on  the National Security Council. Paal told a private forum on  U.S.-Japan trade relations that he believes the political  upheavals in Tokyo will have "a big impact" on the  Hosokawa-Clinton summit.    In his television interview, Cutter said Clinton remains  "extremely supportive" of Hosokawa's reform efforts.    Senior U.S. Administration officials have said Washington  had  hoped Hosokawa would shift his focus to reviving the stalled  Japanese economy once the political reform issue was out of the  way. Cutter said Friday that Clinton still expects the Japanese  Government to introduce a stimulus package, noting that the  issues of political reform and economic stimulus are "quite  distinct."    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in Tokyo on  Sunday for talks with Hosokawa and Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii.    Tokyo and Washington are currently engaged in wide-ranging  trade talks through which Washington hopes to secure a Japanese  commitment to adopt specific measures to reduce its vast trade  surplus and open up specific market sectors of particular  interest to U.S. businesses.    The Clinton administration has repeatedly said the size of  Japan's trade surplus is "politically untenable." Clinton  himself reinforced his determination to cut the trade gap with  Japan, saying on a television talk show Thursday that Japan is  one of the "biggest problems" for U.S. trade.</p>

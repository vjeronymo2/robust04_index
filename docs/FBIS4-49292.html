			<p>BFN     [Text] The Guangdong Provincial Government held an  emergency telephone meeting this afternoon. The meeting called  for curbing indiscriminate fund-raising to ensure the  fulfillment of the task of issuing treasury bonds as scheduled  across the province.    The task of issuing treasury bonds assigned by the state to  Guangdong this year involves 6.71 billion yuan. By the 25th of  this month, the province had issued 12.13 and 18.84 percent of  the two-year and three-year treasury bonds respectively, ranking  last among the provinces. The major reason why Guangdong has  been slow in issuing treasury bonds is that some localities have  indiscriminately raised funds and raised interest rates.    The provincial government has demanded that the whole  province take action to correct illegal activities of  indiscriminately raising funds and that various localities  complete the issuance of 50 percent of the two-year treasury  bonds and more than one-third of the three-year bonds by the end  of this month and to complete the issuance of all two-year  treasury bonds by the end of May and all three-year treasury  bonds by the end of June. This task should be grasped  personally by the number-one men in party and government  organizations in various localities and its fulfillment should  be ensured by organizations at all levels. Responsibility shall  be affixed to anyone who delays the fulfillment of this task.    The telephone meeting held this afternoon was chaired by  Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governors Lu Ruihua and Ou Guangyuan  also spoke at the meeting.</p>

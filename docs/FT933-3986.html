			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dutch purchase of Newey enforces European role in electrical distribution HAGEMEYER, the Dutch company which has agreed to pay BTR up to Pounds 165m for Newey &amp; Eyre Group, said the management of the Birmingham-based electrical distributor would remain after the acquisition. Hagemeyer, which is 63 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, is an international trading house specialising in automobiles, consumer electronics, speciality foods and luxury goods. It also supplies electro-technical products. The timing of the acquisition fits Hagemeyer's pattern of takeovers in the field of electrical distribution. In 1989 it acquired the Dutch group Bernard, and followed that up two years later with the purchase of a large majority stake in Froschl of Germany. Mr Andrew Land, chairman of Hagemeyer, said the management team of Newey had managed to maintain a reasonable level of profit during a severe UK recession. The purchase comes as the British construction industry is showing signs of emerging from recession. Mr Land said: 'We are cautious and do not expect a very decided upturn, but we do expect an improvement in conditions.' Given the normal time lag of six to 12 months, Hagemeyer expected Britain's market for electro-technical supplies to show an 'uptick' in the second half of next year. The acquisition of Newey will not only boost the Dutch company's turnover by one-third to more than Fl 4.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), but it will also bring into reach a long-standing goal of building up a significant European electro-technical business. Its aim for the past five years has been to generate sales of at least Fl 2.5bn per year in the electro-technical sector by 1995. Newey's turnover of Fl 1bn, plus existing electro-technical turnover of nearly Fl 1.2bn, puts Hagemeyer comfortably on course to reach this goal, Mr Land said yesterday. Mr Land said that Hagemeyer usually takes two years to absorb and integrate a major electro-technical acquisitions, meaning that a similar-sized deal should not be expected for another two years. Smaller, 'rounding' acquisitions of companies with turnover of between Fl 50m and Fl 200m are possible, he said. Hagemeyer expects to decide before the end of the year how it will finance the purchase of Newey. Mr Land did not rule out a share issue but said the decision would rest on a number of factors.</p>

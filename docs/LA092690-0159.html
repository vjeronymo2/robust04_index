			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PIZZA HUT TEENS FEE SHORT-LIVED  </P> <P> An assistant restaurant manager fed up with hordes of teen-agers at her Pizza  Hut locked the doors and collected $1 each from youths unaccompanied by adults,  but the national chain ended the policy.  </P> <P> Susan Gamlin, manager of the Pizza Hut in Baden, about 15 miles northwest of  Pittsburgh, said her assistant instituted the cover charge because unruly teens  were disrupting the eatery after football games and high school dances.  </P> <P> "We didn't think a dollar was too much to ask from kids who destroy our dining  room every Friday night," Gamlin said. "The kids dump the salt and pepper  shakers, only order bread sticks and water, try to bring in food from  McDonald's, don't wait to be seated and then complain about not having a  waitress."  </P> <P> Roger Rydell, a spokesman at the chain's Wichita, Kan., headquarters, said it  was wrong to collect the fee.  </P> <P> "There are no cover charges at Pizza Hut," he said.  </P></p>

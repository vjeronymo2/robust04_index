			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei tumbles again on fears of political scandal Tokyo FEARS OF a new political scandal, and continued arbitrage-linked and investment trust selling took equities into a second consecutive steep fall yesterday, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 685.04 or 3.1 per cent lower at 21,696.86, after opening at the day's best of 22,299.63 and touching a low of 21,596.95. The index dropped 3.2 per cent on Friday. Volume came to 180m shares, after Friday's 225m. Declines led rises by 905 to 74 with 115 issues unchanged, while 131 stocks fell to their lowest levels since the beginning of 1991. The Topix index of all first section shares lost 40.32 to 1,619.84 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.93 to 1,216.92. The market plunged just after the opening, on the unwinding of arbitrage positions in light trading. Selling by investment trusts, and fears that this will continue until the closing of their books on March 31, put a further dampener on sentiment. The market was faced with more talk that the Finance Ministry will restrict arbitrage trading, possibly later this week, and this prompted additional selling. However, the most dramatic depressant yesterday were reports of a police raid on Mr Fumio Abe, a member of the House of Representatives and former secretary general of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's ruling party faction. 'There was panic selling,' said Ms Betty Wu of SBCI Securities. 'There is the fear that this will open a Pandora's box.' The Bank of Japan's tight monetary stance in the short-term money market prior to the end of a reserve management period today was another bearish factor, Ms Wu said. She added that financial officials might now take action to prevent further declines which would push bank capital-to-asset ratios well below the critical 8 per cent level mandated by the Bank for International Settlements. Banks were among the day's largest losers, with Dai-Ichi Kangyo off Y130 at Y2,030 and Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank down Y130 at Y1,540. NTT fell to a record low for the second consecutive session, ending Y18,000 off at Y702,000. Electricals fared relatively well, with Tokyo Electron gaining Y70 to Y2,350 and Toshiba Y1 to Y613. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 515.05 to 23,146.36 in volume of 53.5m shares. Roundup TAIWAN AND Bombay ended on the positive side, but most markets in the region were affected by Tokyo yesterday. HONG KONG ran into profit-taking but closed off the day's lows. The Hang Seng index lost 23.01 to 4,325.91 as turnover fell to HKDollars 1.33bn from HKDollars 2.15bn. The market was also depressed by rumours of a cash call by Citic Pacific, the locally listed arm of China's overseas investment company, after Citic Pacific announced plans to buy out the 64 per cent of Hang Chong Investment that it does not already own for an estimated HKDollars 5bn. AUSTRALIA was mixed as mining shares continued to rise as a result of the Australian dollar's recent weakness but oil issues fell further. The All Ordinaries index slipped 7.5 to 1,660.4 as turnover declined to ADollars 218m from ADollars 276m. In natural resources, CRA advanced 24 cents to ADollars 12.94 and Pasminco added 11 cents at ADollars 1.55. Soft crude prices weighed on oil shares, Woodside Petroleum shedding 8 cents to ADollars 3.72. NEW ZEALAND weakened in quiet trade. The NZSE-40 index fell 24.67 or 1.6 per cent to 1,493.68. Turnover dropped to NZDollars 10.7m (NZDollars 18.8m). Dual-listed shares were hurt by the exchange rate movements. Carter Holt Harvey dipped 7 cents to NZDollars 2.26 on the market's heaviest turnover of 1.1m shares, while forestry and resources group Fletcher Challenge lost 6 cents to NZDollars 3.30 on volume of 490,000. SINGAPORE saw early dumping of 'foreign' shares in blue chips with limitations on foreign shareholdings, on weekend reports indicating that the stock exchange wanted these limits raised, or abandoned. However, Singapore Airlines, the worst hit, saw its F shares recover from a day's low of SDollars 19.10 to close 50 cents off at SDollars 19.80 after the SES said it had not changed its policy. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 4.81 down at 1,483.25 in quiet trading. KUALA LUMPUR drifted in continuing uncertainty about the Malaysian economy. The KLSE composite index lost 3.21 to 548.69 as turnover slipped from MDollars 91.5m to MDollars 66m. SEOUL continued to fall after Friday's tumble amid reports of foreign selling, the composite index shedding 8.02 to 609.90 as turnover contracted from Won301bn to Won185.3bn. Political friction was said to be one reason behind yesterday's drop. TAIWAN climbed in hectic trading, the weighted index gaining 47.61 to 4,904.43 following a rise of 74 points on Saturday. Turnover was at its heaviest since last June, expanding from TDollars 42.5bn to TDollars 54.3bn. Traders said the strengthening of the plastic, petrochemical and financial sectors in late dealing had led a general recovery after early selling triggered by the drop in Tokyo. BOMBAY set a new closing high on heavy speculative buying as the BSE index added 26.35 or 1.3 per cent at 1,998.88, following an intraday peak of 2,006.84. Brokers said a powerful group of bulls were lifting the market against an indifferent economic news background. The BSE imposed daily limits on purchases of two volatile stocks, Associated Cement and Apollo Tyres, to curb excess speculation, but that failed to hold prices down. ACC forged ahead Rs55 to Rs3,540 and Apollo Tyres moved up Rs4.50 to Rs185.</p>

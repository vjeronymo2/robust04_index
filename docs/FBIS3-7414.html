			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP, REUTERS from Geneva] </F>   [Text] North Korea warned that it will take a certain  practical step if the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  does not withdraw its resolution regarding the nuclear  inspection of North Korea. Today, the North Korean mission to  Geneva distributed the statement issued by the North Korean  General Department of Atomic Energy and denounced that the IAEA  is pursuing a vicious political goal.    North Korea said that if the UN Security Council takes steps  to impose sanctions on North Korea, it will regard these steps  as a declaration of war and that it will take a practical step  corresponding to the IAEA Secretariat's unfairness if the IAEA  does not withdraw its resolution.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANNES FILM FESTIVAL SALUTING CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE  </P> <P> The Cannes film festival pays its own political tribute to the triumph of  democracy in the former Communist Bloc by giving grim East European films  prominence at next month's event.  </P> <P> Only one East European director was short-listed last year for the "Golden  Palm," awarded after 12 days of screenings in the glamorous Riviera resort.  </P> <P> This time four East European directors will be up for the prize, with another  two showing outside the competition.  </P> <P> The sinister aspects of life under the now discredited Communist regimes are  the focus of most of the East Bloc offerings.  </P> <P> In Polish director Ryszard Bugajski's "Przesluchanie" (The Interrogation) a  woman is questioned in a police station, while Czechoslovak director Karel  Kachyna explores the effect of systematic eavesdropping in "Ucho" (The Ear).  </P> <P> Polish director Andrzej Wajda, whose "Korzcak" is not up for the award, tells  the story of a doctor and a group of children struggling to survive in a  concentration camp in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Soviet director Pavel Lounguine's cinematic debut -- "Taxi Blues" -- centers on  the relationship between a cabdriver and an Israeli saxophonist in present-day  Moscow.  </P> <P> Festival president Gilles Jacob, who sat on a panel that whittled the 326 films  originally vying for a place down to 24, stressed that Eastern Europe will not  be allowed to overshadow other countries' offerings.  </P> <P> "We took some of the East European films because they are free and liberated  now, but all parts of the world have been represented," Jacob said.  </P> <P> Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, fresh from winning an honorary Oscar in Los  Angeles last month, will open the festival May 10 with his autobiographical  "Dreams."  </P></p>

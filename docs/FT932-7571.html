			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gold price riding a speculative rollercoaster - At a Glance Gold prices had a topsy-turvy week with the US dollar price touching Dollars 384.50 a troy ounce on Wednesday, its highest level since the panic buying just after the start of the Gulf War in January 1991. The price of gold has rebounded from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in London on the first trading day of 1993. The rise during the past four weeks has been partly inspired by high-profile investors Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, and George Soros, the US investment fund manager. However, the gold price fell back from the Wednesday peak, with some investors taking profits, and dropped to around Dollars 373 an ounce on Friday.</p>

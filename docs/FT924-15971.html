			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Just in time for Divali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, comes an absorbing item on Down To Earth (8.00), C4's magazine programme on archaeology. The Gundestrup Cauldron is the world's most famous cooking-pot. It has now become the most enigmatic archaeological treasure ever unearthed in Denmark. Archaeologists used to believe that this great silver cauldron of the 1st century BC was Celtic. Now they have wiped their spectacles and looked more closely. They discover firstly that it was made in Romania and secondly that there are elephants on the inside. The controversial suggestion is that its makers were gypsies, the deities are Hindu, and that Europe BC was blissfully multi-racial and multi-cultural . . . Which is emphatically not true of Kuwait, as the opening documentary of C4's Critical Eye reminds us. Free Kuwait (9.00) goes over familiar terrain, the Kuwaitis' dislike bordering on paranoid fear of the country's non-Kuwaiti residents. These are ingrained sentiments which, predictably perhaps, have not altered one jot since the war.</p>

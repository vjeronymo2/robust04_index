This was stated by Czech Economics  Minister Karel Dyba, who spoke to German economic correspondents  in Prague. Even though wages are rising in the Czech Republic,  this development is slow.    "We cannot afford excessive wage increases," Dyba says. As a  result of the reduction of real wages in Germany, which began in  1993 and will probably continue in 1994, the Czech economy  already has a problem regarding international competition.  Employers and the state agree on these connections.    When asked what the trade unions think about a virtual wage  freeze in his country, Dyba said: "Trade unions? What is  that?" Because of their communist past, the trade unions still  have problems with being accepted by the people, he said.    The exchange rate of the koruna has been stable since the  beginning of 1991. There are no problems of devaluation. In  1994, the inflation rate will clearly decrease from  approximately 19 percent to below 10 percent. Furthermore, the  inflation rate in 1993 was essentially influenced by the  introduction of the new turnover tax. Dyba wants cooperation  between German and Czech industry to intensify. A total of 30  percent of Czech exports go to Germany: "Therefore, I hope that  the Germans and German industry are well," the minister said.  In the meantime, more than 60 percent of the Czech GNP is  produced by private economy, which did not exist at all four  years ago.    Like Dyba, Richard Salzmann, director General of Komercni  Banka, is in favor of promoting Czech exports. While Salzmann  thinks that an export promotion program subsidized by the state  is necessary, Dyba is rather in favor of private initiatives.    Salzmann said that the method of privatizing the former  state-owned companies in the Czech Republic is very good;  privatization is carried out in part via auctions or direct  sales to private persons, often foreign investors, and in part  via a so-called coupon system, in which any Czech citizen can  participate. The importance of the Stock Exchange in Prague,  where the fund companies will also be listed, will increase  quickly. The Stock Exchange started operating in June 1993.</p>

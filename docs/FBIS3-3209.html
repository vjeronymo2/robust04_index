The delegation, comprised of 16 members of seven nationalist  organizations in Japan, was invited by a private association  that promotes exchanges with the Chinese.    Organizers in Osaka said it is the first time that  representatives from more than one nationalist organization have  been allowed into Communist China at the same time.    The members are scheduled to visit Beijing, Dalian and  Shanghai. They will meet with members of government and research  bodies to debate China's military growth, the export of military  weapons and technology, and China's territorial claims to the  Senkaku Islands located about 160 kilometers north of Yaeyama  Islands, southwest of Okinawa.    The group also will distribute documents outlining arguments  against the commonly accepted version of the 1937 Nanjing  massacre, in which more than 142,000 Chinese were killed  according to estimates made at the Tokyo war crimes trials.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China  this weekend, but the group's organizers said their visit will  be different.    "We take China seriously. Unlike the present  administration's apologetic diplomacy, we want to change the  historical awareness of the last 100 years from the  Sino-Japanese war, which has been only a discussion in diplomacy  of assailants and victims," the members said.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRING ON FOREIGNERS' COMPOUND IN BEIJING MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNED  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has evidence that the shooting by Chinese soldiers  last month at foreign diplomats' apartments was a planned, coordinated attack,  U.S. officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> The officials, who declined to be identified, said the U.S. Embassy will likely  lodge a new complaint this week with the Chinese Foreign Ministry over findings  in a report compiled last week on the June 7 shooting incident.  </P> <P> An embassy investigation of the incident indicated that a Chinese soldier  directed the gunfire and that some shooting may have come from a nearby  building, along with that from troops on a street below the diplomats'  apartments, officials said.  </P> <P> Several Americans and other foreigners, including children, narrowly escaped  injury when the Chinese troops fired hundreds of bullets into the front of a  high-rise apartment building in a compound where foreign diplomats and  journalists reside. The Chinese government said the soldiers were firing at a  sniper.  </P> <P> The shooting came four days after the Chinese army brutally suppressed the  democracy movement, cleared central Tian An Men Square of thousands of  student-led protesters and enforced the martial-law decree announced May 20.  </P></p>

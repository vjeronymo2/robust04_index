			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-Peruvian press  communique was issued here today in which the presidents of the  two countries expressed willingness to continue concerted  efforts for the long-term and stable growth of bilateral ties.    Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori made a state visit to  China from June 8 to 12 at the invitation of Chinese President  Jiang Zemin.    The communique mentioned the official talks between the two  presidents and a meeting between Chinese Premier Li Peng and  Fujimori.    The communique said that the leaders of the two countries  discussed bilateral ties and expressed satisfaction with the  development of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation in the  fields of politics, economy, trade, culture, science and  technology since the two countries established diplomatic  relations 23 years ago, and with the consensus they had reached  on international affairs.    Peru reaffirmed in the communique that it abides by the  principles of a communique on the establishment of diplomatic  ties between the two countries, adhering to its "one-China"  position and recognizing the Government of the People's Republic  of China as the sole legitimate government representing the  whole country. China expressed appreciation for this, the  communique said.    The communique said that the two countries signed an  agreement on the promotion and mutual protection of investment,  a Sino-Peruvian consular agreement, and an agreement for the  Bank of China to provide Peru with export credits.    The leaders of the two countries exchanged views on the  situation in their respective regions and the rest of the world  as well as other major international issues and reached  consensus on these issues.    China wants to further its friendly cooperation with Latin-  American countries. The leaders of the two countries noted that  they enjoy common interests in developing relations between the  Pacific Basin and Latin-America and desire to continue their  efforts to contribute to this. Fujimori invited Chinese  President Jiang Zemin to visit Peru at a time convenient to him,  which Jiang accepted with pleasure.</p>

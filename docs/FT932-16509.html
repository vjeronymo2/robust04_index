			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Republican unity holds up Clinton stimulus bill DEMOCRATIC presidents usually have to worry about their own party's disunity, but for the time being, Republican unity is proving quite enough to block President Bill Clinton in Congress. Yesterday the Senate's Democratic leadership failed for the third time to break a Republican stranglehold over the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending bill which forms a centrepiece of the president's short-term economic plan. The White House, which has tried to push through its economic package with as few amendments as possible, has now been forced into negotiations with the Republicans, but it is unclear whether the two sides can agree on a compromise. While the Democrats hold a notional 57-43 majority, the Senate's sometimes eccentric rules of procedure allow the minority to prevent a vote from taking place unless the majority musters 60 senators to bring debate to an end. The two sides are at odds over the stimulus bill's importance. Republican Senator Phil Gramm calls it 'one last big spending spree' before the administration embarks on the task of reducing the deficit. But Mr Robert Reich, the Labour Secretary, yesterday defended the bill as 'the only way to get jobs back,' and said this position was bolstered by the 'stubbornly high' March unemployment rate of 7.0 per cent announced last week. Whether or not the stimulus bill is necessary, the Senate deadlock is holding up another measure that is critical: a bill to increase the limit on federal debt to Dollars 4,370bn. The Treasury yesterday had to postpone a Dollars 22.4bn auction of Treasury bills, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, estimates the ceiling will be breached tomorrow. For most senators, however, the argument is more a matter of political arm-wrestling - a trial of strength and endurance. For the Republicans, not just the stimulus bill but their influence on all future legislation may be at stake. On the administration's side is the irritation of many House members that the Senate is stopping them from going home for the scheduled Easter/Passover recess, and the opportunity to label the Republicans as champions of gridlock. Although gridlock was unpopular with voters in the last election, so was wasteful government spending, and it appears that the Republicans are winning this particular labelling battle.</p>

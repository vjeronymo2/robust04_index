			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Observer: Tiny error How many people spotted the mistake in Tiny Rowland's defence of Lonrho's contro- versial dealings with Libya in his company's Observer newspaper on Sunday? Tiny's description of his brave attempt to prevent Colonel Gadaffi from nationalising the Libyan assets of British Petroleum at the start of the 1970s is an interesting political footnote. But it does not quite square with other interpretations of what happened. Anthony Sampson, in his book the Seven Sisters, says the Libyans nationalised BP's assets after Iran was allowed to occupy three islands in the Persian Gulf which were under British protection. There is no suggestion that it had anything to do with Gadaffi's unhappiness about being swindled by Britain's ministry of defence over an expensive military radar order  - which is what Rowland implies. The Lonrho chief says that he insisted that Anthony Parsons, who was in charge of the Middle East desk at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, should pass on his warning about the imminent nationalisation of BP's assets to a cabinet headed by then prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. He, however, had stepped down as premier in 1964, and was merely foreign secretary at the time.</p>

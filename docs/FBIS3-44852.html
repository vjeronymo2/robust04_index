We have  interviewed the relevant persons about those questions and have  sorted out their answers in the following paragraphs for your  reference.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What actually constitutes the 1994/95  elections in Hong Kong?    [Relevant person] The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong include  the election of the District Boards in September 1994, the  elections of the Urban Council and the Regional Council in March  1995, and the election of the Legislative Council in September  1995. Because these three tiers of elections are to be  conducted in 1994 and 1995, they are generally called the  1994/95 elections in Hong Kong.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What are these organs called the Legislative  Council, Urban Council, Regional Council, and District Boards?    [Relevant person] The Legislative Council, Urban Council,  Regional Council, and District Boards are the components of the  political structure of the British Hong Kong authorities. They  differ in nature, function, and organization. Let me explain  the general situation as follows:    The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has been established  according to the Letters Patent and is the highest among the  three- tier structure created by the British Hong Kong  authorities. In Hong Kong, the governor holds all the power;  decisionmaking and legislative powers both belong to the  governor. The Legislative Council does not have legislative  power and is only there to assist the governor in legislation,  to debate bills, and to examine and discuss affairs. The  Legislative Council does not have the power to initiate a bill;  this power rests with the Executive Council or the chief  secretary, and the power to approve it rests with the governor.  After a draft bill is adopted in the Legislative Council, it  has to be approved by the governor in order to become law. In  addition, Britain has the power to veto a law which has been  passed by the Legislative Council and approved by the governor.  Britain may also legislate on behalf of Hong Kong. The  Legislative Council in Hong Kong is completely different from  the representative congresses of sovereign states -- which are  legislative organs possessing supreme power -- it is only a  consultative body which advises the governor on legislative  matters. The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has three main  duties: First, to discuss and pass laws proposed by the  Executive Council and to formulate regulations, including those  determining the allocation of funds; second, to discuss,  supervise, and control the government's financial expenditure;  and, third, carry out inquiries and debates on government  policies and matters which concern the people. Since its  establishment in 1843, the Legislative Council in Hong Kong has  undergone major changes in its organization. The current  Legislative Council has 60 members, and among them 18 are  directly elected from districts, 21 are appointed, and 21 are  elected from functional constituencies.    The Urban Council and the Regional Council constitute the  middle tier of the three-tier structure established by the  British Hong Kong authorities. They are regional organizations  that do not have political power. The two councils are on an  equal footing and may also be called the two Municipal Councils.  The former has jurisdiction over Hong Kong Island and the urban  areas in Kowloon, while the latter has jurisdiction over the New  Territories and the outlying islands. Their functions are to  provide residents with cultural, recreational, and urban  services, including environmental management, hygiene control,  management of hawkers, and the construction and management of  public recreational and sports facilities. The current Urban  Council has 40 members, among whom 15 are elected by the people,  15 are appointed, and 10 are members from various urban District  Boards. The current Regional Council has 36 members, among whom  12 are elected by the people, 12 are appointed, nine are members  from the District Boards in the New Territories, and three are  members who have reserved seats -- the chairman and the two vice  chairmen of the Heung Yee Kuk [a body representing the  indigenous population of the New Territories].    The District Boards constitute the lowest tier of the  three-tier structure established by the British Hong Kong  authorities. Like the two Municipal Councils, the District  Boards are regional organizations without political power.  Their function is to provide consultation; in concrete terms,  they primarily provide the government with ideas on matters  which affect the welfare of the individuals who live or work in  the districts and assist in supervising the work and policies of  various government departments at the district level. In  addition, the government often consults the District Boards on  important issues which affect Hong Kong residents, such as the  examination of regulations on urban planning, public housing  policy, and health service reform at the grass-roots level.  Hong Kong is currently divided into 19 districts, and District  Boards differ in the number of members. The current round of  District Boards has a total of 441 members, among whom 274 are  elected by the people, 140 are appointed, and 27 are members who  have reserved seats -- the chairmen of the rural committees of  the New Territories.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why must the Chinese and British Governments  hold talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong?    [Relevant person] According to the provisions of the Sino-  British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Chinese  Government will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July  1997; the British Government will return Hong Kong to the PRC on  1 July 1997; and its administrative power over Hong Kong will  end on 30 June 1997. Therefore, the political system and  framework set up by the British Hong Kong authorities will also  come to an end. Although the Letters Patent and the relevant  stipulations stipulate that the members of the Legislative  Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards --  bodies which have been set up by the British Hong Kong  authorities -- should serve for four years, and, speaking in  terms of time, their tenures will not expire on 30 June 1997,  due to the fact that they are the components of the political  structure established by the British Hong Kong authorities, this  three-tier structure should be disbanded on 30 June 1997. By  then, the new legislative assembly of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] and new regional organizations will  be organized according to the decisions of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the  provisions of the Basic Law. Therefore, in the first place, the  British Hong Kong authorities have no right to bother about the  political structure after 1997. Proceeding from the overall  consideration of maintaining a stable transition for Hong Kong  and the smooth transfer of political power, however, the Chinese  Government hopes to be able to make the proper arrangements for  the transition of the three-tier structure and its members  through cooperation with the British Government on the basis of  convergence with the Basic Law.    As early as the drafting of the Basic Law, the Chinese and  British Governments held many rounds of discussions on the  development of the political system in Hong Kong (including the  exchange of letters between the two foreign ministers in early  1990) and reached agreements, understandings, and a consensus.  The British Government has promised time and again that the  development of Hong Kong's political system during the  transitional period will converge with the Basic Law. In order  to enable the members of the final the Legislative Council in  Hong Kong to become the members of the first legislative  assembly of the Hong Kong SAR, on 4 April 1990, the NPC Standing  Committee adopted the Decision on the Method for the Formation  of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the  Hong Kong SAR, which specifically stipulated that "the first  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR shall be composed of 60  members, with 20 members returned by geographical constituencies  through direct elections, 10 members returned by an election  committee, and 30 members returned by functional constituencies.  If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council  before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity  with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law  of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic  Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and pledge allegiance to the  Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and who meet the requirements set forth  in the Basic Law of the Region may, upon confirmation by the  Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legislative  Council of the Region." Because the two Municipal Councils and  the District Boards were regional organizations without  political power, the NPC did not formulate specific regulations  on the transition of the members of these two tiers of  organizations, leaving the issue to be decided through  discussion between the Chinese and British Governments.    The Sino-British Joint Declaration clearly stipulates that  the Chinese and British Governments should strengthen  cooperation on Hong Kong during the latter part of the  transitional period and should examine together the measures  which must be taken in order to ensure the smooth transfer of  political power and a stable transition. Because the members of  the Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the  District Boards to be elected in 1994 and 1995 all face a  problem of transition, the relevant 1994/95 electoral  arrangements must be discussed by both the Chinese and British  Governments so as to reach a consensus. The Chinese and British  sides held talks this time with the precise purpose of  discussing how the Legislative Council, the two Municipal  Councils, and the District Boards that are to be elected in 1994  and 1995 can converge with the Basic Law, so that their members  can serve beyond 1 July 1997 and can become members of the first  legislative assembly and regional organizations of the Hong Kong  SAR, so as to realize a smooth transition for Hong Kong's  political system.    The Chinese and British sides have yet to reach an agreement  on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements. Under these  circumstances, the British side has already submitted part of  the relevant draft to the Legislative Council for discussion,  and this has meant that the negotiations have stopped. Thus,  the terms of office of the members of the last Legislative  Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards to  be formed by the British Hong Kong authorities in 1994 and 1995,  will have to stop on 30 June 1997.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background against which China  and Britain started talks on the electoral arrangements for Hong  Kong?    [Relevant person] As everyone knows, in October 1992, Hong  Kong Governor Patten, who had been in office for less than three  months, delivered his first policy address, in which he  unilaterally proposed a "constitutional package" which sought to  make important changes to Hong Kong's current political system.  This proposal was made without prior discussion with the  Chinese side, and such a thing should have been done according  to the provisions of the Joint Declaration. The package  included a concrete plan for the 1994/95 electoral arrangements  for Hong Kong. This "package" violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration in terms of content and in terms of the way it was  proposed; it violated the principle of convergence with the  Basic Law; and it violated the relevant agreements and  understandings already reached by the Chinese and British sides.  It may be summarized as the "three violations" political reform  package.    Patten's proposal of the package has placed an obstacle  before cooperation between China and Britain on the Hong Kong  question and has caused unrest and division in Hong Kong  society. If Patten's plan is to be followed, it will make it  impossible to have a smooth transfer of governing power over  Hong Kong in 1997 or to have a smooth transition, and this will  greatly affect Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Shortly  after Patten proposed the "three violations" package, the  Chinese Government expressed their strong objection to it. At  that time, both the Foreign Ministry spokesman and the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office spokesman solemnly pointed out that,  during Hong Kong's transitional period, if the development of  the political system is unable to converge with the Basic Law,  the responsibility will not rest on the Chinese side. When the  leaders of the Chinese Government met the leaders of the British  Government, they repeatedly made it clear that they hoped the  British Government, keeping in mind the overall consideration of  maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and the common  interests of China and Britain, will return to the track of  discussion and cooperation as stipulated by the Sino-British  Joint Declaration. At the same time, Patten's package naturally  met with strong objection and criticism from the people of  various levels in Hong Kong, as well as from knowledgeable  persons in Britain, both within the government and without. It  was precisely under these circumstances that the British  Government had no choice but to request diplomatic negotiations  with the Chinese Government on the issue of Hong Kong's 1994/95  electoral arrangements. Proceeding from the overall  consideration of realizing Hong Kong's smooth transition and  maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the Chinese  Government accepted the proposal on conducting diplomatic  negotiations put forward by the British Government.    [RENMIN RIBAO] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong, what elements of Chris Patten's  proposal gave concrete expression to the "three violations?"    [Relevant person] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's  "three violations" found expression in the following points:    1. He changed the character of the indirect elections  through the functional constituencies and transformed the  elections by functional constituencies into direct elections in  a disguised form. The system of functional constituency  elections was designed by the British Hong Kong Government  according to Hong Kong's history and the condition of social  development and was first put into practice in 1985. It served  the purpose of guaranteeing that people in the business and  professional circles who play an important role in Hong Kong's  economic prosperity and social stability would have  representatives in the Legislative Council. When drafting the  Basic Law, the Chinese Government affirmed such election form in  consideration of the current condition of the development of  Hong Kong's political structure, and the Basic Law specifies  that, for the first three terms of the Legislative Council after  the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, seats would still be  preserved for members elected by functional constituencies.  Because these Legislative Councillors are to be elected by  various functional constituencies determined in legal terms,  this is a form of indirect election. The British Hong Kong  Government also acknowledged in its legal documents that the  functional constituency elections are indirect elections. In  his "constitutional reform package," however, Patten replaced  all forms of corporate voting with individual voters; at the  same time, he extended the franchise in the functional  constituencies to all eligible voters in the local working  population so that "every single worker" in Hong Kong will have  the second opportunity to vote in addition to the direct  election. Patten's arrangement not only changed the original  purpose of arranging functional constituency elections but also  transformed the indirect elections through functional  constituencies into direct elections in various trades.    2. With regard to the composition of the Election Committee,  Patten's proposal violated the Sino-British agreements and  understandings on this issue. In early 1990, the Chinese  Government and the British Government repeatedly held  consultations on the composition of the Election Committee.  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and then British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd exchanged letters several times (these  diplomatic documents were made public on 28 October 1992).  Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on the composition  of the 1995 Election Committee. The British side agreed in  principle with the composition form and proportion specified by  the second point of Annex I of the Basic Law for the Election  Committee, which stipulated that the committee will be composed  of four sectors, specifically, the industrial, commercial, and  financial sector; the professional sector; the labor, social  services, religious, and other sector; and members of the  Legislative Council, representatives of district-based  organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's  Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference. Each sector was to hold 25 percent of  the seats in the Election Committee. Patten, however,  disregarded the agreement reached by the Chinese side and the  British side a long time ago and put forth a different method  for forming the Election Committee in his "constitutional reform  package." According to Patten, the committee will be wholly or  mostly composed of directly elected District Board members. The  Basic Law's specification that the Election Committee be  included in the election of the first SAR Legislative council  was aimed at increasing the representativeness of the  Legislative Council and ensuring the balanced participation of  people in all social strata and in all walks of life. Patten's  proposal, however, not only directly violated the agreement that  had been reached by China and Britain, but also went against the  original reason for setting up the Election Committee.    3. On the issue of the elections of the District Boards and  the two municipal councils, Patten proposed in his package that  all appointed membership to these organizations be discontinued.  This violated the principle of the gradual development of Hong  Kong's political structure specified by the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law. In addition, this was not suited  to the actual operational needs of the District Boards and the  two municipal councils.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the crux of the Sino-British dispute  over the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong?    [Relevant person] Chris Patten introduced his  "constitutional reform package" in the name of "expanding  democracy in Hong Kong." This gave the public the false  impression that Patten is trying to expand democracy in Hong  Kong, while the Chinese side does not agree with the development  of democracy in Hong Kong. This is absolutely not the case.    For more than 150 years of British rule in Hong Kong, the  governors have consistently arrogated all power to themselves,  and there has never been democracy whatsoever in Hong Kong. The  Hong Kong Legislative Council was established in 1843, and all  of its members were appointed by the governors in over 140 years  after that. Not until 1985 -- after the Sino-British Joint  Declaration on the Hong Kong issue was signed -- did a few  indirectly elected legislative members sit on the council.  Therefore, the development of Hong Kong's political structure  must proceed from this historical and social reality and must  proceed in an orderly way step by step so that it will be  favorable to the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability. In the remaining years of the transitional period,  Patten rashly decided to "expand democracy in Hong Kong" and  make a great change to the existing constitutional system  without regard to the agreements, understandings, and consensus  that the Chinese side and the British side had reached. He did  this in an attempt to impose the British-style parliamentary  democracy upon Hong Kong and to compel Hong Kong to cover the  road to a perfect parliamentary democracy in a few years which  the Western capitalist countries took several hundred years to  cover. This can only serve to create obstacles to a smooth  transfer of power and endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability.    The Chinese Government has consistently favored promoting  democracy in Hong Kong. It was the Chinese Government, when  beginning the talks on the Hong Kong issue with the British side  in 1982, that clearly announced the adoption of such principles  and policies as "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong  people to administer Hong Kong," and "allowing Hong Kong to  exercise a high degree of autonomy" after China recovers  sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Basic Law, in particular,  provides specific and adequate guarantees for the Hong Kong  people's democratic rights. According to the Basic Law, the  chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR will be selected by  election or through consultations and ultimately will be  selected by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly  representative nominating committee in accordance with  democratic procedures. The SAR Legislative Council will have  full legislative power and administrative supervisory power. It  will have the right to impeach the chief executive. The number  of seats returned by direct elections will increase from 20 to  30 in a short period of six years from 1997 to 2003. The method  of forming the SAR Legislative Council will be specified in  light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in  accordance with the principle of orderly and gradual progress,  and all members of the Legislative Council will eventually be  elected by universal suffrage. Facts show that the democracy to  be introduced in Hong Kong after 1997 as stipulated by the Basic  Law will be much greater than that which has been given to the  Hong Kong people by the British rulers over the last 150 years.  This was precisely the reason why the Basic Law was extensively  supported by the masses from all social strata in Hong Kong.  When the Basic Law was officially promulgated in April 1990,  the spokesman for the British Foreign Office also explicitly  indicated that the Basic Law "lays the foundation for Hong  Kong's future status" and "is the acceptable reflection of the  Joint Declaration." In the course of drafting the Basic Law,  the British side repeatedly stressed the need for the  convergence of the pre- 1997 developments of Hong Kong's  political structure with the Basic Law, and the Chinese side and  the British side reached a consensus on this matter. Obviously,  the British side should make arrangements for Hong Kong's  1994-95 elections in accordance with the principle of  convergence with the Basic Law and with the agreements and  understandings reached by the two sides in order to make things  favorable to the changeover of government and smooth transition  in 1997. However, the British side has openly broken faith with  the Chinese side and has gone its own way.    All this shows that the crux of the Sino-British dispute  over  Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements is in no way  concerned with a number of specific issues related, for example,  to the arrangements of the functional constituency elections or  the election committee election, nor does it concern the issue  of whether it is necessary to promote democracy in Hong Kong or  the speed at which democracy should be promoted; rather, this is  a matter of whether the British side is willing to act in good  faith and a matter of political principle concerning whether it  is still willing to honor the Joint Declaration, to make the  development of Hong Kong's political structure converge with the  Basic Law, and to observe and implement the agreements and  understandings that the two sides have reached.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the basic position and attitude that  the Chinese have held in the talks?    [Relevant person] When the two sides were still making  preparations before the beginning of the talks, the Chinese side  announced its position, that the Sino-British talks on the  1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong must be based on the  Sino- British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence  with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and  understandings already reached between the two sides.    The Chinese Government maintained that, if the two sides  could reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral  arrangements through the talks, this would be conducive to the  smooth transfer of government and a smooth transition in 1997,  would be favorable to both sides, and would be in keeping with  the fundamental and long- term interests of the Hong Kong  residents. In order to enable the talks to proceed smoothly and  to reach an agreement at an earlier date, the Chinese side  consistently held a sincere and positive attitude toward the  talks and made great efforts to promote the talks inside and  outside the meeting place and to quicken the process of the  talks. The Chinese side agreed to restore the meeting of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the meeting of the Airport  Committee; solved the issues concerning the cable television  franchise contract, the renewal of Hong Kong Electric's  agreement, and the garbage landfill zone in the western New  Territories; made the Sino-British Land Commission solve the  1993-94 land allocation issue; endorsed starting the western  tunnel project and the Central and Wanchai reclamation project  before a comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial  arrangements was reached; and proposed that two meetings of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group be held separately in Beijing  and London within 1993 to quicken its work. All this showed the  Chinese side's sincerity for restoring Sino-British cooperation  on the Hong Kong issue. In the course of the talks, the Chinese  side not only adhered to its principles, it also showed  flexibility. For issues on which agreements and understandings  had been reached by the two sides in the past, the Chinese side  insisted on following the existing agreements and  understandings; on issues which were not explicitly mentioned by  the existing agreements and understandings or had not been  discussed by the two sides, the Chinese side adopted a flexible  approach and showed its willingness to hold discussions with the  British side in order to seek solutions acceptable to both sides.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the talks make progress so slowly  and fail to reach any agreement over such a long time?    [Relevant person] Before the beginning of the talks, the  British side agreed with the principle of converging with the  Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and agreed to  take the agreements and understandings that the two side had  reached in the past as the foundation for the talks as the  Chinese side required. If the British side could actually act  according to these "three principles" in the talks, then it  would not be difficult for the two sides to reach an agreement.  However, things did not go according to our wishes. The  British side repeatedly went back on its words during the talks.  It not only refused to put forth its own plan according to the  relevant provisions of the Basic Law, but also refused to  acknowledge the agreements and understandings previously reached  between the two countries. In the talks, although the British  side showed some flexibility on certain concrete issues, it  continued to insist on the position of Patten's "three  violations" package and made no substantial changes. For the  issues which are not clearly specified in the Basic Law or on  which the two sides did not reach agreements or understandings  in the past, the British side stubbornly required the Chinese  side to totally accept its ideas. Moreover, during the talks,  the British side even mentioned some affairs within the scope of  China's sovereignty and some issues that were not related to the  talks and required the Chinese side to make a promise, thus  creating obstacles to the talks.    At the beginning of the talks, the British side said that  they had always maintained a positive and constructive attitude  toward the talks, but actual practice in the talks only showed  the opposite. During the course of the talks, the British side  continued to play "little tricks" to undermine and disrupt the  smooth process of the talks. For example, before the two sides  reached any agreement, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council  hastily adopted the "draft bill on the Boundary and Election  Commission" and substantially increased the number of elected  District Board members, and the British Hong Kong authorities  gazetted the "Ordinance on the Proposed Number and Names of  Districts" and decided to decrease the number of District Boards  from 19 to 18. The British Hong Kong authorities also connived  at and supported the decision of the Constitutional Development  Panel of the Legislative Council to discuss Governor Patten's  "constitutional package" in an attempt to advance the  legislative process while the talks were going on. A senior  official from the British Foreign Ministry even openly alleged  that the future Sino- British agreement would be submitted to  the Legislative Council for discussion and revision, thus  placing the decision of the Hong Kong Legislative Council above  the agreement reached by the Chinese and British Governments.  Throughout the process of the talks, the British side also  continued to exert pressure on the Chinese side by setting a  deadline for the talks and warned that "the Hong Kong governor  would make a decision if there was no obvious progress in the  talks."    Because the British side stubbornly stuck to Patten's "three  violations" package and created obstacles to the talks on every  issue, the talks made progress very slowly and failed to reach  any agreement over a long period of time.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the Chinese side propose that the  issue concerning the arrangements for the Legislative Council  elections and the District Board and Municipal Council elections  be separately discussed and solved? What was the British side's  attitude toward this?    [Relevant person] In order to advance the talks and also in  consideration of the fact that the elections to the District  Boards and the two Municipal Councils will be held earlier and  that the issue related to this part of elections is simpler, in  the fourth round of the talks the Chinese side proposed that the  issue concerning the arrangements for the elections to the  District Boards and Municipal Councils be first discussed and  solved before the issues concerning the Legislative Council  elections are discussed. However, this proposal was rejected by  the British side, which argued that the 1994-95 elections should  be handled as a "package." As the talks had been held for more  than five months and little progress had been made, on 1 October  when meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in New  York, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen once  again proposed that the 1994-95 electoral arrangements be  discussed and solved in two separate parts. Qian pointed out  that, as 1994 was drawing near, time was pressing, and the 1994  elections were comparatively simpler, so the two sides might  first discuss the issue of the 1994 elections and reach an  agreement. The more complicated 1995 election issue can wait,  as there is still time for the two sides to continue the  discussion. This was the principle of "dealing with easier  things first and dealing with more difficult things later" and  the reason behind the Chinese side's proposal for "separately"  dealing with the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong.  At that time, the British side once again turned down the  Chinese side's proposal. In his second policy address in  October 1993, Patten also made it clear that "this was  impracticable." Because the Chinese side's proposal was  reasonable, however, it was endorsed and supported widely by  many Hong Kong people. Afterward, the British side had no  choice but to agree with the Chinese side's proposal on  discussing the electoral arrangements for the District Boards  and Municipal Councils first, but it set forth three  preconditions: requiring the Chinese side to agree to lower the  voting age from 21 to 18, to accept the British side's proposal  on the voting method, and to discontinue all appointed  membership in these organizations. The British side's  intentions were obvious. On one hand, it tried to meet the Hong  Kong people's wishes by agreeing to "separately" handle the  1994-95 electoral arrangements in order to free itself from the  predicament; on the other hand, it tried to use the three  preconditions to set an obstacle to the actual "separate"  handling, because, if the Chinese side did not accept the three  requirements, "separate" handling would become impossible.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why is it said that it is entirely possible  for China and Britain to reach an accord on the electoral  arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal  bodies?    [Relevant person] The Chinese side has criticized the  British side's consent for "separating" the 1994 and 1995  electoral arrangements and its practice of setting out three  preconditions, while indicating that that was not a constructive  attitude in seeking a solution. Proceeding from the overall  situation, however, the Chinese side agreed to the British  side's requirement on lowering the voting age from 21 to 18  years, while raising no objection to the British side's proposal  of adopting the "one-seat, one-vote system" (a district ballot  method, namely, the number of districts coincides with the  number of seats, with only one seat to every district. Each  voter can cast only one vote in the election.) On the issue of  abolishing appointed seats, the Chinese side set forth a  different opinion. That was the focus of the argument between  the Chinese and British sides over the electoral arrangements  for district boards and the two municipal bodies.    Chris Patten's suggestion on abolishing the appointed seats  in the district boards and the two municipal bodies in his  "constitutional reform package" immediately met strong  opposition from the presidents of the district boards and the  two municipal bodies and the majority of their members. Neither  did the majority of Hong Kong residents approve of abolishing  all appointed seats. Taking into consideration this wish of Hong  Kong residents as well as the actual operation of the district  boards and the two municipal bodies, the Chinese side believed  that maintaining some appointed seats would be conducive to  those bodies better exercising their functions, and fall in line  with Hong Kong's actual conditions; on such grounds, the Chinese  side was for maintaining the existing number of appointed seats  in the district boards and the two municipal bodies.  Nevertheless, on the grounds that the Legislative Council would  abolish the system of appointed seats in the 1995 election, the  British side insisted on the abolition of appointed seats in the  district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British  side's grounds did not hold water. Whether or not the appointed  seats exist in the district boards and the two municipal bodies  has nothing to do with the election of the Legislative Council,  because their nature and functions are different. The two sides  conducted repeated discussions on this issue; despite the fact  that the Chinese side compromised and stated that the number of  appointed seats should be axed to one-fourth of all seats from  the original one-third based on the principle of proceeding in  an orderly way and step by step, the British side was bent on  abolishing all appointed seats, and was unwilling to yield an  inch.    In order to reach an accord with the British side on the  electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two  municipal bodies as quickly as possible, the Chinese side  exerted efforts again during the 15th round of talks, and set  out a compromise way of taking into consideration both sides'  positions, bypassing disputes, namely, an explanation would be  added to the understanding reached between the two sides: The  British side was for abolishing the appointed seats in the  district boards and the two municipal bodies; the Chinese side  was for maintaining an appropriate proportion of appointed  seats. After 30 June 1997, the Hong Kong SAR Government would  decide on the number of district boards and appointed seats on  its own based on the stipulation of Basic Law Article 98. This  plan of the Chinese side actually allowed the British side to  abolish appointed seats before 30 June 1997, but after that date  an appropriate proportion of appointed seats would be  established according to the relevant stipulation in the Basic  Law by the Hong Kong SAR Government. The British side agreed to  the Chinese side's opinion on the issue of appointed seats  mentioned above.    By then, the Chinese side had already adopted the British  side's opinions on the issues of the voting age, voting method,  and appointed seats involved in the elections of the district  boards and the municipal councils, and had met the British  side's demands.    In addition to the aforesaid issues, there were two other  issues involving the election of the district boards and the  municipal councils. One of the issues was that the  nongovernment nature and functions of the Hong Kong district  boards and the two municipal bodies would remain unchanged in  the last four years of the transition period because of  convergence with the relevant stipulation in the Basic Law. On  this issue, there was no major difference between the Chinese  and British sides. Another issue was that for convergence with  the Basic Law, the Chinese side required the British side to  promise to lift restrictions on delegates to the people's  congresses at various levels from the Hong Kong area  participating in elections. On this issue, the British side  eventually expressed their agreement after some procrastination.    The aforesaid conditions showed that on all issues involved  in the elections of the district boards and the two municipal  bodies, the Chinese side and its British counterpart tended to  become unanimous in their positions. In fact, it was entirely  possible for the two sides to reach an accord on the electoral  arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal  bodies in the wake of the 15th round.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why was it that the two sides failed to reach  an accord when the Chinese side and its British counterpart had  tended to become unanimous in their positions on all issues  involved in the elections of the district boards and the two  municipal bodies?    [Relevant person] The cause of the failure of the two  sides to reach an accord on the electoral arrangements for the  district boards and the two municipal bodies lies precisely in  the fact that the British side raised new issues and set out new  demands.    Before the 16th round of talks began, the British side put  to  its Chinese counterpart the proposal that the voting method  characterized by "one seat, one vote" for the election of the  district boards and the two municipal bodies must also be  applicable to the 1995 district elections of the Legislative  Council. This demand of the British side was groundless,  because neither regulations nor precedent exist that the same  voting method must be adopted in the elections of district  boards, the two municipal bodies, and the Legislative Council.  Matters regarding the election of the Legislative Council,  including the voting method to be adopted, could be resolved  later in discussions on those elections. Otherwise, matters  could be made complicated, and it would not be conducive to the  talks' progress. However, the British side insisted on  including the application of the "one seat, one vote" voting  method to the election of the Legislative Council in the  memorandum of understanding on the electoral arrangements for  the district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British  side stated that its demand was based on the need for a  "balanced" accord, for "practical and political reasons."    The so-called "balance" the British side referred to was its  agreement to lift the restrictions on delegates to the people's  congresses at various levels participating in the election of  the three-tier assemblies, with the change in the voting age  being applicable to the three-tier elections. Under such  circumstances, if the Chinese side disagreed with adopting the  same voting method for the election of the three-tier  assemblies, that would spell imbalance. Directed at the British  way of putting it, the Chinese side specially submitted a draft  understanding to the British side in the 17th round of talks,  with the suggestion that the three points, namely, the voting  age, the voting method, and lifting restrictions on delegates to  the people's congresses be confined to the elections to the  district boards and the two municipal bodies, and that all  issues involving the elections to the Legislative Council be  resolved later. However, the suggestion of the Chinese side  aimed at seeking a solution to the problems was immediately  rejected by the British side.    As to the so-called "practical and political reasons," the  British side chiefly referred to the two following points:  First, the legislation on the voting method for the Legislative  Council needs be adopted as quickly as possible; if the voting  method should pass through legislation on two occasions, that  would be a waste of time. In actual fact, the voting method for  the district boards and the two municipal bodies and that for  the Legislative Council have no necessary connection; their  legislation has always been separate in the past. Furthermore,  the election of the Legislative Council is to take place in  September 1995, it was not so pressing in terms of time, and  could be resolved later on. That being the case, this reason of  the British side's did not hold water. Second, the British side  said that back in 1992 the Legislative Council had adopted a  motion on its adoption of the "one seat, one vote system" for  its 1995 election; that being the case, it was imperative to fix  such a voting method at present. The British side actually  wanted the Chinese side to accept the opinion of the Hong Kong  Legislative Council, and place its opinion above the talks  between the Chinese and British Governments. The Chinese side  would never accept that point.    Under the circumstance that the British side had failed to  achieve its aim of killing two birds with one stone, namely  simultaneously resolving the voting method for the Legislative  Council and that for the district boards and the two municipal  bodies, the British issued a "statement" shortly before the  conclusion of the 17th round, saying that the British side could  no longer continue the understanding reached with the Chinese  side in the first phase of the talks, and unilaterally announced  the interruption [zhong duan 0022 2451] of the talks on the  electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two  municipal bodies. Facts have proved that precisely because of  the jeopardy deliberately introduced by the British side, no  accord was reached in the Sino-British talks on the electoral  arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal  bodies.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Why do we say that the British side should  be held responsible for the termination of the Sino-British  talks over Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements?    [Relevant person] Before the talks started, when both sides  sides were discussing through diplomatic channels the issue of  holding talks, the Chinese side already had pointed clearly that  if the British side submitted the relevant bills to the  Legislative Council [Legco] before an agreement was reached  between China and Britain through the talks, it would indicate  that the British side had no sincerity whatsoever in the talks  and would mean the termination of talks; the responsibility  would not rest on the Chinese side. Through diplomatic channels  the Chinese side once again expressed this solemn and just stand  following the end of the 17th round of talks, but the British  side turned a deaf ear to the repeated warnings and dissuasion  of the Chinese Government. On 2 December 1993, Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten issued a statement on Hong Kong's  1994/1995 electoral arrangements, declaring that on 10 December  1993, he would gazette part of his bill on Hong Kong's elections  and on 15 December, would submit the bill for discussion by  Legco.    In response to this British move, spokesmen from the Chinese  Foreign Ministry, the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch in Hong Kong  issued separate statements reiterating that if the British Hong  Kong authorities went ahead with the legislative process on the  1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong, this would mean that the  British side had terminated the talks unilaterally. The British  side went ahead, however, regardless of warnings, gazetting the  relevant bill as scheduled, and tabling it before Legco for its  first and second readings.    The facts demonstrate that the Chinese side has shown the  utmost sincerity and patience toward the talks, and that the  British side should be held fully responsible for their  termination. Although the British side has continued to say  that they wish to have an 18th round of talks with the Chinese  side on the remaining issues related to the 1994/1995 elections  -- which are more complicated -- and that they "will never leave  the negotiating table," this is but a trick to deceive the  public and to shift responsibility for terminating the talks  onto the other side. If the British side is truly sincere about  resuming the talks, reopening of talks will be possible only  after it has withdrawn the partial bill that has been tabled  before Legco. The door to negotiations remains open; the key  lies in the attitude of the British side.    [RENMIN RIBAO] As the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's  electoral arrangements have terminated, what does the Chinese  side plan to do?    [Relevant person] It is very clear that because China and  Britain are unable to reach an agreement on Hong Kong's  1994/1995 electoral arrangements, the transition issue does not  exist for the members of the last Legco, the two municipal  councils, and the district boards of the British Hong Kong  administration. Their term of office will last only until 30  June 1997. By that time, the Chinese side will have "set up  another kitchen" in accordance with the decisions of the NPC and  the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, and will have  reconstituted Legco and the district organizations of the Hong  Kong SAR.    Recently, the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong  SAR Preparatory Committee held its second plenary meeting. The  participants discussed Hong Kong's current situation and  expressed their strong resent against the serious measures taken  by the British side, which submitted part of the bill concerning  Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements to the Legco under  conditions of no agreement having been reached between the  Chinese and British Governments. The meeting held that this was  a deliberate sabotage of the talks by the British side and that  the British Government should be held responsible for all  consequences. It decided to accelerate the pace of various  preparatory work for resuming the exercise of sovereignty over  Hong Kong.</p>

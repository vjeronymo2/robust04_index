			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Ringing in a new lightweight phone Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, this month launches what it claims is the smallest and lightest mobile phone for the new digital networks springing up worldwide, writes Andrew Adonis. Weighing less than 200 grams with a special lightweight battery, the Nokia 2110 'family' offers the same basic design and features for Europe's GSM and PCN networks, the American TDMA standard and the emerging Japanese Digital Phone System. It intensifies competition in the market for digital handsets, the high price of which is one of the main obstacles to the growth of digital networks in countries - such as the UK - with mature analogue networks. Nokia is likely to launch the 2110 on the UK market at a price competitive with existing Siemens and Motorola digital handsets, which retail at between Pounds 250 and Pounds 300.

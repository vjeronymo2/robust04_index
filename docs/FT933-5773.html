			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread advances In a firm brewery sector, Whitbread stood out, helped by a broker's buy note together with continued speculation over the fate of Grand Metropolitan's Chef and Brewer public houses-restaurants chain. The 'A' shares advanced 10 to 544p in moderate turnover. Kleinwort Benson turned buyer of Whitbread, arguing that the group was exceptionally placed to take advantage of the UK economic recovery on both its brewing and retail fronts. The company's position in retailing in particular will mean it will recover more quickly than other brewing stocks, according to Mr Andrew Holland at Kleinwort. 'The improvement in cash flow over the last two years has been dramatic and should prove sustainable,' he said. Meanwhile, weekend press speculation over whether GrandMet will sell its 750-strong Chef and Brewer chain again spilled over into the market, although brewing analysts said there was little fresh news to be garnered. Both Whitbread and Bass are said to have made enquiries over the chain - on which analysts put a price tag of between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn. However, speculation is growing that GrandMet may parcel off the division should one buyer prove hard to find. Boddington was yet another name being mentioned as a potential buyer yesterday. Bass shares were steady at 502p. GrandMet 3 ahead at 460p and Boddington a penny up at 281p. Dealers adopted a cautious approach to trading in HSBC both ahead of and following the interim results. These came in towards the bottom of the market's range of expectations, put at between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn, although a more refined view was between Pounds 1.1bn and Pounds 1.3bn. HSBC shares traded around 7 higher at 740p immediately before and after the figures, but subsequently fell away to 725p as analysts scrutinised the figures in detail and sought guidance from the accompanying statement. Thereafter the shares crept forward, finally to stand a net penny up at 734p. Turnover of only 3.9m was described as disappointing by marketmakers. The other big banks came under pressure late in the day, Barclays sliding 9 to 499p on 2.6m traded and Lloyds 5 to 554p. National Westminster dipped 3 to 494p and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 7 to 276p. Composite insurances extended their recent dull performance as the market became increasingly nervous about Sun Alliance's interim report, scheduled for tomorrow. Sun Alliance shares slipped 5 to 385p, with less than 1m shares traded. Analysts expect the group to achieve profits of up to Pounds 80m, compared with a previous deficit of around Pounds 98m. There was little reaction in the market to news of losses expected by Chubb Corporation, the manager of Sun Alliance business in the US. Chubb said its Pacific Indemnity unit would incur losses following the settlement of a multi-billion dollar abestos lawsuit with Fibreboard Corporation. A bout of profit-taking left the oil sector with a sprinkling of small falls. The leaders, among the FT-SE 100's best performers over the past two weeks, drifted easier, with BP losing 3 1/2 at 316 1/2 p on 6.4m traded and Shell 5 at 673p. A press suggestion that Norwich Union, the insurance company and among the biggest investors in the oil exploration and production sub-sector, could be about to lighten its considerable holdings triggered a flurry of selling in companies such as Goal, 2 easier at 57p, and Clyde, 2 1/2 off at 51 1/2 p. Recent high-flyer Lasmo tumbled 5 1/2 to 148p. Shares in UK airports operator BAA were boosted by reports from British Airways of a sharp increase in traffic out of London's Gatwick Airport in recent months. BAA moved ahead 15 to 833p, while the British flag carrier's shares ended 5 firmer at 360p in trade of 2.9m. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel continued to strengthen amid continued hopes of a cut in interest rates in France, home of many of the investors in the stock. The shares added 8 at 485p. Among engineering stocks, hopes of a tank order for engineering group Vickers, which reports interim figures tomorrow, left the shares 2 1/2 dearer at 151 1/2 p. Profits are expected to be in the range of Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m, against a Pounds 4.1m loss a year earlier. News that flotation plans for BM Group's Australian subsidiary Austoft were well advanced cheered the market, helping the shares harden a penny to 17 1/2 p. Metals group Johnson Matthey dropped 22 to 480p after General Motors, of the US, one of its customers, launched legal action against JM. Speculation that international mining group RTZ would soon be making further disposals, following last week's sale of most of its Pillar business to MB-Caradon, pushed the shares up 7 to 741p. Caradon dipped 4 to 336p on profit-taking. SG Warburg was said to be positive on BTR, which gained 3 1/2 at 399 1/2 p. Renewed speculation that Reed International will soon announce the purchase of Official Airline Guide, the US publisher, helped the shares appreciate 16 to 733p. Among the property sector, Slough Estates weakened 4 to 236p on a negative note from NatWest Securities.</p>

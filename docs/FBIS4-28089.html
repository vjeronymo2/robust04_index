			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  instructed his aides Tuesday to consider having the Hiroshima  atomic bomb dome placed on a UN list of world heritage sites.    Hata told an informal cabinet meeting he supports  registration of the building and directed Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and other officials to look into the  matter, officials said.    "Nuclear weapons are a tragic thing and Japan ought to be  telling the people of the world that it is the only country to  have suffered an atomic bombing," Hata told reporters after the  meeting.    The move followed a proposal at the meeting by Koshiro  Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination  Agency, that the dome should become a heritage site to mark next  year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.    Ishida told a news conference the listing of the dome  deserves consideration because the Nazi-built World War II  Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland is also on the UN list.  Poland placed it on the list in 1979.    Several million people, many of them Jews, were killed in  the  concentration camps.    Supporters of the bid to have the dome registered have  argued  that it is comparable in significance to the Auschwitz camp  since it is a symbol of the suffering caused by the war and a  reminder of the dangers of nuclear warfare.    "Japan is the only country to have suffered an atomic  bombing  and has an obligation to signal peace to the world," Ishida said.    Japan joined the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) convention concerning the protection of  the world cultural and natural heritage in June 1992, 20 years  after its creation.    The dome, a symbol of the nuclear attack on the city in the  closing days of World War II, is part of the former Hiroshima  Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall designed by Czechoslovak  architect Jan Letzel.    The ferroconcrete building was some 160 meters below the  point at which the atomic bomb exploded on Aug. 6, 1945.    The World Heritage Program, begun in 1978, aims to protect  sites and landmarks of outstanding universal significance.    The UNESCO list of more than 360 sites throughout the world  includes the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Taj Mahal in  India, Chartres Cathedral in France, and Serengeti National Park  in Tanzania.    The four sites Japan has listed include Yakushima, an island  dotted with Japanese cedars off the southernmost main island of  Kyushu, the Shirakami mountain region with its beech trees  straddling Aomori and Akita Prefectures in northern Japan, the  seventh-century Horyuji temple in Nara Prefecture and the 17th  century Himeji Castle in Hyogo Prefecture, both western Japan.    The Hiroshima city assembly and Rengo Hiroshima, an  organization comprising a number of local groups, have backed a  campaign to persuade Diet members to register the dome.    But to qualify for placing by the government on the UNESCO  list, sites in Japan must be designated under the Cultural  Properties Law.    The Agency for Cultural Affairs, which administers the law,  normally only registers sites from before the postfeudal Meiji  era, which began in 1868.    Any decision to register the dome would have to be made in  time for a UNESCO-sponsored international meeting in December at  which site nominations are assessed.</p>

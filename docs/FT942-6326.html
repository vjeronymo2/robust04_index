			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Costs soar in battle for Lasmo Enterprise Oil is expected today to extend its hostile Pounds 1.3bn bid for rival explorer Lasmo as the costs of the battle between Britain's two largest independents spiral to more than Pounds 30m. By the time the offer period expires at the end of July, Lasmo will have spent Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m defending its independence. Enterprise is likely to pay a similar price in fees and charges if successful and a mere Pounds 5m if the bid fails. Combining the two companies could cost Enterprise more than Pounds 80m in restructuring charges, although advisers say overhead savings of Pounds 30-Pounds 40m a year could be achieved. The offer is likely to be extended to June 17, with most investors expecting the all-paper bid to be revised. A new offer could include some form of cash or a revised paper deal in the light of Enterprise's weakened share price. As the battle nears the half-way stage, Lasmo is set to question further Enterprise's accounting standards, but it is also expected to retract an earlier charge that Enterprise has had little international success. It did not include Enterprise's Norwegian operations in its calculations. It has been invited to give the Takeover Panel additional details of allegation that Enterprise's techniques allowed it to inflate earnings. Lasmo will come under pressure to persuade institutional investors that it has the financial resources to exploit all its development opportunities. One shareholder said price was not the main issue. Lasmo needed to show that it was a better developer of assets than Enterprise. 'Lasmo has to prove to us that it deserves its independence.' Although Enterprise has come under attack for not fully explaining the logic behind its offer, speculation intensified that the bid had been motivated in part by the chance to swap some of Lasmo's assets. 'There is a bit too much confidence on Enterprise's part for them not to have done deals or know they can do them,' said one institutional investor. A combined company would have the largest acreage in the UK continental shelf. Asset trading would strengthen cash flow and the combined balance sheet, allowing the larger group to accelerate appraisal and development of Lasmo assets in Algeria and Colombia. The bid values Lasmo paper at about 130p, compared with Friday's 148p close. Jewel in the crown, Page 19</p>

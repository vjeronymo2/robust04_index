			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["If IAEA Secretariat Refuses To Accept Our Reasonable </F> Proposal, We Will Have No Other Alternative But To Replace Fuel  Rod, Spokesman of DPRK Foreign Ministry" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- If the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] Secretariat carries the  situation into the extremities despite our utmost magnanimity  and good will, we will resolutely counter it, warned a spokesman  of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in his answer to a question  put by KCNA today concerning the replacement of fuel rod at the  5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station.    He told KCNA the DPRK did not delay the issue of entry visas  to five inspectors selected by the IAEA side so that they may be  present at the place of the replacement of fuel rod and verify  the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes.    This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat is raising an  unreasonable demand for selecting, preserving and measuring some  fuel at the time of the replacement of fuel rod, the spokesman  said, and added:    This can never be allowed because it means routine and ad  hoc  inspections ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of its declared  withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty].    It is crystal clear that, if we allow the selective  measurement of the fuel rod, the agency Secretariat will find a  new pretext for a pressure on the DPRK.    If the agency Secretariat refuses to accept our reasonable  proposal and persists in its unreasonable demand, we will have  no other alternative but to replace the fuel rod according to  our operation plan.    Whether the IAEA inspectors are present or not, the spent  fuel rod counter, the thermo-luminescence detector and  monitoring apparatuses installed by the IAEA at the experimental  nuclear power station are operating continuously, and this means  that our replacement of fuel rod is carried out strictly under  the surveillance of the IAEA.    We can no longer allow the IAEA Secretariat to use our  "nuclear problem" as a political expedient.</p>

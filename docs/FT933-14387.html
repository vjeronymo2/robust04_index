			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (6): Some worrying trends - Unemployment statistics analysed NOBODY is quite sure why there was a fourth successive monthly fall in the West Midlands unemployment figures in May. In fact - surprisingly, given the level of business - the employment position looked more cheerful than for over a year. More cheerful, that is, because the unemployment position had ceased to deteriorate. Analysis by the West Midlands Enterprise Board shows that over the period between November 1992 and May 1993, unemployment across the region fell by 0.1 per cent. At the same time there have been some more job opportunities. The rough measurement of the unemployment to vacancy ratio (reached by dividing the number of jobless by the number of job centre and careers office vacancies) fell to 29 in May from 32.7 in April. The national ratios were respectively 21.1 and 23. The figures are surprising because, as Mr Martin Booth, the WMEB's chief economist, says: 'One would have expected a stronger output rise before unemployment declines.' But he also notes that, traditionally, 'the West Midlands goes deeper into recession than the national economy and, when it comes out, it comes out faster than the national average.' The difficulty is that the overall figures contain some damaging trends. Not least among them is the high proportion of those who have been without jobs for more than a year and are thus classified as long term unemployed. This proportion has increased in regional terms to 38.5 per cent of the May 1993 total unemployed from 36 per cent in October 1992. The national average is 35.8 per cent. Once the long term unemployed percentages are narrowed down, sharp differences emerge within the region. The area with the highest percentage is that of the old West Midlands county - the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation with Solihull and Coventry. Here the proportion is 43.3 per cent  -compared with 29.8 per cent in Shropshire, lowest in the region. A second series of damaging statistics comes from the absolute numbers when they are broken down to ward level. Total unemployment in the region during May was 282,300; or 11.1 per cent, against a national average of 10.4 per cent. But there are 12 wards in the conurbation - five in Birmingham, three in Wolverhampton, two in Coventry and one each in Sandwell and Walsall - where male unemployment rates run at more than 35 per cent. The main thing these wards have in common is that they are inner city areas. Local authorities worry that there are enlarging communities which are moving outside the economic cycle: even when the economy recovers, the unemployment rate in the inner city wards will remain high. It is to these areas, of course, that development programmes are directed. But the effect of areas of unemployment and deprivation on the general business growth of the West Midlands region is not clear; prosperity and poverty have marched hand in hand in the Midlands since the industrial revolution. Moreover, there is a danger that deprivation saps confidence and drives away potential investors whatever the attractions of, say, a city centre.</p>

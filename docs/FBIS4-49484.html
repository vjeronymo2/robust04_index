			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 5 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Today,  some media organizations received a notice from the Information  Office of the mainland government, passed on by the personnel of  the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch, which politely refused  to grant some Hong Kong reporters who had "boycotted"  news-gathering invitations permission to cover stories in  Zhejiang this time. However, the notice also stated that the  media organizations may send different reporters. Our reporter  interviewed on this matter a staff member of the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch in charge of transmitting news-gathering  applications to higher authorities.    The person interviewed said: In the past, local reporters  accepted invitations or sponsorships from mainland officials for  gathering news in China on a voluntary basis and it was  perfectly all right for them to decline the invitations. But  this time, the problem is not just rejecting invitations, but  also that they publicly "boycotted" the invitations and sent a  signed statement to several departments of the Chinese  Government. Under such circumstances, it would be very hard for  the mainland authorities to give the green light to those who  took part in the "boycott" to gather news wherever they want as  if nothing had happened.    Xi Yang was convicted according to law by the mainland  judicial authorities for violation of the criminal law, which  had absolutely nothing to do with normal news gathering in the  mainland. It is inappropriate for some people to politicize  what was obviously a legal issue, show no respect for facts or  law, and "boycott" all kinds of news gathering in the mainland  that they consider to be of a propaganda nature. The mainland  Information Office made it clear that as you may "boycott" the  invitations extended by some local authorities to gather news  there, the local authorities can also reject your application  for a news-gathering permit for the time being.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Official  sources reported today that Guatemala has agreed to lend its  territory for the repatriation of Taiwan immigrants in response  to a request from the International Migration Organization  [Organizacion Internacional para las Migraciones, OIM].    Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz Vielmann has said that, based  on a request from the United States and Taiwan, the government  agreed to do this "as a demonstration of cooperation with the  OIM," but cautioned that "this decision must not be understood  as setting a precedent." Vielmann told the media: "The  cooperation being extended now does not constitute a  manifestation of a policy in this regard."    Guatemala will permit the ship Jinn Yinn I to dock at a  Guatemalan port. The passengers, who have been traveling in  very crowded conditions, comprise 102 Chinese [as received] who  were intercepted without legal documents in waters off  California by U.S. Coast Guard units.    According to Vielmann, President Ramiro De Leon ordered the  Foreign Relations, Government, and Defense Ministries to form a  commission to coordinate details for the debarkation and  "immediate deportation" of the travelers.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMPHITHEATER ANTI-NOISE FACTION HAILS COURT RULING  </P> <P> Both sides in the dispute over noise levels at Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa  Mesa disagree about the impact of a U.S. Supreme Court decision this week that  allows New York City to have its own sound engineer at outdoor rock concerts to  keep the volume down.  </P> <P> The court ruled 6-3 that the city could insist on having one of its technicians  at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in Central Park in order to make certain  that the park's nearby, 13-acre Sheep Meadow remains a "quiet zone," as decreed  by Mayor Ed Koch in 1985. The decision overturned a federal appeals court  decision.  </P> <P> A long-running legal battle pitting the group Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa  against Ned West Inc. -- the firm which operates the Pacific -- over noise  generated by rock concerts, has involved the state the county and the city, and  is now in Orange County Superior Court. The state became embroiled in the  dispute because it owns the land. Another hearing on the dispute is scheduled  July 14.  </P> <P> "I think the court's decision will be of considerable assistance to our  attorney in pleading our cause," said Russ Millar, a founder of Concerned  Citizens. "It seems evident on the face of it that this decision will be a  guideline for the court here."  </P> <P> Neil Papiano, an attorney with the Nederlander Organization, the parent of Ned  West, said he is familiar with the New York case, but insisted that "there are  a lot of reasons (the ruling) doesn't have any application" to the Pacific  Amphitheatre litigation.  </P> <P> "We have never contested the right of a governmental authority to establish a  standard for sound," Papiano said. "We are within the regulations that have  been made."  </P> <P> Millar said he believes the decision would "be helpful in our attempt to  acquire justice for the homeowners. The community is against the outrageous  noise that comes from the amphitheater."  </P> <P> Papiano, referring to Millar, said that at this point "one person is making  most of the noise."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the amphitheater used a rented, digital sound system  designed to beam the sound in a way that would keep it inside the auditorium  area. The results of the new system are still being assessed.  </P></p>

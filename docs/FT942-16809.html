			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Value of regulation regime attacked Audit regulation in the UK is unlikely to prevent scandals and it benefits neither large companies nor their auditors, two academics said yesterday. The system of audit regulation set up since 1989 has raised audit standards in small firms of accountants but has had no effect on the quality of audits of larger firms, the academics said. The findings came in a paper presented at the European Accounting Association conference in Venice by Ms Stella Fearnley of the University of Southampton and Mr Michael Page of the University of Portsmouth. They said audit failures leading to corporate collapses arose from judgments that the regulatory regime was not designed to address. Small companies were paying a high price for regulation, some of which was passed on to their clients. But the clients did not benefit. The main beneficiaries of audit regulation were banks, the Inland Revenue and creditors, which did not have to pay. In a separate paper, three British academics argued that submissions on the reform of auditing in the UK reflected the self-interest of the accountancy bodies.</p>

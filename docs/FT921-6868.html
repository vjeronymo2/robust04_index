			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Indonesia bans Portuguese ship Indonesia yesterday banned from its waters a Portuguese ship planning to sail to East Timor to mark an army massacre of civilians, accusing its sponsors of being troublemakers, Reuter reports from Timor. The foreign ministry said the planned visit by the Lusitania Expresso, which left Lisbon last month, was politically motivated to aggravate tension in East Timor and incite disturbances. The vessel is due to call at Darwin in north Australia to pick up 100 students and journalists before sailing to the East Timor capital Dili where it is expected around March 3. Those travelling on the ship intend to lay a wreath at the cemetery where Indonesian troops killed scores of mourners last November. Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1976 in a move which remains unrecognised by the United Nations.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> QUAKER OATS CO. TO REORGANIZE; HUNDREDS OF LAYOFFS EXPECTED  </P> <P> Quaker Oats Co., whose earnings have been dragged down by its soon-to-be-shed  Fisher-Price toy unit, said today that it will reorganize its businesses and  lay off several hundred workers over the next year.  </P> <P> The food processing company, whose brands include Quaker Oats, Life and Cap'n  Crunch cereals, Aunt Jemima, Celeste frozen pizza, Gatorade, Rice-A-Roni, Ken-L  Rations and Gaines-Burgers, also said it expects to report flat to slightly  lower profits for its fiscal year ending June 30.  </P> <P> For fiscal 1989, the Chicago-based company reported earnings of $2.88 a share  and sales of $4.9 billion.  </P> <P> The 1989 results exclude results from Quaker's Fisher-Price operation, which is  now reported as a discontinued business since the company previously said it  would spin off the toy division to Quaker shareholders.  </P> <P> Quaker's efforts to shed its non-food operations follow an industry trend to  move "back to the basics."  </P></p>

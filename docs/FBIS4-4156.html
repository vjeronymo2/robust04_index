			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States has refused to grant political  asylum to the prominent dissident Wang Jiaqi, forcing the  British government to bundle him off to London, according to  sources in the U.S. in direct contact with the case.    After escaping from public security detention in Tangshan in  March, Wang secretly travelled to Hong Kong earlier this month.  He is believed to have sought political asylum in the U.S.    But eager to avoid becoming the exclusive destination for  mainland dissidents, Washington has apparently rejected the  request.    News of Wang's arrival in the territory broke last Saturday  while the Hong Kong-funded underground railway that helped him  escape was still seeking third countries to accept the former  Beijing University student.    This prompted the Hong Kong British government to order him  to leave the territory in order to avoid political embarrassment  with China at a sensitive time in Sino-British relations.    It remained unclear last night whether Wang had already  arrived in Britain, but London is "his final destination", one  source said. British Foreign Office officials said last night  they had no information about the case.    The source said that if the U.S. government had been willing  to grant Wang political asylum, it would have been announced  shortly after his arrival in Hong Kong, reportedly on April 15.    "The U.S. has been trying hard to get other countries to  admit political refugees from China and this is another case,"  the source said. They want to spread it around."    Earlier this year, the U.S. rejected requests for political  asylum from four mainland refugees in Taiwan who were eventually  resettled in Sweden.    There has been no public statement from Wang or the  organisations assisting him because "the case is still in  process", the source said, adding: "He won't remain silent for  long. He has things to say."    While the U.S. would have been Wang's preferred destination,  he will have to wait for "some time" before he can travel to the  U.S. on a visa.    "Only then could he re-apply for U.S. political asylum," the  source said.    Wang, a postgraduate law student at Beijing University and  former public security officer, escaped from police detention in  Tangshan, Hebei province, on March 27. He is believed to have  arrived in Hong Kong on April 15 and been sheltered in a remote  part of the territory while negotiations commenced to find a  third country to accept him.    Wang and a Beijing University law professor, Yuan Hongbing,  were detained in Beijing on March 2, apparently for being  leading figures behind a petition in support of workers' rights.    China's national Public Security Ministry said the two were  being held on suspicion of "being involved in unlawful acts  inciting turmoil and disrupting social order" as well as other  unspecified "criminal acts".    The use of Hong Kong as a sanctuary and transit point for  mainland dissidents could cause Sino-British relations to  deteriorate further.    This is not the first time that the territory's underground  railway for mainland dissidents -- which became known as  "Operation Yellow Bird" after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in  June 1989 -- has been derailed by a U.S. refusal to proffer  political asylum to refugees who managed to reach Hong Kong. A  group of political refugees from Hunan province living in Hong  Kong with government knowledge were packed off to London after  being discovered in 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Main services of the Russian  State Duma (lower house of parliament) have almost completed the  removal to a new building in the Okhotny Ryad. The State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin and his deputies began their working day in  the new place today.    The shifting of deputies to the State Duma new building was  preceded by its sanctifying by Archbishop Istrinski Arseniy with  a group of clergymen, in accordance with a Russian Orthodox  Church ritual. Meeting halls of the houses and premises which  were already open by that time were also sanctified.    "We had decided that representatives of the patriarchate and  his holiness himself will be permanent guests of the State  Duma," house deputy chairman Valentin kovalev told ITAR-TASS.  "During talks with Archbishop Arseniy, we spoke about a whole  gamut of questions, which are impossible to resolve only on the  level of knowledge, they need to be resolved at, what we call,  the level of soul and heart," the duma official noted.    Kovalev emphasised that the Russian Orthodox Church has  expressed readiness to render all kind of assistance to the  State Duma. "Archbishop Arseniy reminded us that during complex  periods of the Russian history, such as today, fathers of the  Russian orthodox Church gave advices to statesman, and at  present it will also not be superflous," Valentin Kovalev said.    According to Kovalev, the State Duma's shifting to the new  place will be over within this week, as planned. The house  deputy chairman noted that many premises are in need of repairs.    "We felt this after shifting here," Kovalev noted. "The  system of communications is in a bad state. This worries the  State Duma leadership more than anything else. There are  problems with electric wiring, water pipelines and even the  sewage system. Valentin Kovalev said that these question will be  discussed at a meeting to be held next Thursday with the  participation of the Moscow City Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.</p>

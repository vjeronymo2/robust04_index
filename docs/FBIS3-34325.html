			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb 6, IRNA -- The leader of the Islamic  revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, on Sunday [6 February]  warned against plots of satanic powers to physically eliminate  those Iranian ulema who are efficient and helpful for the  country, Islam and Muslims.    The supreme leader cited the February 2 aborted attempt on  the life of President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani during a speech  at the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, the late  Imam Khomeyni as the latest example of such plots.    "They attempted to strip Muslim ummah of one of the  prominent, efficient and devotee personalities of the Islamic  Republic, our beloved president...but thanks God this time they  were frustrated as in many of their previous plots and  treasons," the leader said.    Ayatollah Khamene'i made the remarks in his speech to a  large  group of ulema, Friday prayer leaders and professors and  students of theological schools.    The supreme leader termed the Islamic revolution as a great  storm which thwarted treacherous conspiracies and ambitious  plans of the U.S. and its lackeys in Iran, helped spread Islam  and attracted other nations to spirituality. "This paid the way  for the collapse of the eastern empire and of Marxist rule in  the world," he said.    Ayatollah Khamene'i also lauded the founder of the Islamic  Republic, the late Imam Khomeyni, for laying the foundation of  an Islamic system of government in a world estranged from  spiritual values.    "But the reality is that there are many people who have  neither realized nor felt the greatness of these two phenomena  -- imam and the revolution. We should try to make this great  truth tangible in the life of Muslims both in Iran and  throughout the world," he said.    Elsewhere in his speech, the leader pointed out that piety,  faith and knowledge is the key to all problems.    Ayatollah Khamene'i cautioned that hypocritical and  blasphemous powers of the world, now fearful of the vigilance of  Muslims, have closed their ranks to get rid of the increasing  influence of Islam.    "What is now happening in the four corners of the world such  as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Palestine, Lebanon, Algeria and Kashmir  betrays the deep enmity of the oppressors with Islam and the  Islamic Republic," the leader concluded.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cadmium market at 20-year lows CADMIUM PRICES have fallen to the lowest levels for more than 20 years in the face of high stocks, environmental concerns and falling demand. The bid price has fallen below 50 cents a lb. Some traders believe it could fall to about 30 cents and remain there for several years. In the late 1980s prices reached Dollars 9 a lb. 'It's a metal that simply ran out of steam,' said one trader yesterday. 'All the news is bearish.' Cadmium - a by-product of zinc mining - is highly poisonous and has been the target of environmentalists. Rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries for gadgets like video cameras and portable telephones have made up the bulk of consumption. But improving technology has reduced the amount of cadmium needed in each battery, and new types of battery using no cadmium are on the horizon. At the same time consumption in paint pigments and PVC stabilisers is also falling. One trader said yesterday that there was now only one major user for the metal in the UK - two other big plants had been closed recently because of environmental concerns. Producer stocks of cadmium are already high, with some estimates putting them at as much as 5,000 tonnes, compared with world consumption at betweeen 16,000 and 17,000 tonnes a year.</p>

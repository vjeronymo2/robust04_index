			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> I have a question for the Los Angeles School Board and the Los Angeles teachers  union: What is the priority in the school system? I used to think our kids were  No. 1 . . . that their futures were of overall importance to everyone involved.  That's not the picture I'm getting.  </P> <P> My son is a fifth grader at Melvin Avenue School in Reseda. I am deeply  disturbed by the fact that he might not get a graduation ceremony due to the  strike, and that the grades he earned this year will mean nothing next year  when it comes to placing him in junior high school because the administration  will never see them.  </P> <P> And what about the schooling time lost due to the strike itself? I don't think  it is a matter of which side is right or wrong in this standoff between the  board and the union. I care much too deeply about the education of my son to  stand idly by and let him be hurt by someone else's argument. The teachers  deserve better treatment than they have received; they're doing an  extraordinarily important job. But their tactics only hurt the kids. It is time  to end this bureaucratic tug-of-war and get on with the much more important job  of educating our children!  </P> <P> JESSICA SCHULZ  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

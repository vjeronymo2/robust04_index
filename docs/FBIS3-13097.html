			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Text] The resolution about to be endorsed by the UN  Security Council is one the PLO has been anticipating. The  issue of Jerusalem -- namely, the clause which applies the  Geneva Convention to the territories, including Jerusalem -- is  the most crucial article of that resolution. Israel objects to  the clause, but it is expected to be endorsed nevertheless,  since the United States will probably abstain on this clause,  rather than veto it.    The resolution denouncing the Hebron massacre, which the  Security Council will debate tonight, will pave the way for  renewing the negotiations. Political sources in Jerusalem have  said that the clause incorporating Jerusalem in the territories  is an achievement for the Palestinians, and within a few days,  it will pave the way to direct contacts toward the resumption of  negotiations. The contacts will address the steps Israel is to  take in the wake of the Hebron massacre to secure the PLO return  to the negotiations.    For Israel, the Jerusalem clause is disagreeable, but it is  neither new nor very significant. It is disagreeable, but not  tragic, Foreign Ministry sources said.    Last night, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held his second  telephone conversation with Yasir 'Arafat in two days. Rabin  told 'Arafat that Israel will not accept all the demands 'Arafat  had conveyed to political adviser Jacques Neriya as a condition  for resuming the negotiations. Rabin urged 'Arafat to return to  the negotiating table. 'Arafat replied: Not yet. It is  believed that after the UN Security Council passes a denouncing  resolution, a senior-level meeting -- probably between Peres and  Mahmud 'Abbas, possibly between Rabin and 'Arafat -- will be  held within a few days, heralding the delegations' return to  intensive talks on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement.</p>

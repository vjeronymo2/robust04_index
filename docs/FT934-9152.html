			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Rome's voting change blocked A controversial proposal to extend full voting rights and special parliamentary representation to Italians living outside Italy has failed to pass through the senate, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The draft law required a two-thirds majority since it involved altering the constitution. But yesterday those in favour of the proposal only mustered 148 votes against the 163 votes necessary. The proposal will now be put on ice for three months, then it will be up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to decide whether to call a national referendum on the issue.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Business Travel: European airlines spar over prices - Travel Update European airlines have launched a series of Christmas promotional discount fares which they describe as a 'skirmish' rather than an all-out fares war, writes Michael Skapinker. The promotions are designed to fill seats when European traffic is at a traditional post-Christmas lull between January and March. Lufthansa was the first to start the Christmas discounts with a reduced fares package for parties of two to four people for travel within Europe. Under the scheme, the first passenger pays the full fare, the second gets a 50 per cent discount, and the third and fourth get discounts of 25 per cent each. They must spend a Saturday night at their destination. British Airways has responded with fare cuts for flights from Frankfurt to London. Air France has a similar package as Lufthansa for its flights out of Germany, while SAS and KLM are also offering lower fares. British airlines, airports and travel agents are still seething over the announcement of a new departure tax in last week's Budget. Air passengers flying to another UK or European Union destination will have to pay Pounds 5. Those flying elsewhere will pay Pounds 10. Transfer and transit passengers will be exempt, as will children under two, and those making return journeys within the UK. The tax comes into effect in October next year. The government says the measure merely brings the UK into line with other countries which charge air passengers to leave their territory. This appears to be the case, according to information gathered by Thomas Cook, the travel agents chain. The US charges passengers departing on international flights Dollars 18 (Pounds 12). Japan charges Y2,000 (Pounds 12.40), Germany DM6 (Pounds 2.30), France FFr15 (Pounds 1.70) and Belgium BFr330 (Pounds 6.10). British Airways flights to Delhi transfer from Gatwick to Heathrow from today. They will operate alongside the airline's established services to Bombay and Madras from Terminal 4. An extra flight to Delhi is also being added, making six a week. Italy and France will study building a 290km high-speed rail link between Lyons and Turin via a tunnel through the Alps. The scheme is expected to take at least 10 years to complete. The link would halve the journey time to 1 1/2 hours. Germany and France are among the leading bidders for a Dollars 10bn project to build China's first high-speed rail link from Beijing to Shanghai, according to official newspapers in the Chinese capital. The 1,300km line is intended to ease congestion. Sabena, the Belgian airline, plans to operate a joint flight with Delta Air Lines between Brussels and New York. Under the plan Delta would book seats on Sabena's daily flight from January 16. Philip Morris, the US cigarette manufacturer, is funding smoking rooms at airports in an attempt to counteract the growth in non-smoking policies. Hartsfield Airport, Atlanta, has banned smoking in all areas. Philip Morris is spending Dollars 250,000 to help build 10 smoking rooms. KLM, the Dutch airline, is cutting fares to 27 European destinations by between Fl 84 (Pounds 29.20) and Fl 838 per return ticket between December 27 and March 27. British nationals planning to travel to Libya should consider whether their visits are necessary. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against Libya in April 1992, including a ban on flights to and from Libya. These sanctions remain in force and were supplemented by further sanctions, including a freeze on Libyan assets and a ban on exports of oil-related equipment, last Wednesday. All British nationals should register with the British Interests Section, Italian Embassy, Tripoli. Tel:  Tripoli 31191.

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MY shares jump on advance to Pounds 2.5m MY HOLDINGS lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 2.51m for the year to August 28, in spite of pressure on some prices. Shares in the USM-quoted packaging company moved ahead 7 1/2 p to 52 1/2 p. 'It was a difficult year and the results were better than I expected,' Mr John Monks, chief executive, said. 'I don't see the outlook as being any better,' he added. A recommended final dividend of 1p lifts the total for the year to 1.25p (1p). Earnings per share fell to 3.91p (3.95p) because new accounting rules forced the restatement of a Pounds 220,000 tax credit in the comparative figures. Sales on continuing operations declined to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 34.3m). Total turnover reached Pounds 35.1m, however, with the acquisition in February of Kohler, the printed folding cartons maker, making up the difference. The Pounds 1.3m purchase from Malbak, the company's South African parent, contributed Pounds 180,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.42m). 'Volume has grown in some areas but price most definitely hasn't. We have seen some price slippage,' said Mr Monks. The cushion packaging business contributed a fifth of sales, against nearer a quarter last year, as buyers struggling with the decline in demand for electrical and household goods in the UK were faced with the same difficulty in mainland Europe. The thermoforming business performed well in the first half but saw less seasonal buoyancy as poor summer weather squashed demand for containers used to pack soft fruit. Capital expenditure was more than Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3m). The group spent Pounds 2m on a second polypropylene extrusion and thermoforming line that produces trays for microwaveable and short shelf-life products. Bank borrowings at the year end were Pounds 283,000 (Pounds 723,000). Gearing fell to 2 per cent (5 per cent).</p>

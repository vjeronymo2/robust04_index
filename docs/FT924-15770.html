			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities brush aside currency factors UK STOCKS held up well yesterday in the face of the acrimonious dispute between the British and German governments over the background to sterling's effective devaluation and also to calls in the UK press for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Excitement was kindled by heavy trade in Trafalgar House, the shipping, hotels and construction conglomerate, as Hongkong Land, one-third controlled by Jardine Matheson, bought a 14.9 per cent stake. Despite the further slide in the pound, the equity market continued to hope for another cut in domestic base rates, taking its cue from rumours in the foreign exchange markets that the Bundesbank might, after all, reduce German rates today. Equities made an uncertain start as investors awaited the outcome of a meeting of UK government ministers after publication in London's morning newspapers of a statement by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had sparked a bitter response from the Bank of England. However, the UK chancellor left the meeting rejecting suggestions of resignation and the stock market began to advance behind continued firmness in stock index futures and the drama surrounding Trafalgar House. The advance received a further spur in the second half of the session when hints of an impending cut in German interest rates circulated both in Europe and in the US. At best the Footsie showed a gain of 33.1 points but the market then boiled over. By the close, the gain on the FT-SE Index had been cut to 19.3 for a final reading of 2,572.3. Confirmation that it was Hongkong Land chasing stock in Trafalgar House and that it would tender for a further 15 per cent stake, came only late in the day and there was some disappointment that there will be no full bid for at least a year. Suggestions of an impending bid for a Footsie stock have been circulating for some weeks. Turnover of 168m shares in Trafalgar House made up about one fifth of the day's total Seaq turnover in equities of 823m. There was also a heavy overnight programme from a leading US house and a second programme crossed the trading screens towards the close of business. Demand for oil shares, in particular for Shell, was a late feature. Wednesday's retail, or customer, business remained high, with the Pounds 1.5bn value figure maintaining the impetus of the past fortnight. County NatWest, the London investment bank, commented that share placings from companies and institutional shareholders have also been at a high level; this could suggest that investors are unconvinced as to the permanence of the rally in share prices which has greeted Britain's exit from the ERM network. Sterling's weakness impacted on the stock market in terms of improving the attractions of share prices for overseas investors rather than by undermining hopes for lower interest rates. Nor was confidence notably harmed by the continuing flow of profits downgrades of leading UK companies by brokerage houses.</p>

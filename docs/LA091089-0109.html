			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ROSECRANS CORRIDOR VICE SPURS ANNEXATION PLEA  </P> <P> At the height of the dinner hour, it is eerily still inside the restaurant on  Western Avenue near Rosecrans Avenue.  </P> <P> Each table is meticulously set: Place mats, paper napkins and silverware are  precisely in place. Cardboard placards advertise dinner specials. Menus are at  the ready.  </P> <P> But not a customer is in sight. Until closing, at around 11 p.m., not one  patron walks in for a sit-down dinner, although a few stop by to pick up orders  or phone them in for delivery.  </P> <P> Outside, at the brightly lit bars and motels nearby, the parking lots are full  and the ebb and flow of customers continues until the early morning hours.  </P> <P> The owner of the restaurant, who asked that his name not be used, says  prostitution in the neighborhood is driving his customers away.  </P> <P> "It's not good for business," he said. "Sometimes customers come in, they see  the girls and they leave. They never come back."  </P> <P> Other merchants in the area, especially those whose businesses are open only  during the day, say they have reached a peaceful but uneasy coexistence with  the activities on the street.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, many report that prostitutes sometimes aggressively proposition  customers attempting to enter the small shops along the street, said Gardena  Police Lt. Gary Cherry. The prostitution problem on Western Avenue is centered  around an area known as the Rosecrans Corridor, a jagged, milelong finger of  unincorporated county land that extends along Rosecrans Avenue into the city of  Gardena, from Crenshaw Boulevard to just east of Western.  </P> <P> One merchant, who requested anonymity, said he has survived by building a loyal  clientele that has kept his business afloat for 30 years.  </P> <P> 'We get along in this neighborhood," he said. "(Prostitution) is a part of life  here."  </P> <P> But law enforcement officials hope to curtail it.  </P> <P> The Gardena Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department  separately conducted raids on Western Avenue during a single week in August,  making a combined total of 125 arrests.  </P> <P> In an Aug. 19 sweep by the Sheriff's Department, 59 men were arrested and  charged with soliciting, two women were arrested on prostitution charges, and a  man and woman were charged with interfering with police operations, said Lt.  Dennis Slocumb. The sheriff's sweep was conducted around 146th Street and  Western Avenue, he said.  </P> <P> Five days later, on Aug. 24, Gardena police conducted a sweep at 148th Street  and Western. Sixty-two men were arrested and charged with soliciting  prostitution, said Gardena Sgt. Robert Watts. In a separate sweep on Vermont  Avenue on Aug. 25, Gardena police arrested 21 more men who were charged with  soliciting, he said.  </P> <P> In both the police and sheriff's operations, undercover female officers posing  as prostitutes stood along Western Avenue, where potential customers driving by  pulled over to the curb to solicit sex, law enforcement officials said. The men  were later cited on suspicion of soliciting prostitution, booked and released.  </P> <P> Both stings began during broad daylight, around noon, police and sheriff's  deputies said.  </P> <P> Since then, the number of prostitutes on the street has decreased somewhat,  said merchants whose complaints helped trigger the sweeps.  </P> <P> Still, law enforcement officials and business owners predict that the lull will  be temporary.  </P> <P> "I've seen them take women and drug dealers off the street, but they come right  back," said a longtime merchant who asked to be identified only as Brian. "You  turn into a cynic."  </P> <P> Jerry Kitahama, whose family has owned the Wayside Nursery near Rosecrans  Avenue since 1934, said police efforts have helped to lessen the problem in  recent years, but he is pessimistic that it will be eradicated.  </P> <P> "No matter what they do, they'll never get rid of it," said Kitahama, whose  nursery falls within Gardena city limits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Losing Battle'  </P> <P> Gardena Sgt. Watts concurs. "The problem is, in my opinion, it's a losing  battle," Watts said. "It doesn't have a long-term effect, primarily because  there are a whole lot of customers out there."  </P> <P> Geography also plays a part in Western Avenue's prostitution problem, according  to city officials, police and business owners.  </P> <P> Some business owners in the unincorporated county area complained that they  rarely see sheriff's deputies on patrol. In addition, some said, response to  emergencies might be swifter from the Gardena police, headquartered at the  Gardena Civic Center less than two miles away, than from the Lennox Sheriff's  Station, about four miles away.  </P> <P> Lt. Ron Herbst of the Lennox Sheriff's Station said at least one car patrols  the unincorporated county area west of Gardena, including the Rosecrans  Corridor, in the early morning hours. During the evenings, two or three cars  patrol the area, he said. In addition, there may be unmarked vice or gang-unit  cars in the area.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, unless there's a specific call, it may appear no one's around,"  Herbst said. "But they're definitely there, and they're busy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Annexation Sought  </P> <P> Last October, Gardena city officials submitted an application to the Local  Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to annex the 198-acre parcel.  </P> <P> According to a report prepared last year by city officials, about 1,700 people  live in the area, which is 32.6% residential, 21% industrial, 18.6% commercial,  and the rest a mix of public property and other uses.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth Landau said the city is negotiating over the transfer of  property tax revenues from the county to the city. Those negotiations should be  complete in 60 to 90 days, he said.  </P> <P> Then, the City Council must approve a resolution of the property tax transfer  agreement with the county, according to the city's report. If approved, the  annexation proposal will go before LAFCO for a public hearing. If LAFCO  approves and fewer than 25% of property owners in the unincorporated area  oppose the annexation, the proposal will return to the City Council for another  public hearing. If there is still no public opposition and if the council then  approves it, the annexation would go into effect the following day.  </P> <P> City officials have argued that annexation would give residents better fire and  police protection and increased access to local government because they could  take complaints to nearby Gardena City Hall rather than to the Board of  Supervisors in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Some merchants hope that if the annexation goes through, Gardena police will  step up patrols and prostitution will decrease even further.  </P> <P> "The only thing that would help us is if the Gardena Police Department would  take over this area," one merchant said. "That'd be nice."  </P></p>

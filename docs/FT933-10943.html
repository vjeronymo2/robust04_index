			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The appeal of a narrow view of life: A look at the revival of Britain's canals and their colourful history DEREK AND Elizabeth Bradley walked the tow-path of the River Trent with purpose. Ahead of them stretched nearly half-a-mile of boats, the biggest inland waterways show ever held in Britain; but the Bradleys only had eyes for canal narrow boats. 'I love the peace and sense of history on the canals, and the wild flowers going past so slowly at eye-level,' says Elizabeth. 'My husband is coming up to retirement, so we're here to look for a boat.' So were many other people. According to Stephen Goldsbrough, chairman of the Canal Boat Builders Association, the market is growing at a pace to make the recession-hit marine industry envious. Eight years ago the association had 40 members. Constructing narrow boats was a folk art almost on a par with coracle-building. Now there are 400 members, launching over 1,000 new narrow boats each year. Notions of 'camping-out' quickly vanish once aboard a modern vessel. 'Anything you have at home you can put in a narrow boat,' says Goldsbrough. 'We've just done one with a complete onboard office equipped with computer and fax. Another client plans to spend a year touring the canal system painting in watercolours, so one end of his boat is a studio with big skylights.' Exactly 200 years ago Britain's fledgling canal system was enjoying a similar boom, although disapproving commentators of the time called it a 'mania.' In 1793 there were 62 canals in various stages of construction, one-third of all those ever built. As canal enthusiast Anthony Burton chronicles in his new book, Canal Mania (Arum Press, Pounds 19.95) speculators drove prices up in a dizzy spiral. Newspapers reported that Pounds 140 shares in the Birmingham Navigation company were soon selling for over Pounds 1,000. In 1792 prospective investors in the Grand Junction Canal were invited to gather at an inn in Stony Stratford. The excited crowd was so large that the meeting had to be moved to the parish church. A total subscription of Pounds 250,000 was needed but these eager 'parishioners' subscribed over Pounds 1m. A fortnight later a similar meeting to fund the Leicestershire &amp; Northampton Union overflowed even the town's church, and the meeting was adjourned to a nearby field. London-based investors employed agents who criss-crossed the country on horseback to give them a flying start on each new canal scheme. Parliament, remembering the South Sea Bubble, anxiously debated canal fever. Members wondered whether the English countryside would not soon be more water than land. A motion was tabled proposing that canal construction be stopped at harvest time, since so many farm workers were being lured off the land to work as navvies. The launch-pad of this feverish activity was the traditional grand tour of Europe by a young English aristocrat, the Duke of Bridgwater. For him the highlight of his tour was a visit to the Grand Canal of Languedoc (now known as the Canal du Midi), completed in 1681. Voltaire had described the canal as 'le monument le plus glorieux par son utilite, par son grandeur, et par ses difficultes.' It was 150 miles long and contained all the features later found in the British system: aqueducts, locks and a tunnel. To a mine owner such as Bridgwater, the applications for moving his coal to market were obvious. In 1760 Parliament gave approval for a canal to link the ducal collieries in Worsley with the factories of Manchester, half-a-dozen miles away. A young self-taught engineer, James Brindley, was engaged for its construction, which in turn nearly bankrupted the duke before it became a revenue-producing project. The rest is history. Within 50 years Britain was a spider's web of linked - or parallel, and competing - canals. They flourished briefly as a commercial freight system. But competition from the railways limited demand and motorised road transport killed it. As recently as the 1950s and early 1960s, canals were being filled in and abandoned. Since then numerous groups, aided by the British Waterways Board and enlightened local authorities, have reversed the decay; Britain's 'lost' waterways are being revived. Plans are in hand to restore nearly all the remaining 100 miles of disused canals owned by British Waterways. It will complete a network stretching from Taunton in the south- west to Lancaster in the north. Landscapes, wildlife and industrial archaeology make the canal system a phenomenon almost better-viewed as a linear national park. 'Slightly more than 50 per cent of the UK population lives near a canal,' says Bridget Atherton of British Waterways. 'They're not just for the enthusiast with a boat. Canals are so accessible. You don't need a large sum of money to walk along the towpath and enjoy it.' Stephen Goldsbrough, who took orders for six narrowboats at an average of Pounds 40,000 apiece during the Inland Boat Show, says that with around 23,000 boats on over 2,000 miles of waterway, there is still plenty of potential for growth, in the sense of physical space. Whether the intensity of access at particular spots may need regulating is another question. 'We're all of a sudden opening up a 200-year-old system to numbers of people that it can't really cope with,' he says. 'Tow paths, for example, built to cope with a dozen horses a day, are being worn away in some places. One looks at the Lake District spending money to dissuade mountain bikers from going there and it does cause you to wonder.'</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Caracas considers rescue for bank A financial crisis at the second largest bank in Venezuela seems to be the latest manifestation of years of lax banking supervision that has contributed to past banking failures. Banco Latino, reporting assets equivalent to Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.27bn) at mid-year, was suspended from the national cheque clearing system by the central bank on Thursday. The Caracas-based bank, with branches throughout Venezuela, is expected to re-open - which it did not on Friday - but there was no official word on when. The government, meeting yesterday with representatives of the largest Venezuelan banks, was considering solutions. These included direct government intervention (which could lead to a restructuring or liquidation), a government-backed recovery programme without intervention, sale of the bank or its closure and liquidation. The outcome seen as most likely would be the government and the other big banks providing support so that Banco Latino might recover. The bank's last published figures, in mid-1993, gave no indication of any financial trouble. It had total deposits of Dollars 1.56bn, of which 92 per cent were from the public. In the first half of 1993, the bank had total revenues of Dollars 382.4m and net earnings of Dollars 10.1m. Banco Latino, founded in 1950, owns Banco Latino International in the US and a subsidiary in the Netherlands Antilles. It is the country's leading financial institution in passbook savings and trust fund management. It grew rapidly during the second administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, who took office in 1989 but was ousted last year to face corruption charges. The bank was controlled by Mr Pedro Tinoco, a wealthy businessmen and former finance minister who was a close friend and adviser of Mr Perez. Mr Tinoco, who died last year, was central bank president from 1989-92. The largest stockholders are Mr Tinoco's estate, the Febres Cordero family, and the Cisneros industrial-commercial group which is controlled by two brothers. The bank's board blames its predicament on outside forces, including a rumour campaign, an alleged failure by a government entity to pay a debt of Dollars 75m on time, and a local television station's news of the government decision to act on the bank. (The news was carried by other media.) The bank said that it lost more than Dollars 500m in deposits in recent months due to rumours. Small depositors, however, seem to have been unaware of the bank's problems until it shut down last week. The problems will not be fully explained clearly before an independent analysis of the books. In recent years of high real interest rates, though, the bank aggressively sought deposits from corporate clients and the general public, offering among the highest rates in the market. Last year, Venezuela's economy contracted after three consecutive years of strong growth, thereby increasing bad debts and reducing income from loans and investments. Savings deposits up to the equivalent of Dollars 9,345 are guaranteed by the Venezuelan government, although past banking collapses have entailed long delays before depositors were compensated. After the government had intervened in three banks - Banco Nacional de Descuento (1978), Banco de los Trabajadores (1982) and Banco de Comercio (1985) - some clients and creditors never collected, and those responsible for the banks' failures for the most part went unpunished. Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, central bank president, has worked hard to tighten the regulatory system since she took over in 1992, and a new banking law to correct regulatory and other deficiencies took effect this month. This allows competition from foreign banks, sets strict capital requirements and provides regulators with power. Critics of the Venezuelan banking system, including some bankers, say questionable practices have been common. The newspaper, El Diario de Caracas, outlined a few yesterday. They included connivance between bankers, investors and politicians, sloppy regulation and supervision of banks, (improper) lending to high bank officials, and betting the government will provide financial assistance.</p>

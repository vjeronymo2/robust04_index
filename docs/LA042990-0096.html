			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA  </P> <P> An 11-month-old baby died Friday after falling, apparently headfirst, into a  bucket of water at his home in Vista.  </P> <P> Flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital, Jesus Sandoval was placed on  life-support systems, but he died just before midnight Friday, according to the  San Diego county coroner's office.  </P> <P> The Sandoval infant, who was apparently left unattended for a moment in the  family living room, crawled 20 feet to the water bucket and fell in head-first,  according to a spokesman for the coroner's office.  </P> <P> An autopsy confirmed that drowning was the cause of death, the coroner's  official said.  </P> <P> Hospital spokeswoman Sharon Ross said the baby is the son of Hector and  Clotilde Sandoval of the 200 block of West Los Angeles Drive.  </P> <P> Several San Diego-area children have been taken to the hospital after nearly  drowning since Easter, Ross said. She said three 2-year-old babies remain  hospitalized and two others have been treated and released. A 16-year-old girl,  drowned in the ocean, she said.  </P> <P> "There just seems to be a rash of drowning incidents right now," Ross said.  "People are going outside more, I guess, and they should be more careful so  this kind of thing won't happen."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Roy Stamper said that Deputy Ed Gomez and a Vista Fire  Department crew dispatched to the house about 2:30 p.m. were able to revive the  child temporarily.  </P></p>

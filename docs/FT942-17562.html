			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Life insurance This week Norwich Union became the latest life insurer to concede - under pressure from its regulator - that its sales force is not up to scratch. But while the regulator's more robust attitude should be welcomed, improved training and supervision may not, in themselves, stop life insurance being mis-sold. Whatever their training, commission-based salesmen have a powerful economic incentive to favour certain products. Full disclosure of commissions from next year may change that, since the true costs of buying life insurance will be clearer. Spreading commissions through the life of a product rather than charging up-front would be one way of making the costs easier for customers to swallow. Such level charging would give salesmen an incentive to sell policies which are likely to run their full course. Surrender values should also improve, unless companies introduce exit charges or penalties to weight the risk of early surrender back in their favour. The snag is that the transition to level charging would squeeze life companies and independent financial advisers which rely on up-front commissions to meet working capital requirements. That points to a wider range of commission structures, and perhaps more customer choice about how to pay. Whichever system emerges, though, life insurers must find a way of selling more policies which run to maturity. Otherwise the regulator is sure to ask whether long-term life and pensions products should be sold on commission at all.</p>

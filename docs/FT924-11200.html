			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Skandia Skandia's decision to scale back all its international reinsurance operations rather than accept a firm cash offer may leave the market thoroughly confused. Walking away from a partial flotation of the US business last month was curious enough - although the Dollars 18 a share offered by institutional investors was arguably a little mean. Last week's trade bid, on the other hand - which Skandia rejected - was Dollars 2 a share higher and would have netted Dollars 500m to relieve its debt burden. This is surely a consideration for a company which makes extensive use of commercial paper and recently had its credit rating cut. Perhaps Skandia simply wanted to avoid the embarrassment of booking a loss on the disposal. The broader question is whether a much-reduced Skandia can make sustainable profits in a volatile, commodity business like reinsurance. By specialising in casualty business it may be able to carve a niche. But like Mercantile &amp; General, Prudential's reinsurance subsidiary which was cut down to size this month, lower premium income will leave Skandia more heavily geared to losses on the tail of reinsurance business already written. The withdrawal of capital by the likes of Skandia and Prudential is hardly likely to bring about a hardening of rates. Even giants of the industry such as Munich Re and Swiss Re have less than 10 per cent of the market each: for every krona or pound of capital taken out, there is a D-Mark or Swiss franc waiting to come in. Besides, the market is shrinking as direct insurers opt to self-insure. The big players will, no doubt, use the latest round of hurricane damage as an excuse to push for higher rates. Whether the market or the regulators allow this to happen is less certain.</p>

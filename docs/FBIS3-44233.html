The Allied Forces  in the name of the best interest of the nation, simply withdrew  the candidates to the presidency of the parliament to make way  for the old bureau led by the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition.    [Unidentified reporter] At 2200 at the People's Palace, the  moment was marked by the end of despair and emotion sustained by  the USORAL for 48 hours following a disagreement over the  members of this political group that should be members of the  bureau. After a very tense moment exacerbated by strongly  termed statements and after a four-hour interruption that  enabled the two sides to organize a vote to come to an  agreement, Mr. (Joseph Singawuju) took the floor to withdraw the  candidates of the Allied Forces -- (Ninda Kabika) and Dr.  (Bwasa) -- deciding that there should not be a win-or-lose  attitude. An immense joy erupted in the conference room.  People embraced one another. There was applause to mark the  end of the conflict that almost led the deliberations into an  impasse.    (Ange Luni Bembe), (Kaben Bingo), Nguyi Nduba, and Vangu  Mambwene will from now on -- and until the next legislative  elections -- be the close aides of Monsignor Monsengwo.    On the other hand, the former bureau led by the USORAL,  including Joseph Ileo, Christophe Lutumbula, (Kinkela Vinkanci)  and Valentin Mubaka, will continue to hold office in the new  legislative body. Called to take the floor, the leader of the  bureau, Valentin Mubaka, could not find the words to express his  joy and expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for showing  the necessary political will to put an end to the dual  institutions.    The new bureau will be officially and solemnly presented  today as of 1400 in the presence of the diplomatic corps invited  at the People's Palace to attend the ceremony.</p>

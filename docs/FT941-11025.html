			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / PIA seeks to reassure investors and potential members The draft prospectus in which the proposed Personal Investment Authority sets out its stall is designed to reassure both investors and the firms it intends to regulate. Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, calls the authority a new type of self-regulating organisation, defining itself on the basis of the customer rather than a category of product or advice. Investors are told that they can look to the PIA for assurance that its members will give them suitable advice and will not defraud them. Potential members are told that the authority will take account of the impact of regulation on the market, in terms of the benefit to consumers and the burden on the industry, particularly small businesses. How the PIA will operate: The prospectus defends the decision - which has met considerable opposition in the financial services industry - that the 19-strong board should be made up of nine practitioners, nine public-interest directors, including the chairman and the chief executive. The Financial Services Act, it says, requires a self-regulating organisation to have a 'proper balance' between industry interests and the public interest. The section also sets out the board's relatively streamlined committee structure. The industry will be involved in decision-taking through working groups and task forces, and through staff secondments to the PIA. Each proposal for new rules put to the board must be accompanied by a compliance-costs assessment. Costs and compensation: The PIA estimates its 1994-95 budget at Pounds 29.5m, including Pounds 5.5m in fees to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and Pounds 1m for operating an ombudsman and arbitration scheme. The Pounds 6m set-up costs, incurred since spring 1992, are intended to be written off over five years, adding Pounds 1.2m to first-year costs. But it expects to raise Pounds 1.5m from other sources, taking total revenue needed for the first year to Pounds 29.2m. First-year fees for members will be about 20 per cent higher than their 1994-95 payments to existing regulators, in a flat increase across all classes of member. The ways of calculating regulatory fees may be adjusted after the first two years. The PIA will have a cap of Pounds 100m for its liabilities under the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which recompenses customers who cannot obtain redress from the firms which advised them because they have gone into default. Maximum exposure for independent practitioners in any one year will be Pounds 9.5m. Joining: In looking at applications the authority will consider a range of factors, including proof that the firm has appropriate professional indemnity insurance cover and whether it is 'organised and motivated' to comply with the rules. The authority will be able to decide for itself whether to accept any firm. It will also be able to give conditional acceptance. Being a member: Members will comply with the training and competence arrangements set by existing regulators. In the longer-term, the PIA may impose higher standards. All members must have a minimum of Pounds 10,000 capital, with higher amounts set for larger firms and those which handle clients' money. Monitoring will be linked to the admissions process. Information acquired then will decide the firm's risk categorisation which will affect, for example, how often it receives inspection visits. In the short-term the PIA will maintain large sections of existing rulebooks, but there will be new rules in 11 areas. Service to investors: A 10 to 15-member consumer panel chaired by one of the public-interest directors will be set up and consulted on investor-protection proposals. It will produce an annual report on the PIA's effectiveness. If a complaint against a firm remains unsettled the customer will have the right to go to an ombudsman, whose bureau will act independently.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Miyazawa pledges more reform after by-election defeat MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday pledged to redouble his efforts to carry out political reform in the wake of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in an important by-election. However Diet members doubt whether Sunday's defeat will actually galvanise Mr Miyazawa and other LDP leaders into action. Instead, argument over possible reforms and over the current spate of corruption scandals is likely to continue to blight proceedings in the Diet. This will slow discussion over other serious issues facing the government - including measures to stimulate the economy, the possible opening of the rice market, and plans to increase Japan's contribution to United Nations peacekeeping forces. Sunday's poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, for a seat in the Diet's lower house was won by Mr Koki Hagino, a university professor backed by opposition parties and by the political arm of Rengo, Japan's trade union federation. Mr Hagino narrowly defeated an LDP candidate in a rural constituency which had once been a ruling party stronghold. According to newspaper opinion polls, voters in Miyagi were concerned about the slowdown in the economy and about hints the government might relax a ban on rice imports. However their anger was mostly directed at Mr Miyazawa's failure to tackle political reform. Commentators saw the verdict as a measure of widespread public discontent with LDP-dominated politics. The Yomiuri newspaper said yesterday: 'The problem is that the LDP has no concrete policies. They have nothing with which to engage people in a political debate.' However, opposition parties also have little credit with voters. The Yomiuri said: 'This is a crisis not only for the LDP but also for the opposition which has lost the ability to solve problems.' The LDP now has little time to recover voters' trust before two more by-elections in the spring followed by a national election for seats in the Diet's upper house in July. The party lost its majority in the upper house in 1989, during the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal. It seems certain to lose more ground this year as voters protest about more recent affairs.</p>

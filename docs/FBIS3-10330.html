			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Swedish companies which had established  operations in Mexico as a means of gaining access to that  market, are now reducing their operations, according to the 2  February Stockholm business weekly VECKANS AFFARER. The weekly  notes that many of these firms had originally invested in Mexico  when its economy was based on import substitution and that they  are now encountering competition from imports from the United  States.    The Swedish-Swiss electronics and engineering giant Asea  Brown Boveri (ABB), which has seen its sales fall 50 percent  over the last two years, has closed two of its five plants and  slashed its Mexican work force by half. Atlas Copco, a mining  equipment manufacturer, has also reduced its Mexican staff and  production and increased its imports from the United States.  While Tetra Pak has expanded its Mexican operations and is  increasing its share of the milk packaging market, it expects  increased competition from imported U.S. milk.    Even Ericsson, which has long been the largest Swedish  investor and a leading telecommunications manufacturer in  Mexico, now has to defend its position against competition from  AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom, and Motorola. It also has cut back  its  work force in an effort to control costs. Ericsson's head of  Mexican operations, Gerhard Skladal, expects the company to  replace many of its Swedish-made components with U.S. inputs and  he hopes that at the same time Ericsson will be able to increase  sales from its Mexican plants to the rest of North America.    The weekly also reports complaints by businessmen that  Mexico  needs to improve its infrastructure and productivity levels,  which at present are not comparable to those of industrialized  countries. Skladal notes: "We figure that we will need to hire  at least 3-4 times more employees to do a certain job here than  would be necessary in the United States." The chief of Atlas  Copco's Mexican branch expects that company to increase its  production in the United States, because "it is hardly logical  for us to invest in Mexico right now." Both ABB and Ericsson  hope that infrastructure improvements in Mexico will open new  markets for their products. Ericsson wants to upgrade the  Mexican telecommunications system to Western standards, and ABB  is optimistic about opportunities in the growing Mexican  automobile industry and in the cement and steel sectors.    The revolt in Chiapas is apparently having little effect on  investment decisions, according to the report. "Those of us who  have been here for a long time and know the country are not  scared off," says ABB's head of Mexican operations, Luiz Bring.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Argentaria prices offering at Pta3,800 ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation which is being partially privatised, yesterday priced its global public offering at Pta3,800 (Dollars 32.75) a share. The pricing, at the upper end of the Pta3,500 to Pta3,950 range announced three weeks ago, reflected a strong demand. More than 450,000 domestic retailers have registered their interest in acquiring Argentaria shares, a number that is in excess of double the number of total shareholders that the bank expected when it said it was putting 25 per cent of its equity on the market. According to FG, the Madrid securities firm, demand for Argentaria paper in the US, where 4m shares are being offered, is about 14m shares. In the UK, demand is for about 15m shares where 3.5m shares are being offered. Morgan Stanley International is acting as co-ordinator in the placement. The US public offering of 8m American depository shares, representing the 4m common shares, is expected to start shortly after the May 5 close of the subscription period for domestic retail investors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "Who Is </F> More Dangerous for Europe? Tomorrow is the Second Round of  Parliamentary Elections on the Peninsula"]    [Text] Republic of Crimea President Yuriy Meshkov has held  a press conference in Simferopol. He announced he had had to  cut short his trip to Cyprus owing to a sharply worsened  situation in Crimea. First and foremost, Meshkov underlined,  was the appointment by Ukraine's president of a representative  to the Republic of Crimea. "One can only regret," Meshkov  underlined, "there is at the helm of the Ukrainian state at the  moment the most dangerous government from the point of view of  continued peace and stability in Europe."    Yuriy Meshkov told the journalists that he had repealed the  Crimean government's decree on raising the prices of bread by a  factor of 2.3. Crimean Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, in his  turn, said to the journalists that "if the president puts spokes  in our wheels, I would be obliged to relinquish the position and  return to Moscow." More so, the vice premier underlined,  because already "part of my team has left Crimea because working  here is not a simple thing."    Mykola Myhalchenko, the Ukraine president's adviser, also  held a press conference in Simferopol. In particular, he said:  "If Meshkov is stating that today's Ukrainian leadership is  dangerous for Europe, I would like him to take a look at  himself. On the contrary, he (Meshkov -- A.P.) is terribly  dangerous not only for Europe but also for the entire world.  His ill-advised actions may result in a situation where Crimea  will become a world hot spot." Myhalchenko said that the Ukraine  president's representative in the Republic of Crimea would  oversee the observance of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine  on the peninsula, in accordance with Ukrainian law.    A meeting in support of the president of the Republic of  Crimea was planned in Simferopol's Lenin Square on 8 April. It  did not take place because of pouring rain. The further  situation on the peninsula largely depends on the result of the  second round of parliamentary elections scheduled for 10 April.</p>

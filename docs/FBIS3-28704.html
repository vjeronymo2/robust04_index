			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Raymond Burgos] </F>   [Excerpts] The Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [RAM],  the rightist military rebel group that mounted several coup  attempts against the previous administration, yesterday threw  its support behind the groundswell of protest against increases  in oil prices, power rates and transport fares. It also gave  tacit approval to the bombings of the offices of three oil  companies by the leftist Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB].    "We believe it is the right of the people to protest in the  loudest possible manner, and RAM will be a participant in the  planned protest actions," Captain Danilo Lim, RAM spokesperson,  said in a televised interview. Church, labor, consumer and even  business groups have also joined the clamor for a rollback in  fuel prices.    Lim described the attacks on the oil company offices as "the  only language which the government understands. Such bombings  are being conducted since only through such acts can the people  capture the attention of the government," he said.    In a separate interview on radio, Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan,  who led several of the coup attempts, urged the government to  heed the public outcry or face worsening violence. At the same  time, however, he appealed for sobriety and for earnest  dialogues. "We need a sober approach. We are on the side of the  protesters because the impact is serious, but let us focus (our  efforts)," he said. "The choices are we either fight each other  again or sit down and talk about how we can help one another."  Another rightwing rebel, Proceso Maligalig, who is involved in  peace talks with the government, said: "We should be  dispassionate about this. We should be rational about it. This  could be the start of a serious problem."    In the provinces:    -- The multisectoral People's Initiative to Denounce and  Reject Oil (Price Increases), or PIDRO, called off a rally  scheduled in Davao City on Sunday, the day Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed visits Davao.    -- Students and non-government organizations plan a big  protest rally today in Baguio. A bigger rally is set for 9  February to coincide with the general strikes planned in Metro  Manila, Davao and Cagayan de Oro cities.    -- A similar mass action is scheduled today in lloilo  City, regional center of Western Visayas.    -- Three radio stations in Cebu City whose commentators  have reportedly been urging people to join a civil disobedience  movement are under fire from the National Telecommunications  Commission [NTC].    The National Bureau of Investigation, meanwhile, released a  sketch of one of four men believed to have lobbed sticks of  dynamite at Petron and Shell buildings in Makati last Tuesday.  On that day, too, a bomb was hurled at the Caltex office in  Manila.    President Ramos reiterated an appeal for sobriety and  solidarity "so as not to jeopardize our efforts for national  recovery. Panic and extremist actions can only result in higher  inflation, fewer jobs, reduced investment, trade and tourism,  and delayed growth," Mr. Ramos said at the opening of the  two-day conference of the Federation of Industrial Security  Organization of the Philippines. [passage omitted]    "It is not the people who should bear the brunt of the  government's excessive spending and blind obedience to the  dictation of powerful forces outside the government," Lim said.  Echoing a common sentiment aired by other protest groups, he  said the Ramos administration could look for other ways to raise  revenues than increase the price of gasoline and other petroleum  products.    In Camp Crame, top police officials and security officers of  government and private installations agreed in a meeting to  adopt "airtight defenses to thwart further sabotage around their  facilities." Police officials said these measures would include  security in and around power, oil, water and communications  facilities. "We are not taking any chances despite the  pronouncement of the ABB to hold off further attacks in Metro  Manila," said Director Pedro Sistoza, deputy chief for  administration of the Philippine National Police.    Present at the meeting were security chiefs of Caltex  Philippines Inc., Pilipinas [Philippines] Shell, Petron, Meralco  [Manila Electric Company], Philippine Long Distance Telephone  Co., Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, National Power  Corp. and the Energy Regulatory Board. [passage omitted]    The National Telecommunications Commission will investigate  radio stations DYLA, DYRB and DYFX in Cebu for their  commentators' advocacy of civil disobedience as a form of  protest. Danilo Sy, NTC regional director, said he would ask  officials of the three stations to explain why their  commentators were allowed to make statements that could cause  public unrest. DYLA is owned by the Associated Labor Union-Trade  Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP). DYRB belongs to  defeated presidential candidate Eduardo Cojuangco, and DYFX has  the Iglesia ni Cristo [Church of Christ] as its major  stockholder.    Rally organizers in Davao City put off their mass action in  response to an appeal from Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to hold their  rally any day except on the day of Mahathir's visit. The  organizers also had a dialogue with Duterte's chief of staff,  Leoncio Evasco. Duterte later promised to provide government  vehicles to transport protesters from the countryside to the  city center. "I would like to extend my gratitude to whoever  were planning to stage a mass action for their understanding,"  he said. Duterte said he would not join a rally set for Monday  by the militant People Against Oil Price Increase because "the  greater interest of the people requires that I support President  Ramos. My duty is to assure that the government remains stable,"  he said.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Homes Assured 'slid into chaos' before collapse DIRECTORS of Homes Assured, the mortgage brokers, allowed the company to trade fraudulently for nine months before it collapsed with debts of Pounds 9m in 1989, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. From the outset, Homes Assured, which was set up to arrange mortgages for council tenants buying their own homes, was never adequately capitalised and its finances soon slid into chaos, said Mr Michael Kalisher QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office. By November 1988, Homes Assured was hopelessly insolvent and should have stopped trading, he said. The company avoided one attempt by creditors to put it into liquidation by showing a court bogus accounts. It also took out short-term loans and stopped paying staff wages and other bills in an attempt to survive. However, such attempts only delayed the inevitable and the company was forced into liquidation in August 1989, Mr Kalisher told the court. He was opening the prosecution of Mr Anthony Dobson, a former Homes Assured director, Mr Michael Robinson, the company's managing director and Mr Keith Woodward, another director. Mr Dobson faces three counts of fraudulent trading, Mr Robinson two similar charges and Mr Woodward one of fraudulent trading and one of furnishing false information. All deny the charges. After the company was set up in late 1987, it was supported with Pounds 250,000 in capital from the Bank of Boston, Mr Kalisher said. To attract this investment, Mr Dobson lied by withholding the information that he had averted personal bankruptcy by reaching a voluntary agreement with creditors to repay debts of Pounds 600,000. The bank would not have made this investment had it known of his personal circumstances. Homes Assured initially appeared solvent, but the absence of genuine profits was concealed by the large advance payments it received in commissions from life assurance policies sold. However, its troubles mounted when commissions on cancelled policies had to be returned, overheads rose unchecked and its tied agency status with the Legal &amp; General was lost. 'Each of the defendants knew when they continued to trade after November that there was no real prospect of Homes Assured paying these debts. They continued to trade despite that and intentionally defrauded the creditors of Homes Assured or its subsidiaries,' said Mr Kalisher. Sir Edward du Cann, the former Tory MP and chairman of the Conservative party, was a vice-chairman and director of the company and played an active role in raising finance, Mr Kalisher said. However, he would not be called to give evidence. The trial, which is expected to last about four months, continues today.</p>

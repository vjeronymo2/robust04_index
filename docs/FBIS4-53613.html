			<p>BFN     [Text] On the evening of 19 May, a senior Foreign Ministry  official spoke with regard to the question of Japan becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC], and, while  noting it was his personal view, said: "Japan should have veto  power if it wants to have its stand accepted [in the United  Nations]."    This is the first time that a senior government official  spoke in favor of having veto power equal to that of the five  existing member countries--the United States, Russia, China, the  UK, and France. Germany has also expressed hope that it would  become a permanent UNSC member with veto power.    But the senior official added he would not be too insistent  on having veto rights.</p>

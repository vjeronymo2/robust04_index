			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Berkenbaum: "The First Information </F> Highway"]    [Excerpts] The "information highways" so dear to the  president of the European Commission did not wait for the  publication of his white paper -- adopted last Saturday [18  December] at the Brussels summit -- to become a reality.  Yesterday, still in Brussels, Jacques Delors was to have  inaugurated the first truly trans-European telecommunications  network: Euro-ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network).  Prevented at the last minute from attending the ceremony, the  Commission president charged the director general of DGXIII (EC  Commission directorate general responsible for  telecommunications) to represent him and to welcome the event on  his behalf: "We are moving from the industrial era to the age  of information."    [passage omitted] ISDN has remained relatively confidential  until now for two reasons. The first reason was the national  and incompatible nature of the early networks, leading to a lack  of crossborder services. The second reason, an immediate  consequence of this, was the scant enthusiasm shown by terminal  manufacturers and service suppliers to invest in a market that  was certainly promising but which was too limited because of the  adaptations needed for each country.    It was to remedy this problem that, in 1986, the EC launched  the idea of a jointly operated and standardized ISDN. Three  years later, in 1989, 26 European telecommunications operators  (including Belgacom) undertook to provide a basic set of  pan-European services by the end of 1993. They rose to the  challenge, and Euro-ISDN was born. The network already connects  17 countries. Including the vast investments needed to develop  the applications, the global cost is estimated to have already  reached ECU50 billion or 2,000 billion Belgian francs.    [passage omitted] Some people, however, are wondering if  Euro-ISDN is not arriving just a little late. It is merely  foreshadowing the future network known as broadband ISDN, which  is expected to be introduced on a large scale as of 1995. This  network, also backed by the European Commission, will offer much  greater data transmission capacities and a better integration of  services. Bringing high-resolution color faxes, high-definition  interactive television, the transfer of medical images, etc., it  will pull Europe headlong into the era of multimedia  communications. Pilot projects already exist, developed by the  major manufacturers with the backing of various European  programs.    The ambition stated in Brussels last weekend is to free up  the resources needed to put these services within everyone's  reach by building trans-European networks. In its white paper,  the Commission reckons that the development of  telecommunications in Europe will cost some ECU150 billion over  the next five years. To be sure, such expenditure will not be  in vain -- by the year 2000, telecommunications should represent  6 percent of GNP of the Twelve and boost growth by 6 percent  over the next 10 to 15 years. Its depths have yet to be plumbed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Armenian Government delegation headed by Armenian  Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan paid a two-day official  visit to Krasnodarskiy Kray. The aim of the visit was to  regulate the trade and economic ties between Armenia and  Krasnodarskiy Kray, and solve the problem of air freight flights  that were canceled two months ago following the crash of a plane  flying from Krasnodar to Gyumri.    The delegation held a number of official and business talks  with the leadership of the kray and with the representatives of  various departments and organizations.    Three agreements were signed on the principles of trade and  economic cooperation for 1994, on cultural, educational and  scientific cooperation, and on [words indistinct] freight  transportation by air.    The Armenian delegation also met with representatives of the  Armenian community in the kray at the Center of National Culture  in Krasnodar.    The Armenian Government delegation returned to Armenia  today.</p>

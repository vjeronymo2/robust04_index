			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: INSURANCE FIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED  </P> <P> For a long time, rental car companies covered the cost of collision damage to  many of their cars with money taken in on "collision damage waivers." Though  many companies were self-insured for collision and the CDW for some years  covered only a portion of car value, it was probably adequate. Indeed, there  has always been some question of whether they covered such costs too well.  </P> <P> There have been questions as well about whether rental companies misrepresented  CDW coverage, selling it as "insurance" while insisting it wasn't to escape  regulation, and whether they strong-armed customers into buying it when it may  have duplicated coverage on their own auto policies. There were questions about  advertising rates that didn't include or disclose fat CDW surcharges. There  were even questions about repair costs -- most notably Hertz's -- that were  billed to customers or their insurers and were found to be inflated.  </P> <P> Fortunately, given all the questions, competition jumped in: Other businesses  are now offering to cover those costs. But rental companies, far from being  relieved, aren't happy. "Just try to get the money," they say, although they  probably mean that they liked getting it themselves.  </P> <P> Many auto insurance policies now have collision coverage that's transferable to  rented cars. Not everyone takes collision coverage, of course. But at State  Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, more than 77% do now: "More and more  people are financing cars," says State Farm spokesman Bob Sasser in  Bloomington, Ill., "and the lien-holder requires it."  </P> <P> Credit card companies have also discovered collision damage, offering rental  car coverage as an "enhancement" -- one of an increasing roster of added  services to give their card an edge in today's competition. All American  Express cards include the service and premium MasterCards and Visas -- not just  to compete with other cards but with other payment options. "In spite of the  growth of plastic," says Keith Kendrick, MasterCard's senior vice president of  marketing, "less than 10% of all discretionary consumer income spending goes on  bank cards rather than cash or checks."  </P> <P> All credit cards together handle only 13% of consumer spending, according to  the Santa Monica-based Nilson Report, which covers the industry. Obviously,  offering convenience, credit and accounting records isn't enough, so they're  offering care. MasterCard's first question to card-holders reporting rental car  accidents is "Are you all right?," says Kendrick. If not, the company will "get  involved in the process" of calling an ambulance or police or getting medical  help.  </P> <P> Sensitive to criticism of their own collision damage coverage, car rental  agencies hasten to say that the coverage provided by credit card companies is  no great deal, either. Application of the coverage is usually limited. It  excludes exotic, antique and off-road vehicles, for instance, as well as  long-term rentals (a 21-day limit for State Farm, 30 days for American Express,  60 days for MasterCard).  </P> <P> The effect of making a claim on one's auto insurance is the same as with one's  own car: The premium goes up. Thus, a car rental agency can position its CDW,  says Glenn Kurtz, an Enterprise Rent-A-Car agent in Beverly Hills, as "a  service we offer to help them stay away from their insurance companies."  </P> <P> What's more, a rental-company CDW lets customers just "walk away" from any  collision damage, they say, while outside coverage involves a lot of paper  work. Indeed, one must file claims. But given a copy of the rental company's  bill for damage, a big insurer such as State Farm will deal with the company  directly. Credit card companies send out claim forms to be returned with many  documents attached -- copies of the rental contract, repair bill, accident  report, auto insurance policy, notice of amount paid by insurance.  </P> <P> This is secondary coverage, of course, paying what's left after any applicable  auto insurance, or other responsible party, has paid off. They're also  generally reimbursement plans, which means the customer may have to lay out  money ahead -- for any deductible carried on his policy or for the whole amount  if there's no policy -- sometimes before leaving the agency.  </P> <P> Outside payers may also be stiff with rental companies, they say. Credit card  companies may be very slow to pay and it takes one small independent rental  agency in Hollywood "about four months" to get money from insurance companies.  Indeed, insurers may be slower than usual and demand more information "to be  sure we're not being ripped off," says Sasser at State Farm. The insurer has  less control than with private cars, which come in for inspection, often with  estimates; here, the rental company has the car and may already be fixing it.  </P> <P> Such outside coverages don't guarantee rental companies satisfaction. Some  agencies say most of their customers have no auto insurance, often because they  don't own cars or are foreigners. They're also transient: This is a business  serving "a lot of leisure travelers they never see again," says Jan Armstrong,  director of the Washington-based American Car Rental Assn.  </P> <P> Even when customers have outside coverage -- through insurance or a credit card  -- it's "difficult (for rental agencies) to collect," says Armstrong. "Nobody  ever hears from the customer again. They can go after the companies, but there  may be no response."  </P> <P> In their view, the only workable solution to such high risks is the CDW, which  gives them revenue up front instead of a promise of later payment. But it's  revenue, not money pooled to cover all damages or even to buy insurance. And  pretending it was "insurance" just opened the door to the current complex  competition.  </P> <P> The whole squabble was avoidable. Rental car companies, like other businesses,  should have bought insurance for their fleet and factored the cost of it into  their rates. Auto insurers needn't have made their collision coverage  transferable (building the cost into their rates), nor would credit card  companies have offered the coverage (building the cost into their rates).  Something relatively simple could have stayed simple, even straightforward,  with car rental companies advertising honest daily rates that include insurance  for everyone.  </P> <P> Maybe it's not too late.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Tawse reduces deficit to Pounds 2.03m Brown &amp; Tawse Group, the steel and pipes distributor, yesterday reported reduced interim pre-tax losses, but blamed 'extremely difficult' market conditions for a further decline in turnover. The group announced a Pounds 2.03m pre-tax loss for the six months to October 3, down from Pounds 2.76m. However, Mr Don McFarlane, who took over as chairman earlier this year as part of a management shake-up and restructuring plan, said market conditions 'had, if anything, deteriorated further' during the period. Turnover fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 53.5m (Pounds 63.2m), including Pounds 2.29m from discontinued operations. Excluding Jay Fasteners, which was sold in July having contributed Pounds 120,000 to the first-half results, the group reported increased operating losses from continuing operations of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.28m). Net interest costs fell to Pounds 813,000 (Pounds 1.09m). Losses per share dropped to 2.7p (8.5p). The shares closed 4p lower at 36p.</p>

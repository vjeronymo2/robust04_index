			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minsk, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Belarus will speed up  its reforms for a market economy this year despite current  economic woes caused by hikes of prices for imported raw  materials from former Soviet republics.    In an interview with XINHUA Tuesday [11 January], vice  chairman of Belarus' Council of Ministers Sergey Stepanovich  Ling said that the country's ongoing economic reforms are  irreversible.    Moreover, he emphasized, Belarus has laid a "primary  legislative foundation" to guarantee the continuation of its  reforms.    Twenty bills related to reforms in the economic structure  and  the ownership system, including laws on privatization and land  ownership, were adopted last year.    In 1994, the government will take a series of measures,  including the issuance of privatization bonds three months ahead  of schedule, to push the reforms forward.    But he ruled out the possibility of adopting such radical  reform policies as "shock therapy." The state "will control the  pace of reforms" "to ensure their effective continuation," he  stressed.    The vice chairman pointed out that Belarus will pursue a  "gradual and cautious" reform policy. The former Soviet  republic will study China's excellent experiences in its reform  to avoid making mistakes in its own reform, he added.    Belarus' advanced industrial equipment and technology and  the  good qualifications of its workers will help lead the country  out of the current economic plight, he said.    Belarus, which has to import over 90 percent of the energy  and raw materials it needs, has met with great difficulty since  Russia and other former Soviet republics raised prices for  energy and raw material exports.    Belarus witnessed a monthly inflation rate of up to 30  percent and an unemployment rate of 1.2 percent last year. Many  factories have stopped production.    During the privatization drive, more than 200 state-owned  enterprises have been privatized so far and reforms have begun  in finance, commerce and agriculture.</p>

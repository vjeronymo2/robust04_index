			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Guilbert: "Majority and Opposition in </F> Search of a Strategy"]    [Text] There is symmetry on the surface only. True, the  blow is severe both on the Left and on the Right; the emergence  of a force that claims over 12 percent of votes is not to be  taken lightly. Tapie and De Villiers cannot be ignored, and  their presence is made all the more clangorous by the fuzziness  of the policies they stand for. However, while Tapie is  snapping at the heels of the PS [Socialist Party] leader [Michel  Rocard], being outdistanced by the latter by less than 3  percentage points, De Villiers has only gone half the distance,  as it were, covered by the leader of the RPR-UDF [Rally for the  Republic-French Democratic Union] list. Therefore, the Left is  becoming truly fragmented, while the Right is merely divided.    As for Europe, the stands taken by the newcomers are  completely opposite: Tapie is a staunch defender of federalism,  while de Villiers demands nothing less than the elimination of  the "pernicious" Maastricht Treaty. Should we compare their  moral behavior? While the latter calls for a crusade for  "values," an acknowledged component of his success, the scandals  surrounding the former demonstrate that his electorate is hardly  concerned with integrity: It is as though this was not an issue  at all.    As for the "populist" tag they have often been saddled with,  it does not appear to have been taken seriously: Indeed, it  hardly explains anything. Are they populists, those people who  wanted to vote for the majority but who were intent on  confirming their radical rejection of the Maastricht Treaty  without giving their vote to [National Front leader] Le Pen,  whose list stagnated? Are they populists, those who previously  voted for Mitterrand or those young people who, because they can  no longer identify with the PS, favor either more left-wing  lists or vote for [Mr. Tapie's] "Radical Energy" list in  southern regions which traditionally favored a moderate brand of  Socialism?    Both on the Left and the Right, there is something else  which  counterbalanced the "useful vote" notion which Rocard and Baudis  had been betting on, in an election with no immediate or  tangible political usefulness. A protest vote, no doubt,  stemming from a craving for a new rhetoric, for some intensity  of conviction. As far as the European framework is concerned,  let us listen to Alain Juppe: "The French do not understand the  integration of Europe as it stands," as well as the prime  minister, starkly noting that the public is "preoccupied."  <H5>  Shattered </H5>   What to do? And what will the two troublemakers do? The  disruption is such that presidential election strategies will  have to be revised or at least postponed, be it only to take the  time to comprehend the new phenomena. How simple a situation it  was in which Rocard used to be the obvious candidate of the  Left, while right-wing candidates, certain they would beat him,  only had to take the measure of their attractiveness or  repulsion!    The first effect of Bernard Tapie's victory was to shatter  the obviousness of Rocard's candidacy. "What we need, is a  Mitterrand," Tapie said. This statement had a devastating  effect, intended to open up the game without it going any  further. True, Rocard had favored a strategy based on  alliances, first between the PS' various factions, then beyond  them, in a last-ditch attempt which failed to offer anything new  with respect to society, his party, or even his own presidential  ambitions. His electoral rout gives further confirmation that  we are confronted with an empty shell. The triumph of the  energetic, dynamic, vibrant Bernard Tapie -- all characteristics  not associated with Michel Rocard -- forces the PS leader into  self-criticism: He lacked "boldness" in his style and his  choice of objectives. Back to square one, in other words.    PS leaders have now ended their silence and, without  censuring Rocard, seem to tell him that politics is way too  serious a matter to be left in the hands of a single man, even  if this man is the agreed candidate, or an excessively elitist  team. The way the Socialists are dealing with the concerns of  the French population, be they unemployment or Europe, must be  defined through a general debate. This is the approach favored  by Jospin, for instance. We will witness a return of political  tradition, the choice of the presidential candidate being  deferred for the time being. This is a way of playing for time  while avoiding personality issues as much as possible.    Shall we witness among the Right the same recourse to the  various political groups, the same recognition of their rights,  either to shape a platform, to choose the presidential  candidate, or to engage in a process of planning strategy?  True, the political parties hardly had a say in the European  campaign, their views being made subordinate, not to say being  abandoned, for the sake of unity.    This principle of unity, freely scorned by the talented and  dissident De Villiers list, did not bring the expected results.  What exactly does de Villiers mean, aside from the fact that he  occupies [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua's spot on the  political spectrum or that he operates in the margins of [RPR  leader] Jacques Chirac's domain, and that, like them, he does  not offer a broad alternative European platform such as that  recommended by [Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin, for instance?  However, his is a force that categorically rejects the  government's European policy while being part of the majority,  and which demands to be heard without saying (nor knowing?) what  its stipulations will be.  <H5>  Playing for Time </H5>   Does Edouard Balladur's axiom -- "United we stand, divided  we  fall" -- retain all of the formal relevance it had before the  election? Already, RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe,  condemning Pasqua for supporting de Villiers, is wondering aloud  whether it would not have been preferable to "compete with one  candidate for each political family," since the single list  strategy, including in a presidential election, "favors  dissenting voices." This is exactly the opinion of Charles  Millon, the president of the UDF caucus in the National  Assembly, when he suggests that the RPR and the UDF should enter  into a "contract" of conduct.    Meanwhile, Chirac, who is in Bayeux today together with  Balladur for a strictly Gaullist commemoration (the arrival of  General de Gaulle on French soil on 14 June 1944), keeps silent.  So does [former president] Giscard d'Estaing. For all of them,  what matters now is playing for time.</p>

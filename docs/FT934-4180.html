			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year Hilary Brown, La Potiniere, Gullane, EH31 2AA, Scotland. Tel: 0620-843214. Although we live on the east coast of Scotland close to some of the finest salmon fishing rivers, poached salmon has never excited me. When we were served salmon fillets fried on the skin side only in a restaurant in the south west of France, it was a revelation. The frying pan must be very, very hot before adding a tablespoon of oil. Then the salmon fillets are fried quickly so that the outside is crisp and the inside remains moist and slightly undercooked (an extractor hood or open window is essential). Allow about five minutes for a skinless fillet and about seven for a piece with the skin on, depending on its thickness. Use tongs to turn a couple of times. The skinless version I serve on a bed of spicy lentils with leeks, garlic and a morille sauce alongside. The crispy blackened skin version I serve with a mound of finely- shredded spinach, oak leaf, lollo rosso and basil, along with a virgin olive oil sauce containing finely-diced red pepper and chopped basil. Top both versions withcoarsely crushed Maldon sea salt.</p>

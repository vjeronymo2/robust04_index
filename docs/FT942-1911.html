			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Banker attacks floating charge A leading banker yesterday called for the abolition of the floating charge, a powerful method banks use to secure loans to corporate borrowers. The zrecommendation was made by Mr Derek Sach, director of specialised lending services at the Royal Bank of Scotland. It comes at a time when insolvency issues are under growing scrutiny and while the Department of Trade and Industry is examining revisions to existing legislation. The floating charge allows banks to take a charge over all of a company's changing assets, such as inventory, as security against loans  - in contrast to the fixed charge, which is secured over specified fixed assets. Small businesses say the floating charge - permitted only in a few countries such as the UK, Australia and Canada - unfairly tilts the balance of power in favour of lender banks and away from the interests of management and unsecured creditors to a company. Mr Sach said removing the floating charge would encourage banks to concentrate more on companies' cashflow and financial position rather than focusing on security. 'It would encourage banks to take better decisions and lead to greater business survival rates for the greater good of mankind,' he said. His view stands in stark contrast to the opinion of the British Bankers' Association and individual banks which have insisted that abolition of the floating charge would reduce their willingness to lend. Mr Sach stressed that he was expressing a personal view and that the Royal Bank would continue to take floating charges. Mr Sach, who joined the Royal Bank to set up a special unit for dealing with companies in distress and who previously worked for 3i, the venture-capital company, is known for his outspoken views.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hotelier loath to check out - The career of Lord Forte, retiring chairman WITH Lord Forte still going strong a month before his 84th birthday, it is no surprise that his retirement as chairman does not end his links with the company which he started as a milk bar some 60 years' ago and turned into Britain's biggest hotel group. During a business career spanning six decades, Lord Forte made his enemies. The merger between Forte and Trust Houses in 1970 turned into an acrimonious affair. The ill-feeling generated by Lord Forte's biting criticism of the Savoy Group during the 1980s has not disappeared. The Forte group's critics say it is too inward-looking and too focused on the UK. Yet only the most jaundiced foe would deny that Lord Forte is Britain's greatest-ever hotelier. He will become president, replacing Lord Thorneycroft, former chairman of the Conservative Party. Unlike Lord Thorneycroft, Lord Forte will be a member of the board. Mr Rocco Forte, his 47-year-old son, who has been chief executive since 1983, will now add the post of chairman. To the disappointment of many in the City, Forte has not brought in an outsider as either executive chairman or chief executive. Although it has appointed two respected non-executive directors in the form of Sir Anthony Tennant, retiring chairman of Guinness, and Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo. Mr Forte says he will continue to consult his father, arguing that it would be foolish not to take advantage of his experience. He said pretty much the same when Lord Forte was chairman, which makes it possible that little will change. Two strong non-executives might make their mark, but family solidarity is a constant theme of the Forte story. In his autobiography, published in 1986, Lord Forte recounts that in the late 1870s, a relative in Italy was kidnapped by a band of brigands. The ransom note, addressed to the family in their mountain village of Monforte, between Rome and Naples, was unambiguous: 'If you don't pay, we cut off your son's ear. The second time we ask, we cut off his nose.' There was no question about what the family should do. They sold everything they possessed to raise the money - their jewellery, sheep and horses. They even mortgaged their land. Many emigrated in the search for work to pay off their debts. When Lord Forte started his milk bar, his sceptical father thought he was taking too much of a risk - and put up Pounds 1,000 in cash. Born in Monforte in 1908, Lord Forte arrived in Scotland with his mother at the age of five, joining his father, Rocco, who had set up a small business consisting of cafes, ice cream and food shops. Lord Forte has described himself as Scottish-Italian, but added that he appreciated Dr Johnson's dictum that the noblest prospect which a Scot ever sees is the high road that leads to England. His own business career, first in family establishments and then in his own milk bar, was rudely interrupted in 1940 when his Italian citizenship led to him being interned for three months on the Isle of Man. Loyal to his adopted Britain and a convinced anti-fascist, internment hurt him deeply. The experience forms the most poignant chapter in his book. On its own, it would have been sufficient to lift it above the bland, self-serving mass of business autobiographies. But, while not short of self-congratulation and many digs at enemies past and present, the account of his life was too quirky not to be enjoyed. Recalling his love for his mother, he mentions her excellent Christmas turkey stuffing - and then reproduces the recipe over three-quarters of a page. Acquiring British citizenship six months after the war ended, the then Mr Forte became caterer to many of the UK's landmark events. He won the catering contract for the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1955, his company was awarded the first catering concession at London's Heathrow Airport. When the M1, Britain's first motorway, opened in 1959, Forte became the first operator of a motorway service area, at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. Forte bought its first hotel, the Waldorf in London, in 1958. The company merged with Trust Houses in 1970 and acquired the American-owned Travelodge International company in 1973. Last year the company dropped the Trusthouse part of its name, reverting to just Forte. The size and prestige of the company are undeniable, as are its excellent relations with investors, who have awarded its shares a consistently high rating. But there is general acceptance that the company needs a bigger international business. Many think it needs to become more entrepreneurial. It would be difficult for anyone to succeed Lord Forte, particularly when he still holds a position in the group, no matter how symbolic. His son says that the difference now is that he, rather than his father, is accountable to the shareholders. But whether he is chairman or president, the founder will be hard to ignore.</p>

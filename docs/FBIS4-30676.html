Upon his  return to Hanoi, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, a member of the  delegation, met with Vietnamese pressmen to inform them about  the results of the visit.    Regarding the visit to Canada from June 15 to 22, Deputy  Foreign Minister Le Mai said that the visit to Canada by  Vietnamese Government delegation has achieved good results. It  has contributed to the consolidation and development of the  political and economic relations between the two countries. He  said that Canada has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and  supported the process of renovation in Vietnam. The two sides  also agreed on mutual interest of the two countries in  contributing to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.  The agreement on development and cooperation between the two  countries signed during the visit was the foundation for further  development of relations between Canada and Vietnam.    During the meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai,  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien highly valued the current  process of renovation in Vietnam and appreciated the invitation  to visit Vietnam which would be made very soon.    Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai also laid stress on the great  potential and prospect of economic and trade ties between  Vietnam and Canada. He noted that the political relations  between Vietnam and Canada were fine. However, the economic  cooperation has not yet been equal to potential of the two  nations. For further development, the two sides pledged to  continue negotiations for an early signing of agreements at  governmental level such as the agreements on commercial  cooperation, on investment protection, and the avoidance of  double taxation. At present, the Canadian Government is ready  to exchange with Vietnam its experiences in economic development  and to cooperate with Vietnam in many fields.

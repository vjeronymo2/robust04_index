			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / US purchasing data point to decline in manufacturing THE US manufacturing economy declined in December and overall economic growth was sharply lower, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM), Reuter reports from Tempe, Arizona. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.5 per cent from 50.1 per cent in November. A reading above 50 per cent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding, while one below 50 per cent is a sign it is generally declining. NAPM said the survey was below the key 50 per cent level for the first time since June, when it rose to 50.9 per cent. 'The overall economy's growth in December was the weakest since it emerged from the recession in May 1991,' said Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM survey committee. NAPM said the third consecutive monthly drop in new order growth rates helped push the index lower. 'Three straight months of lower growth rates for new orders ended in a decline in December and pulled all of the other indicators down with it,' Mr Bretz said. The new orders index fell to 49.9 per cent, down from 53.4 per cent in November, and the lowest since 45.9 per cent in April. Mr Bretz added: 'Cautious manufacturers seem ready to wait for an increase in new orders before expanding production, a scenario which suggests a continuation of the economic malaise into the first quarter of 1992.' The PMI index averaged 47.2 per cent for all of 1991. Experience indicates that this rate is consistent with a 1 per cent rise in real domestic growth for all 1991, Mr Bretz said. The PMI index started 1991 with a 37.7 per cent reading in January. In December 1990, the index was 40.5 per cent. In December, employment fell for the 35th consecutive month, NAPM said, as its employment index fell to 39.6 per cent. That was down from 44.4 per cent in November and the lowest since May's reading of 37 per cent. But prices rose in December for the third consecutive month, with NAPM's price index slipping to 50.4 per cent from 51.3 per cent in the previous month.</p>

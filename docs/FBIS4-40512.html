			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. Staroverov: "Russia Stretches Out Helpful </F> Hand to Sevastopol"]    [Text] Upon his return from a trip to Moscow, Sevastopol  City Council Chairman V.M. Semyonov held a press conference. He  said that at present, Ukraine is not capable of providing  subsidies to Sevastopol and that the goal of his trip was to  ensure that the Russian budget finances the part of city's  infrastructure and social sector that is connected with  servicing the Black Sea Fleet (which represents about one-fourth  of all expenditures in this sector). It is expected that 52-53  billion rubles will be earmarked for this purpose.    This amount was announced during the last trip by V.M.  Semyonov to Moscow, last April. At that time, Russian President  Boris Yeltsin jotted "Please take this into consideration when  drafting the budget" on the written appeal.    Aid to Sevastopol should not be a one-shot deal, but  permanent. This is Russia's duty, V.M. Semyonov stressed,  because the Black Sea Fleet is, and will be, Russian with its  base located in Sevastopol.    In Moscow, the mayor of Sevastopol reached an understanding  with Russian Finance Minister Yuriy Dubinin and N. Gonchar, head  of the commission for budget and currency regulation and tax  policies in the Federation Council. Russia's budget  participation and the financing of Sevastopol's needs will be  conducted on the basis of interstate agreements.    In his report, V.M. Semyonov touched upon the mechanism for  funneling funds from the Russian budget to Sevastopol. This  issue was also discussed during his visit to Moscow. He held  meetings with a number of leaders of large industrial companies  and enterprises. In particular, interest in Sevastopol was  expressed by one science and production amalgamation from the  machine-building industry, also known as the major enterprise  manufacturing "Proton" carrier rockets, "Polet" satellites, and  "Salut" and "Almaz" space stations. It proposed to use  high-technology developments in the manufacturing of solar  energy collectors and generators, as well as water purification  equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas and Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Excerpts] The U.S. Government has again announced it is  offering a $100,000 reward for the capture of three Panamanians  -- among them the son of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD)  President Gerardo Gonzalez -- who have been charged with the  murder of U.S. soldier Zak Hernandez. Meanwhile, Gonzalez  claims the reward is part of a "blackmail campaign" being waged  against him.    The State Department has published advertisements in several  Panamanian newspapers offering a reward to anyone who comes  forward with information on the whereabouts of Pedro Miguel  Gonzalez, Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista, who have been  charged with Hernandez's murder and the wounding of another  Southern Command soldier. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Gerardo Gonzalez says the State Department  intends  to use his son as "a scapegoat to attack and blackmail me."    The PRD leader also accused the judicial branch of thwarting  his son's constitutional rights by not allowing him to retain a  lawyer for the trial in the murder case of soldier Zak Hernandez.    According to Gonzalez, Pedro Miguel's only role in the  events  that took place during former U.S. President George Bush's visit  was his participation in the demonstration that took place at  Porras Plaza.    The Zak Hernandez case was investigated by the Fourth  District prosecutor, who requested that Pedro Miguel Gonzalez,  Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista stand trial. Second  District Judge Sandra Huertas De Icaza will assess the merit of  the arguments.    Initially, the authorities arrested three other people  accused of taking part in Hernandez's murder, but they were  later acquitted. None of the three Panamanians sought by the  State Department has retained defense attorneys, because the  courts have not yet accepted the powers of attorney extended by  their relatives to a group of attorneys.</p>

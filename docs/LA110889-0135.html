			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATM CARDS LET CARL'S JR. DISH UP BURGERS, BUCKS;  </P> <P> PLASTIC MONEY: RESTAURANT CHAIN JOINS GROWING LIST OF BUSINESSES USING  ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS. OFFICIALS BELIEVE IT'LL GREATLY HELP SALES.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. customers will soon be able to order a burger, fries and a side  order of cash.  </P> <P> Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises on Tuesday became the first major  fast-food chain to approve the use of automated teller cards at most of its  restaurants.  </P> <P> As the electronic system is installed over the next year in the chain's 423  California restaurants, customers will be able to use plastic money -- namely,  bank debit cards from four major California banks -- to pay for their food  purchases.  </P> <P> And patrons can trot off carrying more than just a bag of burgers. Carl's Jr.  will allow patrons to receive up to $40 cash back with their purchases.  </P> <P> By accepting automated teller machine (ATM) cards, Carl's Jr. is joining a  growing list of retailers -- including gas stations, supermarkets and  convenience stores -- allowing customers to use plastic money.  </P> <P> Just about every major competitor -- including McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's,  Jack in the Box and Burger King -- has tested or researched the use of bank  cards. But most of them have small pilot programs that either issue scrip  redeemable for food or accept credit cards, which involves interest payments.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. is "way ahead of everyone" in developing the use of bank cards, said  Carolyn Levy, a restaurant analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. But in the  already bloated fast-food market, "everyone is desperate to increase customer  counts -- so there's no question that the rest will leap in if it works for  Carl's," Levy said.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. decided to adopt the ATM system after a two-year test at more than  120 Carl's Jr. stores in San Diego and Northern California.  </P> <P> At those stores, customers pay 10 cents per transaction to pay for their  Chicken Clubs and Famous Stars by sliding a bank card through a card reader. A  debit card allows payment to be electronically transferred from the customer's  bank account to Carl's Jr.  </P> <P> So far, the ATM systems seem to have given card carriers a bigger appetite.  Customers who use debit cards spend an average of 50% more at Carl's Jr. than  before, said Bob Altman, a company vice president. Overall sales are up at the  test sites, too, but Carl's officials declined to provide numbers.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. officials believe that purchases made with ATM cards will account  for up to 7% of the chain's transactions within two years -- and eventually  more than 10% once drive-through customers can use plastic money (which the  system currently doesn't allow).  </P> <P> That's for an investment of roughly $2,000 per restaurant to install the  systems -- which Altman estimates will be paid back within the first 18 months  of operation.  </P> <P> The system, through Wells Fargo Bank's Interlink system, accepts ATM cards from  Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Security Pacific and First Interstate. But  starting next spring, the Wells Fargo system will expand to add the state's  major savings and loan associations and larger credit unions.  </P> <P> The system will be added at all 423 company-owned Carl's Jr.'s in California,  with the chain's 60 franchisees having the option of joining. The 48 stores in  Arizona, Nevada and Oregon are not included.  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Paper chase - David Lascelles examines National Westminster Bank's pioneering green audit National Westminster Bank, the UK's second largest clearing bank, is not the sort of company that belches smoke into the sky or empties chemical waste into rivers. But it does employ close to 100,000 people, run a fleet of 7,000 vehicles, own 4,000 separate properties, and consume mountains of paper and office equipment. So it cannot ignore the impact this has on the environment. Nearly a year and a half ago, NatWest decided to try to assess that impact and see what it should do about it. In conjunction with Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, it embarked on an environmental audit of its entire domestic operations. 'We literally lifted manhole covers and looked into the drains,' says Hilary Thompson, head of the bank's environmental management unit. Although the purpose was partly altruistic (the bank's new chairman, Lord Alexander, is keen on environmental issues), it was also economic insofar as NatWest wanted to reduce costs. It was even defensive to the extent that NatWest wanted to rebut criticism and prove that it was willing to set an example. The results of the audit will be published in stages during this year through to October when the programme should be complete. But already work on the support services sector, the largest consumer of supplies and equipment in the bank, and UK retail banking is well advanced, and a picture is beginning to emerge. The audit is being conducted by two NatWest managers and the Coopers team. In the support services area they looked at supplies, property management, vehicles, information technology, catering and links with suppliers. Some of these pose obvious questions: how to make buildings more energy efficient, or vehicles more environmentally friendly, which the bank was addressing already. NatWest is taking the sort of steps you would expect, such as raising the quality of its buildings and 'greening' its vehicle fleet. It is also looking at waste management to ensure that in cleaning out its rubbish it is not merely shifting the problem somewhere else - a requirement that will have statutory force in the UK from next April. A specific problem for banks is paper. NatWest has its own printing division, and the audit examined ways of raising the level of recycled paper. But there are limits to what can be done here. One obstacle is an industry-wide agreement among banks on the quality of paper used in cheques which prevents them being recycled. This would have to be amended if a lower quality was to be accepted. The paper issue also involved examining the policies of paper suppliers to ensure that they met NatWest's standards and would not cause the bank any embarrassment. On the information technology side, the audit checked the energy efficiency of equipment, and asked questions like, what is it made of, is it disposable? Experts looked at the software to see whether it could be made to run more efficiently. A technical unit has also been set up to vet new equipment. Thompson declines to discuss the audit's findings in detail at this stage. But she says that the exercise has been helpful in identifying a wide range of savings. Overall, the savings possible in support services should amount to five or six times the cost of achieving them (as opposed to the cost of the audit itself which Thompson puts in six figures), she believes. Some of the savings will be large, like the Pounds 750,000 that NatWest expects to save each year on its new energy-efficient cheque processing centre in Stone in Staffordshire, right down to the 12 per cent saving on making visiting cards out of recycled paper. However, the cost of actually carrying out the changes required by the audit will be borne by the individual departments concerned on the grounds that they will be the long-run beneficiaries. This will also drive home to individual managers the economic message behind environmental awareness. Getting people to take the exercise seriously is a major part of Thompson's task. Although the initiative had board approval and is backed by senior management headed by Derek Wanless, a deputy group chief executive, institutional inertia and cynicism could still blunt its impact. Thompson has set up a network of senior sector executives whose job it will be to ensure that all the recommendations are carried out, and that the audit has a continuing impact backed by a detailed timetable. The intention is to have a follow-up audit in about three years' time. 'I don't want people to see the environment as a separate issue,' she says. 'I want them to put it in their planning.' Aside from whatever internal benefits NatWest derives from the exercise, it also has an external purpose too. NatWest needs to be in a position where it can speak with some authority on environmental matters to other organisations and businesses. This is increasingly relevant as NatWest now has a policy of examining its business customers' environmental record when making loan decisions. In some cases its managers even require prospective borrowers to conduct an environmental audit of their own (at their own expense) before they approve a loan. This is to protect the bank against exposure to customers whose creditworthiness could be damaged by some environmental disaster. NatWest claims to be the leader among the UK clearing banks in appointing an environmental supremo and conducting its audit. But other big banking organisations have also begun to make themselves more green. Barclays, for example, has had an energy efficiency unit operating since 1979, during which time it estimates it has saved the bank Pounds 11m. It is also trying to extend the use of recycled paper, cut emissions from its cars and outlaw hardwood furnishings. Lloyds and Midland have also been trying to make themselves more green, though none has so far sought an audit of its own.</p>

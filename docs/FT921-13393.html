			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Brazil launches drive to boost tourist industry BRAZIL is launching an aggressive marketing campaign to recuperate its flagging tourist industry. Mr Ronaldo de Monte Rosa, head of Embratur, the state tourist authority, plans to double the number of tourists and increase income from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) over the next five years. 'I want to seize the opportunity of the Earth Summit (to be hosted by Rio in June) to relaunch Brazil as a tourist destination,' he says. To encourage investment, credit lines have been made available by the National Development Bank. Tourism is to be declared an industry, giving investors incentives in terms of reduced import tariffs and energy rates. Brazil might seem to be the ideal tourist location: 4,600 miles of beaches, the world's largest rainforest. But in the past five years, the number of tourists has fallen from 2m to 1.08m, as potential visitors are deterred by social problems caused by economic crisis. Embratur has decided to fight back against the wave of bad publicity focusing on Rio's violence by setting up offices overseas to inform the world about the Indian reserves and Brazilian food and music. Mr Monte Rosa's aims are to rescue Rio and show the world what else Brazil has to offer, 'focusing on the north east and Amazonia'. Despite Brazil's many natural advantages, this is no easy task. Mr Monte Rosa has finally persuaded Rio's state government to invest in a 'security for tourists' programme, by showing that it has lost Dollars 400m a year for the past five years in tourism revenue. But he would like to divert tourists to Amazonia and the north-east, Brazil's poorest but most scenic and culturally rich area.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions ingenuity already displayed Sir, It does not require, as you state in your leading article, 'Revisionism on pensions' (May 17), ingenuity from the City 'to reduce the capital market threat to the value of the (defined contribution) pension on the date of retirement'. That ingenuity has already been displayed by the production of equity-based annuities. What is required is a swift decision by the Inland Revenue to allow pensioners to benefit immediately. In the longer term the requirement to liquidate a personal pension and buy an annuity should be removed and replaced by simple rules on the withdrawal of income and capital from the fund. Philip Warland, director general, Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / French keep tight grip on rate of inflation FRENCH inflation remained stable in March, and significantly below the average of its main trading partners, according to provisional figures released by the National Statistical Institute. The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in March, following similar increases in February and January, and takes the year-on-year increase over the past 12 months to 3.2 per cent. The margin by which French inflation is undercutting that of Germany has widened since the start of the year, and now stands at 1.5 percentage points over the past 12 months. This month the authorities expect a very slightly higher increase in the consumer price index (up 0.4 per cent), but are forecasting a rate of inflation for the year as a whole of only 2.8 per cent.</p>

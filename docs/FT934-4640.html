			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (9): All your needs can be satisfied - A plethora of specialist retailers, offering something for everyone Zurich is well endowed with specialist shops, and they are a delight for the knowledgeable shopper, partly because the staff are also knowledgeable, but also because they usually have the time and willingness to explore all of your needs. If you want to buy climbing rope 'off the reel' - try Seilerei Denzler in Torgasse. Buy your walking or climbing boots at Schuhhaus Grab just round the corner in Oberdorfstrasse - the staff there will patiently search for just the right fit and make you balance on the edge of the stairs to test how far forward your foot moves. For ski equipment, Fritsch in Rennweg, Och in Bahnhofstrasse and Max Eiselin in Stampfenbachstrasse are the leaders. Beach Mountain at Birmensdorferstr. 21 are the snowboard specialists. For advice on fishing rods and bait go to Fischerei &amp; Sportartikel, appropriately situated on the corner of Burkliplatz at the edge of the Lake of Zurich. Browse through an awe-inspiring array of buttons and buckles at Keck in Oetenbachgasse off Rennweg or choose a decorative silver-topped wine cork with a sporting or culinary motif from H. Meng, also in Rennweg. They have a fascinating choice of silver thimbles, too. For upmarket desk accessories for the executive who has everything, look in Papeterie Landolt-Arbenz in Bahnhofstrasse. You can find some unusual gifts in the Messer Dolmetsch shops - Shop-Ville under Bahnhofplatz, Bahnhofstrasse and Limmatquai - where you will be stunned to see so many types of scissors (there's even a pair to cut the top off your boiled egg) and, of course, a full line of Swiss Army knives. Drogerie Wernle in Augustinergasse specialises in candles in any shape, size or colour. If you want to please a philatelist friend, choose a first-day cover with one of the Swiss stamp series from the Post Office shop in Fraumunsterstrasse, first floor. Zigarren Durr on Bahnhofplatz sells cigars to customers from all over the world and has a good selection of pipes and tobacco. There are several model railway specialists ready to give highly technical advice - look in at Paul Aebi, Schrennengasse 37; Peter Schneebeli in General-Willestrasse or the special sections in the big toyshops. Musical instruments are at Hug, Limmatquai and Jecklin in Ramistrasse. At Rascher in Marktgasse in Niederdorf you will find experts on all types of watercolours, oils, paint for airbrushes and every type of canvas or drawing paper. Beautiful topographical maps are a Swiss speciality. The high-quality printing makes them so decorative that many people buy them just because they look good. Orell Fussli are the printers - they also print Swiss banknotes - and you can buy the maps at their new bookshop in Susslistrasse. The town's silver specialist is Silber Meister on Paradeplatz where the daughters of old Zurich families still have lists left for their future trousseaus. Starting with their christening, they are given bits of silver on every occasion until they get married. Pastorini, across the street from the Storchen Hotel on the left bank, has a huge choice of well-made wooden toys - and specialises in doll house furniture. The Franz Carl Weber store in Bahnhofstrasse probably has one of the most comprehensive selections of toys in Europe, but avoid a visit on Wednesday afternoons when Zurich's children get a half-day off. Pewter has always been popular in Zurich - go to Braumandl in Zahringerstrasse (Niederdorf), which specialises in wine carafes - a different shape and style for every canton. Leaded glass paintings to hang in a window are typically Swiss creations, mainly of family coats of arms, or cantonal flags. Anton Christen's shop in Hallwylstrasse is a main supplier.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Yucpa Indian leaders today denied in Miraflores  Palace that they ever had an alliance with Colombian guerrilla  groups, thus rejecting certain media reports. The Indian  leaders insisted that they believe in Venezuelan justice and  that they have confidence in the actions carried out by the  Executive Branch to fulfill their needs.    The Indian leaders reasserted their requests to President  Rafael Caldera: Pay 10 million bolivares in compensation for  every Yucpa who has been assassinated and the granting of 6,000  hectares in the Perija mountain range for their status as first  inhabitants in the zone.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified Indian] We have always  had problems, because some of our fellow Indians have no  identification papers; they are always being harassed for this.  They know we are pure, indigenous, native Indians, yet we have  always been mistreated.    [Second unidentified Indian] We must protest, because they  will annihilate us if we do nothing. We are human beings and  Venezuelans like all of you -- in fact, we are more Venezuelan  than you. I always said you are like retread Venezuelans, no?  [Indian leader chuckles, followed by laughter heard in  background] Therefore, we have always been mistreated by the  cattlemen and landowners, who have taken away all our land and  used it to raise cattle -- and we have no land on which to raise  our crops.    [Third unidentified Indian] For the first time in history,  and I state this as a Yucpa Indian, we have been received with  so much amity and with a positive attitude. Therefore, I state  that I believe in the president of the Republic and all his  cabinet because I believe.... [pauses] no, I know that he has  appointed the most appropriate persons to hold those posts.  Therefore, positive things will occur for us from now on. [end  recording]    Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar de Castro later met with  the president of the Republic and explained her experience in  this case. The Zulia State leader said she advocates giving land  to the Yucpa Indians and providing them with technical  assistance for their crops. In her opinion, the problem can be  solved this way.    [Begin de Castro recording] I understand this solution can  be  reached more or less quickly, and there is no reason why further  aggressions should occur in the zone. I believe we can do this  without major problems so we can give the Indians what they  rightfully demand and what they have been deprived of for many  years. [end recording]</p>

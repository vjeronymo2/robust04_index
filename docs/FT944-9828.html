			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Franchised post offices popular with customers Sir, Mr David Erdman's comments (Letters, November 8) that Post Office Counters advises its most valued customers (old-age pensioners) to open bank accounts with our competition is preposterous. Ninety-five per cent of Britain's post offices have been run by sub-postmasters for the past 350 years. Business in post offices which we have moved from Crown to sub-postmaster operations has grown twice as fast as the rest of our network. Our research shows these offices are popular with our customers. They are conveniently located - often in smart new premises in shopping centres - and are more accessible, too, with car parking facilities and significantly longer opening hours. Opening post offices in partnership with sub-postmasters is a cost-effective way of operating them. The savings we make provide opportunities for reinvestment elsewhere in the business and help to support the network of rural sub-post offices which play such a vital role in the community. Post offices franchised to leading supermarkets are a small but valuable part of our network - just 130 out of a nationwide network of 20,000 post offices. Franchising is just one of the ways in which we are developing our network to improve services to customers by providing a mix of offices catering to customers' needs.

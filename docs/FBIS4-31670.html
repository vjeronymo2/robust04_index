			<p>BFN     [Text] As the Press Center of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina reports, Generals Rasim Delic and Enver  Hadzihasanovic, commander and head of the Supreme Command of the  Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina respectively, had  talks in the UN base in Visoko today with General Michael Rose,  commander of the UN Forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, about the  implementation of the Geneva agreement and the method of  monitoring the cease-fire.    During the meeting, the representatives of the Headquarters  of the Supreme Command of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina presented a proposal on the deployment of  observers, liaison officers, as well as the way of maintaining  mutual communications. It was agreed that in the days to come,  heads of headquarters should establish places for deploying  observers, as well as other elements significant for monitoring  the cease-fire [word indistinct] in the field.    Army General Delic insisted that elements for monitoring the  cease-fire with the Serbian aggressors side should be  established in the same way and that UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Force] should urgently take more efficient measures  to stop attacks at the protected zone of Bihac, as well as to  return the population to the right bank of the Drina River, that  is, to the protected zone of Gorazde.    The (?system of) maintaining the truce on the entire  battlefield of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be monitored in the same  way and on the basis of the same criteria, Army General Delic  said at the end of the talks today, it has been reported by the  Press Center of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

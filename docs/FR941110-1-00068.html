			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) to create a new category of essential-use allowances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) to create destruction and transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (similar to the previous process for granting additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances when substances produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported with expended allowances are transformed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs describe the allowance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for a variety of production and importation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios under the current Allowance Program. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs describe the administrative changes being proposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to facilitate the phaseout of all class I ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances effective January 1, 1996, (except for methyl bromide)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the special production and importation scenarios proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the post-phaseout period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Post-Phaseout Requirements for Transformation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Destruction of Controlled Substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation distinguishes between two categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of controlled substances that are transformed or destroyed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two categories are: (1) controlled substances that were produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or imported explicitly for uses that result in transformation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction, and (2) controlled substances that were produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported with the intention of putting the substance to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``emissive use.'' EPA proposes adding the definition of emissive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use to the current regulation, such that emissive use would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those uses of controlled substances that do not result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction of the substance. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissive uses would be the incorporation of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into a refrigerator or an air conditioner (for a car, household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or building), or the use of a controlled substance as a solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clean machine parts or circuit boards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current program assumes that when a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance is produced or imported for other than transformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destruction it is intended for an emissive use. When the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance is produced or imported for an intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissive use, the producer or importer must expend allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the current program. Whether or not the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance is actually incorporated into an emissive use is not as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important as the fact that it was intended for an emissive use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the controlled substance is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> intended  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for an emissive use at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of production or importation, the person producing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importing the substance is required to expend allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the expenditure of allowances is not sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define emissive use. For example, a controlled substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered from an air conditioner, refrigerator or dehumidifier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured before the current program became effective (July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989) would not have been produced with expended allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the following discussion, EPA proposes changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for controlled substances that are produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly for transformation and destruction, and to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for controlled substances that are produced for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended emissive uses and then subsequently transformed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed. The requirements differ according to the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of the controlled substance during production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Production or importation of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly for uses that result in domestic transformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or destruction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation does not require a person to expend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances if they are explicitly producing or importing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance for a use that will result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction of that substance in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. In other words, allowances do not need to be expended at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of production or importation as long as the producer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer has certification that the controlled substance will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformed or destroyed by themselves, by a second-party, or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a third-party. As long as the producer or importer has such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification that the substance will be transformed or destroyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestically, there is no need to expend allowances for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production or importation of the substance. To confirm the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future transformation or destruction of the controlled substance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current regulation requires the second- or third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person, who will transform or destroy the substance, to submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation certification or destruction verification to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer or exporter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

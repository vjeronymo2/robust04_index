			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A STRONG opening in futures soon gave way to concern about the outcome of today's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht treaty, before a late rally led to a firm finish. The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE Index was struck at a strong 2,733, boosted in no small way by the good overnight performance by Wall Street stocks. The early buying interest quickly faded as worries over Maastricht gained the upper hand and December retreated, falling to 2,719 by mid-morning, which proved to be the day's low. Light buying thereafter helped December slowly regain momentum, as it crept gently forward for the rest of the session with a bout of strong buying activity seen in the last hour of trading which ensured a strong close. The contract finished at 2,744, up 30 from the previous session and around 22 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 17. Turnover was 7,824 lots. Investors showed renewed enthusiasm for traded options, sending turnover climbing to 29,054 contracts by the close, with some 7,446 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. British Aerospace, also busy in the underlying equities after a broker's recommendation, was the most active stock option with a total of 2,173 lots transacted. This was followed by BTR, in which 1,298 contracts were traded, and then by HSBC.</p>

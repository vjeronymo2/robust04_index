			<p>BFN     [Text] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin- Husayn al-Ahmar this morning met with brother Lakhdar  Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus Ghali.  Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud, staff member of the House  Speaker's Office, and several House deputies attended.    At the outset of the meeting, the brother House speaker  welcomed brother Lakhdar Brahimi in his second home, the  Republic of Yemen. He added: We thank you for bothering to make  this trip to achieve the mission assigned to you--a humanitarian  Arab mission. It is a duty that must be performed by a  well-known Arab figure, like you. This is because you are a  fraternal Arab who believes in Arab unity and bringing the  peoples of various countries together. God willing, your  mission will be a success. We will support you.    Shaykh al-Ahmar affirmed that what is taking place in the  Republic of Yemen is a domestic affair. Brother Shaykh  'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar discussed Yemeni unity, saying:  Yemeni unity has been blessed by all fraternal Arabs, who have  deemed it a step along the road of the desired Arab unity, which  has long been the dream of the Arabs. The Arabs have deemed  unity the Arab nation's (?sublime) objective.    Brother al-Ahmar reiterated that any laxity toward Yemeni  unity would be a departure from this objective, which we all  seek to achieve.    During this meeting, the brother House speaker also  explained  the joint unity-orientated action from the outset until it was  crowned by the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen in 1990.  Unity was achieved through democratic methods, dialogue, and  peaceful means. It enjoyed the broad support of all sectors of  the people, al-Ahmar said.    The House speaker indicated that Yemen--territory and  people--has always been united. But, apparently, there were two  distinct regimes.    Shaykh al-Ahmar elaborated on the crisis since its eruption,  noting that certain elements within the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] fabricated it, until these elements  caused a flare-up in the military situation on 27 April  1994--the first anniversary of the parliamentary elections held  in united Yemen.    The House speaker concluded by saying: The most important  issues are Yemeni unity, democracy, and legitimacy. He affirmed  that unity is the most important thing that concerns the people  and their representatives. The choice they are facing is  between either safeguarding unity or death, he contended.    For his part, brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN  secretary general, spoke, saying: Yesterday and the day before  yesterday, I had the honor of meeting several officials, headed  by the brother Presidential Council chairman. I have also met  with representatives of the political parties. Today, I am  meeting with you. The mission I am conducting at the  instructions of the UN secretary general is aimed at enabling me  to find the facts pertaining to the situation of the brothers in  this country, and informing them that the international  community is concerned over what is taking place in this  country, and that the brothers are required to overcome their  difficulties by themselves.    Brahimi added: I feel that I am in my own country, and among  my brothers. We are agreed that Yemen is an important country,  with and age-old history, and that it is only natural for  difficulties to emerge in all countries and societies. God  willing, we will overcome these difficulties. The brothers  reiterated to me at previous meetings that dialogue is an  approach acceptable to Yemenis. God willing, dialogue will help  create a strong Yemen that contributes to the well-being of its  people and its neighbors.    Afterward, brother Lakhdar Brahimi listened to the views of  the House members who attended the meeting, who represent  various parliamentary blocs at the House of Representatives.  These deputies represent parties, political organizations, and  various Yemeni governorates. Some of them are independents.    The House members asserted that Yemeni unity has been  established through peaceful and democratic means, that this  unity has been grounded in dialogue, and that Yemeni unity has  been achieved through a popular and democratic will, without any  pressures. They added that secession is meant to be forced on  us. They hoped that fraternal Arabs will support Yemeni unity,  because it is the first cornerstone in the edifice of Arab  unity. They went on to say that bias in favor of anything other  than Yemeni unity is tantamount to supporting fighting.  Besides, the entire Yemeni people are unified. They adhere to  unity, and can in no way accept secession.    The House members noted that those who declared secession  constitute a small minority that rebelled against legitimacy,  one that does not represent the YSP. This is because it is an  established fact that the YSP has supported and backed unity.  The deputies affirmed that dialogue must have bases. One of  these bases is that any political solution to the crisis must  safeguard Yemeni unity. Any such solutions should not result in  tearing Yemen apart after it has been united, the deputies  argued.    The parliamentarians affirmed the need for the United  Nations  to protect legitimacy and consecrate Yemeni unity, because unity  came as a response to the will and demands of the people, who  supported the Constitution in a public referendum and backed  constitutional legitimacy at the polling stations on 27 April  1993, when they elected their representatives to the first  parliament of unified Yemen. Consequently, the people  unanimously support unity and legitimacy. They will not abandon  unity, regardless of the sacrifices entailed.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HODGES MOVES EASILY INTO RUGBY  </P> <P> Like many current and former Occidental College athletes, David Hodges'  seasonal transition proved easy.  </P> <P> As a two-time all-conference linebacker, Hodges had the size, speed and  strength necessary to stand out as a wing-forward in rugby, a sport in which  Occidental fields a club team each winter.  </P> <P> Rugby's rough physical play without protective padding appealed to Hodges from  the moment he put his head down and began pushing in his first scrum four years  ago.  </P> <P> About the only thing Hodges detested about the sport was the postmatch  camaraderie with opponents -- one of rugby's oldest traditions.  </P> <P> "In football, there's always animosity toward the other guys," says Hodges, a  three-year starter in football who was named to the Kodak All-American college  division team this season. "I still have it toward teams I played against. I  never really liked any team or any of the players."  </P> <P> "Then I come to rugby and you've got to shake their (opponents') hands and go  have a beer with them.  </P> <P> "I had a little trouble with that at first, but now I like it."  </P> <P> Hodges, a 6-foot-3, 219-pound senior, has become one of the best rugby players  in Occidental history.  </P> <P> Last summer he was selected for the Pacific Coact Grizzlies -- a regional team  that competed in a national tournament in Colorado Springs, Colo. Based on his  performance in the Grizzlies' two matches, Hodges was chosen for an  All-American team that played against a Canadian national team.  </P> <P> Hodges' success in rugby surprises no one who has played other sports with or  against him.  </P> <P> "He's (Hodges) a leader -- a great athlete with leverage, agility and  aggressiveness," says rugby teammate Greg Garcia, a senior who played offensive  line for the football team and throws the javelin in track. "No one can match  his ability. He's pretty much in a league of his own."  </P> <P> Occidental, which in a few weeks will celebrate the start of the club's 25th  season, competes in the Southern California Rugby Football Union college  division, a league made up of teams including Loyola Marymount, Claremont, UC  Irvine, Cal Lutheran, UC Riverside, Cal Poly Pomona and USC. Opponents play  each other twice during the season and also meet in two or three tournaments  that include schools from the University Division. Occidental has never had a  losing record.  </P> <P> Hodges came to Occidental from Long Beach Wilson High for the academics and the  chance to continue playing football.  </P> <P> "I was thinking about going to UC Santa Barbara, which was starting up a  (football) program," Hodges says. "But I came here because they already had a  winning tradition."  </P> <P> Hodges, who will graduate this spring with a degree in political science,  helped continue the tradition after becoming a full-time starter in his  sophomore season. He led Occidental to three Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships, including last season when  he was named most valuable defensive player in the conference after the Tigers  finished 8-2.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, one of Hodges' favorite aspects of rugby is the freedom the  sport allows him on offense.  </P> <P> "Defensive guys like me love it because you get to touch the ball, run with it,  pass it, kick it and score," Hodges says.  </P> <P> Yet Hodges is hopeful that his prowess as a linebacker and recognition as an  All-American will spur interest from professional football teams. He already  has had one workout with the NFL scouting combine.  </P> <P> "I'm going to put on some weight and get my speed up," Hodges says. "Playing  pro football isn't a great possibility, but it's there. Hopefully, I'll get  some tryouts this spring."  </P> <P> If not?  </P> <P> "I can always play rugby," he says. "We have guys on our alumni team 60 years  old.  </P> <P> "You can always play this game if you want to."  </P></p>

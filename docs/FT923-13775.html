			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling fails to gain from RPI STERLING had another very volatile day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, sandwiched between a strengthening D-Mark and good UK inflation figures for June, writes James Blitz. In morning trading, the British currency dropped to a low of DM2.8667 against the D-Mark. Sterling sellers were partly taking account of a new round of losses for the dollar in overnight trading in Asia, which took the US currency down to a low of DM1.4945. Compounding this were fears that the Bundesbank council will tighten monetary policy at its meeting on Thursday. M3 money supply, a key gauge of future inflation prospects, has been holding at an annual rate of 9 per cent for five months, overshooting the Bundesbank's target ceiling of 5.5 per cent. These fears were temporarily put to one side at around lunchtime, when the retail price index for June showed that the headline inflation rate had dropped to 3.9 per cent, its lowest level for 8 months. As the figure came out, traders reported a big buying order for sterling from Germany. The inflation figure also allowed Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to reiterate his commitment to the European Monetary System, after a week of growing speculation that Britain might unilaterally devalue. The currency was also helped by rumours in the market that the Bank of England had intervened to support the pound. But the rally petered out towards the end of trading and sterling closed  3/4 of a pfennig down on the day at DM2.8725. Against the dollar, it closed higher at Dollars 1.9215 from a previous close of Dollars 1.8965. The dollar edged lower in late European trading with operators again becoming bearish about its future trend after the see-saw movements in dollar/D-Mark that dominated the week. The June US producer price index helped keep alive suggestions that the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates again. The index rose an expected 0.2 per cent, but the core rate, excluding food and energy, fell 0.1 per cent, the first decline in this measure since February 1987. By the end of European trading, the dollar was down to DM1.4955 from a previous close of DM1.5190. In late American trading, the US currency was slightly softer at DM1.4952. The D-Mark ended stronger against most European currencies yesterday. It closed up against the lira at L757.3 compared to a previous close of L756.6. The Bank of Italy sold DM53m at the midday currency fixing in a bid to ease pressure on the Italian currency. But the lira is still reaping strength from the recent rise in the Italian discount rate. The D-Mark also closed a shade firmer against the French franc, closing at FFr3.377 compared to a previous close of FFr3.373.</p>

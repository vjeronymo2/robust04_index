			<p>931030 FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No sane way to generate jobs Sir, It is impossible not to comment on EC social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn's prescription that hours of work be reduced to generate employment ('EC plans 5 per cent jobless target', October 20). This is new Euro-madness - that the pie can be divided into smaller pieces leaving each with as much to eat. The only way to increase employment is to increase productivity, thereby increasing wealth. It is either that or Pharaoh building pyramids (that is, the insanely ponderous governments of developed nations today). But that is slave labour in a managed economy - which generates neither wealth nor happiness. Claude Roessiger, vice chairman, PAK 2000, Mirror Lake, NH 02583 US</p>

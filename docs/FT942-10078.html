			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: CrossRail debacle Plans to build CrossRail, a new east-west rail line across London, have been thrown into disarray by a small committee of MPs. It has blocked the passage of the bill needed to allow the line to be built, to the horror of the project's backers and London businesses. The future of CrossRail is now in doubt, with substantial delay inevitable even if the government introduces a fresh bill. The case for building CrossRail was convincingly demonstrated in the Central London Rail Study five years ago. The study identified the line as the most effective option for relieving congestion on the existing rail network and catering for future growth. Yet it is the much less cost-effective Jubilee line extension to London's Docklands that is now being built. It was given the go-ahead largely, it appears, as a political gesture to bail out the Canary Wharf development. Those who oppose CrossRail - including the Treasury - point to the drop in central London traffic since 1989. Because of the recession, they forecast that the new rail link will not be needed until well into the next century. This short-sighted approach is sadly typical of UK transport planning: almost every major project from the M25 to the Manchester Metro has found use growing much faster than forecast. On the basis of a short-term economic fluctuation, a project has been blocked that would serve London for decades. This debacle is the latest in a long line of transport planning failures in the UK's recent history. Like the Channel tunnel rail link and the Birmingham north orbital road, CrossRail will be completed long after it is needed - if ever. It need not be so, as the experience of other European countries indicates. The contrast with France is painful: its high-speed rail network was extended to the mouth of the Channel tunnel months before it opened. A more effective approach is needed to setting transport priorities. Ministers should make decisions on the basis of transport criteria, not political expediency. Once agreed, funds should be committed and not withdrawn at the whim of the Treasury. Planning transport infrastructure is something that only government has the power to do: the present procedures are hopelessly inadequate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening. The Angolan peace talks being held in  Lusaka were unproductive today. The government and National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators  did not achieve anything. They are staying put on the  modalities for the implementation of the second round of  presidential elections. The mediators presented a new version,  which the government and UNITA negotiating teams assessed this  afternoon. Blondin Beye is doing everything to dissipate doubts  and overcome the differences. So far that has not been easy.  The next hours may be decisive.    Meanwhile, a source close to the talks told our reporters  here that Paul Hare, U.S. president's special envoy to Angola's  peace negotiations, leaves Lusaka for Luanda tomorrow, where he  will within the next few days meet with His Excellency Engineer  Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic. It is  presumed that the U.S. diplomat will report to President dos  Santos on the results of talks held recently by the U.S.  Administration and Congress in Washington. It has been reported  in Lusaka that Ambassador Hare is presently on a diplomatic tour  that may have some impact on the government-UNITA talks. Our  reporters have also learned from reliable source says that U.S.  Senator Paul Simon is scheduled to visit Angola this month,  having expressed in Washington the wish to meet with the Angolan  head of state, Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas  Savimbi.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Strong demand for Pounds 200m deal from EIB The European Investment Bank yesterday launched a Pounds 200m issue of six-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 15 basis points over UK gilts. Lead managers HSBC Markets and Warburg Securities were surprised by the strength of demand from Asia Pacific investors. Interest also came from European central banks and European retail and institutional investors, they said. The issue brings the total raised by the EIB this year directly in the sterling market to Pounds 900m. The proceeds were not swapped out of sterling. The World Bank's Y200bn 10-year global offer, which was launched on Tuesday, was priced yesterday at 10 basis points over the Japanese government bond No 172. In spite of early concern that the issue would fail to attract interest from investors outside Japan, much of the offering was successfully placed yesterday with investors in Europe and the US, lead managers Merrill Lynch, Nikko and Nomura reported. About 30 per cent of the bonds were placed in Europe, 50 per cent in Japan, 10 per cent in the rest of Asia and 10 per cent in the US, they said. A syndicate official at Nomura said the bank had sold Y25bn of its Y40bn ticket to European investors. Sixty per cent of this trade was accounted for by investors switching out of existing similar 10-year yen-denominated bonds, while the remaining 40 per cent were outright sales, he said. Only about Y6bn of bonds had been returned to the lead managers, an official at Nikko said. The proceeds from the offer, which is likely to be the World Bank's last yen issue this year, were not swapped out of yen, a source close to the deal said. In the Canadian dollar sector, Bell Canada, the country's largest telecommunication company, launched a CDollars 150m issue of five-year bonds with a spread of 36 basis points over Canadian government bonds. Joint lead manager Wood Gundy said demand for Canadian dollar bonds with a five-year maturity was strong and there was a good response to the issue, mainly from retail investors in Europe. The proceeds from the offer, the first time Bell Canada has tapped the euromarkets since July 1993, were not swapped, a source said. In the Australian dollar sector, Coca-Cola Amatil launched a ADollars 75m issue of five-year bonds which found demand among retail investors in Europe and Asia Pacific, lead manager Hambros Bank said.</p>

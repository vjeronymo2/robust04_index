			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate seeks Pounds 100.7m - Other property companies expected to make cash calls BRIXTON Estate, the seventh largest property group in the UK, yesterday launched a 2-for-5 rights issue to raise Pounds 100.7m to take advantage of low property prices. The new shares are being offered at 155p. Yesterday the shares rose 11p to 207p. Brixton is the second big property company after Slough Estates to tap shareholders. Analysts believe other property companies may embark on similar exercises. The cash call, a further sign that confidence is beginning to return to the battered property sector, should find favour with institutional investors. In the last few months, a growing number have started to move back into the property market, believing it will begin to recover within the next 18 months. Mr Harry Axton, chairman, said: 'Since the company went public in the thirties we have only had one rights issue which raised Pounds 15m in 1980. We resist asking shareholders for money if we can manage without it.' The value of Brixton's property portfolio at the year-end dropped from Pounds 724m to Pounds 679m. Net borrowings rose to Pounds 346m, representing gearing of 114 per cent. With significant undrawn borrowing facilities still available, Mr Axton said the group had not been under any pressure to raise new finance. A quarter of the debt is repayable over the following five years and 1 per cent within 12 months. Two of Brixton's biggest shareholders, Clerical Medical &amp; General Life Assurance Society and Royal Insurance Asset Management, which own 37.4 per cent of the group, have undertaken to take up their rights. The rest of the issue is underwritten by J Henry Schroder Wagg. 'If we are going to take advantage of the present situation we need more money,' said Mr Axton. 'We are looking for the right sort of properties, which are let or partially let.' Mr Axton said he had spotted 'short green shoots' in the letting business, the number of sales, however, was still small compared to the increase in new visits. Net rental income last year was in excess of Pounds 55m and the majority was derived from tenants described by the group as 'good quality credit risks'. The group holds land where planning permission exists for 600,000 sq ft of industrial and office space. Shareholders will be asked to approve the increase in share capital at an extraordinary general meeting on June 7. See Lex</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Turkish central bank chief quits after policy row Turkey's economy, already under pressure following last week's devaluation, was dealt another setback yesterday with the resignation of the central bank governor, Mr Bulent Gultekin. The resignation will further undermine the credibility of the battered conservative-led coalition, and that of the prime minister and chief economic policy-maker, Mrs Tansu Ciller, at a critical time as the country approaches municipal elections in March. Mr Gultekin is a widely respected economist and a former professor of public finance at Wharton School in the US. His departure will further fuel the public impression of deep divisions in the government over economic policy. The governor was only appointed to the job last August. The immediate cause was unclear yesterday although Mr Gultekin is understood to have been particularly angry at Mrs Ciller's reported remarks that it was the central bank that was to blame for 12 per cent devaluation. Mr Gultekin warned yesterday of 'political and economic tensions in the coming days'. He said he had used all the monetary instruments available to him to see off a crisis, but had been 'left alone'. He urged the government to adopt a 'reliable and believable' stabilisation programme. 'Instead of a market economy, we have a situation where every sector expects everything to be provided by the state,' he said. Like Mrs Ciller's clash with the former central bank chief, Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, her differences with Mr Gultekin revolve around disagreement about how to finance the budget. While tapping international debt markets, the prime minister has relied on short-term central bank advances, wary of fuelling interest rate raises and diverting funds from the equity markets by increasing issues of government debt. That strategy must now be in doubt after the decision of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade Turkey's international credit rating, the event that initially triggered the currency crisis. Mr Gultekin's departure could cast an immediate shadow as Turkey attempts to tap international debt markets.</p>

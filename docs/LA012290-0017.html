			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IT TAKES TIME, BUT VIRGINIA GETS ACC WIN  </P> <P> Don't look for Virginia Coach Terry Holland to get too excited about the  Cavaliers' 81-79 Atlantic Coast Conference victory over No. 11 Georgia Tech in  overtime Sunday at Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> "You hate to be winless in the league, but we can only enjoy this for about 30  minutes before we have to get ready for Virginia Tech and a four-game road  trip," Holland said.  </P> <P> Virginia's Kenny Turner, who had not scored since the first half, made a  10-foot jump shot with six seconds left for the winning basket.  </P> <P> Sophomore forward Bryant Stith had a career-high 30 points for the Cavaliers,  who recorded their first ACC win after four losses.  </P> <P> Virginia, which led by as many as 13 points in the first half, found itself  down, 66-65, with Georgia Tech's Karl Brown at the free-throw line for a  one-and-one with 14 seconds remaining in regulation.  </P> <P> Brown made the first foul shot to make it 67-65, but missed his second shot.  Brian Oliver made a 16-foot shot for Virginia with one second left to send the  game into overtime. It was Oliver's only basket of the second half.  </P> <P> A four-point play by John Crotty, who was fouled by Brown as he made a  three-point basket, and a pair of free throws by Stith put Virginia ahead,  75-71, with 2:35 left in overtime.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott made two three-point shots in the last 1:01, the  second with 29 seconds remaining, to make the score 79-79 before Turner made  the game-winner.  </P> <P> Freshman point guard Kenny Anderson of the Yellow Jackets missed a 20-footer  just before the final buzzer.  </P> <P> No. 25 Alabama 70, No. 13 LSU 55 -- James Sanders scored 21 points and helped  hold Chris Jackson, the Southeastern Conference's leading scorer, far below his  average as the Crimson Tide upset the Tigers at Tuscaloosa, Ala.  </P> <P> Sanders and Keith Askins combined to hold Jackson, who was averaging 28.3  points, to only 11 before he fouled out with just over a minute left.  </P> <P> The victory left Alabama, LSU and Tennessee in a three-way tie for the SEC lead  with 4-2 records.  </P> <P> LSU (11-3) closed to four points early in the second half. Then, with Alabama  (13-4) leading, 44-39, Sanders made two baskets, one a three-point shot, David  Benoit added a basket and Alabama was led, 51-41, with 11:20 left. The Tigers  trailed, 59-51, with five minutes left after two baskets by Shaquille O'Neal,  but Sanders and Melvin Cheatum scored to extend the lead for Alabama.  </P> <P> Vermont 64, Dartmouth 55 -- Matt Johnson and Rahim Huland El each made four  free throws in the final minute to clinch the win at Burlington, Vt.  </P> <P> Kevin Roberson recorded an unusual triple-double for the Catamounts (7-8). He  scored 20 points, had 17 rebounds and blocked 11 shots.  </P> <P> James Blackwell led Dartmouth (8-6) with 18 points.  </P> <P> Hawaii 74, New Mexico 71 -- Chris Gaines scored 24 points, including nine in  the final 10 minutes, as the Rainbows beat the Lobos in a Western Athletic  Conference game Saturday night at Honolulu.  </P> <P> Hawaii (15-4, 4-2 in the WAC) took its first lead of the game at 59-57 when  Gaines made an 18-foot jump shot with 9:46 left. The Rainbows never trailed the  rest of the way.  </P> <P> Luc Longley scored 26 points for New Mexico (9-9, 1-5).  </P></p>

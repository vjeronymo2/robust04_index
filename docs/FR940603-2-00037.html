Other topics at the meeting should include a continuing discussion on Cleanup Standards, planning for an upcoming review on EMF and Carcinogenicity, briefings or consultations from the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) staff on Low Level Waste Research and other topics as time permits. The RAC will also discuss briefly the anticipated Fiscal Year 1995 review topics.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Lloyd's reserves 'short by Pounds 10bn' Lloyd's of London would need to find an extra Pounds 10.2bn, over a period of years, to bring its reserves into line with possible liabilities, according to forecasts published yesterday. Estimates by Chatset, the independent company that monitors Lloyd's, suggest a further deterioration in the outlook for so-called 'open years' - annual accounts for Lloyd's insurance syndicates which have not been closed because of difficulties in calculating possible claims, in particular from US asbestosis, health and pollution cases. Chatset urged the agencies which run Lloyd's syndicates not to make further cash calls on Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. It said demands for more funds should await the setting up of Equitas, the company Lloyd's is forming to take over, initially, responsibility for 1985 and prior liabilities. Chatset said the Lloyd's authorities 'need to move quickly to maintain the goodwill of the Names, because in practical terms that is the only way they are likely to be paid by the growing army of dissidents, otherwise Lloyd's will find itself being swept into the chasm of insolvency'. Lloyd's authorities are hoping that Equitas will be able to subsume liabilities from old years at a lower cost than individual syndicates, but has yet to prove that the scheme is viable or will win regulatory approval. Chatset's figures highlight the difficulties Lloyd's faces in shaking off past problems. Last week Lloyd's announced that it was reviving attempts at finding an out-of-court settlement for the legal action by Names who are claiming damages from Lloyd's agencies to cover their losses. Mr Charles Sturge, Chatset editor, said the figures assumed under-reserving would be made up over a number of years. The exercise would be less costly if money was injected earlier because income would be earned from investments. But in practice it would be impossible to raise anything approaching Pounds 10bn from Names - if only because many of those who would have to be approached are no longer active in the market. Last year Names were asked to provide an extra Pounds 1.4bn for reserves. Chatset said that had not stopped a deterioration in the amount of under-reserving from Pounds 8.6bn at the end of 1992 to Pounds 10.2bn at the end of last year. US liability policies remain the biggest cause of under-reserving - and for some 'open years' claims may outstrip premium income by several times - but much of the latest increase has arisen from 'personal stop loss' policies underwritten in the Lloyd's market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir </F> Malyshev, and Yuriy Malinov]    [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin warned today of the  danger of a "big war" breaking out in former Yugoslavia.  Churkin, who is accompanying Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, arrived on this Greek island from Brussels today. The  two men are to attend the signing of the agreement on  partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union.    It seems to me, he said in response to questions from  ITAR-TASS, that during July the peoples of former Yugoslavia,  especially Bosnia, have their last chance to reach agreement.  If this chance is missed, a big war will result. V. Churkin  suggested that this big war could start as soon as the summer  ends. He disclosed that proposals for a settlement of the  Bosnian crisis which were "unprecedentedly" resolute were about  to be discussed. If these proposals are not accepted during  July, a great calamity will result, he said.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi men to keep their jobs The board of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group which has seen open hostilities between its chairman and chief executive in recent weeks, has said that both men are to stay in their jobs. In a statement last week the directors said that, following consultation with share-holders, clients and employ-ees, it had been agreed that the interests of the company were best served by the con-tinuation of Mr Maurice Saatchi and Mr Charles Scott in their present roles, as chairman and chief executive respectively. The relationship between Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott appeared to deteriorate towards the end of last year and it had been looking increasingly likely in recent weeks that one of them would have to leave. Mr Saatchi is said to be unhappy about Mr Scott's handling of the group's financial performance; Mr Scott refuses to be drawn on the conflict, but his supporters say that Mr Saatchi has not been bringing in the new business the group so badly needs.</p>

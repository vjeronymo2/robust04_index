			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Polite applause in Duma greets Solzhenitsyn's moral outrage Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russia's most famous living writer and symbol of resistance to communism, yesterday hurled a bolt of moral outrage at Russia's political leadership - accusing it of indifference to suffering, incompetence, betrayal of the state and gross corruption. The 50-minute address to the State Duma (Lower House) contained all the themes the writer wove together in 20 years of exile, sharpened by his exposure to the Russian people through 'hundreds of meetings and thousands of letters'. The people, he said, 'have lost heart ..they do not believe the reforms undertaken by this government are in their interests'. Yet his moving articulation of the plight of his fellow countrymen was rewarded with perfunctory applause by deputies. 'Russia,' he said, 'is not a democracy but an oligarchy - power of a very limited number of people. People who knew I was to talk here said to me: 'Tell the duma, tell the president, about what simple people have in their hearts'. The authorities, he said, had few links with the 'sickness of the country'. People at the grass roots had practically been excluded from public life. 'Everything goes on to one side of them. They have only one miserable choice  -to drag out a lowly and humble existence, or to cheat on the state and each other.' In a direct attack on President Boris Yeltsin and the reformers in government, he said the sale of land was tantamount to 'selling Russia'. On privatisation he said the process 'had taught 70m people a very hard lesson  -never believe the state and never work honestly.' He restated two major themes of his political writing. The first of these was the demand to end the 'lifeless' Commonwealth of Independent States in favour of a new federal state composed of the Slav countries - Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, with Kazakhstan. The second was to recreate, the network of zemstvos, rural councils of the kind operating at the turn of the century.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station report from the "990 Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] Municipal government departments concerned recently  held a meeting on general price inspection to further relay and  implement the guidelines of the national work conference on  general inspection of commodity prices and to make full  arrangements for deepening price inspection across the city.    It has been learned that the municipal commodity prices  department has over the past two days dispatched nearly 1,000  personnel in a campaign concentrating on prioritized checks.  Results of the inspection show that an absolute majority of  state-run and collectively run grain, oil, and sauce stores have  managed to observe state provisions, while a small number of  shops were caught overpricing and entertaining only  large-quantity purchases.    To ensure stability of commodity prices on the market, the  municipal government demanded that strong measures be taken to  strengthen inspection and to carry on the municipality-wide  general inspection of commodity prices in a down-to-earth and  in-depth manner.    The government's specific demands on commodity prices  departments at all levels are: 1. They should further  strengthen price administration in cooperation with departments  in charge of different trades. Without prior approval, no  department or unit should introduce any form of price hike for  commodities and fees that are under state control or for which a  price hike application is required. They should sternly punish  violators of relevant provisions and go a step further to expose  to the public, individual cases of a serious and odious nature  that have a widespread impact. 2. They should resolutely  prohibit, investigate, and deal with price hikes based on  invalid excuses. Acts of exploiting the opportunity of reform  to unscrupulously and covertly raise prices should be sternly  dealt with in accordance with the law. 3. They should keep the  chain effect strictly in check and sternly deal with price hikes  or the expansion of profit margin without approval. And, 4.  They should strengthen inspection of prices at the marketplace.</p>

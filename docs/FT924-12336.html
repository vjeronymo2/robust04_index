			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Arts: Breakfast today, peak time tomorrow . . . - Television Only last month I said in this column that, instead of perpetually condemning television for its worst examples of mass produced rubbish, we should treat the medium as we do other things, from painting to clothing, and judge it by its best. I argued that the proportion of good to bad in television was probably about the same as in the print or prepared food industries, yet whereas the chattering classes and 'Eating Out' columns concentrate exclusively on top restaurants, ignoring burger bars and pizza parlours, and the literary pages disregard tabloid newspapers and pulp romance to dwell on biography and major novels, television is routinely condemned for the ghastliness of its game shows and soap operas. The truth of that argument has surely not changed in the last six weeks, but the strength of it looks more and more doubtful as British television, and especially commercial television, scrambles faster and faster down market. Anyone seeking to defend television's reputation on the grounds that there is still a remarkable quantity of admirable programming has had his work cut out as expanding areas of the old schedules succumb to material which is either cheap and mindless or cheap and imported. Until yesterday the schedule planned by ITV for London viewers tonight was a strikingly awful example. The oldest of all the tabloid-telly series, This Is Your Life at 7.00, is followed by the oldest soap opera on British television, Coronation Street, and then - between 8.00 pm and 2.45 in the morning - the idea was to have three old movies filling 5 hours 35 minutes: Three Days Of The Condor, Amityville II and The Beast In The Cellar. Forty minutes is devoted to news and weather at 10.00 and, all too fittingly, at 12.35 there is a half-hour programme called Hollywood Report which threatens 'behind the scenes reports and interviews with the stars'. Now they have dropped the first film in order to show yet another football match . Of course Thames Television has lost its franchise and may be feeling like the man forced to work out his notice in a confectionery factory (anyone want two tons of peppermint rock with 'Sod off' written down the middle?) But anybody who imagines that the proportion of high quality material on ITV is likely to go up in January has not been keeping an ear to the industry grapevine. Anyway, London Weekend has not lost its franchise, yet look at its Saturday evening schedule: Gladiators, a British copy of a particularly gormless American game show, followed by no less than three embarrassment series, end to end: Blind Date, Beadle's About and Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch. Those are followed by an old movie, 20 minutes of news, and a repeat of the creepy Hale And Pace. However depressing all this may be for the more demanding viewer, it seems almost irrelevant when compared with what has just happened on Channel 4 in the early morning. Experience over the last few years suggests that what is introduced today at the margins (breakfast time, daytime, and the middle of the night) may well turn up tomorrow in peak time. Those who have followed this column on the long marches through the margins may recall reviews of an American programme which literally chased ambulances, of 'yoof' material where style usurps content, of American Gladiators, and numberless American tabloid telly series specialising in prurient interviews. Sure enough, all this is now moving from the margins into peak time. So it seems worth looking at Channel 4's Big Breakfast to see what may be next. Having been unsuccessful with a breakfast programme aimed at intelligent adult viewers looking for news, C4 has gone to the other extreme and created a show which appears to be aimed at young and unintelligent children. It is presented not from a studio but from three cottages knocked together and painted in the brilliant primary colours and designs of a pantomime kitchen, or Playschool. Presenters Chris Evans and Gaby Roslin both look well under 30, and talk across one another in the comprehensive school glottal stop argot which is now as tediously uniform on yoof television as received pronunciation once was on the BBC. You would never know from this programme that plenty of children play the clarinet, belong to the Scout movement, or read books. It is almost entirely concerned with those subjects - pop music, videos, computer games, American animated cartoons (cheap old series such as Dennis The Menace and The Banana Splits appear to be regulars) - which have the blessing of the peculiar adults who specialise in yoof TV. The garish and overstated look of the show is matched by its tone of perpetual hysteria: the impression is not of being spoken to but of being screeched at. Camera crews and sound technicians are required to whoop and cheer the presenters' 'jokes' in the contrived style of American studio audiences. The whole approach is typified by a couple of manic puppets from the Sesame Street mould whose voices never fall below the level of a scream. Very occasionally this Beano Comic version of life is punctuated by something weirdly inconsistent: a report on sexual harassment (what are eight-year-olds supposed to make of that?) or four minutes of Bob Geldof talking to Nelson Mandela ('Was the prison experience essentially a very hard experience? . . . You don't mean you like Abba?') The infrequent news bulletins are presented, ludicrously, in the abbreviated language used in newspaper headlines for space reasons: 'Britain on collision course with EC bureaucrats . . . Horror at Horse of Year Show . . .' The slavish imitation of a communication medium 500 years older than television speaks volumes about how much thought went into preparing this show. Yet again it must be said that the week did, of course, bring impressive programmes. To an outsider, at least, the first part of C4's Greed And Glory looked like an astute and credible account of the recent boom years in the City of London. BBC2's series about fashion and designers, The Look, is proving greatly superior to television's usual catwalk hagiographies; not only has it has been thought through, it has a telling and literate script, a great rarity these days. In the first of the BBC1 series Off The Back Of A Lorry Mike Scott did a nice calm job of showing up the perfidy of the French when the British try to put EC theory into practice and sell flame resistant cloth in France or set up business as auctioneers: free market ideals promptly disappear behind a wall of protectionism. Increasingly, however, programmes of this sort are shown either at teatime or just after most people have gone to bed. In other words they seem to be moving out towards the margins as the yoof hysteria and associated material move in. We have our video recorders, of course, and we can, or anyway may, set them to capture what we want so that we can play it back when we want. But will we? If television's peak hours fill up with yoof series, embarrassment shows, and Marks &amp; Spencer drama (Boon, London's Burning, Civvies and so on) will it become precisely what the chattering classes always pretended it was: the McDonald's of the mass media? It begins to look distinctly possible, though a successful BBC under a charismatic leader might still save the day.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MUSCLE BEACH;  </P> <P> FAMED VENICE SITE INSPIRES OUTDOOR GYM IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> A high wind swept down on the beach near Belmont Pier late Monday afternoon.  Flying clouds of sand whisked over the sleek oiled bodies of the handful of  sunbathers staunch enough to brave the day.  </P> <P> Yet near the Belmont Plaza Pool, a ferocious volleyball game was in full force.  Joggers and bicyclers wended their way lazily along the strand. And wafting  almost inaudibly in the breeze, the grunts and groans of muscled men mixed with  the whistling wind to speak of something never seen here before: the city's  first outdoor gym.  </P> <P> "The wind is nice," said Matt Raith, 22, a Cal State Long Beach student with  bulging biceps who said he had interrupted a jog along the beach to pick up a  barbell. "You're outdoors, you're in the sun, the wind keeps you cool. And it  gives you incentive when the girls walk by."  </P> <P> Said Jody Burton, 29, one of the "girls" walking by: "This is great. It's like  being in Venice. I like muscles."  </P> <P> In fact, it was Venice's famed Muscle Beach that inspired Dan Bode to create  the equivalent in Long Beach. A former commercial real estate agent and  longtime weightlifting enthusiast, Bode, 26, had worked out a couple of times  at Muscle Beach but said he was uncomfortable with the facility's emphasis on  competitive bodybuilding to the exclusion of weightlifting for general fitness.  </P> <P> "I was intimidated by the huge bodybuilders," he said of sharing bench space  with Venice's bulky contingent of musclemen.  </P> <P> So earlier this week he opened his own Fit Beach Athletics, a gym with no walls  where he hopes to make weightlifters and fitness buffs of all ilks feel  welcome. Ironically, the bodybuilding arena in Venice was shut down this week  to allow construction of a new and improved version. The revamped facility is  scheduled to open by January, 1991.  </P> <P> The Long Beach facility, located on a 2,000-square-foot slab of concrete owned  by the city next to the Belmont Plaza Pool, is surrounded by a chain-link fence  protecting the thousands of pounds of weights within. Admission is $5 a day,  $40 per month, or $99 for the entire summer.  </P> <P> For the privilege of using city property, Bode said, he will pay Long Beach  $3,000 or 3% of his summer gross, whichever is greater, as well as $300 a month  for rent.  </P> <P> City officials seem fond of the idea.  </P> <P> "It will bring us a better clientele," said Dave Tedesco, city marine safety  officer responsible for patrolling the area. While in the past, he said, the  beach has been plagued by vagrants and gangs, the presence of the outdoor gym  would tend to change that.  </P> <P> "People coming down here to help themselves and get in shape are better than  people down here to drink or hide or make trouble," Tedesco said. "The area  needs something like this; it needs the focus."  </P> <P> Bode said he plans to stay open seven days a week between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.  from now through Sept. 30. When the weather turns cooler, he said, he will move  the operation to warmer climes, perhaps Hawaii, Australia or Mexico. Then, if  it is a success, he will return to Long Beach next summer.  </P> <P> In order to break even, Bode said, he must attract at least 60 paying customers  daily. During its first day of operation on Monday, he said, the facility drew  about 20, all of whom were allowed to enter free as part of a special  "get-acquainted" promotion. While the facility welcomes women, Bode said, its  first-day clientele was all male.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest risk I've ever taken," said Bode, who has invested about  $20,000 of his own and his family's money in the venture and left a full-time  job in real estate to work at the gym.  </P> <P> Most of the customers seemed happy with the result.  </P> <P> "You can feel the seasons," said Mike Buono, 32, the owner of an auto repair  shop who lives in Huntington Beach. "I don't like air conditioning; this is  more natural and fun."  </P> <P> Some passers-by, especially women, seemed to approve of the arrangement as  well.  </P> <P> "It's great to look at," said Debra DeFranco, 27. "All the nice guys . . . "  </P> <P> Amy Ward, a 21-year-old visitor from Philadelphia, even had an idea to  contribute. "They should set up little stands," she suggested. "Guys always  come to the beach to watch girls. It will be nice for girls to be able to come  down and watch guys."  </P></p>

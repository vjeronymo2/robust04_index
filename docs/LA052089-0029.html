			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHJ-TV EYES THREE-HOUR NEWS SHOW  </P> <P> Disney-owned KHJ-TV Channel 9 is making plans to expand its news presence this  fall and, if the station's new management team approves, could become the first  major station in the country to broadcast three continuous hours of news in  prime time, an executive of the Walt Disney Co. said Friday.  </P> <P> Randy Reiss, executive vice president of the Walt Disney Studios, also  confirmed that company officials have been meeting with popular local  newscasters Jerry Dunphy and Christine Lund and are "most interested" in luring  them to its low-rated independent station.  </P> <P> "If you look at doing two or three hours of news each night, you have to have  the talent to staff those shows," Reiss said. "No offers have been made to  (Dunphy or Lund), but that kind of talent doesn't come along too often."  </P> <P> Disney, which assumed control of KHJ-TV last December after purchasing the  station from RKO for $324 million, announced Thursday that it was replacing the  station's general manager, Chuck Velona, 48, who had been running the operation  since 1979. Veteran television executives Blake Byrne and Jim Saunders will  assume control of Disney's sole TV station on Monday.  </P> <P> Channel 9, plagued by ownership problems and FCC challenges for the past two  decades, has been the lowest-rated station in the Los Angeles market for years.  </P> <P> "Chuck made a difficult transition period easier," Reiss said, "and he leaves  the station in good condition. But for the direction we want the station to go  in the '90s, these two people are better qualified. The task of running an  independent station is not as easy as it once was. Localism is becoming much  much more important.  </P> <P> "We're the No. 4 independent station in the market right now, but with the new  programming we've acquired and a little bit of luck, we very well could be the  No. 1 independent within a year."  </P> <P> Reiss staked his optimism on his new management team's record at taking  low-rated stations in other parts of the country to the top of the ratings  heap. Byrne, who will serve as KHJ's president and general manager, has been  running LIN Broadcasting's seven television stations, including top-rated  outlets in Norfolk, Va., Grand Rapids, Mich. and Dallas. Saunders, who will be  KHJ's executive vice president and manager, ran LIN's stations in Norfolk and  Grand Rapids under Byrne and most recently took the NBC affiliate in Tampa from  No. 3 to No. 1 in news.  </P> <P> Although final decisions on KHJ's news lineup will be delayed until Byrne and  Saunders arrive in Los Angeles, Reiss said that, at the very least, the  half-hour newscasts that Channel 9 currently airs at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. will be  combined into a single, hourlong news program.  </P> <P> But Disney also is considering implementing a two- or three-hour newscast in  prime time, he said. The exact format of the expanded newscast will be  announced within the next month.  </P> <P> "Programming prime time is the most difficult job we have," Reiss said. "Across  the country, independent stations are dependent on movies in prime time, and we  could go out and buy movie packages ourselves. But that wouldn't be the most  unique way to go."  </P> <P> Currently, the three other independent stations in Los Angeles -- KTLA Channel  5, KTTV Channel 11 and KCOP Channel 13 -- run movies at 8 p.m. and then an hour  of news at 10 p.m. In an attempt to distinguish itself from those other  stations, Reiss said, KHJ is looking for ways to localize its programming and  make the station unique.  </P> <P> Using Disney's vast resources, that means, among other things, competing with  the network-owned stations for top-priced anchors. Dunphy, for example, earns  close to $1 million a year at KABC-TV Channel 7, more than twice what the  highest-paid anchors at local independent stations currently command. (Lund,  who teamed with Dunphy on the top-rated local news programs at Channel 7 before  leaving the station three years ago, has also reportedly been negotiating with  both KABC and KCBS-TV Channel 2.)  </P> <P> "We won't pay more and we won't pay less than the other stations, but we do  have to compete with the network-owned stations," Reiss said. "Viewers don't  think the news they get from independents is any less important than what they  get from the network stations, and so you have to give them what they want. And  what they want is top talent."  </P> <P> Under its new management team, KHJ will also launch a few other programming  twists this September. Its afternoon block of Disney children's shows, for  example, will be hosted live every day from Disneyland -- a move designed to  boost both those programs and the parent company.  </P> <P> And its "early fringe" lineup from 5-8 p.m. on weekdays will be filled with  reruns of newly acquired sitcoms, including "Who's the Boss?," "Alf" and  "Perfect Strangers."  </P></p>

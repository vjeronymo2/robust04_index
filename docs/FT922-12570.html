			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Caterpillar bars strikers CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, yesterday turned away workers returning from a five-month strike. They were going back to their jobs after an agreement to end the strike was reached late on Tuesday, Barbara Durr writes from Chicago. The accord between the company and the United Auto Workers' union emerged from two days of talks with a mediator. It amounts to a big setback for the union. Until contract negotiations restart next week, UAW members will work under the terms of Caterpillar's last contract offer. Caterpillar said it would stop hiring replacement workers but might not be able to take back all the strikers. As if to rub that point in, the company turned away returning union workers, saying it was not ready for them. It said it had changed some technical processes in its plants and would assess how many of the returning union members it would need to call back.</p>

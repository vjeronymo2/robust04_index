[Izetbegovic] Mr. Redman reiterated the readiness of the  U.S. Government to insist as a NATO member on the complete and  consistent execution of the 10 February declaration, to be  carried out without condition or change. This is what Mr.  Christopher also confirmed in a telephone conversation with me  late last night. He called me at about midnight to present the  view of the U.S. Government on this issue. He had heard that we  were concerned that a certain hesitation had emerged, and that  certain misinterpretations by lower-ranking officers in the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] had been put forward. Mr.  Christopher -- now that I have mentioned that conversation --  insisted that we too, for our part, observe the cease-fire. I  promised him that and that is what we will do. I also said that  there would be no front line changes on our part in Sarajevo.  The Presidency also reiterated that point yesterday.    As for the peace negotiations, Mr. Redman and I have  discussed ways for furthering the talks, and (we presented  various ideas) on this issue. We concluded, among other things,  that the clashes in central Bosnia had to stop in order to  facilitate negotiations between us and Croatia on a more  constructive basis. When it comes to talks on the resumption of  the Geneva negotiations, we expressed our readiness to continue  with them in order to reach the finale, that is, to establish a  just peace. As you know, the United States has decided to  participate actively in these talks, which is a good sign and  will definitely contribute to these talks being more successful  and effective than has been the case so far.    [Musabasic] Charles Redman first stressed that the talks in  Sarajevo were very useful and productive, and added:    [Redman, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] Of course a lot of people here in Sarajevo will  focus on the NATO ultimatum and whether it will be followed up.  I certainly hope that it will be, and I think that there are  many indications that it will be realized. However, at the same  time one of the main reasons for my being here is to see whether  we can use this new momentum to put some energy into the peace  negotiations. I believe that we all agree. We have held very  serious talks on ways in which we can try to strengthen the  efforts towards resolving the negotiations in order to reach  finally a solution acceptable to all sides.    It will not be easy. It is something that has been discussed  for months, but I hope that the involvement of the United States  -- with strong support and in full cooperation with the European  Union, and consultations with the Russian Federation -- will  help us find new ways to resolve the problems that have been  preventing a negotiated settlement from being reached.    So, this is still in an exploratory phase, as we consider  various options. I think that we have identified some useful  ideas, and I will be working on that, (and in some other  places), but I will remain in constant touch with President  Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and the government in  Sarajevo so that we can reach a lasting peace in Bosnia.</p>

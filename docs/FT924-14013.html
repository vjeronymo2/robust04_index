			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Consumer hopes dip sharply CONSUMER confidence across the UK fell sharply in the three months before Black Wednesday, when sterling was suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism, according to a consumer survey published yesterday. Business Strategies Limited, the economics consultancy, said the fall represented the steepest loss of confidence it had found in any three-month period for five years. It warned that the next four months were critical. In the survey, carried out with Gallup, the market research company, BSL says: 'If consumers respond positively to sterling's departure from the ERM . . . then confidence may bounce back a little with beneficial effect for hopes of recovery. If, on the other hand, consumers remain depressed, then a double-dip recession becomes a very real possibility.' BSL says the effect on consumer attitudes of the pound's departure from the ERM is unclear - but it is likely to be more ambiguous than announcements of job losses by British Aerospace, Ford, Rolls-Royce and Vickers, since the last survey. The slide in confidence in the general economic situation was most marked in southern parts of the country and undid a strong rise in confidence recorded in the three months to July. BSL says that although in the July survey only Wales and the north-west expected economic prospects to deteriorate over the coming year, all regions now expect a 'significant' decline. Confidence in every region has dropped to levels similar to the early days of the recession. The difference now is that an early belief that northern parts of the country would escape the recession is no longer held. In Scotland, optimism about the economy is falling and concern about unemployment is rising. In Yorkshire and Humberside, optimism has declined, reversing many of the gains apparent in the previous survey. In the north, confidence has plunged over the last three months. Mr David Fell, BSL principal economist, said there were three main factors behind the drop in confidence: The second-quarter survey, which painted a more optimistic picture, was conditioned by the general election - with people thinking it would end uncertainty. The period since the election has been one of bad news. The pound was in trouble over most of the summer and many redundancies were announced. The notion that the recovery was going to happen this year evaporated. Mr Fell said the south-east, which accounts for a third of the economy, remained the key region. After three months of improving expectations, respondents now expect their financial situation to worsen over the next few months. Fewer consumers were managing to save than at any time since the regional results were collated almost four years ago. The survey also showed that heavy price discounting had encouraged people to believe that now is a good time to make big purchases and that consumer spending rose slightly in most regions over the past three months.</p>

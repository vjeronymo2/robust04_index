			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): Slowdown reflects uncertainties - The Economy IT IS a sign of the times that Hong Kong has become the slowest-growing of the Far East's dragons. After pushing ahead at an average of 11 per cent a year between 1986 and 1988, Hong Kong's economy grew by only 2.4 per cent last year. In his March Budget, Sir Piers Jacobs, the Financial Secretary, forecast that growth this year will be about 3.5 per cent, rising to an average of 5.5 per cent a year over the first half of the decade. This marked slowdown to levels in line with more mature economies is partly a reflection of more uncertain times on the world markets which are so vital to Hong Kong's economic fortunes. But it also has its cause in the colony's own problems, particularly the uncertainties created by 1997 and a severe labour shortage. Like everything else in Hong Kong, the economic slowdown can be partly traced back to the shocks created by Tienanmen Square in June 1989. The rest of that year saw a tailing off in growth (GDP was up only 2.3 per cent), and any recovery that might have occurred last year was quickly snuffed out by the Gulf crisis and deepening recession in key client economies like the US and the UK. Domestically produced exports rose by only one per cent last year, though this was compensated by a 16 per cent rise in re-exports (mainly goods which have been sent for processing in China's cheap labour markets). Slower economic growth has not, however, helped to ease Hong Kong's straining capacity. With unemployment at a negligible 1.8 per cent, there is an acute labour shortage which is pushing up wage levels and contributing to an alarming rise in inflation. The consumer price index rose by over 10 per cent in 1989 and by 9.8 per cent last year. The forecast for this year is 9.5 per cent, but the rates in January and February were 10.8 per cent and 11.9 per cent with further price rises due from tax increases in the Budget. The government has tried to ease these strains by relaxing immigration rules. But the causes have their roots in profound structural problems which will not be solved that easily. The monetary levers which other countries use to control inflation are not available in Hong Kong because the currency is pegged to the US dollar. Interest rates must be kept broadly in line with US rates. This suggests that inflation could become an unwelcome political aggravation for the colony's government at a sensitive time. Externally, however, inflation is having less impact. The currency's pegged value of Dollars 7.8 against the US dollar has been holding-up well. This is mainly because Hong Kong's exports have remained competitive with prices rising only about three per cent, thanks largely to the extremely low labour costs available in China's economic zones. The immediate prospects for the economy depend on recovery in foreign markets. Ms Elley Mao, the government's principal economist, says that the Budget forecasts were prepared before the end of the Gulf war and may therefore be a bit pessimistic, particularly if the US recovers faster than expected. But others are more cautious. Mr Alan McLean, the chief economist at the Hongkong Bank, originally forecast 3.6 per cent growth this year. But he says he would shave that back a bit now - 'where is the growth going to come from?' he asks. Longer-term judgments need to take account of deeper shifts that are taking place in Hong Kong's economic structures. Broadly, there are three: First, the colony is changing from a manufacturing centre to a services-oriented economy. More and more labour intensive industry is migrating across the border to China where workers earn USDollars 2-3 for a 12 hour day. In 1989, manufacturing accounted for only 18 per cent of GDP compared to 67 per cent for services. Nearly two-thirds of the workforce is now in service industries, mainly wholesale and retail trading, tourism and financial services. This is clearly a sign of Hong Kong's economic evolution. But it does also increase the colony's vulnerability because service industries can take flight much more easily than manufacturing if the political climate becomes unpleasant. Mr John Greenwood, chairman of GT Management, points out that the capital inflow which boosted Hong Kong's economy in the 1970s and early 1980s has been reversed since the Sino-British negotiations on the colony's future in 1983-84. The huge outflow must be hitting the pace of investment. Hence its need for big infrastructure projects like the new airport. Second, Hong Kong is moving steadily upmarket. As any tourist shopper quickly discovers, it is a place for high quality and, if not high, then certainly higher prices. Street markets which once displayed cheap plastic goods and synthetic fabrics now offer stylish designer items, silks and top-of-the line gadgetry. The important goal now is not just to produce but to add as much value as possible. Third, the structure of Hong Kong's markets is changing. Despite the setback of Tienanmen, the China factor looms steadily larger. It is estimated that up to 2m mainland Chinese are now processing goods for Hong Kong businesses, helping the boom in re-exports which is providing the much-needed offset for the slump in domestically produced exports. Hong Kong-based services companies like banks, accountants, insurers and even the stock exchange are peddling their expertise across the border. This is speeding a further shift in dependence away from the US which has traditionally taken about 30 per cent of Hong Kong's production. Japan, Germany and even East Europe are seen as promising long-term markets.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York exchanges complete merger New York's two biggest futures exchanges officially merge today, creating a single powerful commodities exchange that will be the world's largest. After nearly a century as competitive and often quarrelsome neighbours, the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the Commodities Exchange (Comex), become two divisions of a single exchange. The merger, which was approved by members of the exchanges in April and by regulators last month, is expected to lower the costs of operating the two markets, where futures and options are traded in energy and metals, and raise their competitive profiles. Their combined volume for 1994 is projected at over 80m contracts. Merger papers will be signed today, and some Dollars 82m will be paid out to members of both exchanges within the next few weeks. Nymex's 816 members will share a Dollars 22m bonus while Comex's 750 members will receive more than Dollars 60m over the next five years. After today's signing ceremony, exchange officials are expected to announce their selection of a site in the New York area to house the combined markets. The exchanges share cramped space in the World Trade Center, and hope to move into a new building within three years.</p>

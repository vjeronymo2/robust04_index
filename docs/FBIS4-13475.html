			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Hamas has announced that it would sign a peace  agreement with the Israelis if they withdrew from the  territories occupied in 1967 and dismantled the Jewish  settlements. This position means that Hamas has recognized the  enemy. Thus, the fighting spirit has died down. There is no  difference now between this movement and those who have  recognized the enemy, since they all take the same position when  they say that Palestine is the territory that was occupied in  1967. This is a major fallacy that destroys historical facts  and the constants of the nationalist cause for which the Arab  nation has confronted the Israeli enemy since he began his  occupation of the Palestinian land a century ago.</p>

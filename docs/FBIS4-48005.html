			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>   Mandela's Cabinet -- An editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND  STAR in English on 7-8 May on page 8 describes Nelson Mandela's  cabinet "with De Klerk's appointment as second deputy president  assured," as "a good blend of the new and old." It notes the  "one striking omission" Cyril Ramaphosa, officially explained as  choosing "to stay out to guide the ANC during the next five  years." "Ramaphosa's decision not to accept another cabinet post  is reported to have come after his chief rival Thabo Mbeki, got  the nod as first deputy president" and as "heir apparent to  Mandela." Mbeki is a "worthy deputy president," but his  appointment "does nothing to counter perceptions of the ANC as  an organization which favors Xhosas." Alfred Nzo as foreign  minister "comes as an unpleasant surprise," due to his  "reputation for inefficiency" and Joe Modise as minister of  defense is "worrying too," as he was "named in a an ANC  investigation" as "negligent of the rights of internees in ANC  detention camps. "Mandela's 17 ANC appointments leave 10  vacancies for other parties, thought to include Derek Keys for  finance and Roelf Meyer for constitutional affairs.  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Celebration of Unity and Democracy -- "A new age now begins  in South Africa. The elections have produced so neat a result,  such a tidy balance of contending political forces, so as to  give a compelling logic to the idea of a government of national  unity," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in  English on 8 May on page 24. President-elect Mandela has already  "sketched the themes of his administration as conciliation,  nation-building, and upliftment of the poor," a vision "perhaps  best summed up in the newly popular slogan: one nation, many  cultures." "To give effect to his intentions, Mr Mandela knows,  the government must first restore confidence in South Africa's  future, especially among such key elites as local and foreign  investors" and "he has moved swiftly to do so. The decision to  keep Dr Chris Stals at the Reserve Bank and Mr Derek Keys as  Finance Minister could not have been easy for a man surrounded,  as he still is, by 60s-era social engineers, but it has put two  crucial pieces into place." While the "new spirit of  conciliation will be severely tested" by the "troubles that lie  ahead," "it is proper and understandable if South African hearts  swell with pride" as "we have wroght a miracle, we have made a  democracy."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   President Mandela, a New Era -- "When Mr. Mandela is  inaugurated on Tuesday as the Republic of South Africa's state  president, the country not only enters into a totally new and  unknown political era, but the new head of state reaches a  milestone one only reads about in fairy tales," says an  editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 8 May on page  20. "To sit in jail for 27 years and then be welcomed as a hero  by his people, to feel at home in the presence of princes and  statesmen, to be a part of an intense negotiations process, over  seventy-years-of-age and still able to keep to a busy schedule  which could cause many younger men to stumble, to be politically  and socially active after three decades of personal isolation,  and then to fill the highest post in the country, is unique  indeed for any leader in world history. RAPPORT has been and is  still Mr. Mandela's political opponent, and has no reason to  embrace him or the ANC. Mr. Mandela probably feels the same  about RAPPORT. Politically, the struggle goes on. RAPPORT, as  an opposition newspaper will play its watchdog role together  with other critical South African media with intensified  alertness, especially concerning the interests of the Afrikaans  speaking community. But, on the eve of Mr. Mandela's  inauguration we wish him well." "Mr. de Klerk, outgoing state  president, with his outgoing government, carry with them the  wounds of challenging reforms." "RAPPORT did not always agree  with Mr. de Klerk's way of handling the whole reform process,  but from start to finish he acted in a very dignified manner,  and gracefully handled the difficult situations." "We extend  our good wishes to Mr. de Klerk who clearly showed the world  that this land, especially the Afrikaner who governed till now,  has not discarded the policies of civilization, good manners and  goodwill on the highest level."</p>

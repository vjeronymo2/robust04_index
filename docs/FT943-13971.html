			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions - Body Shop's big deal The largest transaction of the week was recorded at the Body Shop Group. Started by Anita Roddick, and now run by her and her husband, Gordon, it has seen its share price recover somewhat over the past 12 months. The couple sold 3.5m shares to fund two projects they have underwritten. One is to help research into the common cold and hay fever, the other a film. But the Roddicks remain the largest shareholders and, even after the sale, they retain a stake of more than 25 per cent. Field Group supplies packaging for a host of brand leaders including Cadbury, Chanel, McVities and Silk Cut. The company came to market in July 1993 at 250p. The share price then rose but has fallen back to its present 228p. Directors in the company all held (and still do) considerable quantities of stock when dealing began last year. At that time, they undertook not to sell any of their shares until after releasing the company's first full-year results. These were announced on June 9; the shares were sold a month later.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                   Sector      Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Avesco (inc red prf)      Mdia       400,220                   2* Body Shop Intnl           RetG     3,500,000    8,400          2 City of London PR         Mdia        60,000       56          1* Dunton Group              BCon     6,000,000      108          1** Field Group               PP&amp;P       504,333    1,170          9 Hanson                    DivI       120,000      296          1 Moorfield Estates         Prop       240,000       62          1 Northern Electric         Elec         8,000       52          1 Osborne &amp; Little          HseG        10,000       37          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Asda Group                RetF        22,704       12          1 Betterware                RetG        19,150       18          1 Bristol Scotts            L&amp;Hl        10,000       13          1 Burnfield                 Eng         26,000       15          1 Christie Group            OthF        34,000       19          1 Control Techniques        E&amp;EE        43,000      174          1 Court Cavendish           Hlth        10,000       22          1 Coutts Consulting         SSer       143,696      122          5*** Dunton Group              BCon     6,000,000      108          1** Fleming Overseas          InvT         6,473       19          1 Graystone                 Eng        182,130       18          2 Gresham Telecomptng       SSer        20,000       11          1 Lloyds Chemists           RetG        20,000       56          1 M &amp; G Group               OthF        27,000      220          2 MacDonald Martin          SW&amp;C         2,000       10          1A Meyer International       BM&amp;M         8,000       33          1 Orb Estates               Prop     5,000,000       50          1 Prospect Industries       Eng        150,000       26          1 Sunleigh                  L&amp;Hl       617,990       37          4*** TR City of London         InvT         8,447       12          1 United Biscuits           FdMa         5,626       18          1 Watson &amp; Philip           RetF        11,232       41          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s. ** Between directors. *** Open offer.

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> The motion picture "Romero," the story of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero who  was slain in 1980 by an assassin in San Salvador, returned Friday to four Los  Angeles-area theaters amid new concerns over the fate of church workers in El  Salvador.  </P> <P> Six Jesuit priests were murdered Nov. 16 along with their cook and her  daughter.  </P> <P> "The continuing tragedy has aroused great interest," said Paulist Father  Ellwood Kieser, producer of the movie that opened last September. "People want  to understand what's going on in that country."  </P> <P> Kieser said that one of the Jesuits killed, Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of  Central American University, was one of the sources for the movie's script.  </P> <P> Romero became archbishop of San Salvador in 1977, nearly a decade after the  Roman Catholic Church in that country had shifted its attention from the  wealthy and government elites to the poor. "A timid, scholarly kind of guy,  Romero was transformed in three years as archbishop from a mouse to a tiger,"  Kieser said.  </P> <P> The $3.5-million Paulist Pictures movie, starring actor Raul Julia, opened  Sept. 8 and was showing in 14 theaters in the Los Angeles area at one point. So  far, the movie has brought in about $1.25 million, Kieser said. The priest,  attached to St. Paul the Apostle Parish in Westwood, was the creator and  producer for 23 years of the "Insight" dramatic television series.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Episcopal Bishop Frederick Borsch, in his report this morning to the annual  convention of the six-county Los Angeles Diocese, will call for the election  next June of a new suffragan, or assistant, bishop. Suffragan Bishop Oliver B.  Garver Jr., elected to that post in 1985, has announced plans to retire when he  turns 65 in July. Garver also served as interim bishop for the diocese's 152  congregations after the July, 1986, death of Bishop Robert Rusack and before  Borsch's election in January, 1988. The two-day diocesan convention, which  convened Friday at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott, was scheduled to address  problems of poverty and homelessness in Southern California and to discuss  details of the proposed Diocesan Center at Echo Park in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> DATES  </P> <P> A panel of scientists will discuss "Genesis, Evolution and the Possibilities of  Faith" at 10 a.m. Sunday at the Pasadena Jewish Temple. The temple had an  earlier forum on the subject Oct. 27, but scheduled a second panel because of  high interest in the discussion, a spokesman said. The discussions at the  "bagel breakfast" Sunday will begin with short talks from evolutionary  biologist Jonathan Baskin of Cal Poly Pomona; Louis Friedman, director of the  Planetary Society, and Arthur Lane of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> The first pan-Methodist worship service in Los Angeles -- featuring  representatives of four denominations -- will be held Sunday at 5 p.m. at Faith  United Methodist Church, according to Pastor M. A. Robinson-Gaither. The Rev.  Carolyn Tyler, pastor of Walker Temple in Los Angeles, will give the sermon,  and her church's choir will provide the music for the Advent service at the  South-Central Los Angeles church. Walker Temple is affiliated with the African  Methodist Episcopal Church; other denominations involved are the African  Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.  The local group is an outgrowth of the national Commission for Pan-Methodist  Cooperation created in 1988.  </P> <P> On the first anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that shook Soviet  Armenia, St. John Armenian Cathedral in Hollywood will conduct Solemn Requiem  services Thursday night under the auspices of Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian. Mass  will start at 7 p.m., followed by Requiem services at 8:30 p.m. and the 9 p.m.  blessing of a monument dedicated to the victims of the quake.  </P> <P> About 400 U.S. and Canadian members of the Women's League for Conservative  Judaism will begin a three-day social justice conference Sunday at Sinai Temple  in Westwood. Topics include abortion, drugs, crime, ecology and illiteracy,  according to a spokeswoman. JOHN DART  </P></p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Seoul weekly SISA JOURNAL, in its  28 April edition on page 6 reported that the KILLIM SINMUN, a  Korean-language newspaper published in Jilin, PRC, will become a  message center for separated Korean families worldwide including  both Koreas. The center could be operating as early as late May.    This three-times-a-week, eight page newspaper's main  audience  is the Jilin-area Korean-Chinese. However, it is read  throughout China and reaches North and South Korea, Russia,  Japan, the United States, and Canada.    This will be the third phase of the "Search for Separated  Family Members" movement. The first was sponsored by the Korea  Broadcasting System in the early 1980's, mainly for families in  South Korea. The second was carried out by a private citizen  dedicated to finding family members in South Korea and China.  This effort, started in 1984, resolved nearly 2,700 cases.  Although the KILLIM SINMUN-sponsored third phase will search  worldwide, its main target is helping the thousands of separated  North and South Koreans to find each other and exchange letters  with families.    This movement was initiated by the chief of the RENMIN  RIBAO's Seoul Bureau, Pyon Yong-u, who is also KILLIM SINMUN's  special correspondent in Seoul. Pyon had hoped an opening  before May, but that wasn't possible because of the frozen  relationship between the two Koreas.    According to the SISA article, North Korea's reaction over  Seoul's open criticism of North Korea's human rights stance and  the Siberian loggers issue could delay things, but Pyon is  optimistic. He is counting on Pyongyang's inability to stop  KILLIM SINMUN from reaching North Koreans because of North  Korea's relationship with China. Pyon plans to work closely  with Cho Yong-sik, chairman of the Separated Families Reunion  Promotion Committee in Seoul.    Notices for missing family members will be published as  classified advertisements and costs will be paid by the  sponsors. However, the names of sponsoring companies or  individuals and the adresses of the families seeking missing  members will not be printed as a precaution against possible  harm to North Korean families by the Pyongyang government. Pyon  told SISA that he hoped this effort would speed reunification.</p>

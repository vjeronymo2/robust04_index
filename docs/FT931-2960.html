			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Iranian exile shot dead A PROMINENT figure in the Iranian exiled opposition, Mr Mohammed Hussein Nagdi, was shot dead in Rome yesterday by two unidentified gunmen, writes Robert Graham. The killing was denounced by the Iranian opposition as the work of agents of the Tehran government. The murder was condemned by the Italian Foreign Ministry and members of parliament, who pointed out the Iranian opposition was not as active in Italy as in France, the UK and Germany. Mr Nagdi was killed as he went to work yesterday morning at the offices of the Iranian opposition in Rome. Two youths on a scooter opened fire seriously wounding him but leaving his chauffeur unharmed. Mr Nagdi was dead on arrival at hospital. Before the Iranian revolution, Mr Nagdi had worked in the Rome embassy and stayed on after siding with anti-Khomeini movement. According to Italian security forces, he was considered a person at risk and was granted a part-time escort. Mr Abolhassan Bani Sadr, the former Iranian president now in exile in Paris, claimed yesterday that Tehran regime was preparing a series of attempts on the lives of opposition figures in Europe. He said German police had recently discovered a list of suspected targets - 11 in Germany, 12 in France, three in the UK and one in Britain.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Cheung Kong to buy EIE Int'l arm EIE International, the cash-strapped Japanese property group, is to sell its Hong Kong-listed property arm to Cheung Kong, the property development company owned by Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man. EIE Development had long been the subject of takeover rumours, on the assumption that its Japanese parent would want to realise cash from this non-core asset. EIE Development's main asset is 55 per cent ownership of the twin-towered Bond Centre. The offer from Cheung Kong was pitched at HKDollars 4 per share, compared with its previous closing price of HKDollars 3.025. The offer values the company at HKDollars 1.7bn (USDollars 220m), whereas the company's most recent valuation gave it a net asset value of HKDollars 2.25bn. Cheung Kong fully exploited last year's property boom in Hong Kong, through residential development sales which generated net profit of HKDollars 4.89bn last year. It has gone out on a stock market spending spree to park this cash flow, investing close to HKDollars 3bn in 12 local companies over the past 16 months. However, its latest purchase can be seen more as a property transaction than a stock market investment. Unlike its other purchases, Cheung Kong will take control of the property company and is likely to privatise it. Analysts believe it is a sign of optimism over the office property market, which has laboured under a glut of supply in the past two years. The deal also emphasises the strength of Cheung Kong and its position of being able to exploit casualties from lesser-performing property markets.</p>

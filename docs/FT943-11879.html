			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Emap radio move is challenged The Radio Authority was yesterday accused in the High Court of acting beyond its powers in approving a scheme allowing the Emap media group to hold more local radio licences than the Broadcasting Act permits. Emap plans to take over Trans World Communications and so extend the number of licences it holds from three to eight - two more than the Broadcasting Act 1990 allows. The authority has sanctioned a structure whereby Emap would hive off two licences to a new company jointly owned by Emap and Schroders, its merchant bankers. The legal challenge has been brought by Guardian Media Group, a 20 per cent shareholder in TWC. The case continues today.</p>

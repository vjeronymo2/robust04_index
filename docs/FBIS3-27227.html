			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Conscientiously Conduct </F> Ideological and Political Education in Grass-Roots Units in  Accordance With the `Regulations'"]    [Text] The General Political Department has promulgated  the "Regulations on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and  Political Education in Grass-Roots Units" for trial  implementation. This is an important measure for implementing  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of army building and the  instructions and guidelines of the Central Party Committee and  the Central Military Commission on strengthening and improving  ideological and political work in the new period. It also  represents a major event in strengthening grass-roots  construction.    Firm and vigorous ideological and political education is our  Army's fine tradition and political superiority. Under the new  situation of fully implementing reform and developing a  socialist market economy, ideological and political education  can only be strengthened rather than weakened. The national  work meeting on propaganda and ideology, which was held not long  ago, urged the whole party to strengthen and improve propaganda  and ideological work under the new situation. General Secretary  Jiang Zemin profoundly expounded the important position,  fundamental guiding principle, and major tasks of propaganda and  ideological work in the new period from the high plane of the  overall work situation of the whole party, thus further pointing  out the correct way and setting very high demands on us to  accomplish propaganda and ideological work and conduct  ideological and political education well. The General Political  Department promulgated the regulations on the basis of full  investigation and proof and of pooling the whole Army's wisdom,  which not only inherited our Army's fine tradition of  ideological and political education but also drew on the  successful experience since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th Central Party Committee, thus reflecting the objective  demand for strengthening and improving ideological and political  education in grass-roots units under the new situation. This  document is the basis for organizing and conducting ideological  and political education in grass-roots units as well as the  embodiment of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots  Level" in ideological and political education. Units at all  levels must conscientiously implement these regulations in light  of reality.    To implement the Regulations, we must, in the first place,  study and be familiar with them. When organizing grass-roots  cadres to study the program, all units must treat the study of  the regulations as an important activity; brigades and regiments  must integrate with preparatory educational meetings to  constantly organize grass-roots political cadres to study the  regulations; and political cadres must consider the regulations  as the teaching material for professional study. Political  cadres at all levels should understand the fundamental spirit of  the regulations, should be familiar with the basic substance and  requirements of the regulations, should define their own duties,  and should comprehend the basic method for conducting education  in accordance with the regulations.    To implement the regulations, we must conscientiously work  in  accordance with their requirements. The purpose of drawing up  this document is precisely to guide concrete work. Therefore,  it would be meaningless if this document were to be pigeonholed  and the regulations were not put into effect. Leaders and  political organs at all levels must organize and guide education  in accordance with the regulations, whereas grass-roots units  must conduct education in accordance with the regulations. It  is necessary to have a greater awareness of the laws and  regulations and conscientiously uphold the solemnity of the  regulations. The regulations must be set as the criteria of  making arrangements for educational activities, for inspecting  the situation of conducting education, and for evaluating  educational results. We must straighten out relationships  between various sectors, improve the administration of  ideological and political education at the grass-roots level,  and establish a normal educational order in accordance with the  regulations.    To implement the regulations, we must integrate them with  educational practices. This year, all types of educational  activities must be organized and implemented in accordance with  the requirements of the regulations. Moreover, we must  constantly enhance our understanding and heighten our capability  of conducting education in accordance with the regulations. We  must accelerate the implementation of all types of educational  activities through the regulations and properly implement the  regulations in the process of conducting education.    To properly implement the regulations, the involvement of  leaders and political organs at all levels is essential. It is  not easy to draw up a good document, and it is even more  difficult to put it into effect, because we have to do a  substantial amount of painstaking work. Every unit must do all  it can to give wide publicity to the regulations within the Army  so as to build up a certain public opinion and momentum. Every  unit must integrate the regulations with its own conditions in  putting forward concrete measures for implementing the  regulations, to take the initiative in studying how to solve the  conflicts and problems in implementing the regulations on a  trial basis, and to create favorable conditions for implementing  the regulations. Leaders at all levels, in particular political  commissars and directors of political departments, must take the  initiative to study the regulations, to give publicity to the  regulations, and to implement the regulations, thus setting an  example for the grass-roots units.    The regulations are the product of integrating the  inheritance of fine traditions with reform and innovation. That  is, in implementing the regulations, we must also strive for  reform and innovation on the basis of inheriting our Army's fine  tradition of political education. We must constantly study new  conditions, solve new problems, use new experiences and  achievements to enrich and perfect the regulations, and treat  the implementation of the regulations as a process of constantly  deepening the reform of ideological and political education in  grass-roots units. We believe that, with the implementation of  the regulations, we will definitely be able to score greater  achievements in conducting ideological and political education  in the grass-roots units.</p>

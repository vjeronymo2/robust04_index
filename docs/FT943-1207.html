			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / South Africa to raise rates The South African Reserve Bank will raise its bank rate by a full percentage point today to 13 per cent, the first rise in South African interest rates since 1991, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. The decision has been criticised by several prominent businessmen who claim that the bank has acted prematurely and may damage the current economic upturn. The South African Chamber of Business has also warned that the move could damage the government's reconstruction and development programme. However Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank governor, who has been warning for several weeks that a rise in rates was imminent, said the move was necessary to stave off rising inflation.</p>

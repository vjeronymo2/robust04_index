			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Of Atlantis, and other lost causes THE FLOOD FROM HEAVEN by Eberhard Zangger Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Pounds 17.50, 256 pages COULD the story of Atlantis, the mythical lost continent usually placed near the Straits of Gibraltar, really be about Troy and the collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms of Greece in the 12th century BC? This is the startling theme of The Flood from Heaven. Ho ho] It must be another crackpot notion like those about the Ark, Stonehenge and prehistoric UFOs. People love to believe them; they do not threaten a rational life as they are about dead-and-gone times; they always make the experts wrong; and they sell well, despite usually damning reviews. Such a scenario seems to have worried Eberhard Zangger's publishers enough to make them ask Anthony Snodgrass, Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge, to write a foreword to show that this time everybody is serious. Only Plato tells us about Atlantis. Writing in the 4th century BC, he describes a city state that the sea swallowed up 9,000 years ago, and says his story comes from the Athenian poet-philosopher-politician Solon, who heard it from priests in Egypt two centuries earlier. It sounds like a paradise: the earth was fruitful, technology efficient, laws were just and all knew their position. Is it based on reality? Or a never-never land version of Plato's ideal state, given mythical historicity to make it more important? I sense that Plato was making his own new myth during a depressed period after the prince he had tutored to be a philosopher-king had gone to the bad. For Zangger, the Atlantis story has the ring of truth. It is, he suggests, an often accurate account of the great city of Troy conflated with the Mycenaean civilisation known to us from archaeology and Homer. As an expert on how the early people of the Aegean used the land - the key to understanding any culture - he has worked most at the Mycenaean citadel of Tiryns. There he has seen the damage (as Plato was the first to describe) caused by cutting down trees: flash floods, soil erosion and alluviation that strands towns once on the sea high and dry inland. Did this destroy Atlantis? It is a book of very mixed quality. It is exceptionally lively on environmental matters, but myths tend to become facts as the book goes on, and that is dangerous. Very little of Homer really matches the Mycenaeans' world; Atlantis is surely the product of Plato's mind and makes good sense in terms of his philosophy.</p>

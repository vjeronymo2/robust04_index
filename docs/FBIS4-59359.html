			<p>BFN     [Text] Ten Palestinian police officers entered Jericho  today via the Allenby Bridge. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that the officers are slated to take over the local  police station today. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers in  the area ordered the soldiers to evacuate the hundreds of  residents who waited for the policemen in the city square and to  close the shops in the city. A riot erupted in the area, and IDF  officers forcefully evacuated correspondents and journalists,  including a Qol Yisra'el crew. Three officers dragged Qol  Yisra'el's correspondent for about 20 meters, and shouted and  threatened him with loaded guns, causing him slight bruises.  The residents of Jericho started to riot, forcing IDF officers  to disperse them with rubber bullets.</p>

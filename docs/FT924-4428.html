			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Leeds 35% ahead to Pounds 5.5m LEEDS GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, reported a 35 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits. It is proposing to raise its dividend by 13 per cent and make a 1-for-2 scrip issue. For the year to September 30 profits increased to Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 4.11m) helped by higher sales in the Middle East and further growth in its non-apparel business. Turnover grew by 31 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 31.4m). Earnings per share increased to 33.1p (25p) out of which the group plans to pay a final dividend of 7.5p (6.75p) lifting the total to 11p (9.75p). Mr Robert Wade, chairman and managing director, said all seven of the textile operations posted increased profits. Although the UK retail sector remained difficult because of weak sales, the group increased market share in a number of areas. 'The need for us to maintain this improvement is paramount, as the pressure on margins is relentless wherever we trade,' Mr Wade said. Last month an arson attack at Walsden Printing damaged some of the printing machines. Although it will be some weeks before full production can be resumed, Mr Wade said the group was fully insured and there should be no impact on profits. Among the non-textile operations Leeds Leasing has been concentrating on protecting its exposure to bad debt, and has reduced new business written by 9 per cent. However, the benefit of lower interest rates and the disappearance of many competitors helped profits increase to Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 124,000.) In March West Yorkshire Insurance had a 1-for-2 rights issue which resulted in Leeds' stake falling from 34.7 per cent to 23 per cent. Leeds did not take up its rights, allowing a fellow shareholder, CNA International Reinsurance, which underwrote the issue, to increase its holding to 41 per cent. Mr Wade said the outlook for the group 'continues to be dominated by difficult conditions in most world markets'. However, he added: 'While it is harder than ever to anticipate the future, the new financial year has started well, and prospects for the first half are not without promise.' COMMENT Leeds has maintained its reputation as a recession-buster. Its core textile printing business has benefited from diversification away from the fickle apparel business, with moves into printed furnishing fabrics, curtains and military camouflage. The balance sheet is in good shape with the Pounds 2.5m in cash at the end of the September almost exactly offsetting debt. Meanwhile the group has reduced its exposure to the insurance sector by not taking up the rights issue at West Yorkshire. Pre-tax profits should climb to about Pounds 6m this year and earnings could reach almost 36p a share producing a prospective p/e of about 14.3. This is a quality stock in an unfashionable sector which, despite its run-up in the last two years, is still a buy.</p>

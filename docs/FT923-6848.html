			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology: Mobile phones go global A global mobile communications system using 66 satellites to provide voice, paging, facsimile and data services for people on the move has this week moved a important step closer to take-off. The popularity of mobile phones has spurred a number of new networks covering increasingly broad geographic areas, such as the GSM programme in Europe. Now low-orbit satellite systems promise to expand the horizons even further. The Federal Communications Commission of the US has awarded Motorola Satellite Communications an experimental licence to construct and launch five satellites to demonstrate the feasibility of its proposed global personal communications network, called Iridium. Now that the World Administrative Radio Conference has allocated spectrum for such satellite mobile services, Motorola hopes that it will be able to convince national telecommunications groups to invest in its technology which will cost Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.8bn) for the space infrastructure alone. The US group has also recently redesigned the system so that it will be operational with just 66 satellites orbiting the Earth, rather than 77 satellites as initially envisioned. The reduction will be achieved by using more powerful satellites which concentrate communications capacity on areas where demand is most required. Each of the 66 satellites moving in low orbits will cast 48, rather than 37, beams on to the surface of the Earth. This will reduce the possibility of interference while allowing reallocation of channels in response to patterns of consumer demand for voice or paging services. The experimental satellites are set to be launched in 1996 and Motorola expects to be able to commercialise the service by 1998. Handsets are likely to be priced initially at between Dollars 2,000 to Dollars 3,000. For users of existing terrestrial mobile networks, Motorola has designed a dual handset that would scan for the subscriber's terrestrial system and go to Iridium only if a signal were not available from the land-based system. Other companies competing with Iridium include Hughes Aircraft, Loral and TRW.</p>

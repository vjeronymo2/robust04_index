			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM signals determination to ratify treaty MR John Major yesterday hinted that he would press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty whatever the result of tomorrow's crucial Commons vote on the social chapter. His suggestion, echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, came as the bill translating the treaty's provisions was finally enacted into law when it received royal assent from the Queen. The European Communities (Amendment) Act as it now becomes has absorbed more time that any other legislation in recent parliamentary history. Its passage through parliament involved 28 days of debate in the Commons and 12 days in the Lords. The government was defeated only once during 72 votes but was forced on several occasions to accept opposition amendments - including that demanding tomorrow's social chapter vote. The prime minister's combative stance coincided also with fresh evidence that the nine Ulster Unionist MPs may be ready to back the government in a debate which has left on a knife edge Mr Major's political authority and the future of the treaty. But as both sides stepped up the war of nerves at Westminster, diehard Tory Euro-sceptics claimed that they still had enough votes to overturn Mr Major's Commons majority of 18. One of the ringleaders of the anti-Maastricht group said that more than 15 of his colleagues had given firm pledges to vote against the government. He also warned that if Mr Major decides to ignore a defeat tomorrow night then some rebels would be prepared to again defy the government in any subsequent vote of confidence. That contrasted with signs of growing optimism among government whips who yesterday stepped up their campaign to isolate the rebels in their constituencies by accusing them of supporting Labour calls for the imposition in Britain of the social chapter. The government side claimed also a growing tide of support from grassroots activists for the government's determination to ratify the treaty without the social chapter. Officials revealed that the 70 to 80 motions submitted by local associations for debate at this autumn's party conference were running about 7 to 1 in favour of the government. Only four demanded a referendum on the treaty and large numbers congratulated Mr Major on the social chapter opt-out. Mr Major's suggestion that the government might anyway ignore a defeat in tomorrow's vote came during fierce Commons clashes with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Mr Smith demanded assurances from the prime minister that he would not seek to override the will of parliament. But to the fury of Labour MPs Mr Major stressed repeatedly that enactment of the Maastricht bill - with the social chapter opt-out intact - had already provided the will of parliament. Pressed again on whether the government would accept the social chapter if a majority of MPs voted for a Labour amendment tomorrow evening Mr Major replied bluntly: 'You know that this House does not support the social chapter.'</p>

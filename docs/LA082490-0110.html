			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THE BIGGEST FINGER POINTS AT LOU HOLTZ  </P> <P> The revelation that five Notre Dame football players tested positive for  steroid use was no revelation at all. In fact, the allegation by former Notre  Dame lineman Steve Huffman that half of the Irish lettermen took steroids isn't  even the most serious charge contained in the first-person story he co-authored  for this week's Sports Illustrated.  </P> <P> Steroid use at America's University? The school under the personal watch of  Touchdown Jesus? Of course. The teenagers who enroll at Notre Dame as freshmen,  football players or not, are not the little angels propagandists like Lou Holtz  swear they are. They're normal kids. In the case of football players, they're  tempted, like players anywhere, to take steroids. Huffman wrote that he knew  players who were dealing steroids, that players kept up to 50 bottles of pills  and "injectables" in their rooms. Needles were in the trash cans, he said. If  that was the case, it doesn't make Notre Dame a terrible place; it means Notre  Dame is up against the same problems confronting any big-time college football  program.  </P> <P> "Notre Dame officials will deny all this, of course," Huffman said. And of  course, he was right. They denied widespread steroid use, and said five players  since 1987 have tested positive. Let's get something straight; just because  five players test positive doesn't mean only five payers used the stuff. One  reason the original NFL steroid policy had no teeth was that players had plenty  of time to train while using steroids in the offseason, then got off them in  plenty of time to pass a scheduled drug test. Notre Dame has been one of the  leaders in conducting random, year-round testing. Still, some players had to be  sophisticated enough to mask usage or evade detection.  </P> <P> Instead of trying to deny Huffman's story or hush it up, Notre Dame officials  would do well to check out his allegations further. They also would be  well-served by being a little more sensitive to Huffman's story than Holtz  allegedly was to injured players.  </P> <P> Ultimately, a coach is not responsible for a guy who makes a conscious decision  to juice up on steroids. But he is responsible for demonstrating some  compassion when a kid he has recruited and promised to take care of comes into  his office and says, "Coach, my shoulder is about to fall off."  </P> <P> Huffman writes about an argument his father had with Holtz back when he was  coach of Arkansas and Huffman's brother Mike was a Razorback. Mike Huffman says  Holtz would try to throw injured players out of the athletic dorm, lest they  "demoralize the other players."  </P> <P> Steve Huffman also says Holtz tried to run him out of South Bend and back to  school in Texas after he was injured at Notre Dame, and that Holtz called him a  "coward" for not playing through a shoulder injury that had required surgery.  Huffman's credibility already has been questioned, partly because current  players have not rushed forward to substantiate his claims and also because he  was paid (a reported $5,000) to co-author the piece. Still, on this score,  Huffman's account rings very true, and it's a story that can be told at  campuses all across America.  </P> <P> Holtz unconscionably called Huffman "a quitter" in his best-selling book, "The  Fighting Spirit." Huffman, quite appropriately, pointed out that it is Holtz  with the history of quitting-head coaching jobs at William and Mary, North  Carolina State, Minnesota (remember the infamous "escape clause") and don't  forget the New York Jets, where he lasted through only 13 weeks of a 14-week  NFL season. Holtz escaped from Minnesota just before the NCAA came to campus to  investigate alleged violations. Now, that's quitting.  </P> <P> Huffman's story wasn't critical of Notre Dame as much as it was critical of  Holtz, one of the more irritating men in college athletics. Is he a great  college football coach? Without question. He's rebuilt programs everywhere he's  been and won a national title.  </P> <P> He's also a world-class whiner. He offended practically anyone with common  sense, particularly his coaching colleagues, last year by saying over and over  that his team wasn't any good ("We're not No. 1; we may not even be in the top  50") despite the fact that Notre Dame was virtually a consensus choice for No.  1 in the preseason polls.  </P> <P> His teams hardly comported themselves as the gentlemen the school would like us  all to believe they are. Remember the fights in the tunnel at Notre Dame  stadium against Miami and Southern Cal. Only after three ugly incidents --  there also was unsportsmanlike taunting -- did Holtz accept responsibility for  his team's behavior and publicly insist he would resign if it happened again.  </P> <P> Notre Dame is not under indictment here; many schools would be wise to use its  overall student-athlete philosophy as a model. But if school officials really  believe there were only five players who took steroids the last three seasons;  if school officials believe Huffman simply lied to Sports Illustrated about  Holtz's insensitivity for a fee, then Notre Dame will continue to have a very  serious problem.  </P></p>

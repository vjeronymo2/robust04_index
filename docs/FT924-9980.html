			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sotheby's changes pricing policy as losses escalate SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS is to increase the premium it receives from buyers at its auctions. From January 1 1993 the auction house, which is controlled by the Detroit-based Taubman family and is quoted in London and New York, will charge 15 per cent on lots sold for Pounds 30,000 or less. On lots which sell for more than Pounds 30,000 the 15 per cent will be charged up to that level and 10 per cent on the balance of the price. Until now Sotheby's had earned its revenue by charging both buyers and sellers 10 per cent of the hammer price on all lots sold. Christies International, the rival auctioneer, said it had no plans to increase its buyers' premium from 10 per cent. The change follows the announcement yesterday that Sotheby's incurred a net loss of Dollars 7.7m (Pounds 4.72m) for the nine months to September 30, against a deficit of Dollars 5.4m. Losses per share were 15 cents (11 cents). However, Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive, said he was pleased that auction sales for the first nine months had improved - from Dollars 610m to Dollars 656.4m. Acquavella, the modern art retail joint venture in New York, while remaining profitable, contributed less than last time, he said, and this downturn had more than accounted for the increase in the group's nine-month losses. Moreover, he added that consignment levels overall were lower than expected and that full-year profits were likely to be below the Dollars 21.5m level of last year. Mr Ainslie said that annual operating costs had been reduced by about Dollars 45m, or 20 per cent, since 1990. The deficit in the traditionally loss-making third quarter emerged at Dollars 13.2m (Dollars 11m) or losses per share of 25 cents (22 cents). Mr Ainslie said that factors behind the increased losses included unfavourable exchange rates, the implementation in Europe of the group's worldwide computer system and the effect of the recently acquired Edmund Peel &amp; Asociados, the Spanish auction company. Auction sales in the three months rose to Dollars 88.7m (Dollars 73.1m) and the third-quarter dividend was held at 15 cents.</p>

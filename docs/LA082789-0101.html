			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIPPED BY U.S. HURDLES, CHINESE REFUGEES LOOK ELSEWHERE  </P> <P> In the months after Chinese military forces crushed the pro-democracy movement  in Beijing, some protest leaders wanted by Chinese authorities said they fled  their country only to face difficulties seeking refuge in the United States.  </P> <P> After unsuccessful attempts to get U.S. visas or being discouraged from even  trying after hearing of the difficulties in obtaining one, at least a dozen  exiled protesters have found temporary sanctuary in countries such as West  Germany, France and Canada, where the governments have been more open to their  pleas for help, they say.  </P> <P> "I was surprised," said Cai Chongguo, a scholar who was a leader in the protest  movement in the city of Wuhan. "American support for the democracy movement was  so widespread, yet when we need help on some small thing like this, it seems no  one can help."  </P> <P> Cai spoke in a telephone interview from Paris, where he and at least four  others eventually obtained political asylum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expected More Flexibility  </P> <P> Cai and other Chinese dissidents said that after the military crackdown in  Beijing, they thought that the United States would be more flexible in granting  visas, especially after President Bush pledged June 13 to assign more diplomats  to process visas and do "whatever it takes" to help Chinese nationals fleeing  their country.  </P> <P> The promise was to give a yes or no answer promptly, but a State Department  official said then that, in practice, a high percentage of the requests would  be granted.  </P> <P> But some of the Chinese dissidents who have managed to escape now say that the  promise was not kept.  </P> <P> In the case of one journalist on a government blacklist in Shenzhen, waiting  for a U.S. visa in Hong Kong meant nearly three weeks of terror as she stayed  in hiding for fear of being captured by Chinese agents, said Cao Changqing,  editor of the Alhambra-based Press Freedom Herald.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed Hiding Place  </P> <P> "For 20 days, the U.S. Consulate did not respond," Cao said of his friend's  visa application. He put the friend, Chen Anchi, in touch with supporters in  Hong Kong. "She changed her hiding place four times," he said.  </P> <P> Desperate for safe haven, Chen finally went to the French Consulate and was  granted political asylum within one hour, Cao said. She just showed French  officials evidence such as articles she had written that were critical of the  Chinese government, he said. Another journalist at the top of the Shenzhen  blacklist eventually decided to seek sanctuary in Canada, he said.  </P> <P> Two more journalists wanted by Chinese authorities remain stranded in Hong  Kong, Cao said. After being questioned and released by Hong Kong officials last  week, they were told they have three months to find a country willing to grant  them permanent refuge, Cao said.  </P> <P> "Because none of the people we've tried to help have been able to get  permission to come to the United States, these two are discouraged about their  chances of finding refuge in this country," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> See Lack of U.S. Welcome  </P> <P> Cao said he and other pro-democracy supporters in the United States are getting  the impression that "the U.S. government does not welcome (Chinese dissidents)  because if they come, they will hurt Sino-U.S. relations." They said that the  United States seems to have drawn the line after offering sanctuary to Chinese  dissident Fang Lizhi at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware that our policy is any more stringent than France or Germany or  any other country," said a State Department official who spoke on the condition  that his name not be used. He said a person who has escaped China "is not in  danger of his life outside of China."  </P> <P> A State Department statement prepared Aug. 15 said that U.S. consular offices  worldwide have been instructed to review visa applications from Chinese  nationals "as compassionately as possible, but they must work within the  framework of existing immigration law," said department spokesman Adam Shub.  </P> <P> "Under the visa laws, there's a certain amount of discretion," said the State  Department official who asked not to be identified, adding that visa examiners  are all taking a more liberal view of when a visa applicant would return to  China.  </P> <P> He said that since the June crackdown in Beijing, U.S. officials have also  granted refugee status to an unspecified number of Chinese nationals who were  able to prove that they have a well-founded fear of government persecution.  </P> <P> He also noted that U.S. officials allowed top Chinese dissidents such as Wuer  Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi to visit this country earlier this month to attend a  pro-democracy conference in Chicago and to tour the country on a fund-raising  campaign. Wuer, Yan and four others were visiting from France, where they fled  after China began its manhunt. Wuer has been admitted by Harvard University as  an undergraduate this fall.  </P> <P> But for less famous exiled Chinese dissidents seeking visas to this country,  the criteria being used by U.S. officials pose a "Catch-22" situation.  </P> <P> For example, He Wei, a 26-year-old sought by Chinese authorities for his  protest activities and publication of the Hunger Strike Express news bulletin  in Beijing, said he fled to West Germany on a tourist visa and has been  rejected twice by U.S. officials in his application for a student visa.  </P> <P> Accepted as a student by Rutgers University in New Jersey, he said when he  applied for a student visa, U.S. officials in Bonn told him he had to prove  that he would return to China after his studies.  </P> <P> "Of course, he is not going to return," said Anne Goldstein, legal director of  the Washington-based International Human Rights Law Group, which is helping He  and other Chinese dissidents apply for permission to stay in or come to the  United States.  </P> <P> "If I go back, there's danger," said He, who spoke under an alias instead of  his real name.  </P> <P> He, who helped coordinate communications between pro-democracy leaders and the  public during the Beijing protests and has photographs proving his  participation, said he is reluctant to apply for political asylum in the United  States because that would affect his chances of ever going back to China to see  his family.  </P> <P> He said he prefers a student visa that would leave his options open. An  attorney friend from Hong Kong has already deposited $10,000 with Rutgers to  pay for his tuition, room and board. In Germany, unable to speak the language,  he feels stranded, he said.  </P> <P> Cai in Paris also faces a language problem. He wants to apply for admission to  a U.S. university but was told he missed the application period for entrance  this fall. So while he waits for another chance, he is studying English on his  own.  </P> <P> "Yes, English, not German," he said. "So you can see where I really want to  go."  </P></p>

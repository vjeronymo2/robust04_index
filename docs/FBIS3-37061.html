According to Yavlinskiy, in the current year the slump in  production will make up about 50% against 1989. In 1993  industrial investment was virtually nil, and the outflow of  foreign currency to the West totaled 15 billion dollars.    Analysing the complicated political situation in the  country,  Yavlinskiy said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya  (Independent) Gazeta that under the circumstances Russia's  government, no matter who leads it, is virtually in no position  to do anything constructive.    "Since the political crisis is bottomless, on the whole no  good can be expected from the present government," Yavlinskiy  said.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Urban policies blamed for smog The Labour party yesterday attacked the government's environmental and transport policies which it blamed for the rise at the weekend in pollution in towns and cities, James Blitz writes. As smog levels in several parts of the country, especially London, remained well above official guidelines Labour accused the government of pursuing urban policies which threatened health, particularly that of the elderly and children. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, said the government's transport policy was at the heart of the problem. He said that pollution could be reduced only by adopting three approaches: a shift in transport policy away from road building and towards public transport; a reduction in emissions from cars; and the setting of air quality targets for local authorities. Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said: 'There are differing views on what causes pollution. As soon as we get definitive advice, we will be in the right position to find a solution.' The rise in pollution levels has been aggravated by the hot weather. The lack of wind left a blanket of warm air over the capital, trapping high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons. In central London the ozone level hit 95 parts per billion at the weekend - the World Health Organisation recommends a maximum level of 70 ppb.</p>

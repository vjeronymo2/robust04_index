			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Thousands march in Pretoria TEN THOUSAND black South Africans yesterday marched peacefully on government buildings in Pretoria as business leaders and trade union officials continued efforts to defuse the country's political crisis. In what turned out to be a muted step in the 'mass action' campaign intended to force President FW de Klerk to give way to majority rule, several thousand demonstrators gathered in the grounds of Union Buildings, the government's administrative headquarters. Mr Sam Shilowa, assistant secretary general of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), handed over a memorandum on political demands and working conditions to a senior civil servant. But the modest turn-out and the low-key mood of the crowd will have disappointed the African National Congress (ANC) and Cosatu, the co-organisers. Their main efforts, however, are being directed towards a general strike, planned to begin on August 3. Representatives of the business community were last night continuing talks with Cosatu officials in an effort to revive the stalled negotiating process. The South African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour Affairs (Sacola), made up of 10 leading employers, is understood to have suggested that business and labour could jointly convene 'assemblies for peace, economic reconstruction and progress' on August 3. Cosatu would suspend plans for a week of disruption and civil disobedience. In return it would expect the government to implement a package of measures to curb political violence, and agree to hold elections for a constituent assembly by the end of the year. Mr Jay Naidoo, Cosatu general secretary, said the Sacola meetings were an attempt 'to break the political log-jam and get movement towards a political democracy'. Government thinking may be disclosed tomorrow when Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, addresses the UN security council in New York.</p>

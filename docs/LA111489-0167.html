			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'GHETTO' IS BEST LONDON PLAY  </P> <P> Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol's Holocaust drama "Ghetto" was named London's  Best Play of 1989 today at the annual Evening Standard Drama Awards.  </P> <P> "Ghetto," set in a Lithuanian ghetto in 1942, opened at London's  state-subsidized Royal National Theater April 27 to near-unanimous raves and  ran in repertory through Nov. 9. It had earlier flopped on Broadway, closing  after 33 performances. Narrated in flashback by a ghetto survivor, the play  tells of the last days of the theater troupe that flourished briefly in the  city's German-occupied Jewish ghetto in Vilna from January, 1942, onward. The  troupe was liquidated in September, 1943.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING DIFFERENCES ASIDE  </P> <P> Ventura County's five lawmakers say they strive to put aside personal and party  differences when decisions are being made to split up state funds for local  public works projects.  </P> <P> Lynn M. Suter, a capital lobbyist for the city of Ventura, agrees that the  "vast philosophical differences" among the county's three Republican and two  Democratic lawmakers "don't get in the way of the delegation responding to  local needs."  </P> <P> She cited a successful bipartisan effort in the past two years to pry loose a  $3.5-million package to rebuild the Ventura Pier -- severely damaged by storms  in 1986 -- over the objections of Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration.  </P> <P> "The pier funding would never have worked" unless the delegation had banded  together, Suter said. The delegation includes Sens. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) and  Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Assembly members Tom McClintock (R-Thousand  Oaks), Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley).  </P> <P> Hart, the area's senior lawmaker, who played a major role in the pier funding,  acknowledged "one thing that can work to a county's benefit is having people  from both parties" champion local issues.  </P> <P> McClintock agreed, noting that he lobbied Deukmejian to support the pier  funding. "The Republicans can intervene with the governor and the Democrats" in  both houses of the Democrat-controlled Legislature, he said.  </P> <P> Hart also cited cooperation among lawmakers to obtain state transportation  funds for projects such as the completion of the interchange of the Simi Valley  and Moorpark freeways.  </P> <P> Not all the efforts have revolved around construction projects. Suter has  organized delegation members to urge support for a $59,000 grant from the state  Department of Conservation to expand Ventura's residential recycling program.  Under the proposal, about 100 recycling containers would be placed at apartment  buildings, mobile home parks and condominium complexes.  </P> <P> Ventura County Supervisor Susan Lacey agreed that the lawmakers "seem to work  well" when local projects are at stake. But, she said, McClintock "has a  tendency to be less part of it" than the others.  </P> <P> McClintock has been embroiled in an ongoing public feud with the Board of  Supervisors, especially Supervisor Madge Schaefer, over the county's need for  money.  </P> <P> "It's a very liberal board, I'm a conservative legislator, and there's bound to  be friction on welfare spending, tax increases" and other issues, McClintock  said.  </P> <P> But Schaefer complained that McClintock "doesn't have a clue as to what is  happening in the county."  </P></p>

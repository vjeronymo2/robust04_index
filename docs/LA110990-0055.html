			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> It's Official: Jane Fonda and Ted Turner will wed, probably sometime in 1991,  according to a representative of the actress. The couple shopped at Tiffany in  Beverly Hills Tuesday and picked out a ring with an opal stone (her favorite)  flanked by two diamonds.  </P> <P> Turner will give Fonda the ring on her birthday, Dec. 21. The couple will  probably keep the ceremony small with just family and friends, and set the date  sometime after her son, Troy Hayden, graduates from high school next June. No  location for the wedding has been named. The two, who have been an item for  about a year, will probably maintain their commuter relationship after the  wedding; he has property in Montana and Georgia, she has property in Los  Angeles. This will be the third marriage for both; Fonda was married to French  film director Roger Vadim and politician Tom Hayden; Turner's former wives were  Judy Nye and Jane Shirley Smith.  </P> <P> Run, Don't Drive: Wanda Panfil said in Warsaw she likes running so much she  doesn't have a driver's license and will not get behind the wheel of the  Mercedes Benz she won in the New York City Marathon. Panfil, 31, said Wednesday  that she will "subordinate everything" to winning the world championship in  Tokyo next year. She won the New York race Sunday.  </P> <P> Run for Cover: There has been such a run on formal morning suits ahead of  Emperor Akihito's enthronement that Japan's protocol chiefs have had to strike  extra-tall and extra-short employees off their VIP-welcoming roster. So many  people have bought the long-tailed "penguin suits" for next week's festivities  that a Tokyo department store is completely out of non-standard sizes. Which  means officials are giving priority to "standard-size" people. Compiled by YEMI  TOURE  </P></p>

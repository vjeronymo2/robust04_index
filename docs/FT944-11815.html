			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / New lending tops Pounds 3bn New lending by the main British banks rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.22bn in the third quarter of 1994, from Pounds 983m in the second quarter, figures released yesterday by the British Bankers' Association show, Philip Coggan writes. The figures are compiled from monthly statistics, which the association has already published. They show that the main reason for the apparent rise in net lending was a fall in the level of repayments by the corporate sector during the second quarter. Lending to the personal sector rose by Pounds 1.78bn, or 1.3 per cent, (after allowing for special factors) in the third quarters. Credit card borrowing was one of the strongest elements, rising by Pounds 198m.</p>

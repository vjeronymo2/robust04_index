			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petukhov and Andrey Ryabov, under </F> rubric "Hypothesis": "Game of Duckpins as a Form of Political  Mobilization"]    [Text] Which of the currents of political ideology  will dominate on the Russian political Olympus? Discussions  about whether the radical reformers will return to their  first-place roles in the government, or whether they have  definitely yielded the initiative to the moderate conservatives,  or perhaps even to the more "drastic" national-patriotic  opposition, are not professional exercises engaged in by  political experts and journalists, but the completely normal  reaction to the indefiniteness and instability of the current  political situation in Russia.    Forecasting the chances of success by various parties or  movements is more purposeful if one relies not upon conjectural  findings, but on the analysis of the state of the Russians'  public awareness and those priorities toward which that  awareness is gravitating. Definite food for thought on this  subject is provided by the results of a comprehensive  sociological study conducted by the Russian Independent  Institute of Social and National Problems in February-March 1994  (a total of 1700 respondents in 10 regions of the country were  polled).    Most of the persons polled (55.7 percent) state that they  are  in favor of a socially oriented market economy ("the state must  guarantee all citizens a social minimum, and whoever wants to  get more must attempt to do so himself"). For purposes of  comparison: the ultraliberal economic model ("the state must not  interfere in the life of the citizens; each individual must  count only on himself") and the more moderate version of the  same liberal model ("the state must help only the weak and  helpless") are supported, respectively, by 4.2 percent and 13.0  percent of the respondents. A total of 22.4 percent of those  polled give their preference to the orthodox communist system of  social equalization. Most Russians unambiguously link their  hopes of the arising of a new socioeconomic model with the  development of entrepreneurship (all told, 63.8 percent of the  respondents asserted that they would like personally to engage  in that type of activity).    Having defined themselves with respect to socioeconomic  policy, Russians demonstrate a high degree of mistrust in the  authority. This, in particular, manifested itself clearly when  they answered the question of what today represents the greatest  danger to Russia. A total of 53.9 percent mentioned the increase  in crime; 42.8 percent, the impoverishment of the population;  39.4 percent, the impotence of the political authority; and 24.4  percent, unemployment. In other words, most Russians do not  believe in the ability of the political establishment to  guarantee an acceptable level of social and economic stability  in the country or to resolve effectively the tasks that only the  state can and must resolve, and therefore they are counting only  on their own strengths.    At the same time, when evaluating their personal prospects,  55.2 percent of the respondents remarked that their life in the  near future will improve or, if worse comes to worst, will  remain unchanged. The fairly high indicator of "personal  optimism" reflects the population's ability to adapt to the  complicated conditions of the current transitional period.    Yet another sign of the Russians' distrust of authority is  the low rating of the political leaders. G. Yavlinskiy received  the support of 23.5 percent of the respondents; B. Yeltsin,  17.2; Ye. Gaydar, 16.7; V. Zhirinovskiy, 9.2; G. Zyuganov, 8.8;  S. Shakhray, 6.7; V. Chernomyrdin, 5.9; and A. Rutskoy, 2.2  percent. Incidentally, it is completely possible to link G.  Yavlinskiy's relative success with the preponderance of the  votes in favor of a socially oriented market economy, because  the image of that politician, who proclaimed the slogan "a  different reform" is linked by the mass consciousness with his  adherence specifically to that path of development. But  nevertheless the number of percentage points garnered by the  leader of the Yabloko [Apple] block is obviously insufficient  for him to lay claim to the role of the expresser of the will of  the majority of the population.    After becoming acquainted with the figures that have been  given, it might seem to certain people that Russians have  completely lost their interest in politics, and therefore, for  the political leaders in the current situation, it does not make  any sense to seek a magic formula for success. However, this is  definitely not so. In the opinion of 66.2 percent of those  polled, there must exist in the country some kind of commonly  held idea that is capable of uniting all segments of society --  the entrepreneurs, workers, intellectuals, the military, and  rural inhabitants. The results of the study do not make it  possible with sufficient accuracy to understand exactly what  that idea is. The range of opinions is extremely broad: 20.8  percent of the respondents feel that the democratic forces are  capable of providing a better future for the country; 18.0  percent put their hopes on receiving aid from the West; and 11.5  percent, to one degree or another, are counting on the positive  role of the Orthodox church. Nevertheless one is struck by the  fact that, all told, more than half those polled (56.6 percent)  expressed their sympathies with various public forces and the  traditionalist-state orientation.    Summing up what has been stated, we take the risk of  hypothesizing that in the mass consciousness there is a growing  need to have a new social force or leader emerge on the  political scene, a force or leader capable of combining in their  activity the ideas of a socially oriented market with adherence  to traditionalist political and spiritual values.    It would seem that, among the current Russian parties and  movements, there are a rather large number of people who openly  declare their "neoconservatism." Nevertheless, their loud and  promising political declarations are not finding the proper  support among Russians. The reason for this is the fact that all  of them, in one way or another, are linked with the present  political establishment, which is responsible, in the  population's opinion, for the current woeful state of the  country. Therefore, in order to lay claim to the role of a truly  influential political force of the neoconservative persuasion,  simply the adherence to an ideology that integrates the slogans  of market social liberalism and spiritual-political conservatism  is obviously insufficient. A leader who attempts to occupy a  particular political niche will have to appear in the public's  opinion as -- in the full sense of the word -- a new person in  Russian politics. In addition, Russians are completely fed up  with verbose discussions of ways to bring the country out of its  crisis, and they currently are inclined, to a much greater  degree than previously, to believe populist promises (we might  recall, for example, the recent successes of V. Zhirinovskiy,  who currently has already lost a considerable part of his  previous popularity because of his unproductive position in the  State Duma). Proceeding from this point, one can assume that the  leader or party that lays claim to success, while differing only  slightly on the basis of world-view position from the views  expressed by the current moderate conservatives -- from PRES to  DPR -- will attempt to achieve mass support with the aid of  slogans that are simple and easy for the rank-and-file voter to  understand, while also using untraditional forms of political  mobilization. The example of the headlong ascent of S.  Berlusconi to the political Olympus in Italy, a country which,  throughout the entire twentieth century had seemingly  anticipated the changing of the political climate on the  European continent, apparently should be viewed as a symptom of  these kinds of changes. The catchy motto "Fozze, Italia!  ("Forward, Italy!), plus the organizing of an election campaign  modeled on clubs made up of fans of the Milan soccer team that  is loved by millions of Italians, in addition to the criticism  of the First Republic elite that had discredited itself -- those  are the basic components of the successful debut of the  telecommunications king from the Apennines in the big political  games. And, incidentally, talking about criticism. According to  our research, the largest number of people polled assume that  the following are to blame for Russia's current misfortunes:  Communists (34.1 percent); the nomenklatura (26.1  percent); and the Mafia (20.0 percent). Thus, it is not  difficult to predict the "critical component" in the program of  the Russian Berlusconi. What might be the basis at such time of  the untraditional political mobilization -- a game of duckpins,  societies of amateur orchard growers or worshippers of the  intoxicating amber beverage, people's walks -- remains only a  guess. To those, however, who will rush to reproach us for  overlooking the possibility that Russian neoconservatism will  become fascist, we might note that, all told, only 23.2 percent  of the respondents are inclined to see in our current mess the  results of intrigues by various "dark forces" -- American  imperialism, the Masons, international financial circles, etc.  And more than half the people polled (52.2 percent) assume that  Russians are the same nation as the other nations of the Russian  Federation and should not play any special role.</p>

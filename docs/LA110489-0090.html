			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN FORD CLYMER, 82; WESTERN ARTIST AND ILLUSTRATOR  </P> <P> Western artist John Ford Clymer, who painted nearly 100 covers for the Saturday  Evening Post and commanded five-figure prices for his sweeping historic scenes,  has died in Bellevue, Wash. He was 82.  </P> <P> Clymer, who lived for many years in Wyoming, died Thursday after a long  illness.  </P> <P> Born in Ellensburg, Wash., on Jan. 29, 1907, the popular painter studied at the  Vancouver School of Art, the Ontario College of Art, the Wilmington Academy of  Art and the Grand Central School of Art.  </P> <P> For 40 years, he was a successful commercial artist, illustrating stories for  numerous magazines in Canada and the United States. He painted the Post covers  between 1942 and 1963.  </P> <P> From that time until his death, Clymer devoted himself to painting North  American game animals and historic scenes of the American West. He had his  first one-man show in 1964 in New York.  </P> <P> Clymer, whose works were favorites at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in  Oklahoma City, and at the annual Cowboy Artists of America show in Phoenix, was  known for painstaking historical research, including visits to the location of  each of his scenes.  </P> <P> In 1978, when Clymer was in his 70s, 282 people took part in a drawing at the  Phoenix show for the privilege of paying $30,000 for his "Water, Water --  Overland Astorians 1811," a 30-by-40-inch oil painting of an expedition  financed by John Jacob Astor. The only other painting Clymer did that year was  snapped up for $25,000.  </P> <P> In 1979, Clymer's "Roast Rabbit" was sold in the Phoenix drawing for $40,000,  only to be resold a few minutes later to a losing bidder who paid the winner  $55,000.  </P> <P> Clymer received the Franklin Mint Gold Medal for Western Art in 1973 and the  Gold Medal in Oil from the National Academy of Western Art in 1974. He was  named to the New York Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1982, and was  featured on the PBS program "Profiles in American Art" in 1984.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Doris, of Teton Village, Wyo.; his son, David; his  daughter, Jo Lorraine Tatum, and five grandchildren.  </P></p>

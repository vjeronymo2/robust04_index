A simultaneous investigation of all zones and scenes of  crime--stations, markets, hotels, warehouses, and parking  lots--was carried out for the first time. A 500-strong  motorized infantry regiment of internal troops and a 300-strong  motorized militia detachment were involved in the operation.  Checks and controls on railroads and highways leading to  Moscow, Pskov, Novgorod, and Murmansk were stepped up. People  worked 12-hour shifts without leave during the operation.    The results in brief are that more than 3,500 crimes were  detected, including 43 murders, around 300 robberies, and more  than 200 thefts and cases of taking away of vehicles. A huge  number of firearms and edged weapons, around 40 kg of drugs, and  money and valuables worth 718 million rubles and $29,000 were  seized from criminals. The level of crime halved in St  Petersburg City and oblast during the two weeks of the operation.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strikes plunge plantations into crisis LABOUR UNREST in Kerala, Southern India, has plunged rubber, tea, and coffee plantations in the area into a crisis, with frequent strikes causing heavy production losses. Talks between Mr N. Ramakrishna, the state labour minister, and trade union leaders of the Plantation Labour Committee have failed, with the committee putting forward further demands and the government unwilling to revise wages, saying that losses had already been suffered as a result of wage increases worth Rs1m (Pounds 350,000) a year acceded to in February. A single day's token strike by plantation workers agitating for increased wages and cost of living allowances last week, resulted in production losses of 300,000 kg of tea, and 150,000 kg of rubber, besides a loss of 450,000 working days and Rs17.8m of revenue. The Kerala state government lost Rs1.1m by way of sales tax in a single day. The plantation industry, Kerala's largest, employs 450,000 workers.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Tenant safeguard measures urged Tenants should have greater protection from eviction, the Law Commission said yesterday. The proposal was among a number of suggestions for reform of the law on termination on tenancies put forward by the government's law reform body. The commission said the 'complex, confused and defective' law needed urgent reform. Parts of the law date back 150 years. It recommends that a landlord should not be allowed to take a property back without a court order or the tenant's agreement if the tenant is in default for non-payment of rent or for breach of some other obligation in a lease. Landlords have the right in some cases now simply to repossess the property  -a right of 'peaceable re-entry' described by a law lord recently as 'dangerous'. The commission also proposes that courts should be able to give tenants the chance to save their tenancies by taking appropriate remedial action, and that there should be a single set of rules governing the landlord's right of forfeiture. At the moment there are different rules depending on whether forfeiture is as a result of non-payment of rent or other defaults. The commission recommends that a landlord should be required to give preliminary notice of forfeiture only when a tenant has failed to comply with an obligation to repair the property. Landlords would lose the right of forfeiture only if, knowing the facts, they behaved in a way which would lead a reasonable tenant to believe they did not intend to end the lease. At present a landlord can lose the right by merely sending a rent demand. These reforms, which would apply to all types of leases were first put forward by the commission in 1985. They have been re-submitted together with a draft bill. Termination of Tenancies Bill, Law Com No 221, HC 135. HMSO. Pounds 15.10.</p>

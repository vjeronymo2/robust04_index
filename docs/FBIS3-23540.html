			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Major-General V. Rudik, chief of the Civilian Defense </F> Workers Directorate, interviewed by Colonel Anatoliy Yurkin  (res): "Urgent Topic: Civilian Personnel of Russian Federation  Armed Forces--Wages and Social Protection"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Minister's  Order No. 130, "On Introducing New Wage Terms for Civilian  Personnel of Troop Units, Institutions, Military Educational  Institutions, and Budget-Financed Enterprises and Organizations  of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense on the Basis of a  Uniform Wage Scale [UWS]," significantly improves social  protection for civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces  and is becoming a tangible incentive.    Major-General V. Rudik, chief of the Civilian Personnel  Labor and Wages Directorate of the Russian Federation Armed  Forces, tells about the procedure for introducing the new wage  terms based on the Uniform Wage Scale (UWS) and the tasks  involved in accomplishing this important work.    [Yurkin] The introduction of new wage terms affects the  vital  interests of employees of the entire national-economic budget  sphere and the civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces.  However, before talking about the innovations, Viktor  Antonovich, it seems that we should first discuss, if only  briefly, the background of this issue. Many ask why the  introduction of the UWS was necessary and whether it is in  keeping with the Russian Federation Labor Law Code.    [Rudik] Let's start from the beginning: The socioeconomic  situation that obtained at the end of last year caused a sharp  change in traditional wage policy. A significant wage gap arose  between the production and nonproduction spheres.    After prices were liberalized, members of certain branches  (miners, air-traffic controllers) used various methods to obtain  appreciable advantages, causing even greater tension in society.  The question of social justice and compliance with the  requirements of Article Two of the Russian Federation Labor Law  Code arose with special urgency. Let me remind you what that  article says: "Every worker has the right to equal compensation  for equal work, without any discrimination and not below the  legally prescribed minimum amount." This in turn led to Russian  Federation government Decree No. 785, whose purpose is to  regulate wage rates for various branches and to establish  substantiated wage ratios for workers depending on complexity  and skill levels and based on the use of the UWS.    Just what is the UWS? It is a uniform scale of wage rates  and  grade-based wages for workers and office employees. It  encompasses all budget sphere workers and provides for wage  differentiation among 18 grades. The wage scale for workers has  eight grades. In contrast to analogous workers in the national  economy, the Russian Federation government decree sets increases  in wage rates of up to 50 percent for categories of civilian  personnel and for various types of work, as well as a schedule  of additional payments, compensation payments, and wage and  salary raises linked to the particular features of military  units' activities.    [Yurkin] Who has been given advantages in terms of the  amounts of wage and salary increases? Won't workers' rights be  infringed upon?    [Rudik] No, they will not. The wage rates (including the  increases of up to 50 percent) have been increased first and  foremost for workers, who had no grounds to complain about their  pay earlier. This applies to toolmakers, a wide range of machine  tool operators, and tool-setters who work with unique equipment.  This category also includes loggers, divers, topographers and  geodesists, district power grid specialists, and several others.    The maximum wage increase of 50 percent is being introduced  for all UWS grade one workers, as well as for certain categories  of physicians and middle- and junior-level medical personnel.  Wage rates are being increased by 40 percent for all workers on  whom UWS grade two is conferred, such as drivers, road and  railroad repairmen, utility repairmen, and workers who  specialize in construction repairs. I could continue this list,  but the point of the changes lies in that the differentiated  wage increases were also prompted by an adverse personnel  situation. For example, certain garrisons in the Fear East and  the Transbaykal region in effect have no workers to operate  their utility systems. For this reason, the introduction of the  UWS provides wage increases for workers that are more  substantial, and in a number of cases higher, than those for  degree-holding specialists, such as engineers, economists, and  even directors of structural divisions.    [Yurkin] Many readers might immediately ask about the  procedure that will be used to confer grades on workers. Who  will do this?    [Rudik] That is a rather complex question, but I will give  an  intelligible answer to it. First of all, enterprise and  organization workers whose pay was based on hourly wage rates  will be subject to the previous procedure for conferring grades  one through eight, which conform to the UWS wage categories. The  Russian defense minister's order directs that skill categories  are to be conferred on workers who did not have them previously.  For example, guards, office cleaning women, film projectionists,  and park landscapers. This also applies to boiler operators and  dry cleaning and laundry workers. Military units also have other  worker occupations for which a specific wage category is not  conferred but rather set by the commanding officer. He takes  into account the difficulty, service norms, and other parameters  of the job in question.    Grades nine and 10 can be set for highly skilled workers  employed in important and responsible jobs. I should point out  that this norm should not be viewed as a chance to establish  wage rates for worker occupations in grades nine and 10, but  only as a chance to pay them wages based on the rates set for  these grades. These wages need not necessarily be of a permanent  character.    The introduction of the UWS does not require that workers be  assigned new wage categories, as a rule. They are simply given  the new wage in keeping with the grade already conferred on them  or set for them by the commanding officer, and an entry is made  to this effect in their labor record booklets.    Military unit commanders are also permitted to introduce  labor organization and wage methods and systems (temporary,  piece-rate, brigade, etc.) when concluding collective contracts  within the scope of the confirmed wage fund.    [Yurkin] Let's hope, Viktor Antonovich, that the gist of  your  explanations will be clear to workers reading this. The  important thing is that they are going to start earning more  money by exhibiting diligence and discipline. Will the social  rights of directors and specialists and of our intelligentsia be  safeguarded just as thoroughly?    [Rudik] I see no reason for concern, since wage procedures  and terms for that category of civilian personnel of the Russian  Armed Forces have been set for all budget branches, regardless  of place of work. For example, economists will have wage scales  in the range of grades six through 11, chief specialists, 13  through 17, and office managers, four and five. In view of the  heightened social responsibility and the creative character of  the work of employees in public education, higher education,  public health, and science, their wage rates have been set at  one to four grades higher than those for general specialists.  For example, while engineers in various specialties have wage  rates at grades six through 11, teachers and doctors will have  wage rates at grades seven through 14 and grades eight through  15, respectively.    For many specialist positions, skill requirements entail  dual  grades within the framework of the corresponding category. For  example, a category-two production engineer comes under grades  nine and 10. This is due to rather significant differences in  the level of difficulty, diversity and importance of their  official duties. Taking this approach to setting grades for  military unit commanders (based on the decisions of  certification commissions) makes it possible to effectively  resolve wage rate issues in specific circumstances.    The wage rates for top officials and directors of  institutions, organizations, and enterprises fall within grades  nine through 18, as a rule. They are differentiated on the basis  of complexity of administrative functions and their social  responsibility. Salary rates for deputy directors and chief  accountants are set 10 to 20 percent, and for assistant  directors 30 to 40 percent, below the salary of the  corresponding director. The amount by which the salary is  reduced is set at any percentage from the minimum to the maximum  amount established for the deputy, assistant director, or chief  accountant. As in the case of specialists, wages for this  category will be based on the findings of special certification  procedures.    [Yurkin] What determines wage amounts for enterprise,  institution, and organization directors?    [Rudik] The group of the enterprise, institution, or  organization. Military units and formations, for example, are  divided into four groups. This division is a forced one. You  will agree that managing a corps and managing a division are by  no means one and the same thing. It is hardly fair if a  1,500-bed hospital pays the same wage as a hospital with just  200 beds. The criteria for assigning plants, arsenals, bases,  warehouses, repair shops, print shops, and a number of other  enterprises and organizations to the various groups are  performance indices in physical terms and the established number  of workers. When work-force tables are registered and audits and  checks are performed, a check is made to see that the director  has been assigned to the correct wage group.    [Yurkin] Will wage terms and, in particular, above-wage  amounts change with the introduction of the UWS?    [Rudik] In contrast to the national economy, the  introduction  of the UWS for civilian employees of the Russian Armed Forces  entails significant changes in this form of wages.    In shifting to the new wage terms based on the UWS, military  unit commanders are authorized, when concluding collective  contracts and within the scope of their approved wage funds, to  agree to salary raises, to set additional payments over and  above the wage rates, and to pay additional pay of a  compensation character. For the first time, additional pay has  been introduced for combat alert duty and for working in rural  areas.    The main types of additional pay of a compensation character  are provided to directors, specialists, and technical  performance personnel who know foreign languages and use them in  their daily work and to motor vehicle drivers with skill  ratings. The defense minister's order takes into account all  special features of the work of branch employees and categories  of civilian personnel and establishes various types of salary  raises and additional pay.    In my opinion, the new system for paying percentage-based  increases for uninterrupted service merits special attention.    [Yurkin] Needless to say, we are dealing with an urgent  problem that concerns a lot of people. Could you spell out what  the innovations being introduced will basically mean, so that  readers of our journal who work in military units and at  Ministry of Defense organizations and enterprises can quickly  calculate their wages?    [Rudik] Let me begin with the most important point: The  amount of the percentage-based additional pay for uninterrupted  service has been substantially increased and is now equal to  that of an officer for years of service. This innovation was  introduced in order to stabilize cadres and to give civilian  personnel a greater material incentive to amass uninterrupted  work time in military units and to increase their wages. The  following additional pay for uninterrupted service, as a  percentage of the wage rate for basic occupation, has been  established: more than one year, five percent; more than two  years, 10 percent; more than three years, 15 percent; more than  five years, 20 percent; more than 10 years, 25 percent; more  than 15 years, 30 percent; and more than 20 years, 40 percent.  It should now be easy to make the calculations with a pencil.    The procedure for calculating length of uninterrupted  service  for servicemen who have been discharged into the reserves or  have retired on account of age, sickness, personnel cutbacks, or  health limitations has been changed, and rightly so. Their total  length of uninterrupted service conferring the right to receive  percentage-based additional pay for such service now includes  their entire period of military service. True, on one condition:  That they began working in the military unit within one year of  the date of discharge from military service, and, with respect  to employees discharged on account of disability, excluding the  time of a group one or group two disability. This period used to  be six months.    The question of including military service in the Armed  Forces of the states that used to be former Soviet union  republics has also been solved in a positive fashion, provided  that the person began working in the military unit within one  year of the date on which he was discharged into the reserves or  retired on those same grounds. Given current migration  processes, this measure will undoubtedly help many people make  important decisions about their future, relying on the help of  the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense.    [Yurkin] The social orientation of many Russian Federation  laws relating to our Armed Forces is clear. Does the  introduction of the UWS give broader rights to unit commanders  in providing incentives for conscientious service?    [Rudik] The rights of commanders are undoubtedly broadened.  With the consent of elective trade union agencies, each year  military unit commanders approve a material incentive and  material assistance fund in an amount of up to six monthly wage  funds (based on a one-year period). How will this money be used?  First and foremost, to pay bonuses for basic performance on a  monthly and quarterly basis and to make additional incentive  payments. For example, for completing especially important,  urgent tasks and to reward employees for annual performance  results--the so-called 13th paycheck.    The following provision is also new: Monies in this fund may  be used to reimburse workers for meals and the cost of commuting  on urban public transport and to make other payments of a social  character stipulated in a collective contract. The latter is the  legal foundation regulating all material incentive matters.  Bonuses, additional pay, rewards, and material assistance paid  to an individual employee are not limited by any maximum  ceilings; however, total payments to all workers in the course  of one year must not exceed six monthly wage funds (based on a  one-year period). Money saved from monthly wage funds may not be  used for these purposes.    [Yurkin] Viktor Antonovich, let me make a proposal: Let's  look at incentive factors on a somewhat different plane. You  will agree that it's one thing to live and work in Russia's  central regions, and quite another in Siberia and the Far North.  Are any compensation measures provided for Northerners,  Siberians, Far Easterners, and people in the Transbaykal region?    [Rudik] I can assure you that the approach to setting  regional coefficients, the subject of your question, has been  fundamentally changed. Everyone was fed up with the  discrepancies that existed earlier. For example, a 1.30  coefficient was set for military units in Nizhneilimskiy and  Bratsk Rayons, Irkutsk Province, but a 1.40 coefficient for  loggers. This sort of social discrimination against civilian  personnel of the Russian Armed Forces was also to be observed in  Okhotsk District, Khabarovsk Kray. These discrepancies have now  been eliminated.    The Ministry of Defense has been authorized to apply  regional  coefficients to the wages of civilian personnel within the scope  of the coefficients set for a corresponding region, including  those set by local agencies. For this reason, Order No. 130 of  the Russian Federation defense minister establishes uniform  regional coefficients for civilian personnel of military units,  institutions, enterprises, and organizations in the  corresponding regions.    The introduction of the UWS entails a shift to the  interbranch wage organization principle. This means that in  fields of Defense Ministry activity, equal pay for equal work is  being introduced for employees in equivalent occupations. At the  same time, special features of the work of employees in various  branches are taken into account in setting wage terms. This is  reflected in defense minister Order No. 130 that I mentioned.    [Yurkin] If we are going to discuss special wage  arrangements, I suggest that we start with military educational  institutions.    [Rudik] This section of the order deals with wage terms not  only for higher educational establishment employees, but also  for employees of general-education institutions, such as  schools, kindergartens, and extracurricular and military  educational establishments.    For professor and instructor positions, skill requirements  call for experience in research, research-and-teaching, or  practical work, which must be reflected in the employee's labor  record booklet.    The procedure for paying for teaching work over and above  established workload norms (including when an employee is  substituting for an instructor who is temporarily absent) has  been changed. An employee may hold a second job at up to 50  percent time, in either his own or another department, it makes  no difference. On the whole, the innovations will result in a  increase 3-4 times for the salaries for educators in comparison  with November 1992, and increase of 3.5-5 times for educational  institution directors.    We also have another category of civilian employees whose  wages have prompted many questions. It is medical and pharmacy  employees. There will be no special certifications in  introducing the new wage terms. Under the wage scale system,  their pay grades will be based on the position they hold, the  skill category conferred on them, whether they hold any academic  ranks or honorary titles, and their place of work.    Physician specialists at rest and relaxation facilities,  preventive-care facilities, boarding houses, tourist centers,  sports schools and facilities, general-education schools, and  preschool and extracurricular institutions will be assigned to  UWS wage grade nine, regardless of their skill categories.    Medical and pharmacy employees who manage their departments  and are candidates of sciences; physicians who serve as chairmen  of military physician commissions and medical flight  commissions; directors of military medical institutions who have  a skill category; and physicians who have the honorary title  "Meritorious Physician" are to be assigned a pay grade that is  one grade higher than that of persons who do not have these  distinctions. I repeat: only one grade higher, not two grades,  one for being a manager and one for the honorary title.    [Yurkin] Are there no exceptions?    [Rudik] The rule is this: People who are entitled to  increase  their pay grades by one or two grades on the basis of several  factors may take one pay grade increase based on the most  compelling grounds. And now as regards exceptions: The UWS pay  grades may be raised by two grades for physicians and for  certified pharmacists who manage their military medical  institutions and who have the highest skill rating, and for  doctors of science and physicians who hold the honorary title  "People's Physician."    I should also call attention to the following features:  Military hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as out-patient  polyclinics that include diagnostic centers, have been raised to  the next highest grade with respect to wages for their  directors. In addition, in contrast to the previous procedure,  salaries for civilian personnel who work in hazardous and  especially difficult conditions are being raised not only for  employees of military medical institutions, but also for  employees who are enlisted to provide consultation, medical  care, and other services. The salary increases for these  employees are based on the actual amount of time they work under  the aforementioned conditions.    [Yurkin] How will wages for cultural workers change? In the  library, Margarita Petrovna complained to me that she had worked  her entire life for 120 rubles.    [Rudik] Now the situation has changed. The salary paid to a  library director before the introduction of the UWS has been  increased by 293 percent. For a librarian without a skill  rating, the salary has been increased by 182 percent. But that's  not all: Directors of cultural organizations, institutions, and  enterprises are given the right, in concluding collective  contracts, to include commitments--over and above those  stipulated in the overall wage terms--to raise salaries for arts  workers who hold the honorary titles "People's Artist" and  "Meritorious Artist." Rank and file workers have not been  overlooked either. For example, salaries may be increased for  cinema mechanics, library workers, and other specialists at  cultural-education institutions in rural areas.    [Yurkin] Significant changes have been made in the wage  system for sailors, hydrographers, divers, and command personnel  on Russian Navy support ships. Will this be an incentive in  their work?    [Rudik] I think it will. The international classification of  command personnel positions was used in devising the skill  requirements. For example, captain is followed by the position  of senior (chief) mechanic, and the position of second mechanic  is equivalent in pay to the position of senior captain's  assistant. This was done not by lowering the pay grades for  captains' assistants, but by raising the pay grades for the  mechanics.    The positions of other support ship crew members have been  standardized.    Substantial changes have been made in wages for divers.  Instead of three specialization groups, divers have been  assigned pay grades four through eight, with grade eight  reserved solely for Defense Ministry divers. Additional pay for  skill ratings have been maintained for them. For the first time,  the question of wages for nonstaff divers on sea (roadstead)  ships for time spent working underwater has been resolved.    [Yurkin] There is one other category of Russian Armed Forces  civilian personnel that we have not touched on--employees of  district, fleet, and army staffs. Please explain how they will  be paid.    [Rudik] The UWS wage principles do not extend to state  administrative agencies. Wage terms for these employees will be  set forth in the Russian Federation Law "On State Service." In  the meantime, the decree of the Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet and Government "On Regulating Wages for Employees of  Representative and Executive Government Agencies" is in effect,  together with the Russian defense minister's Order No. 129 of  March 8 of this year.    The provisions of defense minister Order No. 130 apply fully  to the civilian employees of military administrative agencies as  concerns the procedure for calculating and confirming wage  funds, providing percentage-based additional pay for  uninterrupted service and regional coefficients, and providing  material incentives to such employees; up to six monthly wage  funds (based on a one-year period) may be used for these  purposes.    Now that I have described the special features of wages for  various categories of civilian personnel of the Russian Armed  Forces, I consider it necessary to call attention to the  certification of directors, specialists, and technical execution  personnel for the purpose of making sure that the employee is  qualified for the position he holds and determining his wage  grade in accordance with the UWS. This certification is quite  different from previous ones and is designed to ensure effective  measures to improve these employees' material situations and to  reinforce their wages' incentive role, based on social justice  principles.    I want to emphasize that certification will be required for  all directors, specialists, and technical execution personnel  (including those working on a part-time basis) of military  units, institutions, military educational establishments,  enterprises, and organizations, with the exception of medical  and pharmacy employees. For them, the wage grades will be set on  the basis of the previous (1991) certification's results. The  job of introducing UWS wages will be overseen by the unit  commander. At the commander's discretion, the mostly highly  qualified employees of financial agencies, labor agencies, and  personnel departments, economists, and other specialists may be  enlisted in it.    In view of the special characteristics of this time and  constantly rising inflation, which is aggravating social tension  in certain labor collectives, we are pinning special hopes on  smooth and efficient work by commanders and specialists of  financial agencies and labor and wage agencies who are best  qualified to introduce the new UWS wage terms. It is our common  duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the civilian  personnel of the Russian Armed Forces receive their newly  recalculated wages in the shortest possible time.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following are summaries of all substantive oral and written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's responses to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Louisiana program (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.03).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded on June 10, 1994, that the proposed revisions were satisfactory (administrative record No. La&hyph;348.04).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on June 14, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.05).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Forest Service responded on June 15, 1994, that, after consulting the forest administrators in Louisiana, it had no comments (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.06).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) responded on June 20, 1994, that (1) it concurred with the number of trees required for successful revegetation of mined forest land, (2) it recommended a ground cover of at least 75 percent to prevent unacceptable levels of soil erosion, and (3) all gullies should be repaired and revegetated prior to final bond release (administrative record No. 348.08).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS comment concurring with the number of trees required to demonstrate revegetation success, as discussed in finding No. 1.a, the Director is approving the standard for the tree stocking rate proposed by Louisiana at LSMR 53123.B.4.a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS comment concerning a recommended ground cover of 75 percent, as discussed in finding No. 1.a, Louisiana's requirement at LSMR 53123.B.4.a for 70 percent ground cover was previously approved by OSM and is a minimum standard. The Federal regulations of 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(iii) and 817.116(b)(3)(iii) require, for areas to be developed for forestry, that vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to achieve the approved postmining land use. Louisiana, at LSMR 531117.A.4 (which is applicable to revegetation on land reclaimed for any land use), requires that a vegetative cover be established that is capable for stabilizing the soil surface from erosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LSMR 53117.A.4 is substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111(a)(4) and 817.111(a)(4). In addition, Louisiana requires at LSMR 53121.A that suitable mulch and other soil stabilizing practices shall be used on all regraded and topsoiled areas to control erosion, promote germination of seeds, or increase the moisture content of the soil. LSMR 53121.A is no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.114 and 817.114. Louisiana's standard for ground cover at LSMR 53123.B.4.a, in conjunction with the requirements at LSMR 53117.A.4 and 53121.A, is consistent with and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(iii) and 817.116(b)(3)(iii). Therefore, the Director is not requiring that Louisiana revise the standard for ground cover on areas to be developed for forestry at LSMR 53123.B.4.a in response to this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS comment that gullies should be repaired and revegetated prior to final bond release, Louisiana's program at LSMR 53115 requires that (1) when rills and gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regarded and topsoiled, the rills and gullies shall be filled, graded, or otherwise stabilized and the area reseeded or replanted according to the requirements of LSMR 53117 through 53123, and (2) rills or gullies of lesser size be stabilized and the area reseeded or replanted if the rills or gullies are disruptive to the approved postmining land use or may result in additional erosion and sedimentation. Therefore, because Louisiana's approved program addresses the repair and revegetation of gullies, the Director is not requiring that Louisiana revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a in response to this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded on June 21, 1994, that it had no objection to the proposed amendment (administrative record No. 348.07).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the revisions that Louisiana proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Treuhand poised to boost German paper market THE FLEDGLING German commercial paper market is to receive an important boost from the Treuhand, the state-backed agency responsible for privatising east German companies, through plans for a large borrowing programme to finance restructuring investments. The Treuhand is today expected to announce a commercial paper programme, arranged by Dresdner Bank, of up to DM2bn (Pounds 600m), making it the largest programme of its kind since the market began to take shape earlier this year. If the issue runs smoothly, the Treuhand may test the market again to cover more of its DM25bn borrowing limit for 1991. Some Treuhand officials have speculated that the organisation will make use of commercial paper, among other instruments, gradually to take over up to DM70bn of the DM100bn in old debts that the corporate sector in former east Germany is still theoretically carrying. The Treuhand is already paying interest to the Bundesbank on those debts and some analysts believe that it would be better to centralise the debt under one roof. The Bonn finance ministry admits that much of the corporate debt will not be repaid but it officially prefers a case-by-case policy on debt forgiveness. The commercial paper market is only available to the best risk borrowers who then acquire relatively favourable terms. The Treuhand can exploit its semi-government status to save money on its extensive borrowing needs. The maturity of the first issue is expected to be one year. The Treuhand declined to comment yesterday on when, if at all, it intended to tap the commercial paper market, but finance ministry officials confirmed that such a move, rumoured for some time, was now imminent. The move is likely to be welcomed in Frankfurt where financiers will be keen to see the commercial paper market given some ballast. German companies have long complained of restricted financing options in their home market and the shortage has forced them to turn to the Euromarkets. Commercial paper only became possible in Germany earlier this year when the Bundesbank withdrew its previous objections, finance ministry permission for such issues was no longer required, and the turnover tax on securities was abolished. Since then, the biggest issue announced, although not yet completed, was a DM500m programme for Daimler Benz arranged by Deutsche Bank. Daimler already has a commercial paper programme in Dutch guilders and in dollars.</p>

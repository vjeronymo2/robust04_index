			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Economic weakness in US to continue THE US economy is likely to remain weak in the run-up to November's presidential election, another batch of disappointing figures indicated yesterday. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely-watched gauge of conditions in manufacturing - fell to 53.7 per cent last month, against 54.2 per cent in July. The official index of leading indicators rose only 0.1 per cent in July, a smaller increase than would be expected in a robust recovery. Construction spending, meanwhile, fell 0.6 per cent, its second consecutive monthly decline. The Purchasing Managers' Index remains above the 50 per cent threshold that indicates an expanding manufacturing sector, but has failed to gain momentum since the spring and is no higher today than a year ago. Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said the economy continued to grow last month but 'lacked a strong upward momentum'. He said, however, that a component of the overall index measuring new orders had remained steady at 59.8 per cent, a relatively high reading. This suggested growth would continue in coming months. The index of leading indicators pointed to a flat economy. Five of the 11 indicators - led by building permits - contributed positively while five dragged it lower. One indicator, the average work week, was statistically unchanged. The small rise in the index failed to offset a 0.3 per cent decline in June, leaving doubts about the pace of growth in coming months. Yesterday's indicators are the latest in a line of poor figures. This week the Commerce Department reported an unexpected 2.6 per cent decline in new home sales in July. This followed reports of falling consumer confidence and sales of durable goods in July.</p>

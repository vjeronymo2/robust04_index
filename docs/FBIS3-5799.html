The March 22-23 talks will follow a  meeting from March 16 that will focus on calculating the foreign  share in the Japanese semiconductor market for the  October-December quarter last year, said an official at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    Under a 1991 trade pact, Japan and the United States agreed  to a 20 percent goal for foreign market share by the end of  1992. In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign market share  exceeded the goal, reaching 20.2 percent under a U.S. formula.    According to the U.S. formula, the foreign share since has  been in a downward trend, standing at 18.1 percent for the  July-September quarter last year. Under a separate Japanese  accounting method, which includes chips manufactured in Japan by  foreign companies for their own use, the foreign share had risen  above the 20 percent level for three successive quarters from  the final quarter of 1992, but fell to 19.7 percent in the  July-September quarter last year.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said he is  concerned about the decline and insisted that Tokyo is not  abiding by the bilateral trade agreement. It is viewed by the  United States as a commitment but as a nonbinding target by  Japan.</p>

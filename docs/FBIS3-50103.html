			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with yesterday's massacre of six  Sarajevo children in the Ali-Pasino Polje district, Ejup Ganic,  a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent a letter  to U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The letter reads: Yesterday afternoon shells fired from Serb  positions killed six children playing in the snow in front of  their houses in Sarajevo. Several other children were seriously  wounded, and doctors are still fighting for their lives. Horror  of this kind has been going on for 22 months in the besieged  Sarajevo. Mr. President, is there an effective way to realize  finally your proposal on lifting the arms embargo against our  country and on the bombing of Serb positions around Sarajevo?  You said that you would not tolerate the strangulation of  Sarajevo. Let us hope that your country will not allow the  international community's stand on Bosnia-Herzegovina to  continue being influenced by countries that tolerate genocide  and reward aggression.    This is said in Ejup Ganic's letter to U.S. President Bill  Clinton.</p>

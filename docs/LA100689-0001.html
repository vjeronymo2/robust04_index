			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: BATHROOM'S MESSY, SO IRAQI GOVERNOR GETS SWEPT OUT  </P> <P> Iraq's President Saddam Hussein isn't above airing a little dirty laundry in an  effort to clean up his government. While on a visit to the district governor of  Darbandikhan, 180 miles northeast of Baghdad, Hussein was shocked at finding a  filthy bathroom and linens in the governor's office and promptly fired him. "If  the governor himself is not clean and tidy, how will we manage to raise the  standard of our people?" Hussein said on television as he inspected the  official quarters of Mustafa Fatah. Television viewers heard Hussein angrily  rebuke Fatah over the facility's untidy state and dirty towels, and heard him  declare that the government would fire any governor who failed to look after  his district's hygiene. A decree was later issued by the ruling Revolutionary  Command Council confirming Fatah's early retirement and demotion to a lower  grade pension.  </P> <P>  -- A lawsuit filed by Armand Hammer wants to stop an unauthorized biography,  but the author is betting the suit will only stimulate sales. "Armand Hammer:  The Untold Story" was written by University of Missouri journalism professor  Steve Weinberg, who says he interviewed nearly 700 people but got no  cooperation from the 91-year-old chairman of Occidental Petroleum Co. Weinberg  says the book, published by Little Brown, is already on bookstore shelves. He  predicts that Hammer's efforts, currently directed at stopping publication of  the book in Europe, may actually stir interest in the biography. Letters from  Hammer's lawyers, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, described the book as  "beyond redemption by correction" and "riddled" with falsehoods. But Weinberg  says he uncovered new information questioning Hammer's clout in Washington and  detailing a questionable bankruptcy filing by Hammer's father.  </P> <P>  -- First Lady Barbara Bush, a college dropout, will receive her fourth  honorary degree today when she speaks at the convocation of the Morehouse  School of Medicine in Atlanta.

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Back to Lake Wobegon - Garrison Keillor GARRISON Keillor has popped into the Ambassadors Theatre for a few cosy chats (he is there tonight), honing up on the homespun before taking it to the Edinburgh Festival. Keillor is that soft, slow, sweet-voiced Mid-Westerner you hear on Radio Four recounting the quiet excitements of Lake Wobegon, that half real Minnesota town where the clock has stopped in all our innocent childhoods. On air and in his books Keillor is as composed and cool as frozen yoghurt: in the flesh he is more challenging. He looks harmless enough, like those photographs of a British Rail regional manager you see at stations, but then you notice the red socks and realise that the eccentricity is manufactured. Although Keillor lives off his re-creation of an idyllic past, where strict Puritan farming families worshipped niceness and perfected politeness and found their pleasures in gospel choirs and the local radio station's blend of farmstock prices and gentle humour, he is actually the outsider, the one who escaped to New York. He is now quite nasty about the life he left behind, slating it for its narrow mindedness and tedium. It is rather as if Barbara Cartland scorned virginity. We want to believe in these decent folk; we do not want our images over-thrown. Keillor treads a particularly difficult path in rubbishing his sources, because for much of his show he is supported by the Hopeful Gospel Quartet who sing the good old tunes, where the Lord is a firm rock and the Devil gets his deserts. The music is the strongest feature. It is rare to hear white gospel, much more sentimental than black gospel, and close to country music. It is the joy of the evening. For the rest Keillor seemed uncertain as he brought us the latest from Lake Wobegon, sang some clever songs, and recited old ballads. He can still hit the spot, especially on the advantages of being an uncle over a father in 'Uncle New York', and how Bizet was really Duanne from Omaha, but there were signs of nerves and a woeful inability to know when to stop. Through the airwaves and on the pages Keillor drifts us back into a secure family nest of crumpets and cocoa, with mild plesantries for entertainment. In the flesh our illusions are inevitably shattered.</p>

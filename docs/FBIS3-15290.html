There has been a mixed reaction among the Kuban public to  the  transfer of the legislative assembly elections from 3 April to  12 June. The kray organization of the "25 April Alliance" party  is inclined to see in this some kind of behind-the-scenes games  by the Kray Administration and a desire on its part to forestall  political opponents in a bid to get its own people into the  representative organs of power. The kray organization of the  Agrarian Party of Russia expects 12 June to be the final date  for the elections, and intends to hold visiting sessions in a  number of rayons where it intends to define strategy and tactics  for the election campaign.    The local organization of the Republican Party believes that  the postponement of the elections will open the way for  conducting the election campaign without haste. For the  elections, the "Republicans" have decided to register as the  "Yabloko" sociopolitical association, which, apart from them,  will include the Association for the Defense of Consumer Rights,  "Memorial," the Association of Repressed Peoples, the  "Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and "Solidarity,"  the Kuban association of shareholders. Mikhail Veligodksiy,  chairman of the Republican Party kray organization, believes  that the Kray Administration made a mistake by inserting into  the statute on elections an amendment on the need to collect 3  percent of signatures in order to nominate a candidate in a  district. This is three times as many as under the old version.  The task of collecting 2,000-3,000 signatures in today's  conditions is highly complex. But the elections are set, and,  one way or another, the candidate deputies for the kray  legislative assembly must submit voters' signatures in support  of them before the electoral commission will register them.</p>

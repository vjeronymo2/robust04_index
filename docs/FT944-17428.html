			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / 'It was like a long job interview': The sensitive subject of people working for nothing Colin, a 23-year-old graduate in acoustic engineering, spent two months this year working for nothing, except expenses, at a well-established London-based film production company. The result was a reference which secured him a job as a studio manager in a media company. 'It was rather like a long job interview,' said Colin, who was surprised at the amount of responsibility he was given. 'About half the people in the company where I was working started the same way, including the general manager.' An increasing number of young people like Colin are offering to take short-term, unpaid employment to gain a foothold in their chosen profession. It is a sensitive area - there is a fine line between gaining genuine work experience and simply working for nothing. Genuine work experience is part of much school and college-based training. For example, Pathfinders Personnel, the London - based media subsidiary of Angela Mortimer, the secretarial consultancy, arranges work experience of up to four weeks with a range of employers on behalf of secretarial colleges. In the past two years it has made about 1,000 such placements and expects more next year. Ms Amanda Fone, a director of the consultancy, said that in a competitive labour market more and more companies were pleased to take students for a short time. 'Work experience is not replacing the interview, but rather becoming part of it, with many employers recruiting young people they have met on work experience,' she said. The consultancy checked that companies were treating individuals properly. 'We ask students to contact us if at any stage they feel exploited. But, at the same time, we have to be realistic,' she said. 'Sometimes students are asked to do bits of photocopying - but that is different from doing it eight hours a day.' Nevertheless misuse of work experience does occur and there is anecdotal evidence that the practice has increased in the recession, particularly in non-unionised companies. Work substitution of this kind may be particularly common in areas young people perceive as glamorous, such as the media, where the fragmentation of the industry and growth of freelance work has diluted the power of trade unions to stop longer-term placements where they may believe unpaid workers are doing the jobs of full-time workers. Bectu, the broadcasting trade union, where membership has fallen from 60,000 to 35,000 in the past four years, said: 'We try to make it as difficult as we can for managements to abuse work experience.' It pointed to what it considered to be an associated problem in the film industry, where crews are paid less than Pounds 2 an hour with the prospect of more money only after the film has repaid its investors. One problem for those on unpaid work experience is whether to continue to claim unemployment benefits. The lack of clear rules discourages individuals from declaring what they are doing. It is not generally difficult for the person to satisfy the Employment Service that they are available for work. But the income support regulations operated by the Benefits Agency are more difficult to navigate. If a claimant tells the BA about doing unpaid work, an independent adjudication officer will decide whether it is reasonable to do that work on a voluntary basis. If the decision is that it is reasonable, all expenses relating to travel and meals are disregarded. The agency said the difficult part was assessing whether the job was truly voluntary, and the labour was extra to that provided by paid workers. 'Obviously any charitable status of the employer or task would have a bearing on the decision,' it said. Sometimes individuals are able to incorporate unpaid work experience into government training schemes. Florence, aged 27, was offered unpaid work experience by the Open University. 'The OU offered me experience but said they could not pay me for it,' she said. Her local Jobcentre arranged for her training at the OU to be under the state training programme for the unemployed, then called Employment Training. Florence said: 'Once they trusted me I got a lot of responsibility.' She got up at 6am every day to travel from Leicester to the OU at Milton Keynes. 'But they did not take me on to avoid taking somebody else on full-time. At no point did I feel exploited.' Florence was offered a job at the OU. She did not take it as she was also offered one at the BBC, which had been impressed by her CV. But 'it was wonderful to be given the chance to perform at the OU'.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE SHULTZ ON LEGALIZING DRUGS  </P> <P> Legalization of drugs: Bravo! for all of us. I'm Colombian and as such I've  suffered the horror that this last year's illegal business has produced not  only to our Third World society, but to the American people. Violence has been  the medium in which this demand-and-supply deal has taken place. I do not want  youngsters depending on drugs and most of all I do not want youngsters seeing  this business as the only way out of poverty.  </P> <P> Let's legalize, let's take the criminal part away from selling and buying.  Decriminalization would sharply decrease the profit motive of the dealers and  consequently decrease supply.  </P> <P> I'm a liberal, I never thought I'd agree with George Shultz!  </P> <P> SONIA BURCH, Northridge  </P></p>

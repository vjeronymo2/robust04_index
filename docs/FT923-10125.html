			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Futures bearish STERLING futures performed bearishly yesterday as the market continued to take a gloomy view of the outlook for a base rate cut in the UK. Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that an interest rate reduction in Germany would not be forthcoming this year pushed the September contract down in the morning. The fall was deepened after the Dutch central bank decided to raise its special advances money rate to 9.60 per cent from 9.50 per cent. Dealers took the view that Dutch central bank policy is closely tied to the Bundesbank's, and that a tightening of Dutch interest rates one week before the Bundesbank's council meeting does not augur well for rates. After opening at 89.69, September short sterling dipped to a low of 89.64, which was the closing figure. The December contract dropped even further, ending 11 basis points down from the previous close at 89.81. Trade in the sterling cash market was calmer, as dealers showed a far greater willing-ness to offer bills to the Bank of England than had been seen earlier in the week. According to one clearing bank trader, several banks had short positions and sold bills in large quantities to the Bank in the hope of bringing the short dates down. If that was the strategy, it succeeded. The overnight rate sank to a low of 7 per cent offered, from a previous close of 11 per cent and, at the day's end, the one-week was offered  1/8 down at 9 7/8 per cent. The overwhelming bearishness in the market meant that these rates had little effect further out, however. Three-month money closed  1/16 down on the offered side at 10 5/16 per cent and the one-year was unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank of England operated at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo) repayable on August 18 and 19. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 173m in Band 1, Pounds 57m in Band 2, and Pounds 369m in the repo. The forecast was then revised down to Pounds 700m in the afternoon, and the Bank purchased Pounds 100m in Band 1. German call money remained firm, trading just below the Bundesbank's Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent as banks sought to boost reserves to meet end-of-month requirements.</p>

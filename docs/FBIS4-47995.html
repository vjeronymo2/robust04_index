			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says he accepts the results of South Africa's all-race  elections. He spoke to the media at a news conference in Ulundi  today.    [Begin Buthelezi recording] I would like to express my deep  gratitude and appreciation to the people of South Africa in  their entirety. It was their commitment, after all, to  democracy, evidenced in the way they ran to the polls to try and  (?overcome) the adverse circumstances, which makes it possible  for me to state that I accept this election in the interest of  reconciliation, as sufficiently fair and free, to enable us to  move forward, at least. I say so within the acknowledgment of  the fact that of all the imperfections that the first election  held, you know, we have had problems in the last few days --  each and every one of you as fellow South Africans, in your  thousands and millions, have flocked to ballot stations to place  your mark for the new South Africa. In sunshine and in rain and  despite the countless frustrations you experienced you  maintained your resolve and determination, and for this I thank  you my fellow South Africans. [end recording]</p>

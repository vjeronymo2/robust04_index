Addressing more than 500 people in Diber who are members and  sympathizers of this party, Arber Xhaferri stressed that the  former leadership of the party, together with deputies and  ministers, has done almost nothing to realize the goals defined  in the party program. The influence of Albanians in the state  structures in Macedonia, as well as in the political, economic,  security, education, and so forth, power structures, does not  exist at all. As an example of this, the PDP chairman mentioned  the grave situation that exists in the educational field,  stressing that whereas in 1980 there were nine gymnasiums in  Macedonia and 30 professional high schools, in 1992 these  figures were reduced to five, thus marking a continuous decrease.    We are now in a phase of reorganizing the party and our  ranks, Arber Xhaferri said later, stressing that now is the time  we ask the support of Albanian intellectuals,political parties,  and institutions to fulfill our demands. He stressed that  Albanians in Macedonia should never cease to be state-forming  elements and have their own special institutions.</p>

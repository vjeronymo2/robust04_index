			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A GENTLE squeeze began to develop in derivative markets yesterday as a rally in German bond futures and anadvance in US equities pulled London shares up from the lows of last week. The June FT-SE 100 index contract opened firmly, which encouraged arbitrageurs to sell futures and buy shares, which in turn dragged the share market higher. However, this caused only a temporary halt to the futures market's advance. Equity marketmakers continued to buy FT-SE futures, which encouraged privateinvestors into the market. June FT-SE closed at 2,519, up 28 points on the day. June's premium to the spot index finished at 22 points, against fair value of around 15. Dealers said June's premium to fair value indicated that the futures market saw short-term gains on the stock market. Traded options were boosted by busy dealing in the Euro FT-SE 100 index, which saw 1,000 contractschange hands in each of the December 2,225, 2,325 and 2,425 puts. Among FT-SE options, a securities house sold 1,000 December 2,700 calls. Among the stock options, buying of British Telecom August 360 calls and May 360 puts boosted turnover. British Gas June 240 puts were busy, while Pilkington August 200 calls were also sought.</p>

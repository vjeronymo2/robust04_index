			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK JUDICIAL CANDIDATE STIRS DEBATE;  </P> <P> COURTS: CLARENCE THOMAS IS A RISING STAR IN THE GOP. BUT HIS CRITICS CHARGE HIS  VIEWS ON DISCRIMINATION ARE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  </P> <P> Clarence Thomas is a 41-year-old, Yale-educated lawyer. He is articulate,  conservative, a critic of affirmative action -- and black.  </P> <P> For all these reasons, Republicans see him as a star in the making. President  Bush nominated him last year to a highly visible judgeship: the U.S. Court of  Appeals seat in Washington last held by rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert  H. Bork.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee will consider  his nomination. If confirmed, Thomas is seen as a potential successor to  Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black.  </P> <P> In the eyes of some conservatives, the Thomas nomination could mark a historic  shift in attitudes about blacks and civil rights.  </P> <P> Marshall, as a lawyer with the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored  People, made his mark in the early days of the civil rights movement by  attacking "Jim Crow" laws and winning court victories outlawing legal  segregation. Since ascending to the Supreme Court in 1967, he has been the  leading proponent of the view that blacks should be compensated for their  decades of oppression through preferences in college admissions, jobs and  government contracts.  </P> <P> Thomas represents a new generation, one that entered the work force after legal  segregation was abolished. In speeches and interviews, he has argued that only  individual merit, not race, should count.  </P> <P> "No one should be rewarded or punished because of group characteristics,"  Thomas has said.  </P> <P> That was, of course, the view put forth by former President Ronald Reagan and  his attorney general, Edwin Meese III, but the words can carry a greater weight  when they come from a black man who grew up poor in the South, as Thomas did.  </P> <P> In 1982, Reagan picked Thomas, then 33, to be chairman of the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, the agency charged with enforcing the nation's  anti-discrimination laws in the workplace.  </P> <P> As EEOC chief, Thomas displayed a deep skepticism toward traditional,  broad-scale civil rights enforcement. He said he wanted to focus on individual  instances of bias.  </P> <P> Critics said he was more interested in protecting big business than  investigating unfair treatment, especially allegations of age and sex  discrimination. On occasion, he was compared to such Reagan appointees as  Interior Secretary James G. Watt, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator  Ann McGill Burford and Justice Department civil rights chief William Bradford  Reynolds, who became notorious in Congress for undermining the laws they were  charged with enforcing.  </P> <P> Thomas had his share of spats with Congress, too. In 1988, it was revealed that  nearly 9,000 complaints of age discrimination lodged with the EEOC had lapsed  because the agency failed to act on them within the required two-year time  period. When congressional Democrats complained, Thomas lashed back, charging  he was the victim of a "hatchet job."  </P> <P> In the House, 14 committee heads -- all Democrats -- fired off a letter to the  White House charging Thomas "had demonstrated an overall disdain for the rule  of law."  </P> <P> But his star did not dim for Republicans.  </P> <P> "From the beginning, President Bush made clear that he wanted Clarence to have  an important role in the Administration. The only question was what would be  the best role for Clarence," said Murray Dickman, a Justice Department official  who coordinates the selection of federal judges for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  "We view this (the appeals court to which Thomas was nominated) as the second  most important court in the land."  </P> <P> As the ideological battles between the Democratic-dominated Congress and the  Republican-controlled executive branch have intensified, the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia has been called upon increasingly to  decide technical, but highly charged disputes over the meaning of federal law  and federal regulations.  </P> <P> During the Reagan years, liberal legal activists repeatedly went to court  charging Administration officials with failing to enforce the law as written by  Congress. The issues ranged from workplace safety and food dyes to "fairness"  in broadcasting and the constitutionality of the independent-counsel statute.  </P> <P> Aware of the high stakes, the Reagan White House put many of its most reliably  conservative attorneys on the 12-member District of Columbia appeals court,  including Judges Antonin Scalia, Douglas H. Ginsburg and Bork, all of three of  whom were later nominated to the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> As a result, the Thomas nomination has attracted unusual attention. It has also  left Washington's liberal civil rights Establishment in an uneasy spot.  </P> <P> Some activists wanted to fight his confirmation in the Senate and spent months  gathering information. They say the record is clear: Based on his actions at  the EEOC, Thomas cannot be trusted to fairly enforce the law.  </P> <P> But the leaders of the prominent civil rights organizations, divided among  themselves, say they will not take a stand on the nomination.  </P> <P> "At this point, the Leadership Conference (on Civil Rights) has no position,"  said Ralph Neas, executive director of the coalition of more than 100 civil  rights groups.  </P> <P> In the past, these groups have derided Republican administrations for not  appointing blacks to high-level legal jobs.  </P> <P> Last year, when Bush nominated as head of the Justice Department's civil rights  division William Lucas, a former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff who is black,  civil rights lobbyists nonetheless opposed the nomination. They contended Lucas  was not qualified for the post, and the Senate Judiciary Committee voted him  down.  </P> <P> Thomas is Bush's first black nominee to the federal bench, and no one contends  he is unqualified.  </P> <P> Says Patrick McGuigan, an official of the Free Congress Foundation, a  conservative group backing the nomination: "Clarence has an awesome legal  background: Yale, assistant attorney general in Missouri, aide to (Sen.) John  Danforth (R-Mo.), assistant secretary at the Department of Education, and now  EEOC. He's done it all."  </P> <P> The American Bar Assn. gave Thomas a less-glowing endorsement. Its 15-member  evaluation committee rated Thomas as "qualified," which means "it appears the  prospective nominee would be able to perform satisfactorily as a federal  judge."  </P> <P> That was one of three possible ratings. A "well-qualified" nominee is one who  gets the association's "strong affirmative endorsement . . . as one of the best  available for the vacancy," while a "not qualified" nominee is considered "not  adequate from the standpoint of integrity, competence or temperament."  </P> <P> Thomas is expected to get some sharp questioning from Judiciary Committee  Democrats, but aides and lobbyists said they believe he will be confirmed by a  wide margin.  </P> <P> Still smarting over the defeats of Bork and Lucas, committee Republicans are  taking no chances with Thomas. They have loudly protested the staff  investigation of Thomas as unduly thorough. In a letter signed by Chairman  Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the EEOC was asked to turn over detailed files on  how Thomas handled various age-discrimination cases. That prompted a Wall  Street Journal editorial labeling the committee's investigation as "the next  lynching."  </P> <P> Despite such allegations, the President's judicial nominees are rarely rejected  by the Senate. During eight years in office, Reagan filled 378 of the 752  judgeships in the three-tiered federal court system. Only three of his nominees  were voted down: district court nominee Jefferson B. Sessions III of Alabama in  1986, Supreme Court nominee Bork in 1987 and appeals court nominee Bernard  Siegan of San Diego in 1988.  </P> <P> Much information on Thomas' tenure at the EEOC already has been made public and  failed to cause much of a stir.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Senate Special Committee on Aging published an 837-page report  detailing how Thomas and the EEOC rejected a complaint of widespread age  discrimination at the Xerox Corp.  </P> <P> Though the EEOC is charged by law with enforcing the age-discrimination law and  prosecuting violators, the agency, at Thomas' urging, voted not to take on the  Xerox case. Instead, the employees hired a private lawyer and filed a  class-action lawsuit that is still pending.  </P> <P> In a separate suit against Xerox, a federal court jury in Dallas last month  awarded more than $9 million in damages to a 46-year-old woman who contended  she was discharged because of her age.  </P> <P> Last week, the American Assn. of Retired Persons urged the Judiciary Committee  to "thoroughly examine" Thomas' record on enforcing the age-discrimination  laws. But the letter stopped short of opposing the nominee.  </P></p>

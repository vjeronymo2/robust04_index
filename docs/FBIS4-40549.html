			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- North Korea is not yet ready to  make an atom bomb in the opinion of Viktor Mikhaylov, the  Russian Minister of Atomic Energy. It is too complicated a  process, he said today when he was asked by an ITAR-TASS  correspondent whether the DPRK will be able to produce enough  plutonium to make atomic weapons.    As for the DPRK's departure from the IAEA, Viktor Mikhaylov  considers that "this is more a cry from the heart on North  Korea's part." He urged a dialogue between Russia and the  United States on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK,  observing that the country cannot be isolated, even if it  announces its departure from the IAEA. "I think," he  emphasized, "that on the North Korean issue dialogue will  prevail and the DPRK will remain in the IAEA."</p>

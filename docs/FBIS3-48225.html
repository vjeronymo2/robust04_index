			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Sunkyong Group will  not join the consortium for the second mobile phone project,  instead seeking to be the leading shareholder in Korea Mobile  Telecom when part of Korea Telecom's shares in the company go on  sale, Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) Executive Vice  Chairman Cho Kyu-ha said Monday.    FKI, chaired by Sunkyong Chairman Choe Chong-hyon, was  authorized to form a single consortium to carry out the  multibillion U.S.-dollar project by late next month.    Getting all of the bidders to form a single consortium and  selling stock in state-funded Korea Mobile was the government's  way of finally getting the show on the road since Sunkyong had  to give up the business license after beating five competitors  in August 1992 over suspicion of nepotism as Choe was related to  then- President No Tae-u by the marriage of their children.    It now looks as if Sunkyong will be the main stockholder in  Korea Mobile, and either POSCO or Kolon the leading shareholder  in the new cellular phone company.    In an unofficial board meeting at the weekend, Choe said  that  his group had decided to give up the second mobile phone project  to live up to the expectations of the government and the public  and for the sake of business unity.    Ssangyong Group Chairman Kim Sok-won said his group will not  seek to be leading shareholder of the new mobile phone company.    That narrows the competition down to Sinsegi Mobile of  Pohang  Iron and Steel Co. and Second Mobile of the Kolon Group. Dongbu  Mobile of the Dongbu Group and Tongyang Mobile of the Tongyang  Group did not apply for the leadership position.    After Choe announced that his group was withdrawing, FKI  gave  its support for Sunkyong to be prime shareholder of Korea Mobile.    With the unanimous support for Sunkyong in its bid for Korea  Mobile, POSCO is likely to concentrate on gaining control of the  new cellular phone company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement from Party of Democratic Kampuchea Spokesman </F> dated 16 May; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has of  late, openly and shamelessly declared that arms should be  shipped to the two-headed government to further fan the flames  of war against the Khmer Rouge. He has added that the shipping  of arms to the two-headed government to fight the Khmer Rouge  complies with the Paris accord.    II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] wishes to ask  the representatives of the signatory countries of the Paris  accord whether the Australian foreign minister's statement is  correct or contrary to the essence and spirit of the accord.    A. The Paris accord has already come to an end. However, if  the accord is to be taken into consideration, it is asked  whether the accord allows any country or power to provide arms  to Cambodia and whether it has urged or incited any party to  attack another party. No, not at all.    On the contrary, the Paris accord:    1. Forbids arms supply to every party;    2. Clearly stipulates that Cambodia should have four  parties that are all equal and that no party should have the  upper hand.    3. According to the essence and spirit of the accord,  Cambodia should achieve national reconciliation, national unity,  and genuine peace.    B. It is asked whether Gareth Evans' statement is correct or  completely contrary to international law, the UN Charter, the  principle of noninterference in other countries' internal  affairs, and the respect for human rights and the rights to  self-determination of each people. Is the Australian foreign  minister's statement in line with or contrary to the above  principles? Evidently, the provision of arms to the two-headed  government is to allow the communist Vietnamese and their  puppets to continue to destroy the Cambodian nation, people, and  race. So will this action promote peace or just inflame the  war? Will it alleviate the sufferings of the nation and people  or only destroy the Cambodian nation and people?    III. It is obvious the Evans statement is to inflame the war  in Cambodia. It is an utterance by warmongers who use the  Cambodians serving as the communist Vietnamese and American  puppets to attack patriotic Cambodians, to oppose peace,  national reconciliation, and national compromise, and to fan the  flames of war across Cambodia. This is aimed at causing  continued suffering to the Cambodian people and concern to  Cambodia's neighbors, thus once again complicating the situation  in Southeast Asia. The action by Australia and other  unscrupulous alliances is in collaboration with the communist  Vietnamese to enable the latter to swallow and eliminate the  Cambodian race, thereby allowing all of them to grab at Cambodia  according to their disgusting, vested interests.    IV. The Cambodian nation and people as well as Democratic  Kampuchea vehemently oppose the (?dirty) statement by the  atheist warmonger Gareth Evans and the arms supplies to destroy  the Cambodian nation and people.    [Dated] 16 May 1994    [Signed] Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to North Korea's repeated proposal put  forth on 25 May to hold a national meeting on 15 August  [national liberation anniversary], the National Unification  Board [NUB] repeatedly urged today that an exhausting political  propaganda should be immediately stopped, pointing out that the  first priority for a substantive advance in South-North  relations at the present moment is to clear away the suspicion  of North Korea's nuclear development.    In a commentary, NUB spokesman Kim Yong-ki recalled that the  ROK Government has already made clear its position that holding  a national meeting on 15 August is not at all conducive to the  solution to the nuclear issue and to the improvement in the  South- North relations. He emphasized that if North Korea  really takes the nation into consideration, it should show all  sincerity in solving the nuclear issue.</p>

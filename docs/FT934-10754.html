			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Foreign force for Burundi The Burundian army said yesterday it would not stand in the way of an international force to protect ministers who survived a coup which later collapsed, Reuter reports from Bujumbura. 'It is the government's prerogative and we are only an element of the legitimate government. That is our agreement,' said Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Bosco Daradangwa, army spokesman. He said the army had reached the agreement with Ms Sylvie Kinigi, the civilian prime minister and top official since soldiers assassinated President Melchior Ndadaye and six of his ministers. Remnants of Mr Ndadaye's government have taken refuge at the French embassy in the capital since the coup on October 21. The surviving ministers have said they will come out only if an estimated 1,000 foreign troops are deployed to protect them. The army, controlled by the relatively small but powerful Tutsi tribe, had previously opposed foreign troops intervening.</p>

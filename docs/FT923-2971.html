			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: Floating exchange rates only rational economic choice Sir, Samuel Brittan is correct ('Economic Viewpoint', September 10) when he notes that politicians may, at their discretion, choose fixed rather than floating exchange rate regimes. But the fact of political expediency does not mean that fixed rates are a valid or advisable choice] What will be so different about the economy in a few months when the billions of Ecus borrowed to finance the sterling support effort are exhausted? His justification of this silly exercise, namely the short-term goal of the French referendum and the longer-term hope for lower interest rates in Germany, begs the real argument: unless and until UK residents are willing to live and work and export like Germans, there is no hope of pegging sterling (or the lira and franc) to the D-Mark. Floating exchange rates are the only rational choice economically because they reflect the perception of a given country by investors and markets. In the case of the UK, the view remains negative because Britain is not competitive commercially. And floating rates are the only moral choice in a political sense because they allow a nation's citizens fairly to judge the policies of the current government. Efforts to support 'pegged' currencies are by their very terms anti-democratic, particularly in the case of situations such as Russia and Mexico where the International Monetary Fund and G7 are busily supporting artificial exchange rates - and the government's attached to them. Margaret Thatcher and the Danes are right: to hell with bureaucrats in Brussels and elsewhere; up the free market] Christopher Whalen, The Whalen Company, 1717 K Street, NW, Washington, DC, US</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Rothschild Francois] </F>   [Excerpt] The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 785 Haitian boat  people on the high seas in three days, according to State  Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, who adds that these  numbers represent a significant increase in the number of people  requesting asylum, compared to previous days. Since establishing  the refugee control system aboard the U.S. ship, Comfort, in  Kingston Harbor in Jamaica on 15 June, the Coast Guard has  intercepted 1,148 Haitians, according to the spokesman. Today,  130 were granted refugee status, while 347 saw their requests  rejected and must be repatriated. A group of 170 Haitian boat  people were repatriated today. Rothschild Francois reports live:    [Francois] As has been observed, the number of Haitian boat  people has increased over the past few days. Yesterday, more  than 1,000 boat people were intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard  and taken to Jamaica where they will be interviewed under the  U.S. program of political asylum. A total of 170 boat people  were repatriated to Port-au-Prince today aboard the U.S. ship,  the Dependable, including dozens of young children. These  refugees are mostly from Petit-Goave, Cap-Haitian. They said  they took to the sea to escape the misery. [passage omitted]    It should be noted that the U.S. Embassy spokesman in  Port-au-Prince, Stanley Schrager, was on the Port-au-Prince  wharf when these refugees were repatriated. Schrager again  announced that the United States encourages Haitians to apply  for political asylum at the three centers established in Haiti  -- in Cap-Haitian, Port-au-Prince, and les Cayes -- rather than  risk their lives on the high seas.</p>

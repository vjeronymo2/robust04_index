			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Damaging effect of inflation inflation and the effect of moving to a new job. The 1974-79 Labour government introduced the concept of linking the basic state pension to growth in earnings or prices, whichever was the greater. However, since the level of basic pension was low in relation to average earnings, this move would have taken decades to improve the value of the basic pension compared with price inflation. However, even this limited improvement was taken away by the Tory government which increased the basic state pension in line with inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index - by no means a representative measure of the effect of inflation on pensioners. Thus pensioners relying on the state are locked into the standard of living prevailing in 1982. Progress has been made by governments in ensuring that company schemes meet the requirements of employees and pensioners. The government, as an employer, has set the standards required in its public sector occupational schemes as a model for company schemes in two major areas - maintaining the value of pensions against inflation and ensuring that employees who change jobs are treated fairly compared with those who stay. The latter difficulty has become crucial as job mobility has increased. Almost two decades ago, the government ensured that public sector pensions were automatically increased each year in line with rises in the RPI. It also ensured that employees who changed jobs within the public sector had their benefits transferred in full from one scheme to another and employees who moved into the private sector had their accrued pensions revalued up to retirement in line with the RPI. The overall response from the private sector was patchy so that the government was forced to take legislative action. Twenty years ago, an employee changing jobs was entitled to no more than a refund of contributions. An employee is now entitled to a deferred pension based on his accrued service and salary at the time of leaving, revalued in line with the RPI, up to a limit of 5 per cent. Schemes can revalue at a higher rate. Also, employees can take the cash equivalent of this deferred pension and transfer it to another company pension scheme or invest with a life company. Nevertheless, although the differential has narrowed, employees who stay with an employer until retirement still do better than those who leave beforehand.</p>

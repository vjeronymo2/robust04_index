Hata did not specify any actions, but he predicted that  international pressure would mount on North Korea to open two  undeclared nuclear sites to inspection, Deputy Chief Cabinet  Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news conference.    Hata, speaking at a meeting of government and ruling  coalition leaders, also said North Korea's decision to grant  visas to international inspectors has helped ease international  concern about its nuclear program, Hatoyama said.    An inspection team of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) left Vienna on Sunday to inspect seven declared nuclear  sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.    But so far North Korea has rejected pressure to allow  inspections of two other sites at the nuclear complex that are  suspected of playing a role in an alleged nuclear bomb project.    North Korea issued visas to the seven-member inspection team  Saturday after Pyonyang and Washington reached an accord on U.S.  suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea.    The inspectors are expected to arrive in Pyongyang on  Tuesday.    The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the  IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog.    North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear  facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to open to  checks of the two undeclared facilities.</p>

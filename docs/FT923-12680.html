			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Maastricht upsets the apple-cart - Reaction to the treaty shows how politics can complicate the market / Bonds CHOOSING BETWEEN government bond markets ought to be easy, by comparison with the complex business of analysing companies and buying equities. In theory, government bond prices are determined by the outlook for interest rates and inflation. As interest rates come down, bond prices rise so that bond yields fall in sympathy. If inflation starts to rise, the real return from bonds is eroded, so bond yields rise and bond prices fall. However, the performance of bond markets over the past three months has underlined the fact that nothing in the financial markets is quite so simple in practice - not least because of the disruptive influence of politics. The most vivid example came in Europe, where bond markets were dominated by a single political factor: the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union (Emu). Following the signing of the treaty in November, bond prices in most European markets were supported by the Maastricht factor. On June 2, this prop was unexpectedly kicked away when Danish voters rejected the treaty in a referendum. In most European markets, bond prices fell sharply. The worst hit were those where investors had invested most faith in Maastricht: Italy and Spain. According to figures from Kemper Investment Management, Italian bonds turned in a negative total return of 1.45 per cent during June. Spanish bonds performed little better, with a negative return of 0.98 per cent on the month. Bonds denominated in Ecu, the fledgling European single currency, were also hard hit. French and UK government bonds suffered in the immediate aftermath of the Danish referendum, but have since recovered some poise. Maastricht matters to bond market investors, because the treaty lays down strict 'convergence criteria' which countries hoping to take part in Emu must meet. For example, for a country to qualify for the next stage of monetary union long-term interest rates should be no more than 2 per cent higher than the average of the best three performing countries. One argument is that Maastricht gave European governments a strong incentive to get interest rates down and keep inflation under control - bull market conditions for bonds. With the incentive removed, will European governments be prepared to take the tough decisions necessary? In countries with a strong reputation for controlling inflation, bond prices barely twitched. For example, whether Maastricht stands or falls, the German Bundesbank has a strong record of keeping inflation in check. Indeed, German bonds actually gained in the immediate aftermath of the Danish referendum, as investors switched funds out of other markets. Italy, however, is a different matter. When the result of the Danish vote was announced, the Italian state was without president or prime minister. The budget deficit is still growing unchecked, and the lira is seen as the most likely candidate for devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism. The uncertain tone is likely to continue for some months. Although the Irish people voted strongly in favour of the Maastricht treaty on June 18, a bigger test will be the attitude of the French electorate in September. It is also possible that Denmark will call a second referendum early next year, to vote on a revised Maastricht treaty. One positive impact of the Danish referendum could be to re-focus the attention of bond investors away from politics and back to the economic fundamentals of each market. On this basis, many fund managers now tip German government bonds to be the star performers of the second half of the year. German interest rates have probably peaked, and as they come down bond yields will also fall. The outlook for inflation is also good, so real returns should remain high. The influence of politics can also be benign. The UK government bond market was a clear example of this during April, when bond prices rocketed following the Conservative election victory. At the 10-year maturity, UK government bonds were yielding 10.25 per cent in the week before the election. A week after the event, 10-year yields had fallen to 9.30 per cent as bond prices rallied. But economic fundamentals prevail in the end. At the end of June, 10-year gilt yields stood at 9.38 per cent. In other words, bond prices are actually lower than in mid-April. Private investors who want to invest in international bond markets are best advised to do so through a mutual fund. Fund managers control enough cash to spread their risk across a large number of markets. Big funds can also protect themselves against adverse currency movements. Last month provided a clear lesson in how dangerous the foreign exchange markets can be for a bond market investor. For example, a portfolio of Australian government bonds returned almost 3 per cent during June, when measured in Australian dollars. For a sterling-based investor, the same portfolio would have shown a negative return of 2.5 per cent, because the pound strengthened against the Australian dollar on the foreign exchange markets. But even the biggest bond funds have had a tough ride so far this year. Only one of the 25 international bond unit trusts listed by Finstat showed a positive return over the first half of the year - the AES International Bond and Convertible Fund, which also invests in equity-linked instruments. The recent political upheaval in Europe is one reason for the lacklustre performance of most funds. But even outside Europe, bond markets have been unkind so far this year. For example, Japanese government bonds staged a recovery in the last three months, but only after a disastrous performance in the first quarter of the year. Bond prices are still not back to the levels seen in January. US bond prices have also pushed higher over the past three months. At the 10-year maturity, US treasury bond yields are now a healthy 0.4 per cent below the levels seen in early March. But again, the rally has only corrected some of the damage done in the first quarter. Again, bond prices remain significantly lower than at the turn of the year.</p>

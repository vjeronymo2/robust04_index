			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Property: Overseas investment rises to Pounds 2.2bn on back of low UK rates The changing opportunities and pressures facing overseas investors in UK commercial property are highlighted in a report published this week by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, chartered surveyors, writes Vanessa Houlder. Overseas direct investment in property rose from Pounds 1.3bn in 1992 to Pounds 2.2bn in 1993. German, Middle Eastern and south-east Asian investors were the most prominent buyers to respond to the appeal of low UK interest rates and sterling's devaluation. A surprising feature of 1993 was the limited number of sales by overseas investors, which totalled about Pounds 400m; 60 per cent of sales were by Swedish and Japanese investors. Heavier selling had been anticipated by many in the industry as a result of the difficult conditions in the main western economies. Most of the sales by Japanese property holders were accounted for by the developer Kumagai Gumi, rather than institutions. In the case of several Swedish property owners, the transfer of some bad loans to Securum reduced the pressure to sell quickly. Some of the problems experienced by overseas players in the late 1980s are considered less likely to recur. The recent pattern of overseas investment has seen a shift in emphasis away from acquisition for entrepreneurial or development purposes, which predominated in the late 1980s, in favour of standing investments that offer greater security of income.</p>

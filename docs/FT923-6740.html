			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Bush sups sweet cup of opportunity: President stakes out campaign ground with attack on Clinton PRESIDENT George Bush was expected to deliver a fighting speech to the Republican convention. He did not disappoint. Very well written, mostly by Mr Ray Price, President Nixon's old wordsmith, and delivered with more panache than Mr Bush usually musters, it lasted about an hour - a little longer than Mr Bill Clinton's to his Democratic convention last month - and was rapturously received by the assembled delegates. Its principal purpose, as it transpired, was more to stake out the ground for the campaign proper than to lay out a detailed blueprint for a second term. The president said the electorate was offered 'a sharp choice' between two candidates with different agendas, directions and 'yes, the character of the man you want to lead this nation'. He frequently invoked his own war record ('I had barely begun to live when I began to watch men die'), derisively referring to Mr Clinton as 'the head of the Arkansas National Guard' and deliberately not mentioning that his opponent had avoided military service. He contrasted his leadership in the Gulf war with Mr Clinton's equivocal support for it: 'I bit the bullet, he bit his nails.' He painted Mr Clinton, whom he only began to mention regularly by name in the coda to his speech, as the captive of 'the liberal McGovern wing of the other party' and as 'Carter Two'. He said his opponent was advocating 'Elvis economics and America will be checking into Heartbreak Hotel.' Mr Clinton, he said, had faith 'in the tattered blanket of bureaucracy' and would put a new tax on everything in sight, including what he described as 'the government takeover' of health care. Not only would he ration it, but 'he would deny you the right to use a doctor'. 'He defines rich,' Mr Bush charged, 'as anyone who has a job and he wants to separate you from your wallet.' Echoing a standard Republican theme, he declared 'my opponent's passion for big government knows no bounds'. Mr Bush conceded he had made 'a bad call' when he accepted a tax increase in 1990, but he insisted it was 'the Democrats' tax increase', not his own. But if he had made 'a mistake', that was nothing compared to Mr Clinton who 'enjoys tax increases'. His general assault on the Democrats running Congress was as unremitting as it was against Mr Clinton. They were, he said, caught up in 'PACS, perks, privilege, partnership and paralysis'. He demanded action to limit the number of terms congressmen might serve. He said there might be 150 new members of congress in January and 'I'll meet every one of them before they are attacked by the PACS, run by their staffs and cornered by the camera crews.' The president's declared economic agenda for his second term was more sparse than his indictment of the other side. He promised, if re-elected, to cut taxes next year, but only if matching spending cuts were effected. He unveiled a gimmicky plan to enable individuals to contribute to reducing the national debt. But mostly he contented himself with recycling proposals which, he claimed, Congress had deliberately frustrated. 'I offered them my hand, they bit it.' The speech began with a long recitation of the changes in the world that had taken place on his watch, for which he claimed credit. If, Mr Bush said, he had predicted all these developments, people would have said 'you must have inhaled something' (Mr Clinton has conceded smoking, but not inhaling, marijuana). The president declared contempt for Mr Clinton for daring to suggest that the US was now an object of 'ridicule' abroad. The US stood tall and there were lots of challenges ahead. Invoking another Republican touchstone, he said to great cheers 'I look forward to being the first president to visit a free, democratic Cuba'. On social issues, Mr Bush did not stray far from the conservative emphasis on religion and traditional family values. The country must change, he conceded, but must also go back to its roots. This meant respect for human life, of 'the born and unborn', his only reference to abortion, which so divides the Republican Party. With all this, Mr Bush said he sensed 'Americans are uneasy today'. But, he said, in Reaganesque terms 'I see not sunset but a sunrise.' There was 'an unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of opportunity around our American table.' Appealing to the national spirit and implicitly critical of Mr Clinton, he went on, 'if the entire world is going our way, why should we go back to their way?' And yet there was one Democrat with whom Mr Bush was happy to claim association. Harry Truman, Mr Bush asserted, had in 1948 promised 'a new crusade', above all against Congress (which was Republican at the time). So was he, against a different party political target.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Novelist in the making WILLIAM FAULKNER'S LETTERS TO HIS MOTHER AND FATHER, 1918-25 Norton Pounds 16.50, 253 pages WHAT CAN be added to the biography of William Faulkner at this point in his posthumous career? It is 30 years since his death. The authorised biography appeared 20 years ago, and, before and since then, there have been many other works of exegesis - biographies more or less ephemeral, critical assessments, monographs. We know him as one of the masters of American modernism, amongst the trickiest and most intricate in his plays of verbal artistry - too tricky for popular consumption, some would even argue; positively notorious for his own homespun brand of inaccessibility. What we know less about - and what the book under review provides - is where all this writing came from; how he expressed himself between the ages of 12 and 27; where exactly all that raw material, the stuff of such earlier fiction as Soldiers' Pay, and even the later masterpiece, As I Lay Dying, was experienced as life, to be thematically enriched later on when it was transferred to the written page. This collection of youthful letters home to his parents helps us to understand some of that. William Faulkner (his name was actually Falkner; he added the 'u' himself) was born in the small, sleepy Southern town of Oxford, Mississippi, and his first foray north happened in 1918 - he took a job, organised by a friend who was studying at Yale, in an armaments factory in New Haven, becoming, for the first time in his life, 'a full fledged working man' toiling alongside 18,000 others. Why did he leave in the first place? One theory has it that he needed to escape from the pain he felt at the marriage of his childhood sweetheart, Estelle Oldham. As a Southerner he was a subject of popular interest to the Yale types up there: 'These people are always saying things to me to hear me talk,' he tells his mother in an early letter. Everything is new to him about the people, the place. He has his first sight of the sea. He marvels at the fact that the people speak in minutes, not miles, when referring to distances, and where are all those movie theatres he's so used to? What intrigues us about these letters home is the degree of his artlessness. There is no trace of literary ambition, no literary references, no literary theorising, and no evidence of the kind of self-conscious stylistic flourishes that one might have expected from a writer who was to become one of the greatest American novelists of the 20th century. The relationship with his mother is cosy, even babyish - he addresses her as 'momsey,' repeatedly saying 'I love you, darling.' He sounds over-protected, even over-indulged. In the letters to his father (an ex-railroad man), on the other hand - he often wrote to them separately - he is bursting with practical information about everything under the sun: the state of these new-fangled locomotives; the tickertape machines that he glimpses for the first time in his life. He even asks his parents to pass on messages to each other: 'Give dad my love and tell him that I have seen one of the largest hardware houses in America.' Momsey sends lots of food parcels to her wide-eyed, innocent boy. His acquaintances are amazed by the amount of correspondence he receives from home. And yet, as time goes on, and he moves from place to place - after New Haven and having been stirred by the sight of British and Canadian war veterans on the streets, he enlists in the Royal Air Force, travelling first to New York and then on to Toronto, for a period of formal induction - he begins to write with some burgeoning consciousness of the imaginative effect of his writing upon others, and the phrases he starts to strike, still informally expressed, have a distinctly Faulknerian ring to them: 'I can't realise that big, selfish Ed Beanland is dead. It's like hearing that a lightning-rod has been struck by lightning' is his breathless response to a piece of news from home. The lineaments of the man are already becoming visible in the face of the babe.</p>

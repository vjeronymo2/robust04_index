			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STUDY PROMISES LONG-LIVED TOMATO  </P> <P> The study of an obscure wild Brazilian tomato has led scientists to the  discovery of a treatment that doubles the keeping time of some commercially  grown tomatoes.  </P> <P> The nation's $1-billion fresh tomato industry could realize dramatic benefits  from the new process, said Peter J. Davies, a plant physiology professor at  Cornell University.  </P> <P> The Cornell treatment process increases the shelf-life of vine-ripened tomatoes  to 10 to 12 days, said David M. Law, a research associate on the project.  </P> <P> The method involves increasing the level of a chemical compound, called 1,4  butanediamine, already found naturally in the tomato. The process is now being  tested by a food company to determine whether it is viable on a large scale.  </P></p>

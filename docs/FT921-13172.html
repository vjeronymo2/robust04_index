			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Bonn blocks nuclear sales to Libya THE German government yesterday approved an emergency decree forbidding the export to Libya of a consignment of goods with a potential use in nuclear technology. The extraordinary measure follows the seizure of the goods last month at Frankfurt airport, en route from the US to Libya via the Netherlands, according to a government spokesmanMr Dieter Vogel. The German authorities acted on a tip-off from foreign intelligence sources. Current German export control legislation does not give the government sufficient powers to bar the export of the goods, which Mr Vogel said 'could be used for nuclear or other purposes.' Coincidentally, the German government is set to present new export control legislation in the Bundestag today and the sudden revelation of the Libyan cargo appears to strengthen its case. The government has been attempting to persuade the parliament of the need for tougher export controls on sensitive technology - including the use of telephone tapping by the customs - for the past two years. Reuter reported yesterday that the Libyan consignment was seized on December 10, as the aircraft carrying it was already cleared for take-off. The German authorities were asked to stop the cargo by the Dutch, who said their own export controls were not strict enough to act. The agency quoted government sources saying the consignment included laser equipment and other items, ordered by a Dutch intermediary for delivery to 'a Libyan agency which is known to be a procurement institute for the Libyan missile programme'. Mr Vogel would not confirm where the tip-off came from, but said the German authorities would not have acted without confirming the information themselves.</p>

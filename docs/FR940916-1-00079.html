			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FRA Conclusions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA believes that if a train contains a locomotive equipped with 26L freight locomotive brake equipment and the train is equipped with an EOT device, that train should be allowed to be qualified using the AFM. FRA also agrees with several commenters that the AFM should not be permitted as a means of qualifying braking systems on commuter and passenger trains. Due to the shorter length of these types of trains the use of the AFM to qualify their brake systems might allow these trains to operate with excessive brake pipe leakage. The AFM would be an alternative to the leakage test for qualifying properly equipped freight train brake systems. FRA recognizes the concerns of several labor organization commenters opposing the adoption of the AFM; however, FRA believes these commenters' apprehension is based on their unfamiliarity with the method. As FRA pointed out in the ANPRM (57 FR 62551) and as several commenters confirmed, the AFM is a much more comprehensive test than the leakage test. The AFM tests the entire brake system just as it is used, with the pressure-maintaining feature cut in. The method has been allowed in Canada since 1984 without any problems. Based on the comments from several railroads and information obtained during the method's testing from 1981 to 1988, FRA feels the AFM is an effective and reliable alternative method of qualifying train brakes. Although FRA is not mandating the use of the AFM, FRA does encourage railroads to use the method on all trains, not necessarily for qualifying the brake systems, but as a means of providing additional information regarding the brake system to the train crew. FRA further believes that calibration of the air flow indicators should be performed at least every 92 days, based on the fact that it is the calibration period required by the current FRA waiver granted to the AAR and because most railroads stated that they already calibrate the air flow indicators every 60 to 92 days and gave no indication that the period should be altered. See 54 FR 5195 (Feb. 1, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Testing in Cold Weather and on Steep Grades  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA has received a recommendation from the NTSB and petitions from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the United Transportation Union, and the Montana Joint Rail Labor Legislative Council to require additional train air brake system testing in extremely cold weather and mountain grade territory. These parties cite concerns regarding existing practices of some railroads in these areas and the general problem of assuring sufficient brake pipe pressure during train operations in extremely cold weather and on steep, descending grades. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62553), FRA sought comments from interested parties regarding the need for additional testing of train air brakes in these circumstances and the type of additional testing required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAR and a variety of other railroads opposed the mandating of additional testing in cold weather or in mountain grade territory. They stated that the accidents that have occurred in cold weather and on heavy grades are due to failure of individuals to comply with existing procedures and not due to inadequate testing, procedures, or equipment. These commenters felt that current brake tests and operating procedures are sufficient as long as they are followed and performed properly. Several railroads commented that they have installed air dryers on their locomotives in order to eliminate the use of alcohol in cold weather, which is very detrimental to the rubber components of the braking system. In addition, several railroads contended that improved equipment, such as welded fittings and ferrule-clamped air hoses, have negated the effects of cold weather on leakage and braking. Several railroads also suggested that running tests should not be required in mountain grade territory since the performance of such tests only results in the depletion of the reserve air supply, and thus, jeopardizes the effectiveness of the brake system by requiring a train to approach a grade with less than a fully charged brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing the issues of ``feed valve braking'' and use of the ``Passenger'' position of the 26C brake valve in freight service, the AAR stated that the individual railroads have operating rules that address these forms of braking and since no safety issue has arisen regarding their use there is no justification for removing the railroad's discretion in establishing rules appropriate for their operations. At least four railroads stated that use of the ``Passenger'' position in freight service can be performed safely and may be needed and wanted in certain circumstances, and that there should be no regulation prohibiting its use. Although several railroads stated that they do not allow or recommend ``feed valve braking,'' they all believed that the current operating rules of the individual railroads sufficiently address the issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two labor organizations and several of their members commented that additional tests are not required but that good initial and intermediate terminal brake tests are needed. Counsel for the TCU suggested that the railroads should consider placing a carman on each train. The BRC and several of its carmen commented on the widespread use of alcohol and methanol in the trainline during cold weather and mentioned the degenerative effect it has on the rubber components of the brake system. These commenters felt that the use of these materials in the trainline should be addressed by FRA. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) suggested that the allowable front-to-rear gradient be reduced in cold weather from 15-psi to 10-psi. One organization recommended a regulation requiring locomotive engineers to test the brake pipe pressure prior to passing the summit on a mountain grade. The BLE stated that the burden of establishing the safety of ``feed valve braking'' and the use of the ``Passenger'' position of the brake valve should be borne by the railroads rather than using BLE members as test pilots. However, one individual engineer felt that both methods should continue to be allowed in limited circumstances to address unusual conditions that arise from either undesired emergencies or faulty maintaining features of the 26C or 30A-CDW brake valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two brake equipment manufacturers commented that no additional testing requirements are needed. They stated that the industry has taken dramatic steps to reduce leakage in cold weather by installing and using welded pipe fittings, wide lip hose couplings, and ferrule clamps. These commenters felt that if brake equipment is properly maintained and good terminal brake tests are performed, there is no need for additional regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

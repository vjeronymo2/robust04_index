			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments were received on the reservation of detectable warnings on public sidewalk curb ramps in the public right-of-way. On July 9, 1993, the Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation issued a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to suspend temporarily the requirement for detectable warnings on curb ramps and at reflecting pools and hazardous vehicle crossings (58 FR 37052). If adopted, the provisions of ADAAG 4.7.7 (Detectable Warnings), 4.29.5 (Detectable Warnings at Hazardous Vehicular Areas), and 4.29.6 (Detectable Warnings at Reflecting Pools) would be suspended until January 1995. The Board is conducting further research on detectable warnings. The requirement for detectable warnings for elements covered by ADAAG sections 4 through 10 remains in effect unless and until the Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation adopt the proposed suspension and publish a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Comments on detectable warnings submitted to the docket for this rulemaking were considered along with comments submitted to the docket for the July 9, 1993 NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.4(8)&blank;Transitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (8) requires that counter slopes where gutters and streets connect to public sidewalk curb ramps be limited to 1:20 for a distance of 24 inches and prohibits gratings in the area at the base of the public sidewalk curb ramp. It also requires that transitions be flush and smoothly blended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that the counter slope of adjacent surfaces be limited to a maximum of 1:20. Many commenters objected to this limitation for existing gutters, which may have a slope as steep as 1:12. A few commenters noted, however, that a 1:20 slope would be achievable in new construction. Other commenters noted that some designs of street cross sections would preclude maintaining this slope consistently across a street crossing and suggested a limitation in length.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The angle of incidence between a wheelchair descending a public sidewalk curb ramp and the counter slope of the gutter must be limited to avoid catching the wheelchair footrest. The 1:20 maximum required in the interim final rule is consistent with ADAAG 4.7.2 (Slope). The interim final rule adds a requirement that the area of 1:20 slope extend for a 24 inch distance (the length of the wheelbase of most wheelchairs) from the edge of the public sidewalk curb ramp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed concern about the difficulties of travelling over gratings in public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with prohibitions within the continuous passage and on public sidewalk curb ramp landings, gratings may not be installed in street crossings where public sidewalk curb ramps or landings meet adjacent surfaces. Additional discussion can be found in ADAAG 14.2.3 (Public Sidewalks).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several jurisdictions recommended that raised edges be permitted at the bases of public sidewalk curb ramps to facilitate street cleaning and surface drainage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule is consistent with ADAAG 4.7.2 (Slope), which requires that transitions be flush and free of abrupt changes. Even a small level change at the base of a public sidewalk curb ramp can stop a wheelchair, particularly on ascent where it may be necessary to take a run at the ramp slope. No change has been made to the requirement that transitions be smoothly blended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.4(9)&blank;Obstructions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (9) requires that public sidewalk curb ramps be protected from obstructions by parked vehicles. No comments were received on this provision and no changes were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.5&blank;Pedestrian Street Crossings [14.2.5(13), 14.2.6, 14.2.7, and 14.2.8 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that street crossings connect to the continuous passage by means of a public sidewalk curb ramp and that related crossing controls, marked crossings, islands, and overpasses and underpasses be accessible where provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.5(1)&blank;Crossing Controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (1) adapts ADAAG requirements for control button size, operating force, mounting height, and location. It requires a control button to be raised or flush and a minimum of two inches in its smallest dimension and limits the force required to operate controls to 5 lbf (22.2 N). This paragraph also requires that controls be located as close as practicable to the public sidewalk curb ramp or landing serving the crossing at a maximum height of 42 inches above the finished surface of the public sidewalk. It further requires a 30 inch by 48 inch level area within 10 inches horizontally of the control and centered on the control for a parallel approach and centered on and abutting the control for a forward approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM sought comment on the size, usability and maintenance of crossing control buttons. Commenters stated that recessed or hooded buttons and very small membrane-enclosed buttons were difficult for many persons to operate. A few commenters supported the proposed 3/4 inch provision, derived from ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators), for reasons of consistency. Other commenters stated that they had had no problems or complaints from the 3/4 inch diameter buttons installed in their jurisdictions. A number of municipalities indicated that larger buttons were more prone to freezing and vandalism. However, the State of Oregon, and the Douglas County (OR) Public Works Department both indicated that two inch buttons with integral guards posed minimal problems in cold wet climates. EPVA recommended a two inch diameter button as being easier to operate on public sidewalks where site conditions may be less than adequate and the relationship of the button, the public sidewalk curb ramp and landing, and the street crossing may not be optimal. Most individuals with disabilities and organizations representing them strongly supported a button two inches or larger in diameter. The Hawaii Commission on Persons with Disabilities noted that controls should be operable with a closed fist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several State and local government transportation and public works agencies submitted manufacturers' specifications on crossing controls. An Australian traffic engineer submitted data on a three inch by five inch oval button with raised arrows that indicate crossing direction. Large buttons and plates, tactile signage, and raised crossing direction indicators were also recommended by a number of individuals who are blind. A few commenters, including the Lighthouse for the Blind and the American Council of the Blind, suggested that a color contrast at the button would also be useful for pedestrians with vision impairments. Other recommendations included convex and raised buttons rather than flush installations and lever and vertical bar operators for maximum usability by persons with upper body mobility impairments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule requires that crossing control buttons be larger than elevator call buttons given their outdoor locations and the likelihood that surface conditions and location may not allow as controlled an approach as is possible to a wall-mounted elevator button in the lobby of a building. Small buttons require greater fine motor control to operate. A larger button that can be actuated by a slight motion or closed fist will be usable by more persons. This is particularly important where a crossing cycle can only be actuated by operating the control. Additional issues, such as contrast, tactile directions for use, and other button designs may be considered in future rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

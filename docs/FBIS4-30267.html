			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto says Indonesia must work hard  during the upcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]  meeting to ensure that the future policies of developed nations  will no longer harm the interests of Indonesia and other  developing nations. The head of state said this when he  received delegates attending a working technical meeting of the  Department of Farming and Fishery of the Functional Group at the  Tapos Ranch in Bogor today. He said the current policies of  developed nations have often harmed the interests of Indonesia  and other developing nations. For example, Japan continues to  increase the value of its yen. President Suharto reiterated the  paramount importance of the economic development of developing  nations. Indonesia manages to achieve a seven-percent economic  growth and keep inflation below 10 percent annually. Indonesia  considers the APEC meeting, which will take place in Bogor in  November, an appropriate forum because industrialized and  developing nations will be represented there.</p>

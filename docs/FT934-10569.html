			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Forex losses at Ansett keep TNT in the red TNT, the troubled Australian transportation group, yesterday told shareholders that it made a loss after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 33.2m (USDollars 22.4m) in its first quarter to end-September. In the corresponding quarter of 1992, the group reported a ADollars 65.1m deficit. The red ink in the latest three months, however, was mainly due to abnormal charges, which totalled ADollars 35m, compared with ADollars 49m a year ago. These, the company said at its annual meeting in Sydney, were 'almost wholly' due to unrealised foreign exchange losses incurred by the Ansett airline group. Ansett, a predominantly domestic carrier, is owned jointly by TNT and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. On a consolidated basis - that is, excluding companies in which TNT holds no more than a 50 per cent interest - there was a small ADollars 43.6m profit, compared with a ADollars 44m loss in the first quarter of 1992. Meanwhile, ahead of abnormal items and tax, TNT made a first-quarter profit of ADollars 23.4m, up from just ADollars 2m last time. Mr Fred Millar, TNT's chairman, told shareholders that results from many parts of the group were improving. However, TNT admitted that a couple of trouble spots continue to dog the group - notably the Spanish business, where the first-quarter loss was larger than last year and worse than budget, and GD Express Worldwide, owned jointly by TNT and five national post offices. The latter, said Mr Millar, has budgeted to halve its 1992/3 loss in the current year and reach break-even by mid-1995. At the lengthy annual meeting, directors faced tough questioning from some shareholders, although many seemed supportive of the board's current strategy. Mr Millar added that the group hoped to be able to announce new board appointments by early 1994; it lost six members this summer, when a boardroom split occurred, and Sir Peter Abeles - along with a band of directors who backed him - severed ties with the company he built up.</p>

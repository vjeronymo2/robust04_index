			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IN KCAL 'DICK TRACY' CARTOON SERIES  </P> <P> I am a Japanese-American and I used to watch the Dick Tracy cartoon series when  I was a kid growing up in the '60s.  </P> <P> It did not make me a racist. Richard Katsuda of the National Coalition for  Redress and Reparations stated: "Cartoons like this can be destructive at an  early age." Is he serious?  </P> <P> My son, 6, and my daughter, 3 1/2, both love the cartoon series! The minority  spokespersons do not speak for me and my children; let them dictate their  narrow-minded views to their own families.  </P> <P> HENRY SAKAIDA  </P> <P> Temple City  </P> <P>  KCAL on July 6 decided to discontinue broadcasting the "Dick Tracy" cartoon.  </P> <P> </P></p>

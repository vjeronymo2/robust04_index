Idesbald van Biesebroeck, a spokesman for the  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the truce, signed on  December 23 and set to last though January 15, was  "non-existent."    "The last two days have been very quiet in the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, except Sarajevo, Mostar and Bihac," he said.  In Sarajevo "the situation remains unstable," he said, although  there was little or no fighting Monday morning. Heavy arms fire  could be heard at the end of the morning from the north of the  city, and small arms fire downtown. He said UN observers had  counted more than 300 shells fired by Sarajevo's Bosnian Serb  besiegers Sunday, countered by some 30 Bosnian army shells in  return.    In one incident, a Norwegian C-130 Hercules military  transport aircraft was hit by small arms fire Sunday as it  prepared to land in Sarajevo, UN High Commissioner for Refugees  spokesman Ray Wilkinson said Monday. The plane was only  slightly damaged and the airport remained open. In the past  similar incidents have led to the suspension of aid flights into  the Bosnian capital.    Eighty percent of the shelling targeted military areas north  of Sarajevo, including Vogosca, Zuc, and Rajlovac, he said, but  added that shells had landed on residential areas, killing one  person and injuring seven.    In central Bosnia the situation was mostly calm, except for  the regions of Busovaca and Dubravica, south of Zenica, 50  kilometers (30 miles) west of Sarajevo, Wilkinson said. The  region was the scene of violent mortar and small arms clashes  between the Moslem-led Bosnian Army and Bosnian Croat (HVO)  forces Sunday, he added.    In the southern city of Mostar, where HVO forces have been  besieging the Moslem section of town, "the level of military  activity lowered," van Biesebroeck said. But shooting  continued, with the Bosnian Croats firing some 20 mortar shells  into the Moslem eastern sector of the city on Sunday.    Fighting had intensified in the northwestern separatist  Bihac  enclave between forces loyal to rebel leader Fikret Abdic and  the Bosnian Government forces, with clashes particularly fierce  north of the town of Cazin, he said.</p>

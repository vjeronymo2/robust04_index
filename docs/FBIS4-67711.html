			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, April 6 (AFP) -- The seasonal diseases  like meningitis and diarrhoea have claimed the lives of at least  35 people over the last week in Nepal, an official of the Public  Health Office said Wednesday.    Of the 35, at least 21 died of diarrhoea in Pajaru, Jajarkot  district, 300 kilometres (187 miles) northwest of here because  of contaminated water, he said, adding a medical team had been  sent to the area. [passage omitted]    "Similarly, fourteen children fell victim to the killer  disease, meningitis in the Nepalese capital over the week," he  said.    "People also fall victim to seasonal diseases during the  monsoon season (May-August) in Nepal when they drink polluted  flood waters," he said.    But a television report on the deaths of the children and  those who fell ill due to meningitis, has panicked parents in  Kathmandu who have rushed to private clinics to get vaccines,  witnesses said.    The Infectious Diseases Control Department at a hospital in  Kathmandu used to provide free anti-meningitis vaccines, but has  now run out of stock, a doctor said.    Private clinics were charging about four dollars for a shot,  he said, but added "people need not get panicked by the death  rate because it is an average rate at this time of the season."</p>

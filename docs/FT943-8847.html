			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies Nearly four months ago the Stock Exchange came up with the idea of replacing the doomed USM with a new smaller companies market based around the 200-odd shares currently traded under Stock Exchange Rule 4.2 (Rule 535 (2) as was). The exchange does not like to rush things, particularly when it comes to junior markets. There is still no date for the promised consultation document and it looks increasingly unlikely that the market could be up and running by the end of the year when the USM closes its doors to new admissions. But enthusiasts are confident the exchange is at least on the right track - towards a screen-based market, still lightly regulated but with much higher disclosure requirements - and they are not waiting. Rutherford Asset Management has just raised Pounds 19m for a new trust specialising in Rule 4.2 companies and at least one other such trust is thought to be on the way. The managers argue that the Rule 4.2 world is attractive already. Originally operated on the basis of matched bargains there is now growing involvement by marketmakers. Trading volumes are running at a fifth of USM levels, and rising. If the proposed changes attract more interest from specialist fund managers it might at last provide an easy and cheap route for small companies to raise modest amounts of equity. There is certainly a demand. The queue of companies waiting to join suggests that, after relations became so strained during the recession, small companies are loath to rely on banks in the recovery.</p>

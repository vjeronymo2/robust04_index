			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Top bankers held in Dollars 430m scandal Indonesia said yesterday it had arrested two senior bankers in connection with a scandal over a Dollars 430m (Pounds 294.50m) letter of credit extended by a state bank. The loan was supposed to finance petrochemical projects but was allegedly diverted to Hong Kong. The case involving PT Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo) is arousing intense interest among Indonesians and their trading partners because of concerns about the bad debts of the state banks, which account for about 60 per cent of bank business in the country. The two men arrested were Mr Towil Heryoto, who headed Bapindo until he was replaced by the government this week, and Mr Subekti Ismaun, chief of the bank when the unsecured letter of credit was issued in 1992, according to the Attorney General's office. Another former Bapindo executive and Mr Eddy Tansil, director of the Golden Key group which received the credit, were arrested earlier. With accrued interest, the loan is now supposed to be worth more than Dollars 620m, but is apparently not being repaid and is not clear where the money went. Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the Indonesian finance minister, announced recently that latest figures showed 21.2 per cent or around Dollars 7bn of outstanding loans extended by the seven big state banks were classified as bad or doubtful, compared with 17.4 per cent at the end of 1992 and 6 per cent in 1990. Bankers in the private sector believe some state banks, which have a reputation for lending money to businessmen with good political connections, have bad or doubtful loans amounting to as much as 60 per cent of their portfolios. Appalled by the extent of the problem, they are happy to see the finance ministry trying to tackle the issue in public. 'In the past this would never have come up; it would have been swept under the carpet,' said one banker. 'It has been taken very seriously by the minister of finance.' The Attorney General's office said it wanted to bring the four men in jail to trial as soon as possible.</p>

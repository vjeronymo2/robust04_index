			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Poetry and polemics in the cold Moscow rain THE MOST popular entrance to the White House had been behind the Barrikadnaya metro station, beside a posh Italian restaurant called Arlecchino and the Moscow Film Centre. Thus it was there, yesterday morning where the largest crowd gathered to vent their frustration at being unable to get to parliament. In front of the militia, the rows of railings and the trucks drawn up behind them stood a crowd of vociferous demonstrators, the regulars who have appeared each day before the White House to show support for the dissolved parliament and the week-old resistance of parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, and the vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, to President Boris Yeltsin's emergency rule. Many of the demonstrators stood and bellowed at the militia - 'Comrades, for shame, think of what you're doing serving this criminal regime of Yeltsin's'. Two men purloined kitchen chairs, and one recited patriotic poetry into a microphone while the other held the crackling loudspeaker. The cold rain fell on bare heads and umbrellas. Deputies holding out inside can no longer return if they leave for food, fuel or succour. Under a tree to one side stood a group of deputies who had, they said, left the parliament for the night and had been unable to re-enter. One, who said he came from Siberia but refused to give his name, said they had secured an apartment in the city centre where an alternative, exiled parliament could meet. They appeared defeated, demoralised. In the midst of the crowd was a familiar figure, Colonel Viktor Alksnis, the former leader of the 'Soyuz' group of hardline, anti-Gorbachev deputies in the Soviet parliament. He was surrounded by well-wishers who fed him hot tea and a loaf of bread. Colonel Alksnis, as quick-fire of delivery as ever, repeated the familiar themes. Yeltsin's was a criminal administration, the regions were against him, the man who had broken the Soviet Union (Col Alksnis had been in politics to try to prevent such a disintegration) was now breaking Russia - and yet, responsibly, he urged the knot of people about him not to take up arms. The futility of it in the present circumstances was readily apparent. All around were groups of militia and Interior Ministry troops - armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and machine pistols. When they occasionally marched in rough formation from one post to another, the crowd surrounded them, shouting with great passion Po-zor], Po-zor] (shame) in ironic time to their marching steps. The troops tried to look unconcerned. One put his hands over his ears, a gesture interpreted by the crowd as giving a sign that he felt shame. As often in a Russian crowd, it was the women - middle-aged and elderly - who took the initiative. A number of the women surrounded a small knot of foreign reporters and accused us of lying in the service of Mr Yeltsin. One, with a mocking smile on her face, said: 'You support Yeltsin as a great democrat - and here's the result, you can see. There's your democracy for you.' A Russian photographer who had managed to penetrate a little inside the police lines before being sent out reported that columns of special riot units had been drawn up within the perimeter. Within the White House - according to the government - are some 500-600 deputies and defenders, including armed 'extremist groups'. The stage last night was set for a confrontation.</p>

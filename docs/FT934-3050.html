			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Observer: Hook, line and stinker The latest row bugging John Major's cabinet is at least about a down-to-earth issue. Board of trade president Michael Heseltine and treasury chief secretary Michael Portillo have been baiting each other with letters about maggots. The wrigglies that fishermen impale on their hooks have been reeled into affairs of state by Hezza the prezza's approval of the National Rivers Authority's suggestion that post offices be allowed to sell anglers' fishing licences. He thought the idea fully in line with the government's commitment to deregulation, as did environment secretary John Gummer. Then up popped Portillo with a letter to Heseltine objecting that the proposal would undercut the trade of the fishing-tackle shops where anglers now buy their licences along with rods, lines, maggots and the like. For some obscure reason the chief secretary's commitment to economic liberalism does not extend to breaking the monopoly of tackle shops. The prezza seethed, especially since he prides himself on being one of the few members of the cabinet who has ever bought a fishing licence. Back went a stinker of a letter informing Portillo that the licence is an annual purchase. Maggots must be bought weekly. Whereas tackle shops might be threatened if post offices sold maggots and such, Heseltine adds, that is hardly in prospect. Hence 'get your hook off my line and let me get on with running my department'.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DEVELOPMENT SPARKS A SQUABBLE;  </P> <P> 2 CITY AGENCIES CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM  </P> <P> Elected city officials are critical of Los Angeles building inspectors for  failing to force the developer of the Beverly Connection shopping center to  install left-turn pockets and other traffic improvements at the chronically  clogged intersection of Beverly and La Cienega boulevards.  </P> <P> "The issue is bigger than the Beverly Connection," said City Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, who wrote the Department of Building and Safety to demand that it  revoke the temporary certificate of occupancy that was issued when the shopping  center opened in January.  </P> <P> The Beverly Connection is on La Cienega Boulevard between Beverly Boulevard and  3rd Street, across the street from the huge Beverly Center shopping mall and  diagonally across from the newly opened Ma Maison Hotel.  </P> <P> Conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals required that both Beverly  and La Cienega boulevards be widened by five feet to allow for extra left-turn  lanes, and that new signals be installed to regulate traffic in and out of both  shopping malls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Music, Video Stores  </P> <P> "Either Building and Safety is going to have to police better or there's going  to be a radical transformation of who does what in the city," he said. "You  cannot have conditions imposed by the Planning Department and totally ignored  by Building and Safety."  </P> <P> Jane Blumenfeld, Mayor Tom Bradley's planning aide, said that Bradley's office  was also concerned about the Beverly Connection, where a supermarket and music  and video stores have been open since January.  </P> <P> With automobile congestion already a chronic problem in the area, she said that  new stores in the Beverly Connection will only worsen traffic if the  street-widening and double left-turn lanes required by the Board of Zoning  Appeals are not installed.  </P> <P> "This could have citywide implications if temporary certificates of occupancy  are given pending completion of very significant improvements that have not  been done," Blumenfeld said.  </P> <P> Despite the protests, the head of the city's Building Bureau said that little  could have been done to prevent the opening of the Beverly Connection once  construction was completed, especially because the site was previously occupied  by another retail store.  </P> <P> "In the legal sense they had the legal right to occupy the building," said Tim  Taylor, chief of the Building Bureau. "That was a retail store and this is a  retail store. There was really no need for a temporary certificate of  occupancy, but they wanted one. If we revoke it they can fall back on the  existing certificate of occupancy from years ago."  </P> <P> He also said that the growing tendency to require that developers take steps to  deal with traffic and other disruptions before they can occupy their buildings  has overburdened his department.  </P> <P> "It becomes a very difficult enforcement problem for the Building Department to  deal with," he said. "There's no question that conditions were imposed in this  case. The question is, are they legally enforceable? That has not been tested  right now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Substantially Completed  </P> <P> Russell Lane, the city's chief building inspector, agreed, saying that the  municipal code allows him to issue a certificate of occupancy when a building  is substantially completed.  </P> <P> "That basically says there's no hazards involved," he said, adding that he has  only 46 inspectors to monitor construction and remodeling of all major  commercial buildings and large apartment houses in the city.  </P> <P> "The street improvements are not under my jurisdiction," he said. "We're  internally fighting that battle now as to who should enforce those off-site  provisions. If I go out and inspect those street improvements, I'm broadening  my authority by a great deal. My people don't have that expertise."  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky said that building inspectors will have to broaden their scope  if the city is to limit its development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police the Conditions  </P> <P> "This is the straw that broke the camel's back," he said of the Beverly  Connection situation. "Either we're going to find a way for the Building and  Safety Department to police the conditions" set by the Planning Department or  we're going to "find some other department to do it, and I don't think it's an  insurmountable task for any bureaucracy."  </P> <P> Blumenfeld, of Bradley's office, said that planning conditions are the best  vehicle to regulate growth.  </P> <P> "You'd need to have hundreds of people to make it mistake-free," she said.  </P> <P> The comments by Bradley and Yaroslavsky came after two residents groups  protested the decision to let a supermarket and video and music store open in  the Beverly Connection in January.  </P> <P> "We're gratified and pleased that the city takes this seriously," said Harald  Hahn of the Burton Way Homeowners Assn., which has worked with the Beverly  Wilshire Homeowners Assn. to limit development in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blocked Liquor License  </P> <P> The two groups have temporarily blocked a liquor license for Ralphs market by  arguing that there are already more than enough liquor outlets in the area.  </P> <P> Since the stores opened, "the traffic is horrendous. There are traffic jams for  a mile in every direction," he said. He added that "in a sense" he felt sorry  for developer Avi Lerner "because he's got his money on the line and people  can't get into his shopping center. Not very sorry, but a little bit."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Lerner said that work on the required improvements has started  and that it should be finished within two months. He also said there was no  reason not to open the stores in January.  </P> <P> "I ask what's better, closing Ralphs and displacing its patrons, or letting  them shop at the store?"  </P> <P> Referring to protests from the two residents' groups, he said, "This whole  thing is nothing more than a cheap, spiteful shot . . . to basically make  noise."  </P> <P> He also said that work on the traffic improvements was complicated by the task  of avoiding a maze of underground utility pipes that carry electricity, gas and  telephone service.  </P> <P> Exploratory work on the street-widening began more than a year ago, he said,  adding that temporary certificates were created to allow for such scheduling  problems.  </P> <P> He said the work also was delayed by a city ban on street works between Nov. 15  and Jan. 15.  </P></p>

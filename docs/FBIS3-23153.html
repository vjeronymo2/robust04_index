			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    In an interview with AL-SHARQ, 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah said: In the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we cannot help  but see the ugly American face, because the United States has  provided Israel with every means of protection against  international moves to condemn it. He said the U.S. president's  call to the Palestinians and Israelis to move the negotiations  to Washington is meant to save the Palestinians' face and to  insinuate that the Palestinians have broken down the Zionist  barrier placed by Israel between the United States and the  Palestinians. This gives the impression that the U.S.  president's direct sponsorship of the negotiations might give  the Palestinians the unrealistic dream that Washington will  pressure the Jews to accept what they have rejected in Taba.  But the issue is this: The United States will exert more  pressure on the Palestinians by claiming to discuss the need for  peace and for opposing the extremist Jews.    Fadlallah said there should be a Palestinian stance that  reflects respect for the blood of the Palestinian people and  there should also be a firm Arab stance mobilizing all the Arab  factors of strength that will confront this massacre and its  implications so that the world can know that the Arabs have  broken the mold of ineffectiveness. [passage omitted]    Fadlallah stressed that the resistance will stay if there is  a limited Israeli withdrawal from the south and might stay even  if there is a withdrawal from all of the south. He said: I  believe President al-Asad understands the value of the  resistance in restoring Arab dignity and in pressuring Israel  and the U.S. stance.    Regarding reports of U.S. fears of possible Israeli  operations in the south, Fadlallah said: The method of  discussing fears is the strongest form of threat.    He said he does not believe the pope's scheduled visit to  Lebanon is of any unusual importance. He said: I do not  believe it will have any important political impact on Lebanon's  major issue, namely, the Israeli occupation. As we can see, the  pope's gift to the Lebanese and Arab peoples before his visit  was the quick recognition of Israel. We do not believe this  gift encourages the Lebanese to think that this visit will  greatly benefit their ambitions.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (6): Welcoming magnet for multinationals - Mining plays a crucial role Enormous mineral resources, a welcoming foreign investment regime and sound macroeconomic fundamentals have transformed Chile into a magnet for mining multinationals. The foreign companies flocking to Chile reads like a Who's Who of the mining world: Anglo-American, Bema Gold, BHP, Chevron, Cominco - and all the way down the alphabet to RTZ and Shell/Billiton. The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates that Dollars 5bn worth of investment will be channelled into the mining sector to explore, develop or expand projects. Nowhere else in the world are there so many projects so close to fruition. Chile is the world's leading copper producer: about Dollars 4bn of this foreign investment is being channelled into new copper mines. The country has one-quarter of the world's known copper reserves. Some Dollars 560m in gold projects will move Chile up the ladder of the world's top 10 gold producers. A further Dollars 405m is being invested in non-metallics such as iodine and nitrates. Chile's mining sector plays a crucial role in its economy, accounting for almost half of exports and 15 per cent of GDP. According to some estimates, mining production will increase more than 50 per cent by the year 2000. High ore grades at new mines mean that Chile will also continue to be one of the world's lowest cost producers. One estimate by Cochilco puts copper production rising from 1.94m tonnes last year to 2.18m tonnes in 1994. The mining boom has been several years in the making. General Pinochet, who ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, wooed back mining multinationals with a liberal foreign investment regime and a mining code which grants property rights over mining concessions. The return of democracy in 1990 did not upset this vigorous activity, as the new government decided to keep the mining and investment codes intact. More than half of Chile's copper is mined by Codelco, the state-owned Chilean Copper Corporation. But Codelco's four mines, including Chuquicamata, the world's largest, are old. Production is in decline, operating costs are rising, and the powerful Copper Workers' Union, with 19,000 members, has blocked management plans to reduce overmanning. Nevertheless, Codelco has a plan to reverse its dwindling fortunes. Voluntary redundancies and a crackdown on absenteeism increased labour productivity by 6 per cent last year, according to Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president for development. The state concern has also launched an exploration drive to find new reserves. An important breakthrough for Codelco came with the approval of a new law in 1992, authorising the state company to form joint ventures with the private sector. Earlier this year, Codelco invited 20 mining companies to bid for the exploration rights to four of its mining prospects. The idea, says Mr Bande, is to allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration. He expects the first joint-venture agreements to be concluded about the middle of the year. Codelco owns one-third of the registered mining property in Chile. Investment, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint ventures as a way of tapping the huge mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own. In addition, Codelco has completed the basic engineering for Radomiro Tomic, a huge ore body discovered near Chuquicamata. The new mine is scheduled to enter production in 1995. Radomiro Tomic will be a test case for the state-owned copper company. It is the first mine that Codelco is developing from scratch, and the challenge will be to produce copper as cheaply and efficiently as the private sector. Mr Bande says Codelco is in the process of getting the final financial approval for Radomiro Tomic, which will require an investment of Dollars 450m. Once it is up and running, the mine will add 150,000 tonnes of copper to the 1.15m tonnes produced by Codelco's other divisions. Most of Chile's increased copper output, however, will come from private sector projects. Leading the wave of foreign investment, La Escondida - the richest copper deposit in the world - entered production in December 1990. La Escondida is jointly owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi. The Dollars 900m project was completed six months ahead of schedule - a tribute to the engineering and organisational skills of the mainly Chilean contractors. The mine, located in the Atacama desert, last year exported about 760,000 tonnes of copper concentrates (a semi-refined product equivalent to about 320,000 tonnes of refines copper), making it the second-biggest copper operation in the world. The company is studying plans to increase production by a further 80,000 tonnes - the output of a medium-sized mine - by 1994. It is testing a method to process the extra tonnage into pure copper cathodes, using a new technique which does not require smelting. Exxon Minerals, of the US, is close to completing a Dollars 400m expansion programme at its Los Bronces copper mine which will double production to 200,000 tonnes a year. Cominco of Canada recently wrapped up the Dollars 250m financing to develop its Quebrada Blanca copper deposit in the Atacama desert. It expects the mine will enter into production in 1994 with an output of 75,000 tonnes a year. Phelps Dodge of the US is expanding its Ojos del Salado mine and plans to develop a deposit known as La Candelaria, already being dubbed Chile's new Escondida. Outokumpu of Finland recently sold half of its Zaldivar copper deposit to Placer Dome for Dollars 100m. The Canadian resources group also agreed to finance up to Dollars 400m towards the cost of development. Minorco, an investment company owned by Anglo-American of South Africa, paid the record price to enter a copper project last year. Minorco shelled out Dollars 190m to buy Chevron's (the US oil group) stake in Collahuasi, a copper deposit high up in the Andes, now owned in equal shares by Minorco, Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge. Minorco estimates Collahuasi's start-up date will be 1996-97. The huge sums being paid by multinationals for a share of Chile's mining bonanza reflects the country's growing reputation as a safe-haven for foreign investment. 'The risk factor is not there,' says one diplomat in Santiago. 'Companies are prepared to pay top dollars for good mining projects.' A comparative example: in Peru, Anglo-American's Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos recently acquired the rich Quellaveco copper deposit from state-owned MineroPeru for Dollars 12m. The huge price differential between Quellaveco and Collahuasi, for roughly the same amount of copper reserves, reflects the penalty Peru is still paying for its political instability. The wealth of mining projects, concentrated mainly in Chile's desert north, is putting a strain on the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Finding water in the driest desert in the world is as much a priority as striking a rich mineral deposit. Electricity is also in short supply. Port facilities are deficient. La Escondida chose to build its own port, rather than compete with Codelco for Antofagasta's overstretched docks. Phelps Dodge, which wants to ship La Candelaria's copper concentrates from the small port of Caldera, is encountering opposition from local fishermen. They fear the loading operation will pollute the bay. Environmental awareness is growing in Chile, and the clash between Phelps Dodge and the fishermen of Caldera is by no means an isolated example. Local farming and fishing communities have recently won important legal victories against the polluting activities of mining operations. The government has begun enforcing stricter air and water pollution controls. Several companies, including Codelco, are now investing millions of dollars to clean up their act.</p>

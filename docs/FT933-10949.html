			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Real gems are too brash for the '90s - The elegant and affordable costume jewellery that matches the new fashion for flowing lines and softer fabrics NOW THAT the flashy, go-getting 1980s are nothing more than a nostalgic memory and the lean 1990s are well under way, proper jewellery - such as diamonds, sapphires, gold and platinum - is out of vogue. While the power suits and shoulder pads required bold, glitzy jewellery to match, today's softer fabrics and more flowing lines cry out for subtler, less obvious pieces. Ever-on-the-ball Fior, which has long had a reputation for making finely-crafted costume jewellery, today has immaculate versions of all the latest decorative looks at extraordinarily reasonable prices. A glance in the window of either of Fior's shops probably would make most of us pass by quickly, convinced that these glittering pieces were way beyond our means. But study them more closely and you will find that almost all of them are immaculate pieces of costume jewellery which look every bit as well made as the real thing and sell at very accessible prices. Fior employs the techniques the master jewellers use to make their haut jouallerie. All the settings are hand-drilled, all the pieces hand-finished. There are cantilevered bracelets, enamelled brooches, 'lost settings' (a traditional setting for fine stones to make sure the claw is not seen, which was used to make the flower earrings photographed above left) and fine beading. All the care and skill is there; only the intrinsic materials are different. Whereas haut jouallerie is made from gold and platinum, from silver and fine gem stones, the Fior versions use cubic zirconia, faux gems, rhodium and gold plating. All this, of course, has a remarkable effect on the price. Whereas a pair of classic two-carat diamond stud earrings probably would sell for around Pounds 900 if real, the Fior version of two-carat cubic zirconia is just Pounds 60. And when it comes to something as exacting as the diamante set of necklet, brooch and earrings photographed above right, the price difference is even more dramatic. The original 1930s set on which it was based probably would sell today for somewhere between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000, while the version here sells for Pounds 506 (although the pieces can all be bought separately: the necklet is Pounds 215, the brooch, Pounds 250, and the clip earrings Pounds 41). The lost-setting flower earrings beloved of Van Cleef and Arpels, hand-set in silver gilt (and photographed above, left) are Pounds 400; centres can be 'rubies', 'sapphires', 'emeralds' or 'amethyst.' Pictured with the earrings is a Romanesque bracelet in matt 18-carat gold plate for Pounds 65, a gold and cabochon necklet for Pounds 155, and Roman coin earrings at Pounds 44 the pair. Anyone familiar with what is a la mode in the swish Bond Street jewellery stores will recognise the looks at once. There are the 'gold' and cabochon rings and bracelets, the Romanesque pieces, the coin earrings, the flower earrings, the Daliesque watches, and the sharper Paloma Picasso-style pieces. Besides selling ready-made versions of all the latest looks, Fior has established a niche in making perfect copies of pieces that are too valuable to wear. Many a celebrity lodges her real jewellery in the bank and goes out on the town in Fior's handiwork. Elizabeth Taylor commissioned Fior to make a replica of her famous emerald and diamond brooch, while one of Britain's better-heeled dukes, after discovering that it would cost him Pounds 10,000 to insure some of his wife's jewellery for their holiday trip to Australia, decided to have a precise copy made. It cost him Pounds 5,000 but he had saved another Pounds 5,000 and, as he put it: 'My wife has a ring she can go on wearing forever.' The Fior shops are at 27 Brompton Road, London SW3, and 31 New Bond Street, London W1.</p>

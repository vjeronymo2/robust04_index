			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, May 23, IRNA -- Former secretary general  of Lebanese Hizballah, Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, here Monday  urged Lebanese Muslims to carry arms and defend themselves  against the Zionist regime.    Interviewed by IRNA, al-Tufayli criticized the Lebanese  Government for its silence vis-a-vis the crimes being committed  by the Zionist regime, and held the government responsible for  the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, leader of the Mu'manah  resistance group. Al-Dirani was abducted from his home in  al-Biqa' by the Zionist commandos last Saturday.    "From now on Lebanese people cannot trust the security  provided by the Lebanese Government," he said.    Al-Tufayli warned that silence of the Lebanese officials  would further encourage the Zionist regime to continue its  crimes and violate the human rights in Lebanon.</p>

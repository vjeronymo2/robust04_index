			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow improves in wake of a steadier dollar Wall Street AFTER A hesitant start, US stock markets showed some improvement yesterday in the wake of higher bond prices and a stable, although still vulnerable, dollar, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 14.59 up at 3,246.81, slightly below the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.90 ahead at 413.51. The American SE composite edged up 0.13 to 379.65, while the best performance came from the Nasdaq composite, which gained 4.58 at 558.80. New York SE turnover amounted to 172m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 997 to 716. A slight firming in the dollar as overseas investors took profits in the D-Mark provided the foundation for a positive day of equity trading. Investors concentrated their attention on the currency market positives, and the day's only major economic news, an unexpected 3.4 per cent decline in July durable goods orders, was mostly ignored. Although the durable goods orders are notoriously unreliable, and the bulk of last month's decline was due to a big fall in transportation orders, the overall picture of manufacturing industry's past and future orders book was one of continued weakness. Motor manufacturers were mostly firmer in active trading, boosted by Ford's strong mid-August car sales figures. Ford rose a further Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 , while General Motors put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 34 1/8 in turnover of 2.4m shares. Chrysler held at Dollars 19 1/2 . PPG Industries eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 after an order imbalance had delayed trading. The company said there was no reason for the decline, arguing that investors may have misinterpreted some recent remarks by the company's chief executive on the outlook for earnings. PPG also said its chemical plant at Lake Charles in Louisiana had not been damaged by Hurricane Andrew. As the hurricane's force dissipated after reaching the Gulf coast, insurance stocks were in mixed form, with Cigna rising Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 1/8 , Aetna firming Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 39 1/8 , Travelers steady at Dollars 20 3/4 and Geico Dollars 1 1/4 off at Dollars 56. Abbott Laboratories climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 31 1/4 . Broking house Dean Witter Reynolds added the stock to its recommended list after its health care analyst upgraded his rating on Abbott to 'buy' from 'neutral'. On the American Stock Exchange, New York Times softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 after Salomon Brothers, the broking house, raised its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the newspaper group but kept its rating on the stock unchanged at 'hold'. Canada TORONTO finished slightly firmer following light trading. The TSE 300 index was up 7.2 at 3,383.0 and rising issues led declines by 274 to 234. Volume came to 20.4m shares. Bank, pipeline and utility shares, which many investors buy for their stable yields, dominated the most active list. Nova Scotia Power, CDollars 10 7/8 , Toronto Dominion Bank, CDollars 18 3/4 , and Bank of Nova Scotia, CDollars 23 3/4 , put on CDollars  1/8 apiece. Varity gained CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 23 1/4 on posting a second-quarter profit of 37 US cents a share, against a loss of 49 cents a year earlier. Unicorp Energy, off 10 cents at CDollars 1.50, reported a slight decline in six-month net.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry called  for net tax increases to cover a revenue shortfall amid a  graying society, according to a report issued Tuesday [24 May].    The report, submitted to government tax panels and the  ruling  coalition parties, estimates Japan will face a budgetary revenue  shortage of 8.9 trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen in fiscal 2000.    Ministry officials told reporters that net increases in tax  revenues are a necessary part of tax reform because fiscal and  administrative reforms appear insufficient to cover the shortage.    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said the panel  acknowledged the tough medium- to long-term financial  conditions. However, the panel is to make its own estimates,  and revenue "neutral" is still one alternative for tax reform,  Kato told a news conference after the panel's meeting.    The advisory forum to the prime minister is scheduled to  prepare various alternatives with concrete figures for its  regional hearings in early June.    After the hearings, the panel is to begin drafting its  report  for the coalition parties and the government to decide on  promised full- fledged tax reform, including permanent tax cuts,  by the end of June.    Kato said the ministry report poses various estimates that  require the panel's further review, including in social welfare  spending, bond issuances, tax revenues and economic growth. He  noted the body will come up with more "realistic" alternatives  by including in its estimates effects from extending tax cuts.    The report estimated 24 trillion yen for welfare spending in  fiscal 2000, up from 14.6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget  plan, based on figures from a welfare vision prepared by an  advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry.    On bond issuance, the ministry projected 18 trillion yen, up  slightly from 14.4 trillion yen, in line with its policy to  limit the debt-to-expenditure ratio to 5 percent.    Kato said further discussions are necessary on appropriate  levels of bond issuance. He also ruled out the elasticity rate  of 1.1 and the nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent used by  the ministry to estimate tax revenues.    Under the report, tax revenues are expected to increase to  79.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 from an estimated 53.7 trillion  yen in fiscal 1994.    Kato said more "natural" increases in such revenues can be  expected with lower prices in line with deregulations and  administrative overhauls to stimulate consumption. But panel  members acknowledged the increases would not be enough to  finance tax cuts and heavier welfare spending, Kato said.    On the economic growth rate, many panel members held off on  any optimistic outlook, he said.</p>

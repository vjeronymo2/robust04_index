			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Midweek's television, like the midweek joint, coming round again as rissoles, has a dull, marking-time feel to it. Regulars include Between the Lines (9.30pm BBC1), which has lost its bite since its principal coppers were booted out of the force. The old setting - police investigating complaints against the police - had a frighteningly contagious tendency to paranoia and conspiracy theories. The new format is still watchable but disappointingly conventional. A big night for sport, with Oo-ah Cantona, an entente cordiale on his own, returning to Manchester United in The Champions League (7.20pm, ITV), while boxing features prominently in BBC 1's Sportsnight (10.20pm). Those who do not find Baldrick in Blackadder the most uningratiatingly unfunny stooge in the history of comedy will like Tony Robinson's trip to the Caribbean in this week's Great Journeys (9.25pm, BBC2). Or try Syrup, a Cannes prizewinner in the Short and Curlies series (9.45pm, Channel 4), the engaging mini-fable of poor little Baldy George, who finds fulfilment one lunch-hour with the acquisition of a head of thatch.</p>

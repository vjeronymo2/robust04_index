			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for </F> foreign and commonwealth affairs, by satellite from his London  office by Mehmet Ali Birand on the "Crossfire" program -- live,  in English with superimposed Turkish translation]    [Text] [Birand] Now, sir, there are a number of reports  circulating in the Turkish press that you have given the green  light for an independent Kurdish state. Is this true?    [Hurd] We do not believe that an independent Kurdish state  is possible.    [Birand] Let us move on to the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] problem. What is your government's position on the  PKK?    [Hurd] We are against the violation of laws. The London  metropolitan police units have established a special unit to  deal with PKK crimes. We are very familiar what it takes to  fight terrorism. We, therefore, will not allow any acts of  terror and violence within our borders.    [Birand] But you are not banning the PKK?    [Hurd] Our laws do not permit such a measure. This alone  cannot be effective. The important thing is the effective  enforcement of the laws.    [Birand] You and your prime minister, John Major, met with  the Turkish Prime Minister in Brussels. Did she promise you  that she would be solving the Cyprus problem? Your prime  minister, addressing the British parliament, said that she did  make such a promise. Is this true?    [Hurd] Mrs. Ciller said that she very much wants progress on  the Cyprus issue. The two prime ministers share the same views  on the issue. We, the British, believe that this problem has  lasted for too long and that it will become more dangerous with  time. Now we are faced with an opportunity. The UN secretary  general is exerting efforts toward development. He is waiting  for a reply, a result. The Turkish government is standing by  these efforts. There is a Turkish Cypriot community and elected  officials in Northern Cyprus. I hope that they will be in favor  of a development as well. I hope that they will establish  cooperation with the officials in Nicosia. Now is the right  time. If we miss this opportunity then I am concerned for the  future.    [Birand] Now, you are going to be in Ankara on Wednesday [19  January] be the main topic of the talks?    [Hurd] Yes this is true, I am looking forward to this visit.  I want to listen to the views of my Turkish colleague, the  Turkish prime minister. I would like to hear about Turkey's  view on the situation in the world and the Caucasus and  Turkish-European relations. This is very important. I am  personally most interested in the development of these  relations. I hope that Turkey's position within the European  Community will progress. We will probably discuss the issues  concerning Cyprus and Iraq. We have a very long agenda. I am  looking forward to it. Turkey has a very significant part in  British foreign policy.    [Birand] Mr. Minister, I thank you. I will be very happy to  see you in Ankara. I thank you again.</p>

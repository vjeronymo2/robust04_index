			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Moscow rejects peace talks offer from Chechnya: Russian aircraft bomb Chechen capital amid reports of troop advances The Russian government last night rejected an offer of peace talks by Chechnya's president, Gen Dzhokar Dudayev, amid reports that Russian troops were advancing on Grozny, the capital of the breakaway republic. Itar-Tass, the Russian government agency, reported fighting but it was not clear if a full-scale attack was taking place. Early today Russian aircraft carried out sorties over the city, twice dropping bombs. On the political front, stalemate between the Russian and Chechen leaderships continued when Moscow brushed aside Gen Dudayev's offer, in a telegram, of talks in Grozny. Earlier President Boris Yeltsin had demanded that Gen Dudayev meet senior Russian officials at the Russian military base of Mozdok, near the Chechen border. Russia had called for Gen Dudayev to negotiate an agreement on handing over weapons, and set a deadline of midnight on Saturday. 'There will be no more responses to Dzhokhar Dudayev's telegrams,' said President Yeltsin's press office last night, adding that Russia's resolve to restore order in Chechnya would be 'implemented in full'. During daylight hours yesterday there were relatively light engagements between the Russian division to the north of Grozny and the Chechen forces - even though the Russian deadline had expired. Just across the Chechen border with Ingushetia nine Chechens were reported shot dead after Russian soldiers opened fire on a convoy of cars. The stand-off threatened not just the stability of other northern Caucasian republics but that of the Russian administration. Mr Yeltsin faces the agonising choice between committing troops to a bloodbath or seeking a compromise which may be seen by the army and Russian nationalist forces as a betrayal. The skirmishes between the Russian and Chechen forces have seen a Russian general in the field, supported by some of his superiors, refuse to fight. The past week has also seen the splintering of Russia's liberal-democratic forces over the issue, and hostility or at best scepticism from the parliament towards the administration's actions. Threats on the part of senior officials have not been followed through in spite of the flouting of three separate Russian deadlines. In a publicity coup, Gen Dudayev has asked Turkey to mediate in the conflict, according to the Turkish foreign ministry. The ministry said he had sent a telegram to President Suleyman Demirel, saying he was willing to stop fighting and 'find a peaceful solution' with Turkish help. The ministry statement said Turkey had been first to voice its concerns over developments in Chechnya and that 'it has become obvious that Turkey's concerns were warranted'. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish premier, said in a separate message to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, that the Turkish people were worried about the fighting. The Chechens, like the Turks, are largely Moslem and had in the past been part of the Turkish empire. The conflict has already provoked warnings from the Confederation of Caucasian Peoples, which aims to unite the region's republics, that if there is a war, 'it would not be a Russian-Chechen war, it would be a Russian-Caucasian war'. Mr Yeltsin sent troops to the mountainous region of about 1m people after it had defied Kremlin rule for three years. Russian government officials say 14,000 Chechens have fled Grozny since the troops went in. Many headed for Dagestan or Ingushetia, two other autonomous regions on Russia's southern rim. We are the liberators, say Chechens, Page 2</p>

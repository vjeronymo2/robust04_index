			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Act now to avoid zero inflation - Motoring / Investment in a good set of tyres before the bad weather sets in could be a lifesaver Hands up if you know what tyres you have on your own or your company car. Just as I thought. Only about one in 10 of you. Do you have any idea of their correct inflation pressure? Have you checked them in the past three months? And what about the depth of tread pattern: is it nearing the legal minimum of 1.6mm? Do you know if they are wearing evenly? Have you examined the side-walls for damage? I can guess the answer and your conscience should be pricking just a little. At the mention of tyres, most motorists' eyes glaze over. They find them boring and unreliable, liable to let the driver down at awkward times and unreasonably expensive to replace. Today's high-performance cars demand so much from their tyres that, for safety's sake, an insignificant-looking hole can mean a tyre has to be scrapped. The industry says that, ideally, new tyres should be acquired four at a time, but if a pair is bought, they should always go on the rear wheels because, although people worry about sudden front-tyre deflations or skids, rear ones are much more likely to cause a loss of control. Oddly, when you ask how much new tyres for a typical family car will cost, dealers usually start with the cheapest. There are good deals to be had, providing you do not insist on the most familiar brand names. Some tyres factory-fitted to new cars in Europe and Japan have names you may never have heard before, but there is nothing wrong with them, so buy them. Tyres are not always the ultimate distress purchase. They have become a fashion item, and image-conscious motorists re-equip their cars with new wheels and ultra-low profile tyres only 40 per cent as high in cross-section as they are wide. These are reckoned to make a sporty car look irresistibly sexy, but this is a matter of opinion. What is not in doubt is that they can ruin ride comfort, affect handling, and make a car unstable in rain and undriveable on snow. You can, however, improve a car with a sensible change of tyres - say, a set of all-season tyres such as Goodyear's Vectra. These are patterned boldly with a tread made from a rubber compound that grips even in very low temperatures. They make winter driving easier, but work as well as normal tyres on dry roads. The drive, braking and steering of a car all depend on the tread of the four tyres. In extreme conditions, their grip can make the difference between life and death. For years, the industry has been trying to persuade us to treat our tyres with more respect. A little care, it says, can make our motoring much safer, especially in wet and slippery winter months. Care translates into a monthly pressure-check with a gauge (kicking the side-wall really will not do) and a quick look round. But far too few of us do it. When you see a driver changing a wheel on a motorway hard shoulder, do not be too sympathetic. The tyre that suddenly went flat at 70mph could have been losing pressure for days and had probably been topped-up once or twice when the driver stopped for fuel. Tyres do not go down on their own. Something small and sharp in the tread makes a tubeless tyre lose air slowly. If undetected, the tyre may heat and fail suddenly on a motorway. Prevention is better than cure. So, if you suspect tyre trouble, go to the nearest specialist outlet. National chains such as Kwik-Fit and ATS and hundreds of smaller independents provide drive-in tyre service and are always happy to run a safety and slow-puncture check. Recreational 4x4s are usually sold with tyres more suitable for on-road than off-road use because that is where most of them spend their working lives. But if you do spend a lot of time off-road, going up one size and choosing a pattern with chunky shoulders will give more grip to keep you on the move when the going is really rough. Equally, a small increase in tyre width gives any car sharper steering response without making the ride unacceptably hard. But always consult the car or tyre manufacturer before making any radical change.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Radio City shares jump RADIO CITY (Sound of Merseyside), the USM-quoted commercial radio company based in Liverpool, has been approached by a potential bidder, writes Jane Fuller. Yesterday's announcement followed a rise in the A share price from 219p to 269p in little more than a week, and sparked a further surge to 301p. This valued the 2.2m non-voting A shares at Pounds 6.6m. There are also 400,000 ordinary shares, of which about 30 per cent are held by Mr Terry Smith, managing director, and other board members. Radio City's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 880,000 (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.3m) in the year to September. The launch of a new station, City Talk, was a factor behind the dwindling of cash held to Pounds 5,000 (Pounds 640,000). Other shareholders include Capital Radio with 5.9 per cent, Higsons Brewery with 10 per cent and GMWU general work-ers union with 6.6 per cent.</p>

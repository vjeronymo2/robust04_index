			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Conciliatory Overtures"] </F>   [Text] After 14 years of mutual animosity between the  United States and the Islamic Republic, American determination  to avoid contacts with Iran seems to have diminished.    The U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and  Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau,  have recently made statements indicative of U.S. intentions to  open a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic.    Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the  legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding  international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the  political realities of the Islamic Republic.    Pelletreau recently told the House of Representatives'  Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs that the United States will not  try to destabilize the government of Iran and no longer  considers the Islamic Republic to be a temporary phenomenon.  Washington's apparent change of heart is motivated by two  objectives. First, since the demise of the international  bipolar political power structure, and due to the ambiguous  nature of the emerging `new world order,' Europe has exercised  its right to make political decisions independent of the U.S.,  and has therefore gained increasing influence in the Middle  East. Most European countries, in defiance of the United  States, have established and maintained cordial relations with  Iran, thereby limiting American influence in this region.    Second, the failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace  talks has prompted Washington to consider using Tehran's  spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive and  legitimize the peace accord, and to indirectly contain what it  perceives to be the epidemic spreading of 'Islamic  fundamentalism' in the Muslim Middle East.    Realizing and accepting global realities, America is eagerly  awaiting to reoccupy its dominant position in the Middle East.  Iran has all along endeavored to stay faithful to its own  Islamic Revolution while leaving open the possibility of  reconciliation with the U.S. provided that America releases  Iran's assets, which are frozen in U.S. banks, and refrains from  covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and destabilizing  the Islamic Republic.    Considering the resulting benefits for both sides, if  relations are indeed re-established, the United States stands to  gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should be prepared to  make greater concessions. Iranian officials are well aware of  this fact and will base their demands and proposals accordingly.</p>

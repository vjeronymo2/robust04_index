			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS FACE OFF ON BILINGUAL CLASSES  </P> <P> Two groups of Latino parents marched outside a Sun Valley school Wednesday, one  of them loudly chanting support for bilingual education and the other quietly  backing teachers seeking the program's end.  </P> <P> Gloria Soto, a parent who organized the group at Glenwood School that supports  the anti-bilingual teachers, said, "The purpose of the march is to let the  community and the district know that there has been so much slander regarding  LEAD and the teachers at Glenwood."  </P> <P> LEAD is Learning English Advocates Drive, a statewide teachers group organized  by a Glenwood teacher who opposes teaching non-English-speaking students mainly  in their native language.  </P> <P> Soto's group carried bilingual signs that bore slogans such as "LEAD Loves All  Children" and "Parents Support Sally Peterson," LEAD's founder.  </P> <P> "We know what's going on at our school, and we know our students," said Soto, a  longtime parent at the elementary school. "Mrs. Peterson doesn't want to  abolish bilingual education. She wants reform."  </P> <P> Soto said that many Spanish-speaking students are kept in bilingual classrooms  long after they become fluent in English. As a result, she said, they enter  junior high school far behind their English-speaking classmates.  </P> <P> Soon after Soto's group of about 15 began walking, the second group of about 30  began demonstrating nearby. The second group, made up of parents from across  the district, denounced LEAD and later argued with the Glenwood parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latinos Parents Protest  </P> <P> The bilingual supporters also had demonstrated April 18 at Glenwood, when about  50 Latino parents from across Los Angeles protested LEAD's attempts to abolish  the school district's bilingual education plan. Some of the parents who  participated in last week's protest turned up again Wednesday, carrying what  appeared to be hastily written placards touting bilingual education.  </P> <P> LEAD "is against bilingual education because they cannot work with  Spanish-language students," said Francisco Gonzalez, a parent from 28th Street  School in central Los Angeles. "Under the new master plan, bilingual education  will go very well, but these LEAD parents oppose it."  </P> <P> The master plan emphasizes putting bilingual teachers in every classroom with  more than 10 students who are not fluent in English.  </P> <P> The 22,000 members of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers' union, are  voting by mail on a LEAD proposal to reject a proposed $5,000 bonus for  bilingual teachers. Teachers who are not bilingual, but who are teaching in a  bilingual classroom, would be asked to learn Spanish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Demand  </P> <P> The district and union officials argue that rejecting the bonus could bring the  end of bilingual education in Los Angeles because bilingual teachers are much  in demand and could seek higher wages elsewhere. Results of that vote will be  known next month.  </P> <P> Peterson, a Glenwood kindergarten teacher, said the march "was a loving gesture  . . . and I thought it was fabulous."  </P> <P> She said LEAD, which draws financial support from conservative English-only  groups, does not oppose bilingual education. LEAD supports teaching students in  English with assistance from bilingual aides, she said.  </P></p>

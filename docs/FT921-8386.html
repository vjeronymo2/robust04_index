			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Iveco to set up Czech venture IVECO, the truck and industrial vehicle arm of Fiat, is to create a joint venture with Tatra, the Czech vehicle producer. Mercedes-Benz recently announced plans to acquire stakes Avia and Liaz, Czechoslovakia's other two truckmakers. Iveco will pay Dollars 20m for 51 per cent of a new company to which Tatra will contribute land. Tatra expects the new company to produce 500 trucks a year by 1993. Tatra is Czechoslovakia's leading producer of heavy off-road trucks. In 1991, it produced an estimated 10,500 trucks, of which a large portion was sold to Siberian oil companies. The company intends to privatise itself using the voucher programme, which consists of the distribution to the public of vouchers which become shares once the country's privatisation scheme is completed. Mercedes-Benz, part of the German Daimler-Benz group, plans to take a 31 per cent stake in Avia as well as a 20 per cent stake in Liaz, Czechoslovakia's other two truck companies. Avia, which produced 9,000 light trucks in 1991, lost most of its export markets but has successfully increased its domestic sales. Liaz, on the other hand, produced a third of its 1990 sales level, making 5,000 heavy on-road trucks last year. All three deals are awaiting approval of the Czech government which has criticised some of the requirements put forward by Mercedes-Benz. These include higher tariffs on the import of utility vehicles in Czechoslovakia and important tax breaks.</p>

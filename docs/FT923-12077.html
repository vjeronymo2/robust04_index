			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Advisers split over ban on Halcion A SPLIT has emerged within UK health authorities over whether to continue a ban on Halcion, the world's best-selling sleeping treatment. The ban, imposed last October, precipitated a worldwide health scare about the drug and a 50 per cent slide in Halcion sales by Upjohn, its leading manufacturer. The Medicines Control Agency, the licensing body that acts on behalf of UK health ministers, proposes to ignore advice by the Medicines Commission, the UK's senior medicines review body. The commission has advised that Halcion, also known as triazolam, should be re-licensed. Doctors should be allowed to prescribe patients doses of 0.125mg and 0.25mg, although only in tablets of 0.125mg, it recommended. However, health ministers and the agency propose to continue the ban on both 0.125mg and 0.25mg doses. The Department of Health said it believed it was only the second time the agency had ignored the advice of the commission. Upjohn said it would appeal. The agency is bidding to become one of the EC's leading licensing authorities. New licensing procedures proposed by the European Commission will allow licensing authorities to compete against each other. Dr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chief executive, said: 'We're encouraged by the opinion of the Medicines Commission regarding the 0.125mg tablet. We will take all the steps we need to in order to get this product restored to patients and physicians in the UK.' The decision to ban Halcion in the Uk was based on three sets of data. At the time, the authorities were concerned about: A US safety trial in which the UK authorities believed 14 out of 30 subjects on triazolam had psychiatric side-effects compared with three out of 20 on placebo. Pre-marketing trials of more than 14 days that appeared to show that 18.9 per cent of patients on doses of 0.5mg triazolam withdrew compared with 5.4 per cent on placebo. Spontaneous adverse reactions reported by doctors in the US and UK. Upjohn says the trials data have been misinterpreted. It also says the frequency of adverse reaction reporting has a direct relationship to media attention.</p>

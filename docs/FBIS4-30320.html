			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA)-- Pyongyang-based papers  today observe the 20th anniversary of the establishment of  diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.    The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two  countries reflects the common aspirations and desire of the two  peoples to develop, supporting and cooperating with each other  on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, says NODONG  SINMUN in a by-lined article.    Noting that the building of a new society is now being  stepped up at a new stage in Laos, the article says:    A vigorous drive to modernize the country by the end of 2000  is now under way in Laos and its face is improving.    Laos is actively striving to achieve regional peace and  stability.    The Korean people will as ever make active efforts to  develop  the friendly and cooperative relations with the Laotian people.    A signed article of MINJU CHOSON says the Korean people are  rejoiced over the achievements made by the Laotian people in the  building of a new society and wish them greater stride forward  in their future work.</p>

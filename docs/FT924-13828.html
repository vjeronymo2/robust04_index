			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Maybank pre-tax up 26.1% to MDollars 560m MAYBANK, Malaysia's biggest banking group, has reported taxable profits of MDollars 560m (USDollars 223.3m) for the year to June, a rise of 26.1 per cent on the previous year's figure. Maybank's commercial and merchant banking activities accounted for MDollars 472m of the 1992 profits. Finance and leasing operations contributed MDollars 72m, with other activities contributing the remainder. Maybank has concentrated on its home market and therefore benefited from the rapid growth of the Malaysian economy over the past four years. More than 80 per cent of the group's taxable profits came from its operations in Malaysia, while about 12 per cent came from activities in Singapore. Maybank also has operations in Brunei, Hong Kong, London and New York. Mr Ahmad Mohamed Don, managing director, said growth prospects for the bank continued to be favourable given the continued growth of the Malaysian economy. In each of the last four years, Malaysia's economy has grown by more than 8 per cent. The latest estimates are for growth of 8.7 per cent this year. Mr Ahmad also announced that Maybank had acquired a life insurance licence through the MDollars 15m purchase of Safety Life &amp; General Insurance. The life insurance business in Malaysia is considered to be underdeveloped, and Mr Ahmad said the sector had the potential for long-term growth. According to Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, the number of new life insurance policies rose by 25 per cent in 1991.</p>

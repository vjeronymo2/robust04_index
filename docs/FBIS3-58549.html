Indicating that for Greece to try to do something in a sea  in  which Turkey has interests would lead to problems, President  Demirel said: "When I say these things, they immediately get  offended. I am not the one creating tension. I merely want all  the problems to be resolved peacefully."    Indicating that Greece has nothing to be gained in the  present situation by fomenting and escalating a crisis with  Turkey, the president said: "You are not always at fault in a  traffic accident. You might be a very good driver, but someone  might come along and collide with you."    When reminded that he brought Prime Minister Ciller into  politics, Demirel said he cannot comment on the prime minister's  statements and views and added: "Whether I defend or criticize  them, it will still open the way to various speculations. I am  not an inspector of the prime minister; I too am a mere voting  citizen."</p>

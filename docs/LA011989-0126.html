			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES NEED WINFIELD, WITH WASHINGTON GONE  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner may have to reconsider his position on ridding himself of  Dave Winfield after Tuesday's announcement that free-agent outfielder Claudell  Washington had bolted from the New York Yankees to accept a 3-year contract  with the Angels for $2.625 million.  </P> <P> The Yankees were having difficult negotiations with Washington, but he had  expected to re-sign with them until about two weeks ago, when the Angels came  in with their offer. "Believe me, I didn't want to go," Washington said from  his home in Orinda, Calif. "The Yankees more or less forced me out of town. If  I had my choice I would have remained a Yankee."  </P> <P> General Manager Bob Quinn said the Yankees were unwilling to match the length  of the Angels' contract. "We didn't feel it was appropriate to give a  34-year-old outfielder a three-year contract," Quinn said. "He had a career  year (in 1988). Historically he has played extremely well in (the final year of  his contract) and not as well after that. The third year (in the Angels' offer)  surprised us. We were talking about two years and an option." The Yankees are  believed to have offered about $1.8 million over the two years.  </P> <P> Washington hit .308 last season, with 11 home runs and 64 RBI in 455 at-bats.  He played in 126 games and stole 15 bases.  </P> <P> Quinn said the Yankees had no plans to go outside the organization for another  center fielder. Roberto Kelly is likely to get a shot at playing every day.  Kelly, a right-handed hitter, was supposed to have platooned in center field  with Washington last season, but a sprained left wrist limited him to 38 games.  </P> <P> Stanley Jefferson, acquired from the San Diego Padres in the Jack Clark trade,  will get a look, but he brings a reputation as a light hitter.  </P> <P> It is also possible new Manager Dallas Green will try to persuade Rickey  Henderson to move from left field to center. Under Lou Piniella, Henderson  balked at playing center.  </P> <P> In any case, with Washington and Clark gone, the Yankees may not be able to  afford losing Winfield's bat.  </P> <P> Washington's agent, Tom Reich, is a good friend of Steinbrenner's, and both  worked on moving Clark to the Padres. But Quinn had warned that Steinbrenner's  relationship with Reich probably would not help in these negotiations.  </P> <P> Washington expected the Yankees to duplicate the Angels' offer. "You would  think so," he said. "But they didn't and I had to do what was best for me and  my family."  </P> <P> Washington, 34, will receive $2.625 million during the life of the contract. He  will get a $300,000 signing bonus, $875,000 this year, $575,000 in 1990 and  $875,000 in 1991. He can earn an additional $50,000 per year in performance  bonuses.  </P> <P> Washington said that even with the Angels' offer in hand, he had to think twice  about leaving the Yankees, who had acquired him from the Atlanta Braves for Ken  Griffey in 1986. Washington became one of the more popular players among his  Yankees teammates. "It was real tough; I'm going to miss every one of them," he  said. "I wish them all the best. I hope they wish the same for me. We had far  more good times than bad times."  </P> <P> The left-handed-hitting Washington has a lifetime batting average of .280, with  150 home runs, 773 runs batted in and 295 stolen bases.  </P></p>

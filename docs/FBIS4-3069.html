			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yuan Jianda (5913 1696 6671) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- DONG BIWU, a full-length  pictorial on Dong Biwu's brilliant militant life, was published  on the occasion of his 108th birthday. More than 200 people  attended a discussion meeting in the Great Hall of the People  this morning to mark the publication of the pictorial. They  included personages of the judicial and jurisprudential circles  and Dong's relatives and aides.    Wang Hanbin, Song Ping, Song Renqiong, Ren Jianxin, Sun  Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Guangying, Zhang Siqing, Wang Ping,  Wu Xiuquan, Jiang Hua, Chen Xilian, Lu Zhengcao, Zheng  Tianxiang, and Wang Heshou attended a publishing ceremony and  the discussion.    Comrade Dong Biwu was one of the founders of the CPC. He was  an outstanding party and state leader, as well as the principal  founder of the people's judiciary during the period of the new  democratic revolution and socialist construction. He held  concurrent posts as vice premier of the central people's  government and chairman of the political and law committee. He  also served successively as president of the Supreme People's  Court and acting president of the People's Republic of China.    The pictorial, compiled by the China Revolutionary Museum,  contains a large number of photographs showing Dong Biwu's  activities during various periods from the bourgeois democratic  revolution to the new democratic revolution and socialist  construction.    Bo Yibo made a written speech to greet the publication of  the  pictorial. He said: Comrade Dong Biwu was a great  revolutionary. He unselfishly dedicated his entire brilliant  life to the liberation and prosperity of the Chinese nation and  to the independence and prosperity of our country. We should  learn from his great spirit and lofty character, work hard with  one heart and one mind under the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and build well  socialism with Chinese characteristics as Comrade Xiaoping has  advocated.    Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, delivered  a speech at the meeting. He highly praised Comrade Dong Biwu  for having made outstanding contributions to China's revolution  and construction and particularly to China's legal system during  his several decades of revolutionary career. He said: Comrade  Dong Biwu dedicated himself to the formulation of China's  socialist legal system. He profoundly expounded Marxist views  on state and law, summed up the historical experience of the  building of the people's regime and the formulation of the legal  system, and explained and proposed a series of policies and  principles on strengthening the socialist legal system. His  far-sighted views and propositions remain an important guidance  for us to uphold the policy of "building both material and  spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both"  and to further strengthen democracy and the legal system.</p>

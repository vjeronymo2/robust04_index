			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden sceptical over Kazarian Mr Paul Kazarian, the US investor trying to launch a last-minute bid for Borden, the troubled food group, has told the company he is prepared to offer between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 for each Borden share. The offer is considerably more than the Dollars 14.25 a share bid launched by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist, last week. Presenting himself as a potential white knight, Mr Kazarian said that he and his Rhode Island investment firm, Japonica Partners, wanted to take a stake of between 20 and 90 per cent. Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster consumer products group, said he had a plan for rebuilding Borden that should increase the value of its equity to between Dollars 22 and Dollars 25 a share in 1995. Borden's management, however, remains sceptical. It says that Mr Kazarian has yet to make any firm proposal, and that he has given no indications of how an offer would be financed. The company's meeting with Mr Kazarian comes at a time when some of Borden's shareholders have become increasingly vocal in their complaints against the terms of KKR's offer. Some institutional investors have given notice that they will refuse to tender their shares to KKR when the offer formally opens. Borden's board was due to meet late yesterday evening to approve a definite merger agreement with KKR ahead of today's deadline. The company's shares were ahead Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 in early trading.</p>

In reply to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what  concrete results he hopes to achieve in the course of his visit  to the FRG, the Russian defense minister emphasized at the  airport: They will primarily be in questions of expanding  bilateral cooperation between our countries within the framework  of the agreements signed in April 1993. Particular attention  will be paid to the education of our servicemen in the FRG and  of German servicemen in Russian higher military educational  establishments. A number of questions will be discussed  concerning German-Russian military-technical cooperation, since  part of the military hardware in the Bundeswehr's arsenal was  produced here. There is special interest in questions of its  modernization and recycling.    Much attention will be paid to the problems of withdrawing  the Western Group of Forces from German territory, the Russian  military department chief noted in particular.</p>

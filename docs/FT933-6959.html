			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Beijing seizes financial controls: The World Bank's path to cooling the economy CHINA'S economy is, in the World Bank's terminology, 'half-reformed'. Its excesses have to be curbed by a delicate mix of telling people what to do - as in the old days of central planning - and indirect measures which rely more on the working of market forces. Given the complexity of the task, it was not without reason that Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy, turned in June to the World Bank for advice on how to deal with the extraordinary boom which had resulted from the most recent round of market-oriented reforms. China has long respected the bank's advice. Mr Zhu's direct request to a team of visiting economists for assistance on dealing with an overheated economy indicated its continuing influence with the Beijing government. Before taking action to slow growth, however, he wanted to be sure that the economy was indeed overheating. The response from the World Bank was unequivocal. According to its annual study completed in June, massive growth in fixed investment was pushing up prices of raw materials at a rate of nearly 40 per cent. Real estate and securities prices were rising sharply, and excess demand was creating bottlenecks in transport and electricity. 'It is clear that the economy is now overheating, and that growth at current rates is not sustainable,' the bank said. However, it believed swift action could prevent a 'hard landing' and could maintain economic growth of 8 to 9 per cent - still fast, but below the heady 13 per cent pace of 1992. For three days in June, a team of its economists - accompanied by a few foreign economists from outside the bank - conferred with Chinese officials at Dalian in north-east China on exactly what actions should be taken to cool the economy while maintaining the pace of reform. A central theme underlying their recommendations was for the government to seize control of the financial system and of macroeconomic management, while not choking off the development of market mechanisms. At the heart of China's problems, in their view, was the inability of the central bank, the People's Bank of China, to exert monetary control. There was little discipline over banks' lending (none at all over non-bank financial institutions), little use of interest rates as a monetary instrument and little attention paid to flows of foreign exchange. The People's Bank was itself increasingly engaged in commercial activities. A large proportion of the reforms suggested by the team centred around the issue of financial control. The People's Bank, they said, should be radically re-structured 'to turn it into a real central bank'. It should abandon all activities, such as ownership of securities companies and mutual funds, which were not the function of a central bank. Three weeks after the conference at Dalian, Mr Zhu installed himself as governor of the People's Bank and began the recommended changes. On monetary policy itself, the foreign advisers suggested an increase of at least 3 to 5 percentage points in the one-year deposit rate and an even greater increase in lending rates. Other interest rates should also rise with the aim of pushing all above the inflation rate, which had risen to around 14 per cent by the end of the first half. The previous increase in rates, on May 15, was judged insufficient and harmful to the banking system because deposit rates were raised by more than lending rates. On July 11, one-year deposit rates were increased from 9.18 to 10.98 per cent, and the lending rate from 9.36 to 10.98 per cent. Three-year government bond coupons went up from 12.52 to 13.96 per cent. Thus, longer-term rates have become positive relative to inflation, though not yet short-term rates. The economists suggested that rate increases be accompanied by a rigorous tightening of bank supervision, including a reduction of liquidity through increased reserve requirements. Credit ceilings should be enforced and applied to all lending institutions, they said. They recommended an acceleration of moves towards a unified exchange rate. The authorities have since intervened in the swap market to bolster the yuan, encouraging those who had been hoarding foreign currencies in expectation of further weakness of the yuan to buy the Chinese currency. The gap between the official and swap market rates has therefore narrowed. While the measures detailed so far essentially relied upon a market response which would have the effect of slowing economic growth - such as reduced and more judicious bank lending - some direct action was also called for. The effect of official exhortations to faster growth had been to encourage local governments all over the country to pour money into property and industrial schemes. They would give preferential tax treatment to such projects by designating the construction areas as development zones. Financed by easy lending, these schemes contributed enormously to the economic boom, commanding huge volumes of raw materials and pushing up their prices. They also caused a loss of tax revenue, worsening an already large budget deficit. This was a sensitive political issue because it involved wresting back to the centre some control which had been allowed to devolve to local authorities. The economists at Dalian said they 'recognise that there will be resistance to enforcing planning commission controls over investment at the local level'. But their carefully worded conclusion was that 'a key task for the central government at the present time is to achieve consensus on the need for a reduced investment rate'. The government has since closed many development zones and cracked down on wasteful or corrupt local plans. These changes represent only a small part of the World Bank's overall blueprint for Chinese economic reform. Further deregulation of prices and trade as well as re-structuring of the tax system, incomes policy, and state-owned enterprises are all recommended. The economic boom, however, has focused the urgent attention of both China and its advisers on the financial system, an area which had so far virtually escaped reform. Underlining its importance, the World Bank is to hold further workshops with Chinese officials next month on reforming the People's Bank and on re-structuring banks so that they are no longer involved in 'policy lending'  -state-directed lending for the purpose of subsidising state enterprises, or the financing of costly long-term development projects. Although massive hurdles - both economic and political - face China's economic managers, World Bank economists believe the steps taken so far to deal with overheating are in the right direction, and they expect more. The extent to which the desired solutions depend on the market's response, however, shows how far economic reform in China has already come.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MARSHLAND REVIVED AFTER HARD WORK ON OIL SPILL;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A REMARKABLE RECOVERY IN AN ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE REGION TOOK 14  MONTHS AND COST SHELL OIL CO. $12 MILLION.  </P> <P> Crawdads crawl and killdeer call again less than two years after 440,000  gallons of oil spilled into an intricately sensitive marshland here.  </P> <P> "It's not totally OK, but I would say it's 90% back," said Richard Bogaert, the  biologist who monitors the 120-acre wetlands. "The marsh shrubs and grasses  seem to have grown back, coming up from the roots. And we've had good nesting  this year: pintail ducks, mallards, cinnamon teals."  </P> <P> The remarkable recovery had its price. It took 14 months and cost Shell Oil Co.  $12 million, nearly $30 for each gallon spilled. A small part of that money was  paid to fishermen, but most was spent on labor-intensive oil cleanup, said Bill  Sharkey, community relations manager for Shell.  </P> <P> This success does not necessarily inspire hope about the thousands of oil  spills reported to the Coast Guard each year, including the 11 million gallons  that coated 9,600 square miles of Alaskan waters and shoreline in late March.  Each spill is different.  </P> <P> Mike Rugg, a water-quality biologist who was the state's overseer at the  Martinez cleanup, is hesitant to draw comparisons between the Alaskan spill and  the Martinez marsh.  </P> <P> "The amount was so different up there and conditions are so different," he  said. "You've got open ocean there and the arctic weather. And the equipment  that we used was not available there."  </P> <P> The Martinez wetland's thick stands of cattails and acres of dusty green  pickleweed were cleaned manually, square foot by square foot. Crews of 20  contract laborers worked 40 hours a week for six months. They sought out oiled  plants and trimmed them down to ground level, trying not to disturb their  roots.  </P> <P> "The marsh is like tundra in that human footprints damage it," Bogaert said.  "That opens up the area for annual grasses and weeds that replace the marsh  habitat. The marsh's grasses and shrubs are perennials and take longer to get  established. They're battling it out right now in some areas."  </P> <P> The wetland is unusual in that its pre-spill condition was well documented. The  marsh has been maintained by the Mountain View Sanitary District since 1984 to  provide habitat for migratory birds and other creatures that need the  now-scarce wetlands.  </P> <P> Bogaert, who works for the district, has observed waterfowl and analyzed water  nutrients at this marsh and another owned by the district for eight years. He  had completed his spring bird census just days before the flood of heavy crude  oil started down Peyton Slough toward the marsh on April 22, 1988. A drainpipe  in a 12-million-gallon storage tank at the Shell refinery a quarter-mile away  had ruptured, and a safety valve that was supposed to be closed was open.  </P> <P> In much of the marsh and the slough, Bogaert said, the oil was a black carpet  about four inches thick, suffocating everything in its path, down to the  bacteria. Hundreds of birds died.  </P> <P> Early on, the spill managers decided to sacrifice the wetlands, hoping to  contain the spill and prevent further damage downstream. Workers dammed the odd  little wildlife oasis, which is sandwiched between an interstate freeway and a  railroad line. It became a holding pond for the tide of poison.  </P> <P> "About half the oil was recovered from the marsh and Peyton Slough," said Rugg,  who works for California's Department of Fish and Game. The remainder was  distributed downstream in the slough and in the nearby open waters of Carquinez  Strait and Suisun Bay.  </P> <P> The oil tainted other wetlands, although less severely than the district's  marsh, and fouled some rocky intertidal zones.  </P> <P> "Altogether," Rugg said, "about 50 miles of coastline were affected to one  degree or another. About five to eight miles were severely affected."  </P> <P> Rugg, whose job is to make sure that cleanups comply with state requirements,  has worked in the aftermath of about 20 major oil spills since 1970 in San  Francisco Bay. He says that each spill requires a decision on how aggressively  to respond. "We have to take into account the residual damage from the cleanup  itself."  </P> <P> In a marsh, he said, "foot traffic can drive the oil into the substrate. That  damages the root structure and can result in more loss of habitat and  vegetation than just leaving the oil there.  </P> <P> "The oil companies, in general, have taken the position that oil, being a  biodegradable material, will break down in time and any cleanup in the fragile  areas will cause more damage than benefits."  </P> <P> Rugg recognizes some merit in that position, he said, "but in this case, we had  endangered species and migratory birds using these wetlands. The potential  effect of oiling on these birds was so severe that immediate cleanup and  removal of the oil was prudent."  </P> <P> In the first stage of the cleanup, as much oil as possible was vacuumed off by  trucks at the marsh's edge.  </P> <P> From there, the wetlands crews had to step more lightly. The marsh was drained  to harden the top layer of soil, so walking on it wouldn't damage roots. Drying  out the marsh didn't hurt it because wetlands are seasonal and dry up in summer  under normal circumstances.  </P> <P> After the earth was firm, around mid-June, 1988, laborers began mowing down the  oil-fouled salt grass, spike rush, and alkali heath with hand-held weed-cutting  tools. They bagged the cuttings and carried them out on their backs.  </P> <P> "They had the whole marsh marked off with little stakes and flags," Bogaert  said. The root systems of the perennials survived for the most part. And with  the wetland's reflooding this fall and winter, the marsh recreated itself.  </P> <P> Bogaert is still concerned with the oil's long-term effects in the nearby  waters, where cleanup couldn't be so thorough. "This spill has been cleaned up.  But that's not the end of its impact," he said. "The effects show up in the  reproductive cycles of marine animals: with lower fertilization success, lower  embryo survival rates, lower larvae survival."  </P> <P> But any of that, he said, will be hard to blame on one spill.  </P> <P> "The oil got so dispersed that it will be difficult to find effects that stand  out from the background pollution -- from the tanker traffic, the refineries,  and the industrial traffic."  </P> <P> In the course of this and other cleanups, Rugg has come across areas tainted by  old residues of oil spills. They form a tar-like surface over the shoreline, he  said: "It never recovers."  </P> <P> In contrast, he said, at the marsh and in the rocky areas cleaned after the  Shell spill, laborers carefully removed as much oil as possible and then  allowed nature to work. "What we learned from this spill," Rugg said, "was that  if you can effectively remove the oil, recovery is almost immediate."  </P></p>

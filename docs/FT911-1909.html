			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Ruling on late VAT payment PERSISTENT DELAY by customers in settling debts can provide businesses with a reasonable excuse for not paying value added tax on time, the High Court ruled yesterday. Mr Justice Kennedy upheld a decision by a VAT tribunal to cancel surcharges imposed by the Commissioners of Customs on Mr John Steptoe, an electrical contractor of Barkingside, Essex, for late payment of VAT. Judge Medd, QC, tribunal chairman, had said 95 per cent of Mr Steptoe's work was for Redbridge council in London, which, in 1987-88, was 'an extremely slow payer'. Mr Steptoe been left without sufficient funds to meet VAT bills. Judge Medd said this was 'one of those rare cases' where the taxpayer might legitimately put forward as a reasonable excuse 'the un-expected and continuing conduct' of the person who caused the prolonged shortage of funds. Dismissing an appeal by the commissioners, Mr Justice Kennedy said the question of what could be regarded as a reasonable excuse in such cases could safely be left to the discretion of VAT tribunals.</p>

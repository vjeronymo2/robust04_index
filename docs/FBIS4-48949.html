			<p>BFN     [Text] The four-day provincial meeting on the work of  opening to the outside world satisfactorily ended on 28 April.  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee,  delivered an important report entitled "Comprehensively  Implement the Strategy of Bringing Along the Export-oriented  Economy, and Pushing Shandong's Economy Onto Another New Stage."  In his report, he stressed the necessity of comprehensively  carrying out the strategy of bringing along the export-oriented  economy with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even  greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the province, presided over the  meeting held on the morning of 28 April.    At the meeting, Jiang Chunyun dwelt on 10 issues as follows:  First, the issue of understanding. Jiang Chunyun said: In  opening even wider to the outside world and developing an open  economy, the most important thing is to further emancipate the  mind and enhance the understanding of cadres at all levels and  leading comrades, in particular. The degree of the emancipation  of mind decides the broadness and quality of opening up.    Second, the issue of goals. Jiang Chunyun said: To push the  entire economy onto a new stage, we must first push the open  economy onto a new stage. We must place opening up in an even  more conspicuous position closely around the strategic goal on  promoting the provincial economy and social development in three  steps. We must start and promote opening up comprehensively and  make breakthroughs in all areas to develop the scale and level  of opening up extensively, in an effort to rapidly link  Shandong's economy with the world market. In line with this  general demand, we should effect a new and even greater progress  in all fields of open economy, including export, earnings of  foreign exchange, utilization of foreign capital, renovation of  old enterprises through grafting, foreign-funded enterprises of  three types, tourism, labor cooperation with the outside world,  the contacts with the world market, training and absorbing of  professionals, and economic cooperation with other provinces and  regions.    Third, the issue of overall pattern. Jiang Chunyun said:  The opening up strategy, defined by the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, known as opening all  fields to the outside world, making breakthroughs in major  areas, pressing forward the economy level by level, combining  the East with the West, and commonly developing the economy, is  commensurate with the realities of Shandong, and remarkable  results have already been achieved in the practice of this  strategy. Thus, this strategy should be carried out vigorously  and continuously. In developing the economy, we should give  prominence to the overall promotion and coordinated development.  The head of the dragon should be raised, its body should float  in the air, and its tail should sway so that we can truly form  an overall pattern of the development of open economy of  Shandong.    Fourth, the issue of structure. We should give prominence to  the readjustment of the structures of industries, trades, and  export products.    Fifth, the issue of systems. Jiang Chunyun said: At  present, many of our systems are not appropriate and lag far  behind the demands of the international practice. We must  regard the difficult points hampering opening up as the focal  points of the deepening of reform and readjust whichever is  inappropriate so that we can instill new vitality to the  province's open economy.    Sixth, the issue of professionals. Jiang Chunyun said: The  lack of professional personnel has become a major obstacle to  the invigoration of Shandong's open economy. Therefore, we must  adopt feasible measures to accelerate the training of  professional personnel and accelerate the development of  intellectual resources. We should open wide the province's gate  to the outside world and encourage the personnel studying  abroad, the students of Shandong origin in particular, to return  to the province to work after completing their studies abroad.  We should pay attention to attracting retired overseas  high-technology experts, engineering and technological experts,  and economic management experts to the province to work and  encourage them to make contributions to Shandong's economic  development.    Seventh, the environment issue. Jiang Chunyun said: We  should make great efforts to improve the environment for opening  the province to the outside world. In the field of tangible  environment, we should further strengthen the building of  airports, communications facilities, railways, highways, ports,  and power plants. In the field of intangible environment, we  should attach importance on building up a fine-quality and  high-efficient administrative service system, a policy and  regulation system involving foreign nationals and foreign  affairs that tallies with the international practice, and a  sensitive and fast information system. Meanwhile, we should pay  attention to comprehensive management of social order, create a  healthy social atmosphere aimed at forging ahead, and form a  fine social environment in which foreign traders are willing to  make investment in the province and do business at ease.    Eighth, the issue of rules and regulations. Jiang Chunyun  said: In opening to the outside world, we should not open  ourselves arbitrarily, nor should we stop managing anything. We  must make clear what should be allowed, encouraged, opposed, and  restricted in opening up.    Ninth, the issue of study. Jiang Chunyun said: In the  process of shifting from a planned economy to the market economy  and from the domestic market to the world market, we are  confronted with many new circumstances and problems. All people  with professions and trades at all levels in the province should  be determined to study again and study assiduously in order to  improve their level and ability of commanding the  export-oriented economy, the market economy, and the  modernization drive and to improve their skills to lead the open  economy.    Tenth, the leadership issue. Jiang Chunyun said: Party  committees and governments at all levels in the province should  list the opening to the outside world as an important item on  their daily agenda, should pay attention to mapping out  strategies, plans, goals, principles, and policies, should be  meticulous in researching situations, should adopt policy  decisions in a timely manner, and should conscientiously  organize the implementation of these policy decisions. All  localities, departments, and units should enhance their  consciousness in opening to all directions, should foster the  idea of handling foreign affairs and developing foreign economic  relations and foreign trade on a large scale, should voluntarily  cooperate and coordinate with one another, and should bring  their own development into line with the overall pattern of  opening up.    In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun stressed that the province's  reform, opening up, and economic development is at a critical  moment. In particular, the success or failure in our work in  this and next year is of a decisive significance to the  province's economic and social development in the future. We  should comprehensively carry out the strategy of bringing along  an export-oriented economy and increase the dynamics of opening  up with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even  greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures in  a bid to push the province's economy onto another new stage.</p>

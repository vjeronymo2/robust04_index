			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Badra Bakhus al-Fighali from Paris] </F>   [Text] According to well-informed Palestinian sources, last  week the PLO received from the external branch of the Israeli  intelligence agency (Mosad) a security report containing details  about an extremist Jewish network that was involved in a series  of terrorist operations against a number of Palestinian students  and Arab mayors.    The report was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's  office in response to a PLO request. The PLO had called on the  Israeli Government to investigate the assassination of several  Palestinian figures. The assassinations are believed to have  been carried out as part of a scheme to undermine the peace  process.    The Mosad report notes that a number of Palestinians living  in the occupied territories who are opposed to the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement are involved in the  assassinations. The mastermind of the deadly scheme, however,  is a Jewish group calling itself "David's Sword." The group,  led by Jewish clerics loyal to [the slain] Rabbi Meir Kahane, is  believed to have massed considerable resources through its links  to the U.S. Jewish community.    The report says that Mosad agents have arrested most of the  group's members. In their apartments the Mosad found details of  planned operations, weapons, explosives, two-way radios, and  bugging devices. One member, Rabbi Efrayim Tolidano, routinely  smuggled weapons from the United States to Israel. He was  arrested in Lod [Ben-Gurion] Airport as he arrived from  Washington loaded with cash and weapons.</p>

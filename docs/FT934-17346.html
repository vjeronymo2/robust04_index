			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / One more heave In June he was the most un-popular prime minister since opinion sampling began. The Labour opposition had led in the polls since he took office in 1990. Yet he has now called a fresh ballot, for November 6. No sooner had he announced it than Labour fell eight points behind. Perhaps it had something to do with the central bank's forecast of a couple of years of steady, sustainable, non-inflationary growth. The hero of the above little history, which has not yet been fully played out, is Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister of New Zealand. That is about as far as you can get from Britain, yet the story has not been lost on Mr John Major. Aware of his own poll rating, which is also at a record low, the British prime minister might be expected to recite the list of contemporary heads of government who are out of favour, and to name some who have recovered popularity after a bout of mid-term disaffection. I fancy he likes the Bolger story best. The forecast for New Zealand is 2 1/2 per cent plus annual growth. The British rate has reached about 2 per cent. It looks sustainable and non-inflationary, but stuck on a plateau. Contemplating the economic outlook while sitting at his table in the cabinet room, Mr Major muses that this is due to pre-Budget blight. Warnings of tax increases have made consumers cautious. Once the November statement is out of the way, the rate of growth will accelerate. This prospect of prosperity will be played upon at the Conservative conference next week. It may be combined with some softening-up for the combined Budget and spending announcement to come. One more heave, the Tories will be told, and the country's finances will be sound. The long journey through the wastelands entered when Mr Major became chancellor and saw the need to conquer inflation will be over. It has to hurt for just a while longer to work. Contemporary opinion is harsher than that. It says that Mr Major is a weak prime minister, not up to the job, lacking in grip. He might reasonably reply that this is the picture put in people's heads by the media, many leading elements of which turned against him over Maastricht. As to grip, no prime minister for the past 35 years, not even ones resting on large, comfortable, parliamentary majorities, has held firm to counter inflation as he has done, even through the build-up to last year's election. Now, partly thanks to an unplanned devaluation last September, a strongly competitive British economy may be in for a period of high growth and low inflation. I have no more idea than anyone else what Mr Major's strategy of gratification postponed will do for the Conservatives, or even whether the prime minister will keep his job until the next election. If pressed, I would hazard that the odds are slightly against him. Yet the current epidemic of forecasts of his political demise may work itself out. The case that he will not go, the argument that the prime minister rests on, should be rehearsed. If anyone were to look him in the eye and, after reminding him of the vilification he has endured over the past year, ask whether he thought it worth carrying on, he would say he was elected to do a job and will not simply pick up his bat and walk from the crease. There is no expectation in Downing Street of a leadership challenge, partly on the ground that no conceivable challenger would get the 30 signatures necessary under Conservative party rules. Mr Major is in a blunt, combative mood. He has acquired a carapace of hardness I have not seen in him before. He is looking well, and talking as if fate has more in store for him than the role of an interim successor to Lady Thatcher. Aw-are that he plays best in one-on-one conversations he has met some 200 local party bigwigs. He will continue his tours of the constituencies. The soapbox that featured in the April 1992 election will be deployed where appropriate. He intends to pursue a personal campaign to restore Conservative morale - and, I presume, faith in his leadership. The core of history's justification of his position might run as follows: he has taken everything that could be thrown at him for two years. Why? To maintain the unity of the party. Had he come down hard on one side or the other on Europe the Tories would have smashed themselves to smithereens. Maastricht was the best deal for Britain and party unity. Once negotiated, no prime minister could renege on it; had Parliament rejected the ratification bill, Mr Major would have resigned. He has no evident fear of being asked to make way for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor and present darling of the media. To adapt the language Mr Major himself might use, he would go into the jungle with his chancellor and not be afraid to turn his back. The two are cricketing and football buddies. When Mr Clarke was minister of health and under siege by nurses and doctors, Mr Major, chief secretary to the Treasury, offered support. In any case, a change of leader so soon after the last would be damaging for the party and not necessarily worth it. History may demand more. It may ask for a sense of where the Conservative party plans to take the country. Mr Major can only reiterate known policies: pursuit of the health reforms (going well); the education reforms (not); the Citizen's Charter, which will make life better for ordinary people; a fresh look at the structure of Europe; and, above all, the restoration of economic health after a long struggle starting with his chancellorship. Perhaps his friend Sir Norman Fowler can put the above thoughts across to the party at next week's conference. Possibly a fighting speech, peppered with attacks on the tightly knit group of politically motivated men and women who are creating disunity in the party, will do the trick. References to a tougher stance on crime may help, although Mr Major is neither a hanger nor a flogger - nor, in reality, one for excessively punitive terms of imprisonment. No dramatic denouement is in sight. That is not his way. How he must envy Mr John Smith, who has enhanced his stature by a single battle with the trade union half of his Labour party. Mr Major can only look across the seas to New Zealand, and keep his fingers crossed.</p>

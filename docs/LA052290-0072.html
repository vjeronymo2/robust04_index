			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Ride the Movies: Universal Studios Florida opened its gates to the public  Monday for three weeks of "sneak previews" of a Hollywood-style attraction  expected to draw up to 6 million visitors in its first year. The $600-million  attraction, which will officially open June 7, is expected to give stiff  competition to the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened a year ago just  a few miles down the highway. Top Universal shows are based on King Kong, E.T.  the Extraterrestrial, Jaws the killer shark and the 1906 San Francisco  earthquake. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Europe results disappoint Aegon STRONG results in the US and the Netherlands helped lift net profit at Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurance company, to Fl 497m (Dollars 255m) in the first half of 1993, a 7.3 per cent rise on the same period of 1992. Aegon did not give a geographic breakdown, but results in Europe outside the Netherlands did not meet expectations, largely due to setbacks on the British non-life market. However, turnover in Europe showed a small rise in spite of the negative effect of recent currency movements and the disposal of shares in a joint venture in Greece. Group turnover rose by 10.6 per cent to Fl 8.88bn. In the US, sales and operating profit showed a strong rise. Dutch results were also good, despite heightened competition. Aegon said it planned to raise its 1993 interim dividend to Fl 1.15 in cash from Fl 1.10 last year. For the first time, shareholders will have the option of receiving an interim payment in shares. The dividend payments will be worth 2 to 5 per cent less than the cash dividend but are generally more attractive for tax reasons.</p>

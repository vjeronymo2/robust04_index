			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: 'Every government gets its knickers in a twist' Domestic interest in the Scott inquiry has not in general been reflected internationally. Continental European and US press coverage has been thin, and international commentators remain puzzled by the excitement in the UK. France A senior executive in the defence industry: 'Every government in the world gets its knickers in the twist every once in a while. What seems to be typically British is the apparent convergence of businessmen, the intelligence services, and government operating a policy which was decided at quite a high level - very John le Carre. The nearest you come to that is in the US. 'The difference with France is that we were quite overt in our arms exports to Iraq. The British government seems to have said one thing in public and done another in private.' Germany Mr Joachim Krause, former adviser to the UN special commission on Iraq: 'The Scott inquiry has clearly pointed to the limits of export controls in the field of dual-use goods. Whenever a government thinks it is in its strategic interest to buttress the defence capabilities of a certain case - even if this is a rogue state - there may be loopholes to be used or one can simply connive with violations of existing rules. 'It has also shown that Whitehall - like Washington, Paris, Bonn, and most Arab states - succumbed in the 1980s to Saddam Hussein's strategic deception. Such a failure is grave and embarrassing for any government.' United States Mr Kenneth Juster, former senior State Department official in the Bush administration and a partner in a Washington law firm: 'In the US everything is very open and officials are used to being questioned in public. We have had a wide range of investigations over the past 4 1/2 years into all sorts of Iraqgate allegations of wrongdoing . . . hearings by several congressional committees, the turning over of every document requested with no claim of executive privilege, including classified information. 'So far nothing has substantiated the allegation that there was any wrongdoing or conspiracy involving the US and the UK. What has happened is that certain political figures have been been unjustly accused of being criminals simply on account of policy decisions, and the energies of government have been used up in countering false allegations. There has been no fire but a lot of smoke.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Exceptions for Categorically Excluded Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever the decisionmaker determines that an action listed in ``Categorically Excluded Actions'' may have the potential to affect ``significantly'' the quality of the ``human environment,'' as those terms are defined at 40 CFR 1508.27 and 1508.14, respectively, an environmental impact statement or an EA will be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Early Planning for Applicants and Non-APHIS Entities (Section 372.6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is designed to satisfy the directive in the CEQ implementing regulations that agencies make provision ``for cases where actions are planned by private applicants or other * <!-- PJG 0060 hspace --> &blank;9* <!-- PJG 0060 hspace --> &blank;9* entities before Federal involvement * <!-- PJG 0060 hspace --> &blank;9* <!-- PJG 0060 hspace --> &blank;9*.'' (40 CFR 1501.2(d)). Written instructions or guidelines outlining what is needed to comply with environmental planning and documentation requirements for all prospective applicants cannot be included in these procedures. It is the intention of APHIS ultimately to identify environmental data needs for each major APHIS program that requires analysis under these procedures and to provide for those needs as an integral part of program standards and practices. Until that goal can be attained, however, each prospective applicant needing approval for proposed activities normally requiring environmental documentation is encouraged to contact, at the earliest opportunity, APHIS' program staff, which will then coordinate with the environmental unit to design an appropriate compliance procedure tailored to the needs of the particular proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consultation (Section 372.7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section encourages prospective applicants and others to contact APHIS program officials to determine what types of environmental analyses or documentation, if any, need to be prepared. Early consultation is not intended to satisfy the requirements of NEPA alone. NEPA documents should incorporate, to the fullest extent possible, surveys and studies required by other environmental statutes. Implementing regulations of other primary environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, also make provision for early consultation and resolution of major issues by prospective applicants. Only by taking full advantage of opportunities for early environmental planning can APHIS, entities it regulates, the public, and others, avoid excessive costs and undue administrative delays often associated with a poorly timed environmental analysis process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Questions regarding these procedures and their applicability to particular planning and decisionmaking situations are inevitable. No procedure, regardless of how meticulously it may have been fashioned, can anticipate every contingency. For this reason, prospective applicants, and others who may have questions concerning these procedures, their applicability, meaning, or any other problem, should not hesitate to contact program officials and consult with the environmental unit at the earliest opportunity. Responses to all such questions will be provided as quickly as possible, in most cases within a single work day of securing any necessary factual information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Major Planning and Decision Points and Public Involvement (Section 372.8)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is designed to satisfy the directives in the CEQ implementing regulations that agencies (1) designate ``the major decision points for APHIS' principal programs likely to have a significant effect on the human environment and (assure) that the NEPA process corresponds with them'' (40 CFR 1505.1(b) (1992)); and (2) ``make diligent efforts to involve the public'' in NEPA-related activities (40 CFR 1506.6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Proposed &sect;372.5(a) of these procedures describes actions that normally require preparation of an EIS. The narrative explanation for that section emphasizes the desirability of adopting a broad programmatic approach to NEPA compliance that corresponds with APHIS' planning and service delivery efforts. Furthermore, it is in the planning stages of policy, program, or project development where the NEPA process can most effectively and efficiently be employed in the furtherance of the Act's ``pollution prevention'' purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Like many agencies, APHIS makes ample use of long-range planning for policy development and formulation of program strategies. Most major policies and programs are already in place. Still, NEPA is applicable to ongoing activities, including policies, programs, and projects, no less than it is to new ones (40 CFR 1508.18). Thus, for purposes of rationalizing and better coordinating existing policies and program strategies consistent with NEPA, a broad programmatic approach to environmental planning is logical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Planning is often ad hoc in nature and specific points (especially the beginning point) can seldom be anticipated, at least with respect to particular events, times, or individuals. It may also be difficult to judge at what point in the planning process a ``proposal'' exists for NEPA purposes. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The NEPA process will be fully coordinated with APHIS planning. Specific decision points will be identified and communicated to the public in a notice of intent and in the context of the public scoping process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Proposal'' exists at that stage in the development of an action when an agency subject to the Act has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal, and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated. Preparation of an environmental impact statement on a proposal should be timed (&sect;1502.5) so that the final statement may be completed in time for inclusion in any recommendation or report on the proposal. A proposal may exist in fact as well as by agency declaration that one exists (40 CFR 1508.23).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> But see, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Executive Office of the President, Council on Environmental Quality,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Quality 1989 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  21 (20th Annual Report, 1990) (``The impact statement was required to force the agencies to take the substantive provisions of the Act seriously and to consider the environmental policy directives of the Congress in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> formulation of agency plans and procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> '') (emphasis supplied).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A principal purpose of NEPA is to restore public confidence in the Federal Government's capacity to achieve important public purposes and objectives while at the same time maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment. In furtherance of that purpose, both the Act and the CEQ implementing regulations require extensive public involvement in the preparation of necessary environmental documentation. APHIS is committed to an open and accessible NEPA process. There will be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-fun, Stella Lee, and Catherine Ng] </F>   [Text] Legislators yesterday condemned Governor Chris  Patten for rejecting a concerted bid by major political parties  to freeze the proposed rates [local taxes] increase. It was the  first time in the territory's history that the council had  condemned the chief executive.    Legislators voted 21 to 11 in support of the motion  sponsored  by United Democrat heavyweight Szeto Wah to "reprove" the  Governor for "acting against the will of the public."    Citing the Royal Instructions, Mr Patten last month rejected  a proposal from three major political parties to freeze the  rates payment.    The Liberal Pany did not vote, even though it supported a  freeze in the rates.    Legislators from the three parties -- the United Democrats,  Meeting Point and the Liberal Party lashed out at the behaviour  of the Governor, describing his move as "high-handed",  "colonial" and "Draconian."    Mr Szeto said Mr Patten's use of a colonial privilege to  veto  a request with general public support should be denounced. He  was to blame for the humiliation the government had suffered  with an unprecedentedly low support of the legislature in the  budget debate -- only 15 legislators support the government's  proposed rates increase.    The Liberal Party accused the Government of brushing aside  public aspirations and paying no respect to Legco, but said the  wording of the motion was too strong. Party chief Allen Lee  Peng-fei said it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence in  the government. The party chose not to support, oppose, or  abstain from voting. It did not want to abstain because that  might give the impression the party had given up on the rates  issue.    Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming lamented the impotence of  the Legislative Council [Legco], saying that even if the motion  was passed, it would not in any way damage the governor's  position because he was appointed by Britain.    Opposing the motion, appointed member Martin Barrow, who  also  spoke on behalf of six independent legislators, said it was  dangerous to develop an "unrealistic vision" about the role of  Legco and its relations with the executive. He said the rates  issue was not significant and said the introduction of measures  to spend public money or impose taxes was the "sole privilege"  of the administration. "What Hong Kong people look for in a  governor is leadership, not just acquiescence to political  demands and what they look for in their council is responsible  leadership in the best interests of Hong Kong, not a  weathervane."    Appointed independent legislators Christine Loh Kung-wai and  Anna Wu Hung-yuk, who were absent from voting, said the problem  was the lack of accountability. "It is wrong to equate balance  of power with the weakening of power with the executive.  Executive-led government does not mean to control the  legislature," said Ms Loh.    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said in reply: "The  motion is like 'crying wolf' when no wolf exists. "It should be  reserved for serious policy or constitutional issues, or its  impact is greatly devalued. Nor will it change the fact that  the system simply would not work if it involved the executive  rubber-stamping the views of the legislature," he said.    The proposed rates increase represented a minute increase in  household income, which was hardly a sufficient cause for a  "constitutional drama." He called on legislators to respect the  power of the Government.</p>

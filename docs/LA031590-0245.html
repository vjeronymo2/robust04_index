			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AT&amp;T DRAFTING PLAN FOR EARLY RETIREMENTS  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., continuing a campaign to cut costs,  said today that it is drafting an early retirement program for some of its  165,000 non-management workers and is in talks with its two major unions over  the plans.  </P> <P> "We're exploring it right now," said AT&amp;T spokesman Burke Stinson.  </P> <P> "We have a fistful of plans right now, but no handshake on any one of them."  </P> <P> He did not disclose how many employees may be affected, and no time frame for a  plan was given.  </P> <P> Stinson said the interest in such a plan began last year when AT&amp;T offered  a pension sweetener to managers that was accepted by about 12,500, or about 37%  of those eligible.  </P> <P> More cuts would have to be approved by AT&amp;T's two biggest unions, the  Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers.  </P> <P> The company has been using work-force reductions as its main method for cutting  costs. AT&amp;T has cut staff by more than 90,000 since its 1984 divestiture.  </P> <P> Stinson said the telecommunications giant cut its work force, which is  currently at 281,400, by about 25,500 jobs last year.  </P> <P> Last December the company said it plans to cut an additional 8,500 jobs this  year.  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Exhibition Marks Holocaust Date: Germany confronts its Jewish past GERMANY has mounted a remarkable exhibition on Jewish life before the Holocaust, marking its anxiety to atone for the murder of 6m European Jews planned nearly 50 years ago at a lakeside villa in Berlin. 'Jewish Worlds,' depicting 3,000 years of Jewish life opened at the weekend in Berlin under the patronage of Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the German president. Later this week, the villa at the Wannsee where representatives of the German government gathered on January 20, 1942, to approve the details of the 'final solution' will be dedicated as a memorial site. The sombre anniversary of the beginning of the Holocaust provides the background for the exhibition which brings together rare Jewish religious and secular works from museums and libraries around the world as well as artifacts of daily Jewish life. It takes up 20 rooms of the Martin Gropius exhibition building. Mr Andreas Nachama, one of the exhibition organisers, said this was the most valuable collection ever of rare Jewish manuscripts. An edict by Catherine the Great on the establishment of Jewish settlements is shown for the first time outside St Petersburg. The exhibition directly adjoins the 'Topography of Terror', the basement cells of former Gestapo headquarters where prisoners were tortured. It is also only a stone's throw from the former Berlin Wall which some Germans saw as one of the prices they had to pay for the Nazi crimes committed in their name. Costing DM10m (Dollars 6.3m) from the city and federal governments, and with added support from Lufthansa, the exhibition comes at a time when budgets in Bonn and Berlin are strained to the limit by the economic costs of unification. But the exhibition was conceived several months before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and received top priority. The dedication of the 'Holocaust villa' at Wannsee comes after decades of indecision about what to do with the infamous site which was used as a home for schoolchildren until recently. The so-called Wannsee Conference was organised by Reinhard Heydrich, the senior SS officer who headed the Security Police, on orders of Hermann Goring, the Reichs Marshal. Top officials from all the main ministries took part and approved a document by Adolf Eichmann, a deputy to Heydrich. The 'final solution of the Jews' was to take place in the east where columns of Jewish labourers from all over Europe were to build roads. 'Undoubtedly, a large part will be eliminated by natural reduction,' the transcript said. Those who remained would be the most 'robust' and were to be 'accordingly treated' as they represented a natural selection and, if freed, could form the nucleus of a 'new Jewish revival'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed DGO/LVE: "House of Representatives -- The </F> Safety of UN Troops"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 10 Feb (BELGA) -- Every possible step has  been taken to ensure the safety of the Belgian troops currently  deployed in the former Yugoslavia under the flag of the United  Nations, stated Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix on  Thursday afternoon [10 February] during question time in the  House of Representatives.    Mr. Delcroix, who was responding to a question asked by  Jacques Devolder of the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats],  underlined that British General Michael Rose, commander in chief  of the UN troops, was the man primarily responsible for the  safety of Belgian troops.    "We are not intervening directly to specify what the troops  belonging to the Belgian contingent should do there. However,  this does not mean that we are not concerned for their safety.  Moreover, we are making recommendations on this subject to our  commanders on the ground," he said. Nonetheless, the minister  did not want to provide any further details on the content of  these measures.    Meanwhile, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated  that air strikes would be ordered if the Bosnian Serbs failed to  comply with the ultimatum imposed on them by NATO on Wednesday  evening, and which expires in 10 days.    The foreign minister, replying to a question asked by Dirk  Van Der Maelen of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party], duly  confirmed that NATO would remain intransigent if the Serbs  neglected to meet all the conditions laid down in the ultimatum.  The ultimatum calls for the Serbs to withdraw their artillery  to a distance of 20 km from Sarajevo.</p>

"I am absolutely convinced it offers the best way to resolve  the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not  sure," Clinton said at the White House.    Clinton said Vietnam has made "significant tangible  progress"  in helping resolve the issue of POWs and MIAs in the Vietnam war.    Clinton made the announcement after meeting with  representatives of the families of soldiers still missing.    Two U.S. veterans' groups had urged Clinton not to lift the  embargo until all American servicemen missing since the war have  been accounted for.    The President vowed that he remains personally "committed to  continuing the search for the answers and the peace of mind that  the families of the missing deserve."    "I have carefully considered the questions of how best to  sustain that cooperation in securing the fullest possible  accounting," Clinton said.    "I have consulted with my national security and veterans'  affairs advisers," he added, "it was their view that the key to  continued progress lies in expanding our contacts with Vietnam."    "I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure  cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the information  Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade embargo,"  Clinton said.    The President also announced that he has decided to  establish  a liaison office in Vietnam to "provide services for Americans  there and help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the  Vietnamese Government."    But Clinton made clear that "these actions do not constitute  a normalization of our relationships."    "Before that happens," the president stressed, "we must have  more progress, more cooperation, and more answers."</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Machine Tool interested in buying part of FMT Machine Tool Services (GB), a small Lewes-based company which supplies spare parts for machine tools, has expressed interest in buying parts of FMT, the machine tool maker which called in the receivers last week. MTS would not say which parts it was interested in but it is believed it is most likely to want the spares operation. News of the approach comes less than a week after Mr Alan Bloom and Ms Maggie Mills of Ernst &amp; Young were appointed joint administrative receivers at Brighton-based FMT, whose annual sales have fallen from nearly Pounds 20m in 1990 to Pounds 10m. The receivership has shocked the UK machine tool industry and customers of FMT, although Mr Bloom said: 'We are putting plans together with a view to continuing the business as a going concern.' The number of employees at FMT had fallen from more than 400 to about 150 before the receivership, and more than 40 jobs have been cut by the receivers - 30 at the main Brighton plant and the rest at FMT's other operations in Manchester and Newcastle. MTS' potential involvement is somewhat ironic. It comes a few weeks after the Office of Fair Trading dismissed a case against FMT filed by the Lewes company, which had alleged that FMT had restricted its access to spare parts for its range of machining centres. Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday that the receivership was the result of four years of recession, and there was no single 'flashpoint'. Gearing was also heavy, and included borrowings against property. Meanwhile, the Machine Tool Technologies Association confirmed yesterday that it had been helping Mr Bright set up meetings with the Department of Trade and Industry to recover Pounds 1m lost on a contract with Iraq. According to The Engineer magazine, Mr Bright has blamed the government for not revalidating export licences originally issued by the Department before the Gulf war. See Letters to the Editor</p>

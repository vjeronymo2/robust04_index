			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Mesa warns on debt payment MESA, the Texas oil company crippled by debt and depressed natural gas prices, yesterday told the New York Stock Exchange it might make an August debt payment with common stock instead of cash, Bloomberg reports. The announcement renewed concerns that the already dwindling value of Mesa's common stock would be further diluted. Mr T. Boone Pickens, chairman, said Mesa may make the August interest payment on its 12 per cent subordinated notes due in 1996 with stock.</p>

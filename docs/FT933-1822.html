			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Made to measure MBAs The diversity of the British MBA market will be highlighted today when ScottishPower and the textile group Dawson International announce a new management development programme at Heriot-Watt University Business School, Edinburgh. Those involved say efforts have been made to design a course which is relevant to the needs of the two companies. The part-time MBA is also structured so that the 39 participants can balance study with the demands of their jobs. So-called industry-led consortium MBAs are now an established part of the UK management education scene. Other business schools which offer them include Warwick (backed by BP Chemicals, North West Thames Regional Health Authority, National Westminster Bank and British Telecom), the City University, Lancaster and Henley (though the latter finds companies are now more interested in its shorter Diploma of Management course). Consortium MBAs are popular because they enable project work to be carried out with client companies, as well as reducing the risks to employers of losing their best managers. Concerns expressed are that companies have too much influence over the course content, and that control over entry standards passes from the participating business school. 'In the past many companies have taken a passive view, sponsoring almost anyone who asked to go on a part-time MBA programme,' says Ian Hirst, head of Heriot-Watt Business School. 'As a result the people who got the training were not the ones who would benefit the company most. However, ScottishPower and Dawson International have been closely involved in designing the programme structure and will be active in maintaining quality and relevance throughout.' Mike Kinski, ScottishPower's human resources director explains: 'If we need to compete in the increasingly competitive market place, we need to develop in our managers a wider business understanding, increased commercial awareness, a broader range of knowledge and improved leadership skills.'</p>

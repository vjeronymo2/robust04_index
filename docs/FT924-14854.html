			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Iliescu ahead in presidential race Romania's fractious political groups appeared no closer to forming a governmental pact yesterday despite official confirmation of September 27's general election results, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. The election has produced a hung parliament where reform-minded parties are slightly outnumbered by more reactionary and nationalist groups. No government is expected to emerge until after Sunday's presidential run-off. Mr Ion Iliescu, incumbent nationalist president, is firm favourite.</p>

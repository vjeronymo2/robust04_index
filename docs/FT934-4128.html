			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Gatt jigsaw starts to fall into place Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, last night boarded a military aircraft at Andrews airbase and headed for his second meeting within five days with Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commissioner. As he did so, details began to emerge of the US-European Union trade liberalising deal which both hope will open the way for completion of the seven-year Uruguay Round of talks on global trade reform. At the heart of a package likely to be unveiled in Brussels today will be ambitious tariff-cutting measures, which also address European demands to amend the Blair House accord limiting EU exports of subsidised farm goods. As Europe's main farm exporter, France opposed this deal even before the ink was dry when it was signed in Washington in November last year. In what is likely to be seen as a significant climbdown, the US has agreed to: Exempt Europe's existing 25m-tonne cereals stockpile from the Blair House accord, which demands a 21 per cent cut in subsidised cereals exports over a six-year period. Switch the base year from which subsidised exports must be reined in from the 1986-89 average, to 1992. Since subsidised EU cereal exports rose from 17m tonnes during the initial base period, to over 20m tonnes in 1992, the switch greatly reduces the impact of the Blair House accord and, over the six-year life of the agreement, allows Europe (principally France) to export an additional 8m tonnes of cereals. Extend from six to eight years the 'peace clause' under which the US would not challenge Europe's export subsidy regime. The price paid by the EU for these US concessions includes improved market access for US pork, grains, dairy products, and 'specialty crops' - which include nuts, vegetables, processed turkey and almonds. But since these are not expected to yield significant new opportunities to US exporters, EU negotiators have been forced to give ground by trimming tariffs on a number of manufactured goods. Significantly, steel tariffs will be cut to zero even though a Multilateral Steel Agreement is unlikely; tariffs on wood, pulp and paper will also be cut to zero; semiconductor equipment is likely to have tariff protection stripped to zero, while semi-conductors themselves will retain protection averaging 3 per cent. Tariff protection for non-ferrous metals - principally aluminium - will be trimmed mainly among semi-finished goods, but not to zero. A further concession from the US has apparently been made in shipping, where negotiators have for the first time said they are willing to include ocean shipping. Until just days ago, most negotiators expected the Uruguay Round maritime agreement to be limited to ports and port services. When Mr Kantor arrives in Brussels this morning, he will be joined by US negotiators who have spent the past three days in Geneva wrestling with disagreements. These include Europe's demands for 'cultural protection' for its film and television industries; US pressure to weaken rules on anti-dumping actions; and US calls for special treatment of financial services and taxation. None of these issues was resolved last night. However, as long as the two trade negotiators reach agreement today, the pieces appear to be falling into place for the global Uruguay round deal to be settled by December 15.</p>

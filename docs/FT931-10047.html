			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Income falls at Fischer GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said consolidated net income in 1992 was 'significantly below' the SFr42m (Dollars 27.4m) recorded in 1991, reversing a forecast of profit growth made at the interim stage. The group said its results were affected by 'serious recession' in the second half, particularly in Germany. Consolidated sales at SFr2.49bn were slightly below the 1991 level, in spite of a 4 per cent positive effect from exchange rate fluctuations. The closure of steel foundries at Schaffhausen and Worms, the sale of the steel piping business in the UK and the discontinuation of other activities reduced sales by about 2 per cent.</p>

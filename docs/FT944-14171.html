			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / US budget deficit falls to lowest for five years The US budget deficit fell by Dollars 52bn (Pounds 32bn) to Dollars 203bn in the fiscal year to the end of September, its lowest level for five years. Although another drop is expected in the current fiscal year - White House and congressional budget offices estimate a deficit of between Dollars 162bn and Dollars 167bn - a row has already broken out over how to stop the deficit from climbing again over the last five years of the decade. President Bill Clinton said yesterday that he wanted to keep 'managing this thing in a very disciplined way'. But with deficits projected to start rising in the 1996 fiscal year and to be back above Dollars 200bn by the year 1999, the administration has had to begin the process of considering budget strategies for the coming years. In a memorandum obtained by the opposition Republican party and widely distributed to the media, Ms Alice Rivlin, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, warned that holding the deficit at next year's projected level of Dollars 167bn would require Dollars 184bn of spending cuts or tax increases over the period 1996-2000. Eliminating the budget deficit entirely - a goal espoused in theory by most Republican congressional candidates - would require Dollars 684bn of spending cuts or revenue increases. Among the possible approaches outlined in the memo are controversial measures such as cutting the benefits paid under the Social Security pension scheme, applying a means test to limit payments under the Medicare programme which provides health insurance for the elderly, or reducing the tax deductibility of mortgage payments. Ms Rivlin insisted yesterday that her memo 'wasn't any kind of decision memo'. 'The Clinton administration isn't actively considering any of these things at the moment,' she said in a television interview.</p>

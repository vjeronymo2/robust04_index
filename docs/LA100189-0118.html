			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IRISH MISTAKE HELPS U.S. REACH FINAL  </P> <P> Tom Kite converted mistakes by Ireland's Christy O'Connor into a playoff  victory Saturday to send the United States into the championship match in the  Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews, Scotland.  </P> <P> The 2-1 win over defending champion Ireland advanced the three-man U.S. team to  today's 36-hole final against Japan, a 2-1 upset winner over England as cold,  blustery winds scoured the Old Course.  </P> <P> "It's a shame it had to end on a catastrophe like that," Kite said after  O'Connor put his ball into a stream on the first extra hole of the decisive  match after they each finished 18 holes in 71. "But I'll take a win any way we  can get it.  </P> <P> "Winning ugly is a whole lot better than losing pretty any time."  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia put the United States ahead by defeating Philip Walton,  69-71, but Ronan Rafferty beat Curtis Strange with a 30-foot birdie putt on the  final hole.  </P> <P> Bill Britton, seeking his first victory in nine seasons on the PGA Tour, shot a  nine-under-par 63 to take a four-stroke lead after three rounds of the Centel  tournament at Tallahassee, Fla.  </P> <P> Britton was at 16-under-par 200, within range of Jeff Sluman's 1985 tournament  record of 269, after making nine birdies in a bogey-free round.  </P> <P> Ronnie Black, who started the day one shot off the lead after consecutive 67s,  had a 70 and was second at 204. Gary Hallberg shot a 66 and was third at 205.  </P> <P> Second-round leader Tom Pernice Jr., Mike Reid and Bill Buttner were at 206.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel shot a five-under-par 67 to take a three-stroke lead over Pat  Bradley after two rounds of the LPGA San Jose tournament.  </P> <P> Daniel, who has won three tournaments in the last two months, enters today's  final round at 12-under-par 132, five shots better than the previous course  record of 137 set by Sandra Haynie in 1982.  </P> <P> Daniel, third in money-winning on the LPGA tour this year, began the day with a  one-stroke lead over Bradley after shooting a 65 Friday. Bradley, fourth on the  tour in earnings this year, shot a 69 Saturday and was at 135.  </P> <P> Bob Charles shot a two-under-par 70 to retain a one-shot lead over Butch Baird  after two rounds of the $300,000 Space Coast Senior tournament at Melbourne,  Fla.  </P> <P> Charles had four birdies and two bogeys to go eight under par at 136 in a brisk  wind and thick rough at the Suntree Country Club.  </P> <P> Baird, who shot a 70, came to the final hole tied with Charles but took a  bogey.  </P> <P> Jim Dent, who had a 70, was next at 138.  </P></p>

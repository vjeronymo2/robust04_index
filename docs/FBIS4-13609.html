			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by al-Tahir Hammad: "Algeria: Belhaj Threatens </F> Madani With Assassination, GIA (Armed Islamic Group) Splits Into  Four Groups, Chebouti Plays Belhaj Card Against Madani"]    [Text] Algiers--The mass escape from Tazoult prison in the  Aures Mountains was a powerful blow by the fundamentalists  against the government in Algeria. The most serious consequence  of the episode was the possibility that it might ignite the  silent conflict among government figures, who have begun  exchanging charges of complicity in helping the fundamentalists  mount this attack on Algeria's highest security prison. Along  with the increasing tightening of security, the recent operation  has threatened to torpedo President Zeroual's efforts at  dialogue. Moreover, other splits have broken out in the ranks of  the Islamists and have become so acute that Ali Belhaj has  threatened Abassi Madani with assassination. What is happening  behind the scenes with the government and the fundamentalists in  Algeria?    For the first time since Liamine Zeroual assumed power in  Algeria, signs of splits among government figures have begun to  appear, particularly between the president and Prime Minister  Redha Malek. While President Zeroual has announced that the  security policy followed for the past two years against  fundamentalist terrorism has limits and does not constitute the  only solution to the country's crisis, Redha Malek has ruled out  returning to what preceded the crisis with the fundamentalists.  Thus he has clearly indicated that he opposes the idea of  dialogue with the historic leadership of the Islamic Salvation  Front (FIS), the very dialogue that President Zeroual has  engaged in both before and after his election.    Regarding these efforts at dialogue, informed Algerian  sources have told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that a week before taking  power President Zeroual visited Blida military prison, where he  met Shaykh Abassi Madani, the head of the FIS. The same sources  add that the president is convinced that the dialogue must  continue and that Algeria can emerge from its crisis only if all  parties without exception participate. The appointment of the  chairman of the former dialogue committee, Youssef Khatib, as  presidential advisor confirms this policy.  <H5>  Government Figures Divided </H5>   Opposition to this policy began to appear a few days ago  inside the government. The prime minister chose a suitable  opportunity to reveal the existence of this opposition when he  announced his rejection of any return to what preceded the  elections. An explanation for this clear position is that Malek,  who knows the level of progress that the dialogue has made,  wanted to divulge the content of the dialogue. Informed sources  state that the head of the FIS, whom the government proposed  releasing from prison before the Feast of Breaking the Ramadan  Fast [3 March], refused to accept President Zeroual's condition  to agree to talk on a personal basis, rather than as head of the  FIS. Shaykh Abassi Madani stipulated that before he would  continue talking with the government all FIS-member political  prisoners should be released before the end of Ramadan and that  the decree dissolving the FIS should be repealed. He demanded  that legislative and presidential elections be held in one year,  not in three years as was approved before Major General Zeroual  was elected president.    Redha Malek's statement was considered a clear response in  his own name and in the name of his supporters in the military  establishment to the demands of the FIS leader. The statement  constituted a warning to the president and to dialogue  supporters about the danger of accepting these conditions and of  pushing the dialogue to "undesirable consequences"--to causing a  split in the military establishment.    The tightening of security has greatly contributed to  revealing the splits in government positions. There have been  numerous assassinations and terrorist acts. The operation of  freeing over 1,000 prisoners from Tazoult prison in the Aures  Mountains increased the tension even more between opponents and  supporters of dialogue within the government. Some even started  accusing opponents of having facilitated the Tazoult operation  in order to impose their conditions and policy on President  Zeroual's faction.    Clearly, everyone agrees that there were official factions  involved in the prisoners' escape. In particular, about 450  guards were outside the prison during the operation, and the  intervention forces nearby in the area did not arrive at the  prison until eight hours after they were notified. They had been  notified three hours after the escape took place.    The accusations are not restricted to the radical wing of  the  army. The latter in turn accuses pro-dialogue factions of  involvement in several incidents to prove that the security  policy has failed and that there is no solution but dialogue.  Such charges focus on senior military intelligence officials  whom Chief of Staff Mohamed Lamari, the leader of the radicals,  has been unable to transfer into retirement. He had presented a  list of about 25 high officers whom he asked to be changed, but  President Zeroual, who is also minister of defense, rejected the  request.  <H5>  Islamist Splits </H5>   The government's position and the conflict between dialogue  supporters and opponents are complicated by an increase in  terrorist operations and by the existence of disagreements and  divisions within the fundamentalist movement.    Algerian sources state that disagreement has emerged  recently  between the two leaders of the FIS, Shaykh Abassi Madani and  Imam Ali Belhaj, who is known to be the leader of the hard-line  faction. The sources say that Abassi Madani has lost much of his  influence on the FIS and its base because of his having fallen  into the trap of dialogue and that it will be impossible for the  dialogue to produce results unless Ali Belhaj is brought in.  Some assert that the conditions that Abassi Madani proposed to  President Zeroual were really those of Belhaj, who pressured  Madani, prevented him from completing a deal with the  government, and threatened him with assassination.    Clearly, divisions in the fundamentalist movement are  preventing a political solution to the crisis from being reached  and thus are encouraging the factions that support military  action. It should be noted that the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),  which was led by Djaffar El Afghani (he, along with seven of the  group's leaders, was killed), has split into four groups. There  is a group in the capital, led by Abdelkader Hattab (known as  Mouloud), who has threatened to continue assassinations until  the government falls. The group controls the Bordj El Bahri  quarter. Abdelkader Hattab has been accused of having  assassinated former Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah in August 1993  and of having assassinated the head of television, Mustapha  Abada.    Then there is the group of Sayeh Attia, the recently elected  successor to Djaffar El Afghani. The group controls the Media  area near Algiers. It is considered responsible for the murder  of 12 Croatians, a governor, and 18 employees of the  governorate, including the chief of intelligence. The third  group is led by Khaled Sehili, who with his group controls the  city of Blida. He is accused of about 150 operations,  particularly the murder of 400 soldiers.    Controlling the popular quarter of Sidi Bel Abbes in the  capital is a fourth group, led by Kada Benchiha, who is accused  of the murder of several French and one Briton. A peculiarity of  this group is that it decapitates its victims after killing them.    Attention is now focused on the GIA, which is considered to  be the FIS's historic military arm. It is led by Abdelkader  Chebouti, who has links to senior intelligence officers and has  on a number of occasions been shielded by them so that he should  not fall into traps set for him by the police and army in a  number of areas. Chebouti was able to attract the officer Said  Mekhloufi, who held the post of editor-in-chief of the magazine  AL-JAYSH. Mekhloufi is now responsible for organizing military  cells and training groups called "The Islamic Forces." This is  an organization modeled after the official army and armed with  machine guns. These groups control the coastal roads west of the  Algerian capital and south of it, particularly in the Amour  Mountains.    The armed Islamic movement seems to have become active again  after the death of GIA leader El Afghani. Chebouti is considered  to be a supporter of Ali Belhaj and holds a position opposing  FIS leader Shaykh Abassi Madani.    He is also an opponent of dialogue with the government. He  has announced on more than one occasion that he will not stand  with his hands tied in the face of government attempts to draw  some leaders into dialogue. He has threatened moderates with the  severest punishment.    The division in the fundamentalist movement and the lack of  a  unified leadership undoubtedly complicate the situation,  particularly the situation of Major General Zeroual, who has set  all his hope on making the dialogue successful. In the next few  weeks he is expected to try to change the balance of forces in  his favor.    There is much talk now about the existence of a plan to make  changes in the government. Perhaps these reports are what led  Redha Malek to open fire on dialogue supporters within the  government.</p>

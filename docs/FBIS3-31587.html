			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The official Slovak Government delegation, headed by  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, left by air for a visit to the  People's Republic of China early this evening. The composition  of our delegation, which includes Finance Minister Julius Toth,  Economy Minister Jan Ducky, Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik,  Vladimir Masar, the governor of the National Bank of Slovakia,  and representatives of commercial and business circles,  forecasts the aim of this Asian journey. It is signing an  agreement on trade and economic cooperation that will supplement  the agreements signed so far--for example, that on prevention  of double taxation, on the support and protection of  investments, on economic and technical cooperation, and on the  1992 protocol on mutual trade.    Whether or not the fact that China was one of the first  countries that recognized the independent Slovak Republic can be  understood as a certain guarantee that that country counts on us  for the future as its business and economic partner will be  clearer for us only after the end of mutual talks.    Martin Bartisek interviewed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  in  this connection before his departure for China.    [Begin recording] [Bartisek] Chinese products are not  unknown  on our markets. This country is at present undergoing what I  would term a quiet economic boom. To a certain extent it is  helped by the United States, and the West European and advanced  Asian countries. Has our economy any chance in this strong  competition on the Chinese market?    [Meciar] The first condition is for us to be there, to be  able to cope with the environment, to master the new conditions  because businessmen from all over the place are going to China  now. Nowadays there is room there for a chemical industry, a  textile industry, consumer goods. It is a market with an  enormous number of people. In other words, it is an opportunity  for us to be there.    On the other hand, we offer the possibility of cooperation  with our firms for Chinese businessmen, the possibility of  cooperation in that they could get to our markets, the  possibility of cooperation in that we might think of joint  actions in third countries and that there could even be a  certain form of capital interlinking that would be advantageous  for us. All these are facts that are important for us, and that  is why I consider the visit to China very significant. After  it, the visit to Thailand will follow. It has a different aim,  but opening the doors to great China is an opportunity for  Slovakia.    [Bartisek] Prime Minister, your delegation, apart from  Economy Minister Jan Ducky, includes a number of businessmen,  heads of state enterprises, and private companies. I ask  whether conditions have been created today for our small private  businesses to establish concrete agreements in China.    [Meciar] The basic conditions are being created, but let us  say that it is customary that, during my travels, I am  accompanied by representatives of employers' unions. It is  because each trip has to be highly efficient, used not only in  the political and economic part I am presenting but also in the  part that is presented by representatives of the unions,  industry, and so on. They gain practical experience of an  actual partner and then implement what I agree. Thus, the time  between my visit and their visit is shortened to zero. China  now buys a lot of goods abroad [words indistinct] sell our work.  [end recording]</p>

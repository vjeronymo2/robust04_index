			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BACKER OF ELSMERE DUMP PLAN DISPUTES NEGATIVE FINDINGS  </P> <P> The president of BKK Corp., which hopes to open a landfill in Elsmere Canyon by  1991, said Tuesday that he was stunned that an environmental impact report on  the proposed expansion of the nearby Sunshine Canyon Landfill declared Elsmere  a poor choice for a dump.  </P> <P> "You're kidding," said BKK President Kenneth B. Kazarian when told of the  report's conclusions. Kazarian said he had not seen the report, which was  released last week.  </P> <P> He suggested that the report is an effort by a competing corporation to boost  its own dump proposal by criticizing his firm's site.  </P> <P> BKK, based in Torrance, is preparing its own environmental impact report on the  proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon, which lies about two miles northeast of the  Golden State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange. Kazarian said he is confident  that geological and environmental studies will conclude that Elsmere is an  ideal landfill site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Consultant  </P> <P> The report on the proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon dump northwest of  Granada Hills was prepared by a private consulting firm for the landfill's  owner, Browning-Ferris Industries. The report said the only irreversible effect  of expanding the dump would be destruction of 8,000 oak trees.  </P> <P> The thick, three-volume report devoted hundreds of pages, charts and graphs to  the potential impact of expanding Sunshine Canyon but also used 14 pages to  explain why Elsmere Canyon should not be used as a dump.  </P> <P> The report said Browning-Ferris once considered Elsmere as a dump site but  rejected the idea. The report said soil permeability tests showed that the  canyon's floor was not suitable for a dump and would require a liner.  </P> <P> The report also said nearby faults could produce earthquakes on the site. The  canyon could also hold historic buildings, oil drilling equipment and  archeological sites, the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Sites Found  </P> <P> The report conceded that no archeological sites have been discovered in the  canyon but said such discoveries are always possible because Indian tribes did  live in the region. The report also said the canyon could contain fossils of  more than 50 species, including whales and camels.  </P> <P> Kazarian said the report for Browning-Ferris apparently drew its conclusions  from incomplete data. "They're talking about the wrong area," Kazarian argued,  saying his consultants have found no archeologically significant sites in the  canyon. The oil drilling equipment lies outside the canyon, he said.  </P> <P> As for the canyon's soil, he said BKK plans to install protective liners that  will exceed the requirements of state environmental law. Kazarian stressed that  he had not yet seen the report but said that some of its conclusions appear  "intellectually dishonest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Takes a Shot'  </P> <P> He said he had never seen an environmental impact report that "takes a shot"  against a competing project. "That's what it sounds like at this point," he  said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, in comments included in the  Sunshine Canyon report, said the department was not aware of any technical data  to substantiate the criticisms of Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, members of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee, a Santa  Clarita citizens group, said they were encouraged by the report's conclusions.  The report could give the group "good, solid ammunition" for its fight against  BKK's plans, said Glen Rollins, a group member.  </P></p>

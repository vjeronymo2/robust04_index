			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: PanCanadian Petroleum earnings surge to CDollars 61m A RESURGENT PanCanadian Petroleum is providing strong underpinning for hard-pressed Canadian Pacific, the transport, resource and property group. PanCanadian, owned 87 per cent by CP, has reported first-quarter profit of CDollars 61.3m (USDollars 48.6m), or 49 cents a share, treble the year-earlier profit of CDollars 20.5m, or 16 cents. Revenues were CDollars 266m, up 33 per cent. Based on the improved results, the company is hoisting its quarterly dividend by 5 cents to 20 cents a share. Oil prices rose 8 per cent and conventional production was up 27 per cent to 84,258 barrels daily. Synthetic crude also fetched higher prices. PanCanadian is a leading natural gas producer in Alberta and British Columbia, and shipments and prices were also up sharply. Demand in Canada and the US, with the long, severe winter, has left some producers short of contracted volumes, sending them to the spot market for supplies. For the whole of 1992, oil production rose 23 per cent and gas sales 29 per cent. Mr David O'Brien, chairman, says PanCanadian can maintain the momentum over the next two years because of heavy investment in production and development.</p>

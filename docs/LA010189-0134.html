			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A CHARGED IDEA  </P> <P> An idea recently occurred to me that may be worthy of community support.  Because San Diego is considering buying out San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, how  about going ahead and acquiring the Chargers as well? Just ponder the plethora  of possibilities:  </P> <P> Lighting the stadium would be absolutely free, and Charger fans may be eligible  to apply for a rebate on ticket prices from the Public Utilities Commission.  </P> <P> As part of incentive clauses for free agents, the city/Chargers could offer  such bonuses as light bulbs, generators, consulting fees and preferred stock.  </P> <P> The mayor, in her spare time, could coach the team.  </P> <P> We could trade Tom Page and Steve Ortmayer for a Tucson utility and a  substance-abusing linebacker to be named later.  </P> <P> As part of the Russian arts festival, the Chargers might scrimmage with members  of the Kirov Ballet. Perhaps the San Diego Chicken could hatch out of a giant  Faberge egg during halftime and do a humorous rendition of Swan Lake.  </P> <P> If all this wouldn't give that mean old ogre of a Howard Allen from Southern  California Edison fits, I don't know what will. Think about it, San Diego.  SDG&amp;E and the Chargers . . . what an electric combo! Why, everybody, not  just the skinheads, could go out and paint the old town red.  </P> <P> JIM HALL  </P> <P> Imperial Beach  </P></p>

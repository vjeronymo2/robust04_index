			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING AND CANCER RISK  </P> <P> The state and county authorities need to stop the malathion spraying program  immediately in Orange County!  </P> <P> Regardless of the technical and medical questions about the efficacy of  malathion spraying and the short-term and long-term medical impacts, hundreds  of thousands of citizens, taxpayers and residents of central Orange County are  being needlessly put at risk and put money out of pocket.  </P> <P> What is the rush to spray? Why not try the equally effective methods of  biological control (sterile male flies) and physical control (tree stripping,  quarantines, etc.)?  </P> <P> Why are our state and county authorities afraid of open public hearings and an  honest independent review of this program? Why do we have a "state of  emergency" for a problem we have had for 10 years?  </P> <P> Why are we so intent on preserving the profits of the agricultural chemical  companies and the large corporate farming interests that we brush aside all  local opposition and put down all independent authorities?  </P> <P> The Medfly is apparently here to stay. Let's establish a long-term biological  control program that will keep the pest population in reasonable control. Let's  not endanger the lives, safety and well-being of hundreds of thousands of  Orange County residents.  </P> <P> JERRY YUDELSON  </P> <P> MOLLY HAINES  </P> <P> Garden Grove Residents Against Malathion Spraying  </P></p>

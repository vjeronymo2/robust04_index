			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (5): More emphasis on market forces - A look at the results of economic reform in Latin American countries / The March of Western values THE disintegration of the Soviet bloc has brought predictable claims of a victory for the western style of democratic government and economic management. But even before the discrediting of communism transformed the map of the world, shifts towards more democratic systems of government and more market-friendly economic systems were already under way in many developing countries. For pragmatic rather than ideological reasons, many governments had already come to the conclusion that in a capital-scarce world, the market should have a more important role in allocating resources than they had conceded hitherto. There have been two main aspects to this change: the first has involved attaining equilibrium in government finances; the second a series of reforms to the structure of economies to make them more responsive to market forces. In Latin America, for example, the onset of the debt crisis 10 years ago laid bare the economic mismanagement of military governments across the region and paved the way for their replacement by elected successors. But, also as a result of the crisis, governments found it impossible to raise capital. Because their ability to sell debt was severely limited, any attempt to stimulate the economy directly by increasing government spending in excess of revenues has had one result: inflation. Thus reforms were considered necessary to redirect the role of government, raising revenues by restructuring tax systems and cutting expenditures by slimming down bloated bureaucracies and privatising state industries. Privatisation has had an important role in structural reform, too, as part of a set of changes to allow for greater play of market forces. It has been accompanied by a removal of quotas, tariffs and other obstacles to foreign trade and reforms to improve the attraction of investment, domestic and foreign. Yet there is no doubt that governments have been reinforced in their decision to throw out the state-dominated, inward-looking model of economic development by the changes in eastern Europe. Graphic television pictures of life in the former socialist countries have changed the point of view of many voters. 'We used to think there were two ways we could develop our economy. Now we realise that in the east, they live as badly as we do,' said Mr Jaime Duran, a political analyst in Ecuador, where a government pledging economic reforms has just assumed power. This 'unipolar' world has exciting potential, particularly in the prospects offered of a reduction in defence expenditures in developed and developing countries. It has also meant in theory that governments in industrialised countries can alter the basis of their relations with developing countries; that aid can be used to bolster democracy and weaken tyranny, instead of shoring up corrupt regimes whose only claim for support was opposition to Moscow. However, there is also disquiet in the developing world. Donor governments have felt less reticent about imposing new, less ostensibly economic, conditions on aid. The freedom of the US and its allies to intervene in areas of the world in pursuit of domestic policy aims - such as combating drug traffickers or securing oil supplies - is much enlarged. Furthermore, without strong ideological competition, there is the danger of drift in international policy-making, of purposelessness and petty squabbles among the rich countries, epitomised by the inability to reach a conclusion to the Uruguay round of free trade talks. Many policy-makers in developing countries are thus worried that their unilateral decisions to open their economies to the outside world will be greeted by growing protectionism in the industrialised world. Internally, economic reform has been no panacea for governments. While in some countries - such as Mexico and Argentina - it has so far proved popular and helped incumbent governments, in others, there has been a tension between economic reform and the survival of democracy. In Venezuela, for example, the government's reform programme, in spite of its relatively modest scale, has been the focus of public demonstrations since a failed army coup attempt last February. In Peru - a lesson for those who believe left-wing revolutionaries have lost their potential to influence events - a group of brutal Maoists threaten the state. Indeed, the most successful economic reform movements in Latin America - Chile's of the 1980s and Mexico's - have been pushed forward by two of the continent's least democratic regimes. Even in countries where reform has so far proved successful, there are risks. Argentina's future development, for example, depends crucially on stimulating its low levels of investment. And if the investment arrives in Argentina, it is unlikely to arrive in all the countries that are simultaneously opening their economies in the hope of stimulating investment. Amid such competition, aid practitioners are despondent about the ability of much of Africa to attract meaningful amounts of private capital. Without that, and with increased competition for western aid from eastern Europe, the prospects for much of that continent appear dim. Furthermore, even if it arrives, foreign investment may be perceived as exploitative, providing potential problems for incumbent governments. There are other areas where the market does not provide a complete answer or where government will continue to have to play a significant role. In most developing countries, raising capital for large project investments or for small businesses is problematic, and in most there is a pressing need for infrastructure investments. There is also a requirement for government investment in sectors such as education: low wages are no longer, if they ever were, a sufficient incentive for foreign investment, and an educated workforce is an important draw for potential investors. As a decade of austerity, the 1980s saw mounting social pressures in many developing economies. Another important development is the emergence of another value system which has met with unmatched success over the past 20 years: that of Asia. While the models offered by Japan and its Asian neighbours differ in detail, they all place government at the centre of the development process. Japan is growing in importance as a giver of aid and a provider of finance to the multilateral institutions; Korea and Taiwan, once recipients of aid, are themselves becoming donors. Meanwhile, the relative weight of the US economy and the importance of the US as an aid donor continues to decline. The disintegration of the Soviet bloc may in some countries be accompanied by the simultaneous strengthening of democracy and the market economy. In others, there will be tension or conflict between the two. In any event, the hypothesis that the world is on the verge of an uncontested victory for 'western' values must be considered distinctly far-fetched.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Brussels drafts plan to end EC power struggle THE European Commission wants a settlement between Brussels and European Community member states to resolve the power struggle within the EC, clarify the principle of subsidiarity and end the crisis over the Maastricht treaty. A confidential draft of its proposed deal obtained by the Financial Times shows that Brussels is aiming for a solution analogous to the division of powers detailed in the 10th amendment to the US constitution, which reserves for individual states power not vested in the federal government. The Commission was expected to approve this draft last night or today. The draft proposes three main principles which will be put forward to the EC summit in Birmingham on Friday. They are meant to clarify the point that power in the EC rests with the member states unless otherwise specified. Although the Commission is the first EC body to outline a formal settlement, the main political result of the document may therefore be to take the heat off Brussels. This solution would not require tampering with the Maastricht treaty, since it would take the form of a separate 'Interinstitutional Agreement on the Subsidiarity Principle' between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers of the 12 member states. On Friday, EC heads of government will try to hammer out a deal on subsidiarity - the principle that the EC should act only when measures taken nationally or locally are ineffectual - and try to resolve the crisis over ratification of Maastricht. The Commission is trying to seize the initiative and neutralise attempts by the bigger member states to emasculate its powers. It is also putting pressure on the Twelve to decide what it is they want the EC to do in common. Brussels also wants to: Move from intrusive and bind-ing legislation towards framework laws which states would agree but implement according to national circumstances. Devolve much responsibility for implementing EC law to member states. Decentralise management of 'a number of the Commission's more burdensome activities' including agricultural markets and regional spending - which together amount to four-fifths of the EC budget. The first principle states that: 'The powers of the member states shall constitute the rule; the Community's powers, whether exclusive or shared with the member states, shall constitute the exception.' The second says the subsidiarity clause in Maastricht concerns purely 'the exercise and not the conferment of powers, which is reserved for the authors of the treaty', namely the national governments. The third pillar is that the EC should only act where there is demonstrable need, and that the measures it takes should be proportional to the result which is sought. The two tests should be the 'comparative efficiency' and the 'value added' by acting on an EC-wide basis. The Commission suggests a four-tier hierarchy for Community action: 'very strong justification', 'strong justification', 'justification', and 'minimal justification'.

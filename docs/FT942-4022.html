			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / How To Spend It: Surviving the summer - A look at the ordeal of outdoor events Whatever happened to global warming? I had, rather unsportingly, been looking forward to it and was even having visions of vineyards and peaches growing from Land's End to John O'Groats, of suntanned limbs and of wearing one's favourite summer outfit more than once a year in England. Last weekend, which saw the opening sallies in the set-piece rituals of the British summer season, presented a sorrier picture. At Louis Vuitton's Concours d'Elegance, at Hurlingham, west London, on Saturday night, the woman from Tatler was wearing a new Karl Lagerfeld jacket. Not that many noticed since it was hidden under a woolly duffle coat. The Daily Telegraph's reporter's dress was edged with mud. Icy winds nipped at the shins and at one (very chic but outdoor) table all the guests had shivered off by 9.30pm. The jolly parting cry as we all said goodnight was 'See you in St Thomas's' At Smith's Lawn, Windsor, Alfred Dunhill gave us lunch in a windproof marquee and wrapped us in soft navy-blue rugs for polo-watching, while piles of umbrellas stood at the ready. It is true that none of this is compulsory  -so why do we do it? It seems almost a badge of nationhood. Forget Norman Tebbit's cricket test, the real test of nationality is the ability to survive the British outdoor summer event with aplomb. As I write, the rain is still pouring, it is neither cold enough for winter coats nor warm enough for one's gladdest rags - yet most of the season's rites lie ahead. So for those determined to attend set-piece events, here are my tips on how to make them bearable . . . There are some sensitive souls who, it seems, are unable to enjoy themselves unless their pooch is happy, too. For them, some far-seeing manufacturer in France has devised the ultimate doggy treat - the canine hamper. There is a waterproofed blanket to protect delicate bones from damp or chilly grass, a stainless steel bowl to provide a soothing container for canine nosh, a brush to shine up the coat and a bone to keep boredom at bay. It costs Pounds 249 from Asprey 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1. For timing your laps around the park, or the horses in a race, a stop-watch is essential. This one is shock resistant, weighs very little (less than 2oz), and, it is claimed, is laser-tuned to make it accurate to 1/100th of a second. Pounds 23.50 (Pounds 1.50 p+p) from The Conran Shop. Umbrellas are essential, if only to make sure that it does not rain. At Ascot, no logos are allowed so keep it plain. Most traditional examples come from James Smith &amp; Co, 53 New Oxford Street, London WC1 but Liberty has some stunning ones, with the collection by Siobhan O'Neill deserving special mention (we featured one with a spectacular see-through perspex handle a few weeks ago, Pounds 70). Jean-Paul Gaultier has a stunning brolly with a double layer of printed fabric and netting (Pounds 135). Should the sun shine and you need more of a parasol than an umbrella, Chantal Thomass offers one that is very My Fair Lady in white with lots of frills (Pounds 75). If your tastes run more to black and white and the surreal then there is a Fornasetti version at Pounds 69. No outdoor sporting event should be embarked upon without a rug. Smartest (and most expensive) are at Asprey, 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1 where they come in delicious Paisley patterns and have neat little leather handles to hold it rolled up (Pounds 210). Cheaper at Brora, 7a Filmer Road Studios, 75 Filmer Road, London SW6, where 6ft x 5ft, 52oz tartan wool rugs sell at Pounds 55 each or Pounds 99 for a pair. You can find cheaper still at Evergreen (Dept A/J, Albert Mills, Bradford Road, Batley Carr, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire) where 72in x 54in fringed rugs made from recycled fibres (95 per cent wool, 5 per cent other fibres) are Pounds 24.99 (p+p Pounds 2.50). Practical at Flectalon, which has produced a rug which doubles as a picnic bag - an insulated bag capable of holding 25 litres - can be unzipped to become a 6ft 6in x 4ft 8in rug, waterproof backed (Pounds 58.75, John Lewis partnership stores and the General Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street, London SW1 or tel: 0443-843717 for nearest stockist). Even on the bleakest of picnics the white wine should be chilled. The Ice Wrap, a velcro fastened wrap-around pack with a pocket to hold the frozen gel (which should be kept at the ready in a freezer) will cool a bottle in under half an hour and keep it that way for up to eight hours. Pounds 7.99 by Flectalon. For stockists, see above. Binoculars - beg, borrow or buy whether you are going to Wimbledon (lovely for celebrity spotting and following that forehand), cricket, Henley, Ascot or Cowes. When buying, remember the best optics these days are very expensive so there is no substitute for carefully assessing what best suits your own eyes. Try a grand name (Leitz, Zeiss) first as a benchmark against which you can test less expensive versions. Above: keep track of the cricket Test score with a solar-powered radio and you need never worry about your batteries running low. Do not worry too much about the 'solar' - it also responds to ordinary daylight and electric light. It costs Pounds 18.95 (plus Pounds 1.75 p+p) from The Conran Shop. Cartier-Bresson would not be excited but the Action Tracker camera is designed to provide a little fun when outdoors. It takes four sequential shots which come out on the same print - good for analysing golf swings, or photographing the finish of a race. It takes a normal 35mm film but you must remember to ask the developers to print the whole of the negative. It costs Pounds 11.50 (p+p Pounds 1.50) from The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3 6RD. Above and left: portable TVs. If you have seats on court number 14 and you want to follow the action on the centre court or if you are at Henley and cannot bear to miss the Wimbledon finals, then a portable TV is essential. Casio offers at least five models, of which the cheapest is the TV-480 which has a 2.2in screen and auto tuning for Pounds 109.99. Best of all is the TV-7100 which has a reversible detachable sun hood so you get a clear picture even when watching out of doors. The colour screen is 3.3ins and it costs Pounds 219.99. Pictured above is the Hanro vest. There are thermal vests and thermal vests. The Hanro is the state-of-the-art apogee of the genre - with prices to match. There are necklines and sleevelines to accommodate almost every dress that is decent (V-necked, round-necked, spaghetti-strapped, short-sleeved, sleeveless and long-sleeved). The finest knitted silk is the warmest. Prices range from about Pounds 27 to Pounds 37.50, depending upon the style. They are widely available from good department stores such as Fenwick of Bond Street. For a local stockist, tel: 071-245 6231 Calver &amp; Wilson does gorgeous things with velvet, primarily aimed at winter party goers. Given that outdoors at Hurlingham, Glyndebourne or Clonter Opera is likely to be a lot colder than anything held indoors in December, why not order one of their sumptuous velvet capes now? They need two weeks' notice, most people order them in black with a jewel-colour contrasting lining, but any other colour is available. They cost Pounds 390 and should see you glamorously through a life-time of shivering summer evenings. Tel: 071-724 6771. Toosh, Shahtoosh and Pashmina shawls, made from the finest grades of cashmere, are investment garments. They are the shawls that slip through a wedding ring and are so soft, so warm and so light that they are the perfect evening cover-up. Although they cost a great deal, (prices range from Pounds 500 to more than Pounds 1,000, depending on the grade and the quality) they are completely understated. The shawls come in three grades with Pashmina wool - combed from the underbellies of goats that live in the mountains of Kashmir - being the least expensive. Then comes Shahtoosh, combed from goat chin and underbelly and, finally, Toosh, the finest quality, combed only from under the throat of the goat. All the shawls are in plain colours - soft brown, indigo, dark russet red and black - but they can be embellished with simple bands of silk embroidery. Madeleine Trehearne, an English academic who knows India well, imports the shawls in small quantities and sells them from her home. Contact her on 071-435 6310.</p>

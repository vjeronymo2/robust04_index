			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: MEPs will stick to guns on vote Sir, Klaus Kinkel was quite right to state that the UK position on qualified majority voting in an enlarged Community is unacceptable to the European Parliament and that the latter would reject any such solution ('Vote dispute threatens EU expansion', March 9). The reasons are simple: the UK position would render decision-taking in the EU even more difficult than at present. Citizens of all 16 member states have a right to expect the EU to be capable of taking decisions in those areas where it holds responsibilities. The UK position is a recipe for more paralysis in the EU. The European Parliament will certainly stick to its guns. David Martin, MEP, Strasbourg</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]Federation of Electric Power Companies Chairman Kohei  Abe (president, Chubu Electric Power Company) revealed in a  press conference on 19 November that it now appears certain  construction on the FBR demonstration reactor will not begin  until after the turn of the century. The FBR forms plutonium and  generates electric power at the same time, so it produces a  greater amount of fresh fuel than it consumes. The present  Long-Range Plan for Development and Use of Atomic Energy  (established in 1990) targets construction for the FBR  demonstration reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s.    The demonstration reactor, which will have an output of  670,000 kW, is the successor to the FBR prototype Monju (Tsuruga  City, Fukui Prefecture; output 280,00 kW) built by PNC that is  due to reach criticality next year. It has already been  determined that the demonstration reactor will have a top entry  format, which will give it shorter piping and a simpler  structure than Monju. The site, however, is still undecided.    The Federation of Electric Power Companies FBR Policy  Council, consisting of the Executive Vice Presidents in Charge  of Atomic Energy of the Nine Power Companies, has been reviewing  the question of when to start construction of the FBR  demonstration reactor. The Council concluded in its interim  report that construction should be postponed. Mr. Abe said, ``I  believe there will be a report (on delaying the start of  construction) at the next Nine Power Companies Presidential  Meeting (scheduled for 15 December).''    For the same amount of output, construction costs FBRs will  not only run 1.5 times those of the mainstream LWR commercial  power plants currently in use, but it appears that delays in the  startup of Monju have affected the decision to postpone  construction of the demonstration reactor. The U.S. and  countries in Europe, which led the way in FBR research, are  abandoning or suspending FBR projects one after the other.</p>

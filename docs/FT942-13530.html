			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / G7 warns Russia to keep economy on tight rein Russia was yesterday given a clear warning from the world's leading industrial nations that it must put into effect tough economic decisions following last week's approval of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) credit from the International Monetary Fund. At a meeting with finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Russian officials were told they must deliver on their promises to reduce the budget deficit to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 8 per cent in 1993 and reduce the expansion of credit by the monetary authorities. 'We must now have a decisive implementation of budget and monetary policies' by Russia, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said. According to UK officials, the message was echoed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who said the Russians must keep up their reform policies if they were to obtain more assistance. The G7 discussed the prospect of Russia obtaining debt relief on obligations falling due this year from western creditor countries in the Paris Club. According to Mr Waigel, the Paris Club has offered to continue its 1993 debt rescheduling agreement until a 1994 deal has been agreed. Russia is also expected to begin negotiations with the IMF on a stand-by credit facility that could total Dollars 4bn once it has produced first details of its 1995 budget in the autumn. The G7 ministers were critical of the slow pace at which money passes through the pipeline to reach the ground in Russia, but put much of the blame on obstacles set up by Russia's government. US officials said the report from the G7 team in Moscow seeking to coordinate assistance was 'sobering' and complained that Russian officials even obstructed the delivery of visas to technical experts. 'The Russians were saying many of the right words but it remains to be seen what the deeds will be,' a senior US Treasury official said. 'There's a great deal the Russians can do to move things along,' he added. But G7 ministers also criticised the international financial institutions for not doing enough to use their own money to help the economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition to a market economy. A US official said it was important that the IMF and the World Bank 'do all that they prudently can,' noting that the IMF's own cash in proportion to its commitments is at historically high levels. The Russian delegation told the G7 meeting that the government was now ready to tap the World Bank loan proposed last year to help Russian local governments take over some of the social welfare services previously provided by the big state companies. The government had previously been reluctant to use these resources because of doubts about how the loan would be repaid.</p>

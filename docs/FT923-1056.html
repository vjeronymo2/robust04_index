			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fiat pre-tax profits slide to L655bn at halfway FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday reported a further steep setback in profits with a fall to L655bn (Dollars 525.68m) pre-tax in the first half of this year from L1,455bn in the same period of 1991. The decline, on a 2.2 per cent acquisition-driven sales rise to L30.142bn, reflects the group's continuing dilemma of heavy investment and research spending at a time of falling demand and shrinking profit margins. The weak earnings performance came in spite of the L860bn extraordinary gain from the sale of Fiat's remaining stake in Alcatel Italia, the telecommunications equipment company. Excluding the one-off gain, the group's ratio of pre-tax earnings to sales fell to 2.2 per cent from 4.9 per cent at the interim stage last year and 3 per cent for 1991 as a whole. There has been a sharp swing in Fiat's net financial position over the past 12 months, with a deficit of L2,510bn comparing with a surplus of L431bn. This stems mostly from this year's payment of almost L550bn in dividends and the assumption of heavy additional burdens after the purchase of Ford New Holland, which manufactures farming equipment, by Fiat's construction equipment subsidiary. The company has pumped around L1,000bn in new working capital into Ford New Holland. Fiat said it expected to close the year in profit, in spite of the deterioration in earnings. The core cars business was still breaking even, according to an official. However, the company revealed the margin on its industrial activities, principally cars, was now down to 0.3 per cent of sales, equivalent to just L78bn. With Fiat warning of virtual economic stagnation in Italy and the possible impact on consumption of the government's deficit-cutting measures - which will raise taxes and cut benefits - earnings will remain under pressure. Italy remains Fiat's key market for vehicles, and its share of sales is still falling. In the first half, its market share reached 44.4 per cent, against 47.5 per cent at end-June 1991. The outlook for the full year is not encouraging. Fiat gave no indication about its plans for the dividend, cut by 38 per cent for ordinary shares last year. Failing further asset sales, the prospect for earnings and the dividend seem poor.</p>

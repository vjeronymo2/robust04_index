			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS DIVIDED OVER THE BENEFITS OF OAT BRAN;  </P> <P> CHOLESTEROL: CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC DATA MEAN THAT THE CONTROVERSY MAY BE WITH  US A WHILE.  </P> <P> Consumers could have a hard time sifting through the mushy confusion of the oat  bran controversy that erupted last week when the New England Journal of  Medicine reported that a Harvard University study had all but debunked former  scientific conclusions of oat bran's cholesterol-lowering effect.  </P> <P> For the American Heart Assn., it is not so much a question of oats and oat bran  as it is a concern about fat in the diet. Other health authorities see the  problem as one of overall dietary management.  </P> <P> In light of conflicting scientific data and disagreement among scientists  themselves, relief from confusion over the oat bran controversy may not be  immediate. But here are comments from health experts that may provide a better  perspective on the issue.  </P> <P> "The effectiveness of a diet that lowers plasma cholesterol and consequently of  reducing one of the risks of heart attack and stroke, is dependent upon proper  choice of foods relative to fat and cholesterol content. A basic principle is  that food products from sea and land animal sources contain cholesterol.  Cholesterol is not found in any plant sources. The average person should limit  their fat intake to less than 30% of their total calories."  </P> <P>  -- Policy statement from the American Heart Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "We 're confident in the science that relates to grains being an important part  of the diet, and that includes research on both soluble and insoluble fiber. We  believe in the research that says that a diet high in fiber and low in fat can  reduce the risks of chronic diseases. Since oat bran is a good source of  soluble fiber, the extensive data available continues to support benefits of  this type of fiber. A diet low in fat and high fiber is recommended by numerous  health organizations, and ready to eat cereals can easily be part of the diet.  </P> <P> "We don't make claims that oat bran reduces cholesterol levels. We do, however,  point out that oat bran can be part of the low fat high fiber diet that we were  talking about."  </P> <P>  -- Nancy Roach, manager of corporate publicity, Kellogg Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "The study that was done on oat bran (Harvard University study) was not  definitive on the basis that the subjects had unusually low cholesterol levels  for the population of this country to begin with. When you run a study  measuring metabolic end point and start with a desirable end point, it's hard  to show improvement.  </P> <P> "People who have cholesterol levels higher than acceptable as far as risk  factors go, have been shown to benefit when their diet includes fiber that can  be solubilized in the intestine. Under these conditions, you'll find that  pectin, guar gum and, in some studies, oat bran, have properties that have been  shown to lower cholesterol levels, especially in people with elevated  cholesterol levels. I know it's disturbing in nutritional studies to find  inconsistencies, but they do occur. That's why it's necessary to look at the  conditions under which the studies were done. You have to look at the  population, the diet itself -- was it already low in cholesterol? -- and many  other factors."  </P> <P>  -- Dr. Sheldon Reiser, research leader of Carbohydrate Nutrition Laboratory,  Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, United States Department of  Agriculture  </P> <P> </P> <P> "The bottom line is that we should be focusing on lowering saturated fat in the  diet. There are many other foods besides oat bran that have also shown  cholesterol-lowering effects. There are lots of studies that show that foods  high in soluble fiber do lower cholesterol. Americans still need more fiber in  the diet, but it doesn't have to come from one source only. Beans, legumes,  peas, fruits, vegetables, carrots, broccoli are excellent sources of good fiber  of the type that lowers cholesterol.  </P> <P>  -- Evelyn Tribole R.D., American Dietetic Assn. spokesperson  </P> <P> </P> <P> "We should keep in mind that an increase in dietary fiber, especially from  grains, has been demonstrated, without question, to be helpful in  gastrointestinal functions. There is also preliminary evidence that a diet  higher in water soluble fibers, when substituted for fats, are associated with  lower risk of colon cancer. The public should not think that by sprinkling oats  on muffins that are high in fat it is going to help. The primary goal should be  to reduce saturated fat and dietary cholesterol even if it means a major change  in the diet."  </P> <P>  -- William L. Haskell Ph.D., associate professor of medicine, Stanford  University  </P> <P> </P> <P> "I have not read the paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, but have  heard the reviews. I concur with the information that there has been a hype  over what a specific bran might or might not do. Soluble fibers can be  important in lowering blood cholesterol, but large amounts have to be consumed  to have a significant effect. And I think those concerned with overall diet and  health should not look to a single food or a single kind of food as a remedy.  Instead they should follow the dietary principles we have all been told do work  -- and that is to eat a varied diet. People think it is boring because it is so  practical, but it makes very good sense for the population as a whole. If,  however, you have to follow a therapeutic diet, a few oat bran muffins is not  going to do the trick."  </P> <P>  -- Helene Swenerton Ph.D., nutritionist, Cooperative Extention, UC Davis  Department of Nutrition  </P> <P> </P> <P> "I am in disagreement with the conclusion (Harvard University study reported in  New England Journal of Medicine). In addition to the study design factors, the  fat intake was not carefully controlled. This in itself makes it difficult to  interpret. . . .  </P> <P> "Since the University of Kentucky's first scientific article in 1981 showing  the cholesterol-lowering effects of oat bran, seven additional published  studies and three unpublished studies have documented the statistically  significant cholesterol-lowering effect of oat bran. . . . An important factor  to consider is that the new study included dietitians and hospital employees of  Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital who would be more likely to have an enhanced  awareness of changes in their diet. While it was a placebo controlled study, 18  of 20 subjects recognized when they were on a high fiber supplement as opposed  to a low-fiber supplement. This, in itself, indicated that the study was not  successfully blinded. In addition, it is important to consider the fat intake  during the Harvard study. Caloric intake during the oat bran period consisted  of 35.4% fat. This was significantly higher than the fat intake during the low  fiber period, which was 30%. In other words, when research subjects were on the  oat bran they increased their fat intake by 18%. That is a large increase."  </P> <P>  -- James W. Anderson M.D., Metabolic Research Group, University of Kentucky  Medical Center  </P> <P> </P> <P> "If you eat oat bran and still take in butter, cream and other fats, it won't  do the trick to lower cholesterol. You can get good soluble fiber and cut down  on total fat and calories with foods other than just oat bran. If you eat a  diet high in fiber, especially soluble fiber, such as oat bran and other good  soluble fiber foods, but also reduce fat and cholesterol, and include some form  of exercise in your daily regimen, that would make sense. Unfortunately people  like to hang on to a panacea. There are no magic cures."  </P> <P>  -- Dr. Genevieve Ho, nutritionist, UC Agricultural Extension Service, Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling stronger SHORT sterling yesterday shrugged off any implications from a bigger than expected rise in retail sales that base rates might not have to fall, writes Peter John. The futures contract for December delivery concentrated on the view that an improvement in economic growth would make a tax rise at the Budget more likely. Economists expect any increase in taxes to be cushioned by easier rates. December futures hit a high of 94.66 yesterday and closed two basis points firmer on the day at 94.62. The nearer the price gets to 100 the more it discounts lower three-month lending and base rates. Gains in the UK were at odds with the performance of the principal short-term interest rate futures contracts for continental Europe. The D-Mark contract for December slipped 0.7 of a point to 93.74 as German securities repurchase operations saw bids from the banks accepted at 6.77 per cent at the lowest level, rather than 6.65 per cent as hoped. Also, the latest German money supply data came in slightly higher than expected and dampened hopes of an imminent reduction in key German interest rates. A German cut is seen as the spark which will set off a general trend of much-needed interest rate reductions, particularly in France. The French three-month contract was also weaker yesterday, closing 0.7 lower at 93.47. Operations in the UK money markets returned to a more comfortable level yesterday as a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.75bn was more or less dealt with at the earliest opportunity. Among the main factors affecting the shortage, later revised down to Pounds 1.7bn, were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 1.171bn from the system, bills for repurchase by the market, which took out Pounds 231m, and Exchequer transactions, which drained Pounds 95m. A rise in note circulation took up another Pounds 125m, while bankers' balances below target removed Pounds 105m. The Bank of England pro-vided Pounds 1.553bn of bills at 5 29/32 per cent for resale to the market on November 9 and 10. It gave a further Pounds 75m of assistance at midday, via band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent rate. Finally, the Bank provided Pounds 106m in the afternoon, via bills at 5 7/8 per cent, bringing total help to Pounds 1.714bn.</p>

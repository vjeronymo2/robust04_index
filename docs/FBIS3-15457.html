According to Petr Filippov, "the main purpose of the  department is to provide news media with objective and reliable  materials on policies of the president, the government of the  Russian Federation, and the most important socio-economic and  political problems of reforming Russian society, and the  measures taken for their settlement."    At the same time, the head of the Information Department  stressed, "the department will in no way be a new department for  propaganda of the cpsu central committee."    Petr Filippov was one of the organizers of establishing this  department. Basing his views on the experience of the Czech  Republic and other countries, he believes that the course of  economic reforms advances faster in society in those cases when  the population and news media receive full information on their  implementation.    According to the head of the Information Department, now  three problems cause the greatest concern. "First, the  situation in agriculture connected with reforming unprofitable  collective and state farms, and transforming an attitude towards  ownership. Second, the problem of non-payments. The third, the  problems of forming democracy in Russia, observing the  Constitution and developing federalism," Petr Filippov pointed  out.    Touching on the organization of the department's work, the  department head said that working in this office will be mainly  the same experts who worked with him in the analytical center on  social policy. The staff of the department will be about 50  people.</p>

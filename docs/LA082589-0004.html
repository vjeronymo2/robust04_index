			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL ROBERTS AND STANFORD  </P> <P> As a card-carrying member of the ACLU, I was deeply affected by Paul Craig  Roberts' recital of the tribulations of W. Glenn Campbell; how he has been so  persecuted for "helping to devise the outlines of the Reagan Revolution".  </P> <P> From my reading of the press and magazines I can testify that the Hoover  Institution has ably contributed a cutting edge to such institutions as the  American Enterprise Institute and Roberts' own Center for Strategic and  International Studies in their amassing of tendentious data espousing financial  and military aid to the dictatorships of Latin and Central America. They helped  us justify setting up and keeping in power such sterling examples of  government-by-death-squad as those of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and  subsidizing drug peddlers like Noriega in Panama.  </P> <P> For such great services to humanity it is shabby treatment indeed that Campbell  should resign with only a six-year contract as counselor to the Institution,  albeit with "substantial salary boosts."  </P> <P> I suggest an added grant, to enable him to visit the grateful recipients of his  ideological knuckleballs: the killing fields of El Salvador; the burned-out  peasant cooperatives of Nicaragua; the mothers of the "disappeared" of  Argentina, and Chile, and Uruguay.  </P> <P> FREDERIC E. PAMP  </P> <P> Santa Ynez  </P></p>

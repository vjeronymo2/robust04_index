			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Polish PM in economic policy promise to IMF POLAND is set on maintaining good relations with the International Monetary Fund with a view to achieving further reductions in its Dollars 47.2bn foreign debt, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the head of the new centre-left government, said yesterday. His statement to parliament commits the government to following stringent monetary policies acceptable to the IMF, which is unlikely to agree to any appreciable increase in next year's budget deficit over this year's target of 5 per cent of GDP. Mr Pawlak said policies would aim 'at reducing inflation'. The coalition government, elected on September 19 and formed out of the post-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and Mr Pawlak's Polish Peasant party (PSL), needs the IMF's approval for a 20 per cent reduction in the Dollars 30.6bn debt owed to the Paris Club of western government creditors. This was promised in 1991 as part of a 50 per cent debt reduction package agreed on condition that Poland remained in favour with the IMF. The commitment led Mr Pawlak yesterday to announce a markedly lower-than-expected pensions increase next year, in spite of previous demands from the government's own trade union supporters for rises. At the same time Mr Pawlak told the western banks grouped in the London Club, who are owed Dollars 12.3bn by Poland, that the new government would continue, like its predecessors, to look for a reduction 'comparable' to the Paris Club agreement. This is being resisted by the banks.</p>

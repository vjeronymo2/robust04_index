			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz arrived in  Amman yesterday evening to take part in the 17th ministerial  session of the ESCWA [Economic and Social Commission for Western  Asia], which opened its meetings in Amman yesterday.    Upon arrival, the Lebanese minister expressed happiness over  his visit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He said the  Lebanese people cherish and appreciate the Jordanian people and  that His Majesty King Husayn occupies a special place in the  hearts of all the Lebanese.    He added that during his visit he will take part in the  ESCWA's ministerial session, especially since Lebanon is one of  the countries nominated to serve as the headquarters for this  commission.    On the peace process, the Lebanese minister said that after  more than three years since the launching of the peace process  and the Madrid conference, this process has not achieved the  hopes that had been pinned on it. He asserted that the two  cosponsors of the Madrid conference should continue to play an  active role in line with the requirements of the Madrid process  through the resolutions of international legitimacy and to play  the role of a fair broker.    The Lebanese minister noted that he will meet with several  Jordanian officials to discuss Arab developments of interest to  both countries.</p>

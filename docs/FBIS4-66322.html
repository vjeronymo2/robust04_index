Box 525, Chengdu, 610003; MS received 20 Oct 92,  revised 20 Aug 93]    [Text] Abundant nonlinear processes may be produced in  submillimeter-size hohlraum targets by 1.053 m laser light  with duration of 1 ns and energy of 300-600 J. In experiments,  Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and Stimulated Raman  Scattering (SRS) were directly measured, and Resonance  Absorption (RA), Two-Plasmon Decay (TPD), and Ion Acoustic Decay  (IAD) were observed indirectly. The experimental results show  that SBS and SRS are the dominant nonlinear processes in cavity;  they can scatter about 40 percent of the incident laser energy.  Electron plasma waves stimulated by nonlinear processes such as  SRS, TPD, RA, and IAD are the sources of suprathermal electron  generation. Our research indicates that SRS is the chief process  for electron plasma-wave generation in hohlraum targets, and it  can produce suprathermal electrons with a total energy about 10  percent of incident laser energy. Because spectra of nonlinear  process scattering light are closely related to the plasma  state, we can obtain information about the plasma state through  intensive measurement and analysis of these spectra of the  scattering light.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- The head of the primary  coalition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan --  SDPJ], indicated Thursday [21 April] that his party will remain  in the eight-month-old ruling coalition, party officials said.  Tomiichi Murayama told a party meeting that the SDP will  continue efforts to keep the coalition intact against growing  speculation that the SDP may leave the alliance over policy gaps.    Murayama, speaking at a meeting of the party's leadership  body, the Central Executive Committee, expressed willingness to  continue talks with other coalition partners to find a  breakthrough to deadlocked negotiations on cementing policy  accords.    The coalition hopes to come to a consensus prior to picking  its candidate for a new premier in the Diet election who will  succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Talks among the coalition partners remain at an impasse over  how to find common ground to document policies on two remaining  key policies -- tax reform and Japan's stand on North Korea's  suspected nuclear development program. Murayama told the  meeting that the SDP will modify its own alternative on the two  key issues, saying the coalition partners can not reach  agreement on policy talks if they refuse to change any wording.</p>

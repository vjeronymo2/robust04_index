			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> EXXON OFFICIAL SEES MINIMAL CLEANUP  </P> <P> Exxon's top official in Alaska said that shorelines hit by the country's worst  oil spill were improving so well that he anticipated a minimal cleanup this  summer. Otto Harrison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup general manager, told  the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce that more work was needed on fewer than 50  miles of beach and perhaps only 24 miles. Neither state nor federal officials  endorsed Harrison's remarks and, in fact, said there was insufficient evidence  to support the Exxon conclusions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CULTURE THAT ALMOST GOT AWAY;  </P> <P> DANCE: THE KING ISLANDERS FROM ALASKA RESCUED A WAY OF LIFE THAT ALMOST  VANISHED IN THE '60S, PERFORMING SONGS THAT ORIGINATED WITH THEIR ANCESTORS  THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.  </P> <P> Paul Tiulana was sitting at his kitchen table in the city, reaching into the  past.  </P> <P> "Back there on King Island," he said, recalling the tiny Bering Sea settlement  on which he was born, "back there, you need some kind of entertainment. Long  winters. We danced."  </P> <P> It's been 24 years now since the government moved Tiulana, his family and their  neighbors off King Island -- 24 years since they scattered to Anchorage and  Nome and other points south, places with better schools, better housing, less  dangerous weather.  </P> <P> One thing has kept the community alive in the years since -- Eskimo song and  dance.  </P> <P> Tiulana, 68, is the founder and leader of the King Island Inupiat Singers and  Dancers, one of Alaska's better-known native performance troupes. In a state  where traditional song and dance remain an important, living part of culture in  many Eskimo and Indian settlements, the King Island group has become one of the  most traveled, performing in Washington, London, Siberia and throughout their  home state.  </P> <P> Today, the King Islanders arrive in Southern California for the Los Angeles  Festival, which officially opens Saturday at Angel's Gate and Point Fermin  Park. They will be among native performers from throughout the Pacific who are  scheduled to participate in opening ceremonies at a variety of venues through  Sept. 17.  </P> <P> With pulsing rhythms from walrus-skin drums, the 20-member King Island group  performs songs that originated with their ancestors thousands of years ago.  Songs celebrate successful hunts, relate myths, pass on information. In the  Inupiat world, without a written language, songs and dance were how history and  values were passed on from one generation to the next.  </P> <P> For the King Islanders, especially Tiulana, his wife and the two other older  couples that form the group's core, the leap from aboriginal villagers to  performers sometimes seems like a journey across millennia.  </P> <P> King Island is a mountaintop poking out of the icy waters 35 miles off the  western Alaska coast. The 200-or-so residents lived off the land and the sea  with little contact with the white world until earlier this century. They lived  in tiny, ramshackle houses on stilts clinging to a steep hillside above the  water.  </P> <P> The dances evolved within the limits of the cramped environment -- crouches  with intense hand and arm movement that became more frenetic as the intensity  of the music grew, but which needed almost no floor space.  </P> <P> Tiulana was raised to be a polar-bear hunter. He used some of the Stone Age  tools of his ancestors. He stored his game in a cave. He grew to be a man on a  King Island diet of walrus, bearded seal, puffin soup and wild greens.  </P> <P> Then World War II came along and Tiulana was drafted into the Army and  simultaneously catapulted into 20th-Century American society. He visited the  mainland for the first time.  </P> <P> Eventually, he returned to the island, married and raised seven children. But  by the 1960s, King Island was becoming a ghost town. People began drifting away  to easier lives elsewhere. A tuberculosis epidemic hit. The Department of the  Interior finally closed the school and the Tiulanas were relocated in Nome, 90  miles away. Paul went to work as a janitor in a bank. The Inupiat culture began  to slip away.  </P> <P> "We almost lost it," Tiulana said recently. But then, a few years ago, he had  an idea: Why not get the King Islanders together and dance, like the old days?  They rented a community hall and everyone had a blast. They started getting  together regularly until the dance group became a sort of government-in-exile  for the villagers without a village, a way to remember who they were in a  changing world.  </P> <P> Tiulana and other islanders traveled to Anchorage, performing their dances and  selling ivory carvings. Business was good. The family decided to stay and the  King Island troupe was born.  </P> <P> "It was just like starting a new life," he said.  </P> <P> Nothing on King Island prepared the Tiulanas for their new life in the city.  Paul learned to drive a truck in Nome, but recalls the terror of pulling his  car into city traffic in those days. His wife, Clara, always sat next to him  with a big road map unfolded, navigating their course through town.  </P> <P> "There were many more rules and regulations living in the city," he said. "Out  at King Island, we were more independent."  </P> <P> But the Tiulanas adapted. Paul made a living as an artist. Eventually the  National Endowment for the Arts honored him with a Heritage Award, and two  years ago he published his autobiography.  </P> <P> The Tiulanas are a study in cultural contrasts. Clara sits in the living room  of their modest Anchorage home watching a game show on television while sewing  a pair of boots out of the hide of a bearded seal, hunted by a son earlier this  year. The rich, fishy aroma of seal oil, a staple of the Eskimo diet, fills the  house.  </P> <P> Paul and Clara occasionally break into Inupiat, one of three major Eskimo  dialects still spoken here. Their children speak the language, too, although  the grandchildren understand little of what they say.  </P> <P> The Tiulana grandchildren have recently become more involved with the dance  group to learn about their roots, he said. His daughter, Lillian, a computer  programmer for an oil company, points out that they have done so with the help  of videocassettes and a VCR.  </P> <P> The Tiulana daughters are all college graduates who have gone on to  professional careers. The sons became ivory carvers and followed their father's  path. Each spring, some of them return to Alaska's western coast to purchase  ivory and join the hunts for walrus and seal. Sometimes, on a rare calm day,  they take a skiff out into the sea to visit the island they were born.  </P> <P> Even for the grandchildren, who never lived on the island, the songs and dances  are threads connecting them to a past they otherwise have trouble  comprehending. It's a thread more native people in Alaska are looking to as a  way to make sense of dizzying cultural change.  </P> <P> Paul Tiulana is particularly proud of his 14-year-old grandson, Edward, an  up-and-coming star of the King Island group. During the performances, he dons a  hand-carved wooden masks of a walrus and the raven and breaks into urgent,  confident dances.  </P> <P> "I remember he asked me, 'How am I going to dance? I can't dance,' " Tiulana  said. "But he never resisted. He learned and he graduated into the Eskimo  world."  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Pact on ozone layer set to be tightened A WORLD-WIDE treaty to protect the ozone layer of the atmosphere looked set early today to be tightened for the third time in its five-year life, writes Bronwen Maddox in Copenhagen. This follows negotiations by ministers and officials at a three-day United Nations conference. Mr David Maclean, UK environment minister, said: 'We think we have agreed a package that has something for everyone.' The main part of the new version of the 1987 Montreal protocol, to be formally agreed today, is a commitment by industrialised countries to phase out certain damaging chemicals by 1996 instead of the previous date of 2000. The turning point came when industrialised countries pledged up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) on top of Dollars 240m already committed to help developing countries phase out chemicals that harm the ozone layer. In return, developing countries look set to phase out some chemicals by 2006, four years earlier than previously agreed.</p>

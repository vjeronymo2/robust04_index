			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: W. LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> BOARD CANDIDATE DROPS OUT  </P> <P> Gary Garcia, a candidate for the Los Angeles school board's 2nd District seat  in the April election, has announced his decision to withdraw from the race.  Garcia, an English and history teacher at Hamilton High School, endorsed  challenger Mark Slavkin over incumbent Alan Gershman.  </P> <P> Garcia, whose campaign never picked up much support, said he was dropping out  of the race to devote more time to his students.  </P> <P> "I am committed to my students," he said. "I feel this is an important time to  put extra effort into teaching to maintain my students' confidence in our  educational system. They have been very supportive of me in my desire to run  for the board. Now, however, I think I may be most supportive of them by  choosing not to divert any of my attention from teaching."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: MAYBE NINE NO-HITTERS ARE JUST RESULTS OF LUCK  </P> <P> To date, scientists in the field have tendered the following explanations for  the record nine no-hitters dispensed by pitchers in the major leagues this  year:  </P> <P>  -- The ball is smaller.  </P> <P>  -- Gloves are larger.  </P> <P>  -- Fences are softer, allowing flyhawks to crash into them and catch balls  they would have been unable to catch crashing into hard fences.  </P> <P>  -- Talent is diluted.  </P> <P>  -- Spring training was shortened; batters never caught up.  </P> <P>  -- Barometric pressures have worked against the hitters.  </P> <P>  -- Official scorers are suspect, changing hits to errors.  </P> <P>  -- Whopping contracts are tempting hitters to go after bad pitches; one  doesn't get $3 million for walking.  </P> <P> This is a serious matter, especially pertaining to the ball Wade Boggs has  assayed as an eighth of an inch smaller.  </P> <P> Whipping out his jeweler's glass, Tom Lasorda inspects the ball and reports it  hasn't changed.  </P> <P> But that isn't what he said in 1987 when a record 2,634 home runs were struck.  By July 1, Mark McGwire alone had hit 28. George Bell had 27.  </P> <P> Through their spokesman, Sparky Anderson, selected for his Churchillian  eloquence, Lasorda, Whitey Herzog and maybe half a dozen other managers  announced:  </P> <P> "When certain hitters who are lucky to hit four homers all year have hit 16 by  the All-Star break, we are not playing with the same ball as before."  </P> <P> Mike Schmidt submitted it wasn't the ball at all. It was the growing incidence  of split-finger fastballs.  </P> <P> "When the split-finger doesn't split, you've got a nothing pitch," Schmidt  testified. "The split-finger is making hitters rich."  </P> <P> Yet Phil Niekro, a once vaunted warrior, now a coach with Atlanta, credits the  split-finger for the no-hit epidemic today.  </P> <P> "It's the pitch of the age," Phil says. "It fools a lot of batters."  </P> <P> Informed that Boggs sees the baseball as fractionally smaller this year, Niekro  responds:  </P> <P> "When a ball collapses at the plate or travels 95 (m.p.h.), it seems smaller to  everyone."  </P> <P> Major league baseballs have been produced since 1977 by Rawlings, which sends  the materials to a factory in Haiti for assemblage.  </P> <P> Told that voodoo has been practiced for centuries in Haiti, baseball scholars  tapped the old scalp. Haitians wrapping the balls were giving them the  spiritual dipsy-do.  </P> <P> Then as fast as it came, the home run explosion vanished.  </P> <P> "Everyone knew why," a Rawlings man explained. "We had switched back to the old  balls."  </P> <P> "And there actually was no change in baseballs?"  </P> <P> "Of course not. The formula has been the same ever since we started making  them."  </P> <P> And Rawlings insists that the formula for the balls used in today's no-hitters  is identical to that the year all the home runs were hit.  </P> <P> So what created that rash of homers in '87?  </P> <P> "Very likely a passing surge of strength on the part of the hitters," the  Rawlings man answered.  </P> <P> Today, we may be witnessing a passing surge of strength by pitchers. The  previous record for no-hitters in a season was seven, posted in 1917 when many  prime hitters had entered the service of their government.  </P> <P> So, you ask, if the hitters entered the service, what were the pitchers doing?  </P> <P> The answer: They were throwing no-hitters.  </P> <P> If the Persian Gulf involvement should lead to conscription in America, hitters  wish to drop the reminder it is the pitchers' turn to go.  </P> <P> "You hear all these explanations for no-hitters, but no one mentions luck,"  Niekro says. "I threw a no-hitter against San Diego in 1973. My stuff that day  was nothing.  </P> <P> "But our second baseman makes a great stop on one play. And, on another, our  shortstop flags down a tough grounder. The throw is late. They give the  shortstop an error. It should have been ruled a hit. That's what I mean about  luck."  </P> <P> He reflects a moment on the no-hit phenomenon, then continues:  </P> <P> "Ken Holtzman threw a no-hitter for the Cubs without striking out a batter. If  everyone gets wood on the ball, don't you think a pitcher needs luck? And look  at that Andy Hawkins with the Yankees. He throws a no-hitter this year -- and  loses, 4-0."  </P> <P> What happened in the Hawkins case was, the ball was so small that day the  Yankees couldn't field it.  </P></p>

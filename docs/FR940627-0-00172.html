			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An appendix is also required for each of the tests conducted in compliance with Tier 2 requirements. These appendices must contain the full detailed study protocol, complete laboratory report, statistical analysis of the findings, and scientific conclusions. These materials must conform to the reporting requirements of the individual study guidelines as well as the general standards for recordkeeping and reporting specified in the GLP standards of this final rule (see &sect;79.60). A final appendix must be provided, containing laboratory certifications and associated personnel credentials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Tier 3 Report <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reports for additional tests required under the Tier 3 provisions must include a cover page with identifying information as described above for the Tier 1 and 2 summary report(s). The report must begin with a discussion of the concerns arising under the previous tiers which led to the Tier 3 requirements, the specific objectives of the additional studies, and a summary of pertinent results and conclusions. References used in support of Tier 3 conclusions must be cited in the report. The Tier 3 summary discussion must be supported with appendices containing the kinds of documentation discussed above with respect to Tier 2. The laboratory conducting the required tests must be identified, and relevant certifications and personnel credentials provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Confidential Business Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the results of tests ``conducted in conformity with test procedures and protocols established by the Administrator,'' pursuant to CAA section 211(b)(2)(A), shall not be considered confidential. Thus, health and welfare information supplied to EPA in compliance with Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 testing requirements will be made available to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers (or groups) claiming business confidentiality on any information submitted under the F/FA testing program must make a claim of confidentiality in writing at the time of submittal of the reporting requirements. To assert a business confidentiality claim the submitter must clearly mark the confidential information and must submit a separate document setting forth the claim and listing each location at which the confidential information appears in the submitted data. If any person subsequently requests access to the test data submitted under the F/FA testing program (other than health and welfare effects information) and such information is subject to a claim of business confidentiality, the request and any subsequent disclosure will be governed by the provisions of 40 CFR part 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XIII. Administrative Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``economically significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A regulatory support document which presents EPA's analysis of the cost impacts of this final rule is available for review in the public docket (A&hyph;90&hyph;07). EPA estimates that the costs to industry for submittal of the requisite data for Tiers 1 and 2 would total approximately $66 million, assumed to be incurred over the first three-year period after promulgation of this final rule. Thus, the average annual cost during this period would be about $22 million. In the subsequent three years, Tier 3 requirements might cost an additional $1 million annually, per product or group. If ten products or groups were required to conduct Tier 3 testing in the three-year period following the initial compliance period, the cost would be $10 million per year. These projected overall costs are far less than the $100 million annual cost criterion which is a major determinant in defining an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' In addition, this final rule is not expected to adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not ``economically significant'' based on the above criteria, this final rule is still considered a ``significant regulatory action'' pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866 and was thus submitted to OMB for review. Any written comments from OMB and any EPA response to OMB's comments are available in the public docket for this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

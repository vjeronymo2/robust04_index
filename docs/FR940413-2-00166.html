AM General has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.3.1.1 of Standard No. 108 states in part that ``*&blank;*&blank;* no part of the vehicle shall prevent *&blank;*&blank;* any other lamp from meeting the photometric output at any test point specified in any applicable SAE Standard or Recommended Practice.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AM General determined that certain of its 1992&hyph;1994 HUMMER vehicles do not meet the requirements of Paragraph S5.3.1.1 in Standard No. 108. The HUMMER is a truck. Its gross vehicle weight rating is 10,300 pounds. The noncompliant vehicles were built from July 1992 through February 1994, and are those models equipped with an optional rear-mounted, swingaway carrier for a full-size spare tire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AM General stated that the HUMMER is required to be equipped with identification lamps at the rear of the vehicle, since the width of the HUMMER exceeds 80 inches. The HUMMER has three identification lamps (left-side, center, and right-side) mounted on a horizontal bar just above the rear bumper. The noncompliance is that the optional spare tire and its carrier, supported by the rear bumper, obstruct some visibility of each of the three identification lamps. On 578 vehicles, built from July 1992 through January 1994, a photometric noncompliance exists at the 10U 45R test point on the right lamp, and the 10U 45L test point on the left and center lamps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AM General explained that its solution for this problem was to lower the lamps by 0.75 inch. However, ``[s]ubsequent to implementing this revision, it was discovered that a small hex screw head (1/4 x 5/8) on the spare tire carrier now obstructed the [V 10]D test point on the center lamp with the lamp in the revised lower position.'' The vehicles involved in this second noncompliance were built in February 1994. The actual number of vehicles is not known at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AM General stated it believes the first noncompliance among the 578 vehicles is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and offered the following rationale: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The obscuration of the lamps by the wheel/tire assembly affects only a 10 U45 test point for each lamp *&blank;*&blank;*. [T]his typically reduces the visibility angle from 10 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; to about 7 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;. At a following distance of 12 feet in an adjacent lane, this reduces the effective visibility point by less than 8 [inches] *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The obscuration occurs only in close proximity to the vehicle. Since an identification lamp is a steady-burning market lamp, not a signaling lamp, its function is most important as a vehicle approaches from the rear. For approaching vehicles in which the operator's seating position is high above the ground, such as a bus or a heavy truck, the lamp would be fully visible to the operator until the operator was about 25 [feet] behind. For conventional passenger cars, the lamp will remain visible until the operator is 12&hyph;15 [feet] behind. (This assumes a go/no go visibility situation. In reality the lower portion of the lamp lens will still be visible at these distances, although the photometric output is reduced). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rear surface of the HUMMER is already highly&blank;&blank; decorated&blank; with&blank; multiple&blank;&blank; marker lamps *&blank;*&blank;*. In addition to the partially obstructed identification lamp(s), at least one identification lamp is always visible from either side. A clearance lamp is supplied on the rear of each fender, as well as two taillamps *&blank;*&blank;*. With so much prominent lighting on the rear of the vehicle we believe that the loss of visibility of a portion of each lamp in only a very small visibility regime represents no hazard to motor vehicle safety. Any following vehicle in an adjacent lane will have more than sufficient indication of the size and presence of the vehicle. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AM General also stated it believes the second noncompliance among the vehicles built in February 1994 is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and offered the following rationale: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The obscuration of the lamp affects only the V [10]D test point. As described above, the HUMMER is already amply equipped with rear marker lamps, and any following vehicle will have more than adequate notice of the presence of the vehicle. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of AM General, described above.

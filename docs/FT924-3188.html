			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Observer: In the dark A black day for Transport Minister Steven Norris and his official re-opening of London's Victoria coach station, restyled and fitted with all kinds of high-tech gadgetry at a cost of Pounds 4m. For one thing, his mother - a regular coach-traveller - had bowled down from Nottingham to see him perform. But he, coming only a mile or so from the Transport Department's headquarters, got held up by heavy traffic and was 20 minutes late. What's more, even when he arrived, there was no lighting, no heating, nothing on the new passenger-information screens, and no computer ticket-dispensers at work. Thanks to a local power failure, Britain's busiest coach station - with 160,000 comings and goings a year - was blacked out. So he took his mother on a tour of the gloomy complex, sporadically enthusing about how excellent the improvements would be when they worked. And at least there were some real-life passengers to see, awaiting their departures in the dark.</p>

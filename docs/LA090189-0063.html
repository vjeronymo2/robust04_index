			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN DROPS SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED DRUG CENTER  </P> <P> Nancy Reagan has formally withdrawn her support of a proposed Los Angeles drug  treatment center to be operated by Phoenix House and asked that 200 donors who  pledged $5 million to the project be given the opportunity to transfer their  donations to her own Nancy Reagan Foundation, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> "This is a major disappointment to us," said Chris Policano, spokesman for  Phoenix House in New York, a private foundation that operates a variety of drug  programs across the country. "There had been no prior dissension. It was a  surprise; let me leave it at that. . . . But she has changed her mind. And that  is her decision to make."  </P> <P> Phoenix House, meanwhile, has sent letters notifying donors of Mrs. Reagan's  wishes but informing them that the foundation believes that it has a legal  obligation to use the money for a drug treatment center somewhere in the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scope of Program  </P> <P> However, Policano said, the scope of the program would undoubtedly be  "narrowed" because of the organization's loss of the Nancy Reagan name as a  fund-raising asset.  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan's spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said in an interview Thursday that Mrs.  Reagan believed that she was "spreading herself too thin" because she was doing  so much work with her own foundation, her upcoming book and charitable work on  behalf of cancer patients.  </P> <P> "She felt she couldn't get the drug center done properly," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> Asked what Mrs. Reagan believes should happen to the money raised for the  center, he said: "Mrs. Reagan believes it is up to each donor to decide what  should happen to their donations."  </P> <P> However, the law may not allow contributors to re-channel their donations once  given, according to an opinion Phoenix House requested of the California  attorney general three weeks ago.  </P> <P> "Maybe some of those donors would have preferred to transfer to her (Nancy  Reagan's) organization," said Carole Ritts Kornblum, the assistant attorney  general who rendered the opinion, in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> "But that's all history. It doesn't matter. . . . I don't think there's any  legal obligation on the part of Phoenix House, which received gifts, to forward  them to any other charity," Kornblum said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Decision  </P> <P> Policano said that to date, only three contributors have asked that their  donations, totaling $65,000, be returned or transferred. No decision had been  made as yet as to what would happen with those donations, he said.  </P> <P> The former First Lady announced in May that she was withdrawing her support for  the proposed site for the center in Lake View Terrace because of opposition  from homeowners there. A source close to Mrs. Reagan said she told Phoenix  House officials informally shortly after that discussion that she would be  dropping her support of the project altogether.  </P> <P> However, Policano said a staff aide to Mrs. Reagan did not notify Phoenix House  until Aug. 8 that she would no longer lend her name or fund-raising powers to  the proposed treatment center and that she "was going to use the Nancy Reagan  Foundation as the base of her post-White House efforts."  </P> <P> As a result of the notification, he said, the board of directors drafted a  letter that it sent to more than 200 donors who had contributed about $2.8  million in cash and made another $2.2 million in pledges to "clarify the  situation."  </P> <P> The letter informed donors that Mrs. Reagan's change of heart "was a costly  one."  </P> <P> More than $600,000 had already been spent on the Lake View Terrace project. The  funds were used to purchase an abandoned hospital that was to have been the  site of the drug treatment facility and develop the program there, the letter  said.  </P> <P> "Let me point out that the directors of Phoenix Houses of California were  willing to make so large an investment . . . because of iron-clad assurances we  had received from Mrs. Reagan, her advisers and aides," said the letter, which  was signed by Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House Foundation  Inc.  </P> <P> In a related development, The Times learned, the Nancy Reagan Foundation  formally requested -- and received -- permission to withdraw another $3 million  from a permanent endowment at the Community Foundation of Greater Washington  Inc. to fight substance abuse. Mrs. Reagan had helped raise the funds during  her years in the White House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funds for Campaign  </P> <P> Weinberg said Mrs. Reagan's understanding was that those funds "were always for  her to continue her anti-drug abuse campaign, and once the (Nancy Reagan)  foundation was established, then the funds were made available so her work  could continue."  </P> <P> However, Dick Snowden, chairman of the board of the Washington foundation, said  in an interview that the board was under no obligation to honor such a request.  It agreed to do so after first ascertaining that the new Nancy Reagan  Foundation would distribute the funds according to the wishes of the donors.  </P> <P> Snowden said the question of what would happen to the funds was "never spelled  out" when it was set up in the early 1980s. The contract under which the fund  was established called for it to be an ongoing endowment from which the  foundation board would distribute funds with the advice of Mrs. Reagan, he  said.  </P> <P> The Nancy Reagan Foundation requested return of the funds last spring.  </P> <P> "Our board wrestled with it, but it didn't wrestle too hard," Snowden said.  "There was opposition in the sense that, frankly, our greatest concern was that  during the time the fund had been here, not as much money had stayed here in  Washington as we would have liked and we had expected."  </P> <P> He said the board's debate also centered on the fear that if the funds had not  been released, then future first ladies or other officials might be hesitant to  deposit funds there. He said no other such endowment has been transferred.  </P> <P> The Nancy Reagan Foundation is considering 40 requests for grants from drug  prevention and education programs around Southern California. A celebrity  tennis tournament is scheduled for Oct. 7 to raise more funds for the  foundation.  </P></p>

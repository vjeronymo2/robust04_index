			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPIRITS FALL WITH THE WATER LEVEL AT LAKE MORENA  </P> <P> Frankie Read stood on the sandy bottom of Lake Morena last week and surveyed  the view. All around her, where millions of gallons of water used to be,  once-hidden rocks stood tall and dusty in the sun. On the far bank, the effect  of recent draining was plain. About 30 feet below what was once the reservoir's  edge a new, muddy shoreline has emerged. Nearby, the village boat ramp no  longer reaches the water.  </P> <P> "As you can see, we're walking underwater," Mrs. Read, an organic gardener and  eight-year resident of Lake Morena Village, said as she kicked silt from her  boots. Like many of her neighbors in the southeast San Diego County hamlet, she  usually describes the lake in terms of what used to be.  </P> <P> Before the city of San Diego transferred nearly 2.8 billion gallons from Lake  Morena into a neighboring reservoir, Barrett Lake, the water was blue. Now,  it's turquoise, so laden with algae in some areas that visitors smell the odor  before they reach the shore. Before March, when the three months of draining  began, parents didn't worry about letting their children swim in the  1,100-acre, 144-foot lake. Now, parents caution their children not to get stuck  in the mud.  </P> <P> Today, Lake Morena is 440 acres and 114 feet deep, and John Lyons-Lake Morena  Regional Park, once a magnet for fishermen, campers and rare birds alike, is  drawing fewer visitors. At the Express Quick Mart at the center of town, bait  and tackle sales have slowed to a trickle. And it's been months since anyone  has seen the pair of endangered American bald eagles that used to nest on a  granite bluff overlooking the lake.  </P> <P> "When (the city) took the lake, everyone just thought this area was deadville,"  said Dorothy Tobin, who runs a horse farm near the park's entrance, about 8  miles from the Mexican border. "The herons are gone, and most of the hawks. And  the economy has dried up."  </P> <P> Throughout the draining, which ended in June, San Diego officials said the  transfer of water was necessary to reduce Lake Morena's high evaporation rate.  The lake, part of a three-reservoir system designed to serve San Diego in case  of emergency, supplies water downstream to Lake Barrett and Otay Reservoir,  where a filtration plant is situated. Draining the lake, officials said, was  essential to the greater good.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loss of Recreation for San Diegans  </P> <P> Townspeople point out, however, that the shrinking of Lake Morena is more than  a small-town tragedy. According to county figures, of the 300,000 people who  camped, boated and fished around the lake last year, 80% were from the city of  San Diego.  </P> <P> "The city has really hurt San Diegans themselves, and the people don't even  know it," said Richard Leach, the president of the Lake Morena-Campo Chamber of  Commerce. "It's not just our lake, it's their lake, too."  </P> <P> Environmental activists worry that the fate of Lake Morena, once one of the  region's principal stopovers for migratory birds, may establish a dangerous  precedent.  </P> <P> "Reservoirs are one of the few things man constructs that have the capability  to improve the environment," said Bobbie Moran, the Sierra Club's wildlife  chairman. "The question is, if you create a habitat that attracts endangered  species, do you have the right to destroy it? In the creation of environmental  policy, the draining of reservoirs has fallen between the cracks."  </P> <P> The Sierra Club maintains that, because reservoirs enhance the environment,  their drainage should be regulated under the California Environmental Quality  Act, which requires that state and local agencies complete environmental impact  studies for projects that may alter the project area.  </P> <P> That view has been seconded by state attorneys who, at the request of  Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista), analyzed whether the environmental act  pertains to city water management. Their 1988 finding: the state would have  ample grounds to challenge San Diego's disruption of Lake Morena. As yet,  however, the state has not undertaken such a challenge.  </P> <P> County officials call the city's drainage policy indefensible.  </P> <P> "The city has no water management plan," said Dianne Jacob, chief of staff for  county Supervisor George Bailey. "It has never made any sense to us why they're  draining Lake Morena."  </P> <P> Under a 1970 agreement with the county, however, the city of San Diego owns the  lake's water rights and may drain it to 98.5 feet, about 15 feet lower than its  current level. The city has maintained that, although an environmental impact  study is required before filling a reservoir, no such study need be done to  drain one. So far, that approach has been upheld in the courts.  </P> <P> In February, Superior Court Judge William C. Pate ruled that the lake is a  city-operated reservoir and that draining it is an administrative function that  does not require state reviews. In March, a lawyer representing the Lake Morena  residents appealed that decision, but the appeal was rejected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protest Wanes  </P> <P> Another appeal is pending, but Lake Morena Village residents acknowledge that  the heyday of protest, when local boat owners formed a floating barrier to  deter city engineers, is probably over. Now that San Diego has taken what it  came for, there are not many occasions to sing the "Lake Morena vs. S.D. City  Ditty" that a local housewife wrote to the tune of "Summertime Blues."  </P> <P> "Ya' know the eagles are your symbol and we gotta protect them," the song goes.  "We can't let them suffer or go to extinction. The mosquitoes and the mud will  drown them at first. And what about the odor -- our health will be the worst."  </P> <P> Indeed, Mrs. Read said that, as the lake became shallower and its waters  warmer, mosquitoes have flourished. As the water table has dropped, several  local residents have had to redrill their wells, and the local water company  has issued a moratorium on new water meters, which virtually stopped all new  construction in the area.  </P> <P> Visitors to Lake Morena Village, which is part of Campo, are noticing the  difference.  </P> <P> Last week, Mary and Walter Saunders, a computer operator and retired building  contractor from La Mesa, returned to Lake Morena because they remembered their  first trip, last year, so fondly. The Saunders' van was well-equipped with  fishing gear, but they said that, given the condition of the lake, they  wouldn't be trying to lure the lake's famous bass, crappie, bluegill and  catfish onto their lines this trip.  </P> <P> "You can't get a boat on it, and, if you can't bring your boat, it takes the  joy out of fishing -- you can't get where you want to go," Walter Saunders  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Board Sailors Complain  </P> <P> Gary Elster, the president of the San Diego Boardsailing Assn., said the same  was true for his sport. Before the draining, he said, Lake Morena's constant  winds made it the best board-sailing site in the county. But now, he said, the  low water level has exposed new obstacles, making it treacherous to navigate.  Because dozens of feet of sediment have settled on the lake bottom, he said,  the lake is even shallower than the numbers indicate.  </P> <P> "I have not been able to get myself to go back," he said. "It's dangerous, and  it's ugly to look at."  </P> <P> Leach, a local realtor, said he has lost business because clients are  frightened to buy near the receding shoreline. His goal now, he said, is to  keep the lake from disappearing entirely -- for, while the draining flumes have  been shut, about 300,000 gallons a day continue to seep out of the reservoir  under the dam, county park officials say.  </P> <P> "It feels kind of funny when you're selling lake-front property and, all of a  sudden, it's nowhere near the lake," Leach said. "They've gotten the lake down  to a point now that, unless we get a lot of rain, we're going to lose it  altogether."  </P> <P> Many residents, determined to salvage what's left of their main tourist  attraction are hoping for heavy rains to replenish the reservoir. They are  encouraged by memories of the late 1970s, when the lake was even lower than  today -- a "puddle." After a few rainy years, it was full again. And local lore  says that back in 1916, when the reservoir was 4 years old, the city hired a  rainmaker who brought so much rain that rivers overran their banks, dams  overflowed, cattle drowned and Lake Morena was filled to the brim.  </P> <P> But, even if history were to repeat itself, some village residents say, they  would not be satisfied. They fear that, if the reservoir regains its  magnificence, the city might come back for more.  </P> <P> All along, locals have exchanged theories about "hidden agendas" behind San  Diego's drainage policy -- all of them denied by city officials. Some suspect a  city-county feud sparked by the county's failure to pay the city $300,000 for  evaporation losses. Others say they believe the city is transferring water to  fill Lower Otay Reservoir, where an Olympic training center is planned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Veto a Setback  </P> <P> Last week, Lake Morena Village residents suffered a setback when Gov. George  Deukmejian vetoed a bill that might have helped protect the lake from further  draining. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), would  have made water authorities consider the aesthetic and recreational value of a  reservoir before disturbing it, except in emergencies.  </P> <P> Without new state legislation on their side, environmentalists continue to push  for enforcement of old statutes, like California Environmental Quality Act,  that they believe already apply.  </P> <P> "Is this the law? Is this what can happen anywhere? Until we know for sure,  we're going to be asking questions," said the Sierra Club's Moran.  </P> <P> People who live near Lake Morena, meanwhile, are still adjusting. The town of  Campo has a new art gallery and its campgrounds, closed for the summer for  repairs, have recently reopened. This year's annual children's fishing derby  was held at a private pond -- the regular site, Lake Morena's jetty, is no  longer near water. So far, however, no one has renamed the rounded hill at the  northwest edge of the lake. Surrounded by dry land on all sides, it is still  Goat Island.  </P></p>

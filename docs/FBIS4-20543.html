			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Caroline Monnot: "CEA-Industrie Disengages From </F> Framatome, Oris, Sopha, and Cisi"]    [Text] CEA-Industrie is losing its vocation as an  industrial group. Industry Minister Gerard Longuet set the tone  almost as soon as he arrived at the ministry. Eight months  later, the pace of divestment is accelerating. In the meantime,  Philippe Rouvillois, administrator general of the Atomic Energy  Commission, became head of CEA-I and proceeded to quash the  grandiose dreams of Jean-Claude Hirel. Mr. Rouvillois confirmed  the news officially in LES ECHOS on Monday 14 February.    Data processing services (Cisi) and medical technologies  (Oris and Sopha Medical) will no longer be development axes for  a CEA-I whose role henceforth is clearly to be nothing more than  a portfolio company. "In the more or less short term, we  envisage no longer having majority positions in those companies  but retaining interests as a minority shareholder," says CEA's  administrator general, evincing an uncanny comprehension of the  wishes of his tutelary minister.    Cisi, whose "facilities management" division--which  completely or partially administers computer and data processing  systems for third parties--has already been transferred to a  joint subsidiary in partnership with Bull, is far from lacking  suitors of its own. And Sagem is keenly interested in the  medical technologies.    But that still leaves the nuclear technologies and  components  divisions, which Mr. Rouvillois notes are "two major hubs."  Concerning the former, CEA-I here again--under duress--has  abjured even a minor role, except perhaps to offer  representatives of the state some seats on the board of  directors.    COGEMA [General Nuclear Materials Company], one of CEA-I's  most important investments, escaped its orbit early last summer  by linking up with Total, in a move the government fully  approved. Mr. Rouvillois also currently is negotiating  disengagement from Framatome in favor of the Alcatel-Alsthom  group.    The proceeds from these multiple divestments could be used,  in a best-case scenario, to help semiconductor maker  SGS-Thomson--of which CEA-I is a major shareholder--back to  vigorous health and support its ambitious plans.    Thereby preserving a semblance of utility for a corporate  structure which at the moment would appear to have no vocation.</p>

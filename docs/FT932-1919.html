			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / News at Ten under pressure PRESSURE IS growing in ITV to move News at Ten to earlier in the evening as a way of countering growing competition from Channel 4. Three of the largest ITV companies - Carlton, LWT and Central - are expected to raise the issue at a strategy meeting of all the ITV companies at Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, this week. At present ITV often has to interrupt a film or drama to make way for News at Ten. There is then considerable audience loss before resumption of the programme that began before the news. The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body, has made clear it does not want to see the main evening news bulletin moved to 10.30 and has defined prime time as 6pm to 10.30pm. ITV would, however, have the freedom to broadcast its main news programme at any time during that period. Some senior ITV executives say that Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief executive, is scheduling some of his best programmes at 10pm to clash with the news. Partly as a result of competitive scheduling, Channel 4 is believed to be taking more than 17 per cent of the commercial television market. Last week the commission expressed its displeasure to senior ITV executives that weekend news bulletins had been scheduled at 11.15pm. It said the gap between news programmes was too long.</p>

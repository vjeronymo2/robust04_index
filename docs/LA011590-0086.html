			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW ASKS WEST'S HELP ON BALTICS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE KREMLIN WANTS U.S., OTHER NATIONS TO DISCOURAGE THE REGION  FROM SECEDING. A BREAK COULD LEAD TO A 'CATASTROPHE,' A PARTY OFFICIAL SAID.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, faced with growing demands for independence in its three  Baltic republics, is asking the United States and other Western countries to  discourage their secession as a threat to European stability and broader  East-West relations, according to senior Soviet officials and Western  diplomats.  </P> <P> The Soviet argument, which emphasizes the need for a political evolution after  the dramatic upheavals in Eastern Europe, has won considerable sympathy within  the Bush Administration and in West European capitals, these sources said, but  has drawn criticism from conservatives pleased to see the possible breakup of  the "Soviet empire."  </P> <P> "The secession of the Baltic republics, particularly if encouraged by the West,  would probably throw our relations back at least to what they were after  Afghanistan and the Korean airliner incident," a senior Communist Party  official said here, "and at worst they lead to a general world catastrophe."  </P> <P> In referring to the sharp deterioration in East-West relations after Moscow's  1979 military intervention in Afghanistan and the shooting down of a South  Korean airliner in 1983, the official recalled the two incidents in the past  decade that not only heightened international tensions but increased the risk  of military confrontation.  </P> <P> The current fear, according to well-placed Soviet sources, is that secession by  the Baltic republics would encourage nationalists in other Soviet republics to  seek independence and thus bring the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Mikhail Gorbachev would not survive this, nor would perestroika," a senior  Soviet diplomat said, also asking not to be quoted by name. "Beyond this basic  political fact, the separation of the Baltic republics, for example, would  involve the security of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The West, particularly the United States, should not cheer the Baltic  republics on, and we have told everyone this. We have told them: 'Let us do  things in our own way, in our own time. Developments so far have not been  unfavorable to the West. Let events evolve by themselves.' "  </P> <P> These warnings, which have been delivered across Europe and to the United  States and Japan, underline the seriousness of the challenge that President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev faces in the growing nationalist ferment around the  country, according to Western diplomats.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, as he acknowledged himself in Lithuania last week, is now in the  most dangerous moment of his five years as the Soviet leader, and he has tied  his own political fate to the successful resolution of the current crisis.  </P> <P> "This is not just the question of Mikhail Gorbachev being the best, or the  only, man for this job or perestroika being what the West has long prayed would  happen in the Soviet Union," the Soviet diplomat said during the course of a  background discussion of developments in Lithuania and the other Baltic  republics of Estonia and Lativa.  </P> <P> "The West must consider, as we do every day, that if Gorbachev fails, then his  successor will not be following the same policies, not at all. If he fails, he  will be replaced, and so will his policies."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking in Lithuania last week, argued strongly against secession  by the Baltics, a right guaranteed them under the present Soviet constitution.  </P> <P> The United States and most other NATO members have never recognized the Soviet  Union's incorporation of the Baltic republics, which gained their independence  from Russia after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution but lost it after Josef  Stalin's 1939 pact with Adolph Hitler dividing Eastern and Central Europe into  Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence.  </P> <P> Washington now takes the view that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will probably  all succeed in winning some form of independence, according to Bush  Administration officials, but has decided that the best policy for the United  States is not to interfere.  </P> <P> Secretary of States James A. Baker III, however, is expected to discuss this  issue during talks here next month with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet  foreign minister.  </P> <P> Interviewed by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Shevardnadze asserted last week  that, to carry out a successful foreign policy, the Soviet Union has to be a  strong state, not one weakened by separatism and secession.  </P> <P> Recent improvements in international relations, he said, were due largely "to  Soviet perestroika and the fact that the Soviet Union is a strong state as a  result, above all, of a strong alliance among brotherly nations."  </P> <P> "If we would weaken this alliance, we would decrease the effectiveness of our  foreign policy," he said. "Anything positive that is occurring now in the world  would be undermined."  </P> <P> The second point that Moscow has made to the West is its sensitivity to any  reduction in its security. With the sweeping changes under way in Eastern  Europe, which for more than 40 years has served as the Soviet Union's forward  defense line, the Kremlin wants to ensure the stability of its own frontiers  and their defense, according to these Soviet officials.  </P> <P> "The military balance is obviously changing across Europe, and we believe that  everyone will benefit from the reduction of the military forces deployed on the  Continent," the diplomat said. "At the same time, the security of all nations  must be preserved and the mutual confidence we have developed in Europe must be  maintained. . . .  </P> <P> "In this context, Americans might consider how they would react if New England  were talking about seceding, or Texas or the old Confederate states. These are  issues of territorial integrity and sovereignty and, consequently, of  security."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apprehensive Generals  </P> <P> Another Soviet official, who has also briefed visiting Western delegations over  the past month, commented: "Say that the Baltics declared their independence,  would they be friendly to us, or neutral, or would they become a NATO outpost?  You can see why our generals, who must defend the motherland, are very  apprehensive."  </P> <P> The third point that Soviet officials are stressing in their warnings to the  West is the danger of unleasing new and difficult-to-control forces through the  separation of not only the Baltics but other Soviet republics.  </P> <P> "We share the common hope that we are entering an era of greater peace and less  international tension, but this could be upset through the revival, for  example, of old national enmities, of militant Islamic fundamentalism, of  unfulfilled expectations on the part of perhaps the Lithuanians or the Latvians  when their new government cannot provide everything people hoped for," the  official said.  </P> <P> "The peace of the last four decades may have been a cold peace, but we should  improve on it, not destroy it. What have we gained if, say, the Poles demand  from independent Lithuania territory that used to be Polish and prepare to  fight for it? What if the Latvians start to go bankrupt and they turn to an  ultra-rightist, if not to say Nazi, force? And what about the Armenians, caught  between the Turks, the Azerbaijanis and the Iranians, all Muslim and all  militant?"  </P> <P> While Soviet officials generally praise the "balance and prudence" shown by the  Bush Administration on the Baltics question, they are sharply critical of the  broadcasts by the two U.S.-run radio stations, Radio Free Europe and Radio  Liberty, that broadcast to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in local  languages.  </P> <P> "These stations are calling for immediate secession, and their broadcasts are  highly destabilizing," the party official said. "They broadcast the most  extreme of the nationalist slogans, and in some cases, such as Azerbaijan and  Armenia, set one nationality against another. These broadcasts are provoking  internal strife and escalating conflicts, and we believe deliberately so."  </P> <P> No longer jammed, the Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe broadcasts have large  audiences in the Soviet Union because of their topicality, and they have been  increased as Soviet residents have become able to call their headquarters in  West Germany and discuss current developments in interviews that are then  aired.  </P> <P> "These two American radio stations seem quite ready to broadcast the most  inflammatory material," the official said. "They appear to operate from the old  Cold War philosophy that whatever harms the Soviet Union helps the United  States, and that clearly is wrong today. Separatism endangers much more than  the Soviet Union."  </P></p>

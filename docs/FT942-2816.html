			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / What parents are for: Will GE continue to indulge US investment bank Kidder Peabody Sometimes, having a rich owner is a securities company's greatest asset. Shearson Lehman and First Boston, two leading Wall Street firms, learnt that lesson in 1990 when each was helped out by a powerful parent (respectively American Express and CS Holding, the Swiss banking group). Kidder Peabody, errant son of General Electric, the US conglomerate, is the latest to learn the benefits of an owner with a deep pocket. Since it disclosed in April that Dollars 350m of previously reported trading profits over the past three years were fictitious, Kidder has been the target of rumour and sniping on Wall Street. Questions have been asked about the value of its securities portfolio. Headhunters have circled the firm, trying to pick off its best traders. In fact, Kidder's difficulties are not as dire as most of the firm's rivals make out - thanks largely to GE. The GE connection has brought some powerful benefits. Whereas other securities firms - including CS First Boston - raise money on their own behalf using their single-A credit ratings, Kidder is funded through its immediate parent, GE Capital, and, ultimately, GE. The top triple-A rating of these companies enables them to raise money cheaply, in turn giving Kidder an advantage over rivals. (With a portfolio of securities valued at Dollars 73bn at the end of last year, shaving even a fraction of a percentage point from the firm's financing costs has a big impact on profits.) This week, GE has been forced to restate its support for Kidder - a company which, two years ago, it came close to selling. But in the process, it made little pretence about the difficulties the company faces. Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE chief financial officer, drew a direct comparison with other ailing businesses the manufacturing giant has nursed through difficult times before: its power generation business in the 1980s, and its network television business in the early 1990s. He implied that the current environment for the securities industry is equally difficult - an observation likely to come as a surprise to many Wall Street firms, which, though not doing as well as in the record year of 1993, are still experiencing one of their best-ever years. GE's professed commitment will enable Kidder to ride out the storm that began in April. The question, though, is how long GE will remain the indulgent parent. Two problems are besetting Kidder. First, the phantom profits scheme is proving a bigger drag than it had hoped. Kidder blamed the scheme on Mr Joseph Jett, the former head of its government bond trading desk, depicting itself as the innocent victim of a fraud. Mr Jett, though, has since hit back, suggesting senior Kidder executives were aware of his trading strategy and that he is being made a scapegoat. An investigation of Mr Jett's trading by Mr Gary Lynch, a former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, is taking longer than GE had hoped. The length of the investigation is fuelling rumours that Mr Lynch's review has been broadened to take in the activities of executives other than Mr Jett and other aspects of Kidder's business. Adding to the seriousness of the affair, if the Dollars 350m of trading profits were false, then Kidder's resurgence of the past two years has been false too. GE said this week that it had injected Dollars 200m of capital into Kidder to plug the hole left by the phantom profits. Kidder's second longer-term problem is its reliance on one market - mortgage-backed bonds - for a large proportion of its (real) profits. Such bonds are created when household mortgages are packaged and sold to investors. Kidder's dominance of this Dollars 1,600bn market (it handled nearly a quarter of all new issues of bonds last year) proved profitable last year as the volume of new bonds soared. In recent months, however, mortgage-backed bond issues have been running at only about Dollars 10bn a month, compared with Dollars 40bn a month at the start of the year. Kidder has also been affected by being the biggest trader in the market at a time when prices have been volatile. The attractiveness to investors of mortgage-backed bonds dropped both when US interest rates fell last year (many mortgage holders paid their old loans off early to take out new loans at lower rates, hitting the value of the bonds) and rose this year (pre-payments stopped, lengthening the bonds' lives and, again, making them less attractive to investors). Just how badly Kidder has been hurt is impossible to say. At the end of last year, Kidder was more highly geared than any other Wall Street house, with less than Dollars 1bn of capital to support its Dollars 73bn of securities holdings. That suggests that it would only take a small fall in prices to consume a large part of Kidder's capital. Mr Michael Carpenter, the firm's chairman, again insisted this week that Kidder's bond holdings were hedged against falling prices. He added that the firm had sold a third of its mortgage-backed bond holdings, thought to have been worth about Dollars 12bn, improving its liquidity. Questions remain, though, about the other two-thirds - and about Kidder's (and GE's) enthusiasm for retaining such a large position in a market which has proved more volatile than Wall Street had expected.</p>

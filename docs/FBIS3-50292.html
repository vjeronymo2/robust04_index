Hajrudin Sermic reports from the Maglaj Commune Press Center  on the "fierce chetnik and ustasha tank and infantry attacks  that begun early this morning and gained in intensity and  ferocity at about 1100 [1000 GMT]. More than 1,500 projectiles  from tanks, howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, guns, and  mortars of all kinds and calibers have been launched thus far on  our defenders' positions with the support of Praga weapons and  antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft guns. Fire from more  than 60 heavy and armored weapons was opened from all  directions: Teslic, Doboj, Ozren, and Zepce." Finally, Sermic  adds that "as I report, strong artillery preparation for the  third breakthrough attempt is going on."    Smail Terzic reports from the 7-South Operation Group zone  that "civilian targets have been shelled in the districts of  Mrkotic, Kalosevic, [word indistinct], and Jelovci. The  shelling has been going on for several hours."

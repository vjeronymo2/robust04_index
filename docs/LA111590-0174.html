			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IN SEASON: MACADAMIAS;  </P> <P> GOING NUTS OVER MACADAMIAS;  </P> <P> HAWAII ISN'T ONLY SOURCE OF TASTY MORSEL  </P> <P> If you are among the many who believe macadamia nuts grow only in Hawaii, think  again.  </P> <P> According to Jim Russell, a local grower and president of the California  Macadamia Nut Society, the first macadamia nut trees were brought from  Australia's tropical rain forest to Berkeley in the 1890s. They were later  introduced to Hawaii, where the nuts attained commercial recognition. Several  decades later, the trees reappeared on the mainland, including in North County.  Some varieties, such as the Cate, are ready for harvest in time for the  holidays. Others produce almost year-round.  </P> <P> Wilbur Simlik, a retired Marine general and owner of Macadamia Hill Ranch in  Vista, has one of the oldest groves of Cate macadamias in the county. The  original owner of the ranch, Wells Miller, brought back hundreds of macadamia  seedlings from Australia and Hawaii in 1958. Records of his grafting  experiments were kept by UC Riverside, and his grafts eventually made their way  to Israel and Central America.  </P> <P> "Macadamia trees are very independent," said Russell, a grower since 1978.  "Every time you plant a seed, you get another variety. But, if you planted  50,000, maybe only two would be good. That's why we graft them."  </P> <P> Only two botanical varieties produce edible nuts, he said: the tetraphylla, a  species well-suited to the California climate; and the integrifolia, which  accounts for Hawaii's major production.  </P> <P> The tetraphylla, which includes the Cate, a popular variety in North County,  produces a larger, sweeter nut than the integrifolia. Russell said that  macadamias aren't actually roasted in an oven, but deep fried in oil, "just  like French fries."  </P> <P> In 1987, Russell lost a grove of mature trees to freezing temperatures. The  experience hasn't discouraged him from attempting to develop a hardier variety,  however. "They're beautiful landscape trees," he said. "You can prune them if  you want to, and they actually grow and yield fruit even in containers."  </P> <P> Macadamia trees come in all shapes and sizes at Tom Cooper's Rancho Nuez in  Fallbrook. "We planted a few trees after a friend introduced us to the  macadamia in the late '60s, and we've been adding ever since," said Cooper, who  publishes the Macadamia Nut Grower Quarterly.  </P> <P> Like many consumers, Kitty Scholes, owner of the Bob-Kat Ranch in Fallbrook,  thought that macadamias grew only in Hawaii until 1968, when a friend told her  they thrived under local conditions. Over two decades later, Scholes acts as  secretary-treasurer of the Gold Crown Macadamia Assn., a grower-owned and  operated co-op in Fallbrook that ships macadamias all over the United States.  The co-op now counts more than 160 growers, who all pool their macadamias in a  Fallbrook warehouse. "There is no membership fee, and anyone with at least five  trees may join," said Scholes.  </P> <P> A gentle breeze rustles through the lush foliage of the extensive grove of Cate  macadamias, as Scholes checks the clusters of nuts hanging from the limbs like  large, green beads. Cates shed their husk as they hit the ground, and  marble-sized nuts the color of milk-chocolate dot the thick mulch.  </P> <P> The nuts are hand-gathered, then culled, once again by hand. After the nuts are  run through a husking machine, they are air-dried for 2 or 3 weeks to get the  moisture out. The growers then send nuts to the co-op in 50-pound sacks.  </P> <P> Humans are not alone in enjoying macadamias.  </P> <P> "Squirrels, coyotes, crows, rats and even bobcats all love macadamias," said  Scholes. So do parrots and macaws, whose breeders have become regular customers  of the macadamia co-op in Fallbrook.  </P> <P> Macadamias contain no cholesterol. Unshelled, they keep up to a year. Nutmeats  should be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated, or frozen until  just before use. When thawing, don't open the container until the nuts have  reached room temperature to avoid rehydration. Roasting or toasting also  extends the shelf life of nutmeats.  </P> <P> Macadamias are a good source of calcium and riboflavin.  </P> <P> MACADAMIA GROWERS  </P> <P> Macadamia Products, 205 Calle Linda, Fallbrook, 92028.

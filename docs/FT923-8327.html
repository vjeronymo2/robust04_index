			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Alcan Australia reduces losses in first half ALCAN Australia, the Sydney-based integrated aluminium group, has come through the worldwide slump in aluminium prices with reduced losses in the first half to June. The company's loss eased to ADollars 6.6m (USDollars 4.88m) from ADollars 13.4m on a 7 per cent fall in sales to ADollars 276.4m from ADollars 297.2m. No interim dividend will be paid. The directors said the average aluminium price for the half was USDollars 1,295 a tonne, down USDollars 150 a tonne from a year earlier. The restructuring programme begun last year resulted in a further reduction of 100 people from the workforce. A charge of ADollars 1.3m for redundancy costs was incurred compared with ADollars 5.6m last time, the company said. Alcan has written off ADollars 18.3m from its asset revaluation reserve following a valuation of land and buildings. The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 2.7m compared with ADollars 3.5m previously and interest costs of ADollars 7.5m against ADollars 9.3m.</p>

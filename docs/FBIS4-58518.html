			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman (J.T.)--The French government has decided  to stop its participation in the multi-national inspection force  which is inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound ships to monitor the  implementation of the international embargo imposed on Iraq,  Agence France Presse (AFP) Wednesday [4 May] quoted a French  foreign ministry spokesman as saying.    The spokesman announced that the decision became active  immediately following requests by Jordan to replace naval  inspections in with an onshore process.    France, said the spokesman, was the only country which  participated continuously in the naval inspection operation  alongside the U.S. since they were launched.    The spokesman was quoted by AFP as saying that the decision  to quit the force was taken in close coordination with the U.S.  and His Majesty King Husayn and U.N. Secretaary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali were informed of it.    Informed sources told the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper  that Canada turned down a U.S. request to replace French naval  forces in monitoring the embargo in the Red Sea.    AL-HAYAT quoted the sources, who were not identified, as  saying that the Canadian government totally rejected replacing  the French forces.    The sources commended the French decision saying it  "reflects  France's understanding of the Jordanian stand and manifests its  desire to narrow the gaps and reconcile international legitimacy  as a slogan and international justice in reality."    Jordan, which has announced the suspension of its  participation in the Middle East peace process until the siege  on the port of al- 'Aqabah was lifted, has reached an agreement  with the U.S. providing for land-based sanctions verifications  by a neutral side.    The French embassy in Amman late Wednesday issued a  statement  announcing its decision to quit the multinational inspection  forces, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, said.    Through taking this decision, it said, "France aims to  demonstrate its support for Jordan in finding a formula that  would help reduce the heavy burdens inflicted upon the Jordanian  economy by the naval inspection operations."

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Nigerians to hold talks on payments NIGERIAN officials are due to meet Paris Club creditors next week to discuss trade and payments delays and arrears estimated at more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.8bn). There are fears in some quarters of a re-run of the 1982-83 arrears crisis when Nigeria built up a Dollars 5bn payments backlog largely on open account trade. The meeting will take place against a background of a deepening balance of payments crisis and mounting pressure on the Naira. Since its agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club of official creditors lapsed a year ago, Nigeria is understood to have accumulated foreign payments arrears of more than Dollars 3bn. Britain, owed Dollars 600m at the end of January, is the largest creditor, followed by France with Dollars 500m, and Germany with Dollars 400m. Nigeria's total foreign debt stood at Dollars 27.6bn at the end of 1992, of which Dollars 16.5bn was owed to the Paris Club. In the last year, foreign reserves have fallen from Dollars 5.9bn to Dollars 1.4bn at the end of 1992. This was largely the consequence of the Dollars 3.4bn buy-back of debt owed to the London Club of commercial banks early last year, and of the failed strategy of propping up the Naira at an average of N19 to the dollar during 1992, estimated to have cost the country more than Dollars 1bn. With imports running at more than Dollars 700m a month Nigeria now has less than eight weeks' import cover. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) subsequently allowed the Naira to slide until it reached N25 to the dollar last month. It has been pegged at this level but at the cost of a widening premium in the parallel market. At the last two auctions, the CBN sold Dollars 150m in the face of demand for Dollars 721m so that banks received 21 per cent of their requirements. Meanwhile, the free market premium has doubled from 20 per cent at the end of last year to 40 per cent today. Exchange controls were tightened early this month when foreign payments on open account trade and bills for collection were temporarily barred. The Central Bank also deferred payments on letters of credit until 90 days after the goods are shipped by suppliers. The clamp on open account and trade bill payments is justified, the CBN says, by widespread 'round tripping' and fraudulent payments abroad. It says it is reviewing payments documentation but no payments will be approved until April 5. Bankers believe that up to a half of Nigeria's imports may be financed in this way and that payments of at least Dollars 1bn have been deferred for more than a month. The Nigerian delegation is unlikely to get more than a sympathetic hearing at the meeting. It will be told that the debt relief Nigeria desperately needs is dependent on an IMF agreement which is unlikely to be reached until a newly elected civilian president takes office at the end of August.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: East Midlands deal shows pricing trend The keenly-priced Pounds 350m syndicated loan for East Midlands Electricity was signed yesterday, highlighting the trend to cheaper lending caused by intense competition among banks. The five-year loan, arranged by Chemical Bank, was priced at 15 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) which other loan syndicates regarded as unprofitably low. They suggested that finance for the UK regional utility could not be raised, and one said at the time: 'This may be a deal too far.' However, Chemical Bank said yesterday that European, non-European and Japanese banks had joined the deal. Pricing levels for syndicated loans have fallen this year as banks have fought aggressively for assets while borrowers remain wary of debts. This has pushed prices of loans close to the level of bonds and the Swedish government, the biggest borrower on the world's bond market, has turned to a syndicated loan for a Dollars 5bn five-year financing to replace existing debts. Citibank and JP Morgan are currently arranging syndication of that loan, which is priced at 8 basis points over Libor. One banker said: 'Sweden is getting a fantastic deal.' Further evidence of competition among banks driving down prices for loans came when Chemical Bank arranged a keenly-priced Pounds 500m five-year syndicated loan signed last week for National Power, the UK power generator. That deal was priced at 17 basis points over Libor and National Power said the loan was oversubscribed with 25 banks prepared to lend it a total of Pounds 1bn, double the amount required.</p>

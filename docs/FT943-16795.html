			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SB hit by US collapse of Tagamet sales Sales of Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's top-selling drug, have collapsed in the US following the expiry of its American patents on May 17. Preliminary data suggests the anti-ulcer treatment, which generated US sales for the Anglo-American group of about Dollars 648m (Pounds 426m) last year, has lost more than half its share of new prescriptions in its class. Tagamet's share has fallen from about 15 per cent of new prescriptions at the time of the patent expiry to 6.9 per cent during the week to June 17. Generic versions using Tagamet's active ingredient cimetidine have already captured 11.4 per cent of the market. The launch of generic, non-patented, drugs using cimetidine has also hit sales of Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug and the world's best-selling medicine. Its share of new prescriptions fell from 39.5 per cent the week before the expiry to 38.7 per cent during the week ending June 17.</p>

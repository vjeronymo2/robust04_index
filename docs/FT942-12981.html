			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Banco Santander Banco Santander's bid for Banesto looks all the bolder for being 14 per cent above the next competing bid. The bank clearly believes it is buying a recovery stock and one which makes strategic sense. Strip out unrealised property gains, though, and it is paying nearly two times book value for a purchase that will be initially dilutive. Banco Santander has a record for shrewd expansion. Were it not for that, the natural suspicion would be that ambition has got the better of it. Since the terms of the deal require Santander to run Banesto as a separate entity, the acquisition offers limited opportunity for cost-savings. The official rationale is that Banesto's branch network will bring the group critical mass in the retail deposit market, though quite how this will add to earnings is not so clear. Santander also hopes to boost Banesto's earnings through bad debt recoveries. That may be easier said than done. After all Banesto has been through, it is hard to believe its problems have been over-stated. The real test will be whether Santander can restore Banesto's ability to generate income from its focus on the domestic market. The comparison with Banco Popular suggests considerable room for improvement on both revenue and costs. If Santander can succeed in re-motivating Banesto's line management and in reviving the confidence of its customer base, its gamble could pay off. And it is still paying less than half Banesto's price before the authorities intervened.</p>

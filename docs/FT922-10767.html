			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Victorian work set for record: Saleroom ONE of the finest fairy paintings by the Victorian artist Richard Dadd, Contradiction: Oberon and Titania, could fetch Pounds 1.5m when it is sold at Christie's in London on June 12. It was painted at the Bethlem Hospital in Southwark, where Dadd was committed in 1844 after murdering his father in a fit of madness. The oval picture, based on a scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream, sold at auction in 1964 for Pounds 7,000. By 1983, with Victorian art in great demand, it sold to an American collector for Pounds 550,000, a world record at the time for a Victorian picture. London is host this week to a series of Islamic sales. This has been a difficult market in recent years but Christie's was pleased with its total of Pounds 699,000, with 87 per cent sold, from yesterday morning's auction. The top price was Pounds 60,500 for sections of a 13th century North African Qur'an. A late 15th century manuscript of love lyrics composed by Shah Mohammed Nishapuri doubled its original estimate at Pounds 55,000. Christie's in New York at the weekend secured a world auction record for an illustrated book when it sold a copy of Audubon's The Birds of America for Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.3m).</p>

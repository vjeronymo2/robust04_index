			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.207&blank;Stall Warning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would delete the upper limit on stall speed margin and provide for mutable stall warning on acrobatic category airplanes in &sect;23.207. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.207(c) would reference the stall tests required by &sect;23.201(b) and &sect;23.203(a)(1) and specify that during such tests for one knot per second deceleration stalls, both wings level and turning, the stall must begin at a speed exceeding the stalling speed by a margin of not less than 5 knots. The quantified upper limit in the current rule of 10 knots or 15 percent of the stalling speed would be deleted. The upper limit has created problems for manufacturers because of the complex design features required to show compliance. The upper limit requirement was in effect replaced by the nuisance stall warning requirement in &sect;23.207.(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;23.207(d) would be divided and moved to proposed &sect;23.207 (d) and (e). Proposed &sect;23.207(d) on nuisance stall warnings would have no change in requirements. Proposed &sect;23.207(e) would delete the bottom limit of five knots for decelerations greater than one knot per second. Also, it would specify that the stall warning must begin sufficiently before the stall so that the pilot can take corrective action. This is considered appropriate because, at the higher deceleration rates of three to five knots per second, a specified five knots may not be enough stall warning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.207(f) allows for a mutable stall warning system for acrobatic category airplanes, with automatic arming for takeoff and rearming for landing. This feature is useful for acrobatic pilots and provides safeguards for takeoff and landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Secion 23.221&blank;Spinning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise the point to start the one-turn-spin recovery count, delete the ``characteristically incapable of spinning'' option, and make minor changes in acrobatic category spins in &sect;23.221. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.221(a) would replace the exception for airplanes characteristically incapable of spinning with an exception for airplanes that demonstrate compliance with the optional spin resistant requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Criteria for an airplane incapable of spinning are unnecessary since criteria for spin resistant airplanes are provided. Proposed &sect;23.221(a) would change the point at which the count for the one-turn-spin recovery begins. The change would specify a more specific point to begin the count by replacing the current phrase ``after the controls have been applied'' with ``after initiation of the first control action for recovery.'' Under the present rules, if an applicant proposes a multiple step recovery procedure that starts with the rudder, then the airplane may be effectively recovered before the start of the recovery count. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.221(a)(1)(ii) would specify that no control force or characteristic can adversely affect prompt recovery. This would be an improvement over the present prohibition of excessive back pressure in current &sect;23.221(a)(1)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;23.221(a)(1) is proposed to be recodified into &sect;23.221(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) with no changes in the requirements. Present &sect;23.221(a)(2) on spin resistant airplanes would be restated with minor editorial changes but with no change in requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.221(b) would specify the emergency egress requirements of &sect;23.807(b)(5) for those utility category airplanes approved for spinning. This is considered an appropriate way to cross-reference the requirements of &sect;23.807 to the flight requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed &sect;23.221(c) introductory paragraph would require acrobatic category airplanes to meet the one-turn-spin requirements of &sect;23.221(a). This change is proposed because acrobatic category airplanes should have sufficient controllability to recover from the developing one-turn-spin under the same conditions as normal category airplanes. The proposed introductory paragraph would also cross-reference &sect;23.807 for emergency egress requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.221(c) pertaining to acrobatic category airplanes would add a requirement in proposed paragraph (c)(1) for spin recovery after six turns or any greater number of turns for which certification is requested. The proposed rule would require recovery within 1.5 turns after initiation of the first control action for recovery. This proposed requirement would ensure recovery within 1.5 turns if the spin mode changes beyond six turns. As an alternative, the applicant may stop at six turns and provide a limitation of six turns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.221(c)(2) would delete the option to retract flaps during recovery and would provide the applicant with a choice of flaps up or flaps deployed for spin approval. The paragraph would continue to prohibit exceeding applicable airspeed limits and limit maneuvering load factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new &sect;23.221(c)(4) is proposed to ensure that the acrobatic spins do not cause pilot incapacitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;23.221(d) is proposed to be deleted. The recognition of airplanes that are ``characteristically incapable of spinning'' has been in the regulation since at least 1937. In 1942, the present weight, center of gravity, and control mis-rig criteria were introduced into Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 03. Since then, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spin resistant requirements, which are based on research, have been developed and incorporated in the regulations by Amendment No. 23&hyph;42 (56 FR 344, January 3, 1991). If an applicant proposes a non-spinable airplane, it would be appropriate to apply the more technologically advanced requirements of proposed &sect;23.221(a)(2); therefore, &sect;23.221(d) would be deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

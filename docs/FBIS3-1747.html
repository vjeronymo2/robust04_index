If they are equipped with production and management  conditions as well as management ability, all urban residents,  peasants, herdsmen, personnel of enterprises and institutions  who are on leave without pay, resigned, and retired, demobilized  and retired military personnel; this year's graduates from  universities, colleges, and secondary specialized schools;  personnel who are retired or retired with honor; as well as  surplus personnel who are separated from party and government  organizations, enterprises, and institutions during the course  of their organizational reform and the change of operating  mechanisms can apply for permission to engage in individual and  privately-owned business.    Cadres of party and government organizations (not including  those who are clearly stipulated by the state) are encouraged to  lead the operation (ling ban 7325 6586) of or setting up of  (chuang ban 0482 6586) economic entities of a privately-owned  nature within a set period. Such economic entities will be  disconnected from the organizations when conditions are ripe.  Workers and staff members of state-owned enterprises and the  state's institutions are permitted to engage in business  activities during their spare time or take a concurrent job or  work as an assistant at individual industrial and commercial  households as well as at privately-owned enterprises.  State-owned enterprise workers and staff members who are  waiting for job assignments because the production of their  units is suspended or half-suspended, can apply, with a  certificate issued by their former unit, for permission to  engage in individual business on a temporary basis or set up  privately-owned enterprise. They also can work for  privately-owned enterprises. After their former enterprises  resume production, they can return to their former units.    Law enforcement personnel of public security, industrial and  commercial administration, taxation, auditing, supervision, and  other units are not allowed to engage in individual and  privately- owned business if they still are not disconnected  from their organizations.    2. The time period in which demobilized military cadres and  surplus personnel of the state's organizations whose jobs have  not yet been rearranged run privately-owned enterprises or work  in privately-owned enterprises can be added to the length of  their service at their former units; for graduates from  universities, colleges, and secondary specialized schools as  well as youths waiting job assignment -- those persons whose job  assignments should be arranged by the state but are not yet  assigned to work in a particular unit, if they work in  privately-owned enterprises of their own or in privately-owned  enterprises, the time period in which they work for such  enterprises can be added to the length of their service at the  state's units where they are assigned to work later; if  enterprise workers and staff members engage in individual or  privately owned business during the period in which the  production of their units is suspended or half-suspended, their  length of service in this period can be added to the former one.    3. Scientific and technological personnel who are on leave  without pay, resigned, and retired can set up scientific,  technological, development, consultation, and service  businesses. On-the-job scientific and technological personnel  can hold a concurrent job at individual industrial and  commercial households as well as privately-owned enterprises to  engage in technological development, new product development,  technological training, consultation services, and other  activities allowed by the state's policies. In terms of  appraising and rewarding the scientific and technological  results as well as developing new products, people-run  organizations for scientific and technological development,  consultation, and services, which have been approved by  scientific and technological administrations, enjoy equal  treatment as scientific research units owned by the whole people.    4. To engage in individual business, the applicant should  bring his own identification card and application form and apply  for registration directly with the local industrial and  commercial administration. To apply for a privately owned  enterprise license, the applicant should follow the relevant  regulations of the state and the autonomous region.    5. The registered funds of individual industrial and  commercial households shall be approved in accordance with the  amounts recorded on application forms. There is no need to  provide credit certificates.    6. County-level industrial and commercial administrations  can  authorize industrial and commercial administrative offices to  issue temporary business licenses for individual industrial and  commercial households; county-level industrial and commercial  administrations in remote and poverty-stricken areas can  authorize industrial and commercial administrative offices to  issue business licenses for individual industrial and commercial  households.    7. The business scope and management of individual and  privately-owned economic sectors shall be further relaxed.  Except for those trades and commodities which the state laws  and regulations prohibit management of by individual industrial  and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises, they  are allowed to manage all other trades and commodities. The  style for managing trades and commodities which are allowed to  be managed by individual and privately owned businesses shall be  completely free.    Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately-owned enterprises may form economic associations of  various forms embracing different regions, trades, and ownership  systems; and they may buy shares from each other. Privately  owned enterprises may contract, lease, merge with, or purchase  state-owned and collective enterprises.    8. With approval from the competent authority, individual  industrial and commercial households and privately owned  enterprises may set up private schools, kindergartens,  hospitals, and clinics.    Except for the category of mines prohibited by the state or  the autonomous regional people's government for exploitation,  individual industrial and commercial households and privately  owned enterprises may apply for the exploitation of small  amounts of mineral ores and establishment of small mining  enterprises.    9. Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises may transport means of production or  subsistence or farm and sideline products for sale over long  distances to meet market demands; they should be encouraged to  carry out comprehensive mobile business activities in remote  farming and pastoral areas and poor areas; and they should also  be encouraged and supported to engage in commodity wholesale  businesses.    To actively encourage individual industrial and commercial  households and privately owned enterprises to develop tertiary  industries, registration formalities should be simplified and  sped up with regard to application for setting up businesses in  commerce, food catering, service, repairing, consultation,  communications, and long-distance transportation and sale.    10. Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately-owned enterprises should be supported in setting up  joint and cooperative ventures with foreign investors and in  engaging in processing with materials and samples or assembling  of parts and components provided by foreign clients and in  compensation trade. They may engage in mutual trade with border  residents.    In line with the policy of inducing investment from abroad  and developing lateral ties at home, the competent authority  should treat individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises the same way as state-owned  enterprises, and should examine and approve their application  for the establishment of the "three kinds of foreign-funded  enterprises" within the time limit. Those that have received  the approval and are issued the "PRC license for the three kinds  of foreign-funded enterprises" are entitled to preferential  treatment in absorbing foreign capital as prescribed in the  relevant state and regional policies.    A "business license of enterprise legal entity" should be  issued to privately owned enterprises that have set up wholly  funded or partnership businesses abroad so their legal status  can be established.    11. When peasants and herdsmen in poor remote areas apply  for  the establishment of individual and privately-owned economic  undertakings, the industry and commerce administration may, in  accordance with the principle of "opening up first and  regulating later," file the application on record and allow them  to begin business activities without obtaining a license and  paying fees and to complete the registration after the  conditions are ripe.    Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall  be given to individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises for a given period after they set up  factories or stores for productive operations in farming and  pastoral areas in accordance with the relevant regulations.    Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall  be given to individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises that set up productive undertakings  in remote farming and pastoral areas, especially in townships  and villages below the county level.    12. Privately owned enterprises that meet the quota of  employing handicapped people shall be given tax reduction or  exemption as deemed appropriate by tax offices; and the industry  and commerce administration may reduce or exempt administrative  fees on them.    Revenues from tax reduction and exemption for privately  owned  enterprises should be used for expanding the scale of production.    13. With approval from the science and technology and  planning and economic commissions at the same level and with the  certification of tax offices, individual industrial and  commercial households and privately owned enterprises shall be  given preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption  during a given period of time in their trial development and  production of new products.    14. The administrative departments of industry and commerce,  taxation, commodity prices, public security, urban construction  and environmental protection, science and technology, and public  health should actively provide guidance and consultation  regarding laws, regulations, policies, information, and science  and technology; and they should exercise administration within  the scope of their functions prescribed by the law to create a  favorable social environment for the healthy development of  individual and private economic sectors.    15. The lawful rights and interests of individual and  private  economic sectors shall be protected by law. Except under  circumstances allowed by the state laws and statutes and the  regulations of the regional people's government, no unit or  individual shall be allowed to arbitrarily collect fees and  donations from and impose fines on individual industrial and  commercial households and privately owned enterprises. When  fees are collected, it is necessary to show the "fee collection  license" issued by the commodity price department, publicize the  reason and standard for fee collection, and use the uniform  voucher. Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises have the right to refuse to pay  illegal fees, and to report and complain to the government and  relevant departments.    16. Except for the industry and commerce administration, no  unit or individual shall be allowed to seize or revoke the  business license of individual industrial and commercial  households and privately owned enterprises. Units and personnel  concerned should bear legal and economic responsibilities for  economic and other damage done to individual industrial and  commercial households and privately owned enterprises as a  result of illegal seizure or revoking of their business license.    17. Land used by individual industrial and commercial  households and privately-owned enterprises for business  operations or factory construction should be incorporated into  the overall plan of urban construction. The urban construction  department should arrange appropriate buisness venues for  individual industrial and commercial households and privately  owned enterprises that are to be dismantled and relocated under  urban construction plans. When the dismantling and relocation  is approved by a people's government at and above the county  level, the construction units and individuals should bear the  dismantling and relocation expenses according to the relevant  regulations.    No unit or individual shall be allowed to occupy business  venues which have been approved by the competent authority for  use by individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises. Units and individuals that occupy  such venues shall be responsible for economic damage caused by  the occupation.    18. Staff members of state administrative organs shall not  violate the lawful rights and interests of individual industrial  and commercial households and privately owned enterprises.  Violators shall be given administrative disciplinary action and  economic penalties by the competent authority, depending on the  degree of seriousness; those who cause economic damage shall be  ordered to make compensation, and those who violate criminal law  shall be turned over to the judicial organ and be affixed with  criminal responsibilities.    19. Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises shall use the uniform voucher which  is printed by the taxation department and which does not  indicate the nature of ownership. No unit shall be allowed to  reject the voucher as receipt for expense.    20. To harness the enthusiasm of individual industrial and  commercial households and privately owned enterprises in  donating funds to schools, education departments at all levels  should allow schools to accept children of individual industrial  and commercial households and owners and employees of private  enterprises from both inside and outside the locality.    21. Qualified individual industrial and commercial  households  and owners and employees of private enterprises may apply to  join the CPC, the Communist Youth League, and the Army; to go to  a school of higher grade; to be recruited as cadres or workers;  and to be elected as model workers, people's congress deputies,  and members of the people's political consultative conference.  Outstanding individuals with meritorious service may be  recommended to leading posts.    Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately  run enterprises that have made outstanding contributions to the  regional economic development and have delivered more than  50,000 yuan in taxes annually may apply to governments at  various levels for transfer from agricultural to nonagricultural  households.    22. Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership  over associations of self-employed workers; actively create  conditions for solving practical problems related to personnel,  budget, and office venue; and bring into full play the role of  associations in self-education, self-management, and  self-service.    23. Banking institutions at all levels should actively  provide quality service for business activities pursued by  individual industrial and commercial households and  privately-owned enterprises. When they apply to banks and  credit cooperatives for loans to meet operational needs, banking  institutions and credit cooperatives at all levels should treat  them in the same manner as state and collective enterprises and  should support them with loans according to the state credit  policies.    24. Industry and commerce administrative departments at all  levels should step up coordination with relevant departments in  assisting individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises to solve problems related to loans,  business venues, product appraisal and exportation, evaluation  and employment of specialized technical personnel, and overseas  commercial activities.    25. Industry and commerce administrative departments and  associations of self-employed workers at various levels should  strengthen ideological and political education and education on  the legal system and on professional ethnics among individual  industrial and commercial households and owners and employees of  privately owned enterprises so they can foster a correct  operational concept and style, conscientiously safeguard the  interests of consumers, and become managers with a sense of  morality and ideals and observe the law and discipline.    26. Individual industrial and commercial households and  privately owned enterprises should strictly abide by and enforce  state laws, statutes, and policy regulations; and engage in  lawful operations and civilized service. Manufacturing and  marketing of fake and shoddy goods, fraudulent transactions,  speculation and monopoly, and other lawbreaking activities that  undermine the lawful rights and interests of consumers shall be  dealt with resolutely.    27. Those who print, broadcast, sell, or engage in the  rental  of reactionary and pornographic books, magazines, pictures, and  audio-visual products shall, in accordance with the relevant  state laws and regulations, be given a fine depending on the  degree of seriousness and have unlawful income confiscated; and  those who violate the criminal law shall be affixed with  criminal responsibilities according to the law.    28. The Regional Administration for Industry and Commerce is  authorized to interprete these regulations.    29. These regulations enter into force upon promulgation.  Previous regulations that contravene these regulations shall be  rescinded and replaced with these regulations.</p>

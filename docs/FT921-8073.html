			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Decline in electoral registers 'reversed' THE DECLINE in the number of people registering on electoral rolls has been reversed, Labour MPs said yesterday. They said that last year's national total had been boosted by 116,000 people who had registered this year. Mr David Blunkett, the party's local government spokesman, added that the increase in the register had been achieved in spite of government indifference. 'The government has spent almost Pounds 1m registering 34,454 expatriate voters at a cost of Pounds 29 per vote while spending only Pounds 647,000 on the registration of 40m domestic voters,' he said. Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Bar, accused the government of seeking a low turnout in the election for electoral advantage. The MPs quoted a party survey based on information from more than 300 councils in England and Wales, under a variety of political control. Labour said the most marked increases in registration had been in towns and London boroughs containing marginal seats, such as Blackpool, Croydon, Lambeth, Lincoln, Plymouth and York. There had been concern that people were deliberately failing to register in the hope that they would be less likely to have to pay poll tax. Some estimates put the fall in the register between 1987 and last year at 750,000 voters. Many of those deliberately failing to register came from from highly mobile groups such as people in inner cities where voting tends to favour Labour. Mr Rooker criticised particularly the decision of ministers not to set up an advertising campaign before the election was called to advise housebound voters of their rights. They would therefore have insufficient time to exercise their rights. 'Failure to take action amounts to partisan action in view of the evidence,' he claimed.</p>

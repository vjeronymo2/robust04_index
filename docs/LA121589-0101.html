			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: TURRENTINE JAZZES UP HIS APPROACH  </P> <P> Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, who has been a pro going on four decades,  is another improvising artist who can take or leave the word "Jazz." "It's too  ambiguous," the Kensington, Md., resident said from a San Francisco tour stop  Monday. "I always say, 'Ask 50 people what jazz is and you get 50 different  opinions.' It seems that anything that people don't understand, well, that's  jazz."  </P> <P> Turrentine -- who plays Birdland West in Long Beach with his quintet through  Saturday -- says that all the labels people have given him over the years prove  his point. "It's been said that I'm a blues player, that I play jazz/fusion,  bebop, rock 'n' roll, con-fusion. I've been through it all," he laughed.  "Still, I'm playing the same style that I always did, so I try to think in  terms of music, and just hope the fans like it and keep comin' on in."  </P> <P> Blues, coupled with a capacity for playing long, swinging lines, has always  been the essential ingredient of the Turrentine approach. "That's a good  foundation, at least it has been for me," said the former Pittsburgh, Pa.  native. "I've been into the blues from my first road job, which was with (blues  guitarist/singer) Lowell Fulsom when I was 16. Ray Charles was the featured  vocalist and pianist with that group. We'd get on the bandstand and he'd bring  tears to my eyes."  </P> <P> And while the 55-year-old horn man said that his band members -- Bob Fox,  keyboards; Dave Stryker, guitar; Scott Ambush, bass, and Ernie Adams, drums --  occasionally employ some synthesizers and electric instruments, their use  hasn't adulterated his presentations. "I surround myself with some of that  stuff to get that 'today' feel," he said, "but the technology doesn't distort  my style. I'm still playing acoustically and I don't use any gadgets."  </P> <P> Turrentine said his current repertoire reaches from such early-'70s CTI LPs as  "Pieces of Dreams" and "Sugar" to his most recent Blue Note effort, "La Place."  "I play a little bit of the old, a little of the new," he said. "I try to keep  it to flexible. It seems that a lot of the music I have recorded is still  valid. At least it's entertaining to me, and I guess entertaining to the people  who come in."  </P> <P> Briefly hospitalized in October due to an onset of pulmonary edema, Turrentine  said he's back on his feet and feeling great. "I'm following my doctor's  orders, sticking to my diet and taking my high blood pressure pills and it's  like nothing ever happened. I do thank all the people for their cards and  prayers. They really helped."  </P> <P> Upcoming Turrentine engagements include a slot on the David Letterman show on  Tuesday, a New Year's Eve date at the World Trade Center in Manhattan and a  benefit for Enter -- a comprehensive alcohol and drug treatment center located  in East Harlem -- at the Apollo Theatre on Jan. 27. "It's one of my pet  projects," he said, adding that such associates as Jimmy Smith, Les McCann,  Shirley Scott, Hubert Laws, Michael Brecker and Jean Carne are donating their  services. Angelenos wishing to make donations may write to Enter, 302 E. 111th  St., New York, N.Y., 10029.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eskovitz on the Run  </P> <P> Saxophonist Bruce Eskovitz says one of the biggest drawbacks in the current  music scene is the difficulty in keeping a band together. That's why he's so  pleased that his quintet -- which plays at the Overland Cafe in Palms on Friday  at 8:30 p.m. -- has remained intact for a couple of years.  </P> <P> "The guys and I -- Stuart Elster, keyboards; David Hart, guitar; Bob Feldman,  bass, and Rod Harbour, drums -- have been friends for many years and there's  nothing better than people who like each other playing together, grooving and  having the audience like it," the CSUN grad said. "I think Paul McCartney said  that having a band is more fun than driving a Rolls-Royce. Well, I've never had  a Rolls, but I can tell you, having a band is great."  </P> <P> Eskovitz, who also heads the jazz program at the Crossroads School in Santa  Monica, covers the gamut of modern moods in his performances. "We do some  Latin-flavored things, some fusion things and also dip into mainstream, though  we try to do that with a 1989 approach."  </P> <P> The leader's eponymously-titled debut LP is due out in January on the Los  Angeles-based ITI label. "It's kind of a jazz/fusion record, but there are  horns on some tracks, a string section on a ballad, kind of a mixture of some  happy moods with some that are little darker and deeper. I feel good about it."  </P></p>

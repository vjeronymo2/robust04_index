			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: All-round gains at Equitable THE EQUITABLE, the US insurer 49 per cent owned by Axa of France, repaid its recent star billing by Wall Street analysts with third-quarter results which showed a further all-round improvement in its operating position. Net income for the three months to end-September rose to Dollars 71.3m, or 32 cents a share fully diluted. A year before, excluding costs of the company's demutualisation, Equitable earned net profits of Dollars 32.7m or 18 cents a share. The company's shares, which shortly after its flotation in July 1992 traded at a low of Dollars 7 1/2 , jumped yesterday morning by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 26 5/8 , before settling back to close at Dollars 26 3/8 . The company benefited from a strong performance in both its life insurance and investment services businesses. Post-tax profits in insurance rose to Dollars 21.4m from Dollars 17.4m a year earlier, before capital gains and other special items. The improvement resulted from reduced costs and higher profit margins, which more than offset higher than expected mortality during the quarter. Capital gains after tax were Dollars 24.3m, compared with a Dollars 15.1m loss a year earlier. Investment services - which includes Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the stockbroker in which Equitable is expected to float a minority stake, Alliance Capital Management, and Equitable Real Estate Investment Management  -saw net income rise to Dollars 56.9m from Dollars 47m. DLJ was the largest contributor to growth, with a 14.9 per cent rise in net income.</p>

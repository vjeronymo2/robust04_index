			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Saab stays pinned in the red SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile expects no improvement this year on its 1991 result when it made a pre-tax loss after financial items of SKr2.24bn (Dollars 422.6m). The prediction follows a sharp deterioration in second-half trading conditions and disappoints earlier expectations of a substantially reduced 1992 loss. In the first half, pre-tax losses after financial items narrowed to SKr800m from SKr1.59bn in the same 1991 period. The 1992 forecast was given by Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as chief executive last month. He expects the group to remain in the red for at least the first half of 1993, with prospects for the rest of next year hinging on the launch of a new model, scheduled for introduction in the third quarter of 1993. 'The next 12 months are going to be a very difficult time,' warned Mr Butler-Wheelhouse. The implication is that Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, could remain in the red for the whole of 1993, which would be its fifth year of losses in a row. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse said the second-half figures had worsened because of lower sales, particularly in the key US, UK and Swedish markets, and reduced margins. The group originally hoped to sell 101,000 cars this year, but now fears it may only sell 90,000, although this is still up on 1991's 87,500. He said he aimed to reduce the group's break-even production level from 100,000 units to 70,000.</p>

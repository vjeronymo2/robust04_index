			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: 2 LIVE CREW RESCHEDULES O.C. SHOW  </P> <P> The rap group 2 Live Crew, which canceled an appearance at the Celebrity  Theatre last month in the midst of national controversy over the group's  allegedly obscene recordings, has announced it will play the theater after all,  on Nov. 9.  </P> <P> Already there are small swarms of community protest as some residents are again  urging the city to ban the show.  </P> <P> Members of an Anaheim group calling itself the American Civil Responsibilities  Union asked the City Council on Aug. 14 to ban the rappers.  </P> <P> "Reasonable community standards are to be expected," said Howard Garber, a  member of the protest group. "Conservative Orange County is not going to put up  with this apathy and indifference by the Anaheim City Council."  </P> <P> The protest group had urged the council to ban 2 Live Crew last month, but  before the council took action, the rappers cut short their California tour,  explaining that leader Luther Campbell's doctor had ordered him to rest.  </P> <P> Before the cancellation, the council had taken a low-key approach, hoping that  with low ticket sales and little publicity the concert would fade away.  </P> <P> "There are other ways to do it without running around screaming," Mayor Fred  Hunter said. "For us to even pass a resolution banning the 2 Live Crew isn't  right."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a 2 Live Crew album called "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" was  ruled obscene by a federal judge in Florida. However, the rappers have not been  found to violate California obscenity laws.  </P> <P> Garber said that if the Celebrity show takes place, his group will protest  outside the theater.  </P> <P> According to the Celebrity box office, about 900 of 2,500 tickets to the  concert scheduled for last month had been sold and will be honored in November.  </P> <P> Unmarried teen-agers are having more babies than ever, according to a recent  report by the Department of Health and Human Services. Teen-agers 15 to 17 had  33.8 births per 1,000 girls in 1988.  </P> <P> One of every four births in the United States in 1988 was to an unwed mother,  the federal government said. Although black women have the highest rate of  children born out of wedlock, the rate has been rising fastest among white  women.  </P> <P> "When I look into a girl's eyes, I can tell just what she thinks of me. It's  pretty depressing." -- Bob Hope LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Rifkind to set out Pounds 750m defence cuts: Fighting capacity to be maintained; Job losses to be sweetened by procurement plans; Unions issue plea to cabinet Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will today outline to the Commons his plans to trim more than Pounds 750m a year from defence spending without affecting fighting capacity. As a 'sweetener' to balance up to 20,000 job losses, Mr Rifkind will also confirm procurement of several weapons systems. Some of these announcements may be restatements of decisions which have already been taken in principle. The economy drive, which comes into effect from 1996-97, has been billed as a way of saving money on support services without harming the military's fighting ability. The axe is expected to fall heavily on logistics and maintenance personnel in the Royal Air Force, with widespread privatisation of repair work. Rosyth naval base in Fife, initially tipped for closure, has won a partial reprieve, with more than half the 1,300 civilian employees keeping their jobs. Mr Jack Dromey, chairman of a group of defence unions, yesterday appealed to the government to spare the axe. He said: 'We ask the cabinet not to proceed with the break-up of Europe's most efficient naval-support network.' Today's announcement will mark the conclusion of 33 separate studies. Ideas under review have included the closing of defence buildings on lucrative London sites; the merging of three staff colleges; the scaling down of medical services, including hospitals; and the leasing, instead of buying, of non-combat vehicles - the defence establishment operates more than 90,000 such vehicles. The most likely procurement orders include the second batch of 259 Challenger II main battle tanks for the army, for which Vickers was asked to tender last year. Also likely to be announced is the mid-life update for Tornado aircraft, and replacement command and control systems for some Trafalgar submarines from BAe/Sema. There will also be invitations to tender for the replacements to landing ships Fearless and Intrepid, which could be built at Swan Hunter in Tyneside or VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Formal tender invitations will also be issued for the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards, which are due to be privatised by 1996. Less certain are orders for the next batch of Type 23 frigates, which are expected to go to Yarrow on the Clyde, and orders for Sandown minehunters which are being contested between Vosper Thornycroft at Southampton and Yarrow. The orders are expected shortly, but may not yet be ready for signing. Still in the pending tray is the decision on support helicopters for the RAF. A mixed fleet of Boeing Chinooks and Westland EH101s is expected to be ordered towards the end of the year.</p>

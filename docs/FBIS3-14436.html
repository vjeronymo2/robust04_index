			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the efforts made  by some international quarters and some Arabs to effect a  revocation of the economic boycott of Israel, affirming that  Israel has not taken a single step in the direction of peace,  and that it has not made any worth-noting effort to render the  peace process a success. On the contrary, the paper adds,  Israel has done its best to demolish the peace process.  Moreover, it has failed to express any willingness to withdraw  its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Worse still, it  has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its hostile settlement  course. It has not halted, even for a single moment, the policy  of repression, terrorism, displacement, and killing.    Given all this, the paper wonders: What has changed to  warrant an Arab revocation of the economic boycott of Israel,  and the opening of Arab markets for Israeli products? Has  Israel withdrawn from a single inch of occupied territory, or  even pledged to do so? Has it halted its settlement policy? Has  it revoked the policy of killing, displacement, and dislocation  targeting Arabs?    TISHRIN states that the Arab boycott of Israel was a  response  to the hostile and criminal Israeli policies, which are in  violation of the most basic rules of international law, the  Geneva conventions, and the UN Charter. Israel has not made any  change in its policies. Consequently, there is nothing to  warrant an Arab revocation of the boycott. Worse still, the  Israeli aggressiveness and anti-peace course has been nurtured.  For, in spite of Arab efforts to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Israel has committed  massacres. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is flagrant proof of  Israel's aggressiveness.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN wonders: Would it be out  of place if we ask those urging a revocation of the Arab boycott  to put pressure on Israel to make it respect international law  and human rights, and respond to the wishes for peace,  particularly since the Washington talks have entered their third  year, with nothing in the horizon indicating that the  intransigent anti-peace Israeli position has changed?    Under the headline "Rabin's Threats Are Meant to Circumvent  Peace," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral talks are  expected to be resumed in Washington in April after Syria,  through inter-Arab coordination, has given the peace process a  new lease of life by bringing it back on track.    The paper adds: Although no date has thus far been set for  the start of the next round of talks, the Rabin government has  begun to step up its threats, and to couple these threats with  aggressive acts against our kinfolk in occupied Palestine and  southern Lebanon.    The paper goes on to say: Rabin attempts to shuffle cards  whenever he finds himself cornered, and whenever international  efforts to advance the peace process reach an advanced stage.  The developments we have seen over the past few months,  particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit, have shown  that Rabin's efforts to circumvent the summit outcome culminated  in the Hebron massacre, as well as a spate of attacks on  southern Lebanon. These developments have also proved that  Rabin has remained hostage to a maneuvering mind-set opposed to  peace, and that he has continued to cling to a host of  impossible conditions that cannot but obstruct the peace process  and kill the new opportunities created for it.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH affirms the need to halt  Israel's efforts to evade the requirements of peace,  particularly since the attainment of just and comprehensive  peace has become a regional and international demand that will  reflect positively on the interests of the entire world  community.    For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the  tragic  situation being experienced by the city of Hebron 29 days after  the perpetration of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    The paper says: What is currently taking place in Hebron and  the remaining parts of the occupied Arab territories must open  the eyes of the world community to Israeli practices. This must  also draw attention to the tragic situation experienced by the  Palestinians under the hateful occupation, which has turned the  lives of hundreds of thousands of people into an intolerable  inferno, and deprived them of the most basic requirements of a  free and decent life.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israeli practices, which grow  harsher and more ferocious day in and day out, and which have  begun to take on an exceptionally bloody and heinous dimension,  clearly show the Israeli rulers' determination to persist with  their arrogance, stubbornness, and aggressive policy, which is  diametrically opposed to the efforts to achieve just and  comprehensive peace.    The paper notes that these practices underscore the urgent  need for extensive and effective international moves to create  the proper mechanism for the implementation of the recent UN  Security Council Resolution Number 904 to ensure Israeli  compliance with the relevant international resolutions, and  provide the Palestinians with real protection from the  repression of occupation troops.    The paper concludes by saying: Israel will be mistaken if it  believes that it will manage to achieve its objectives through  the pursuit of these policies. Israel must realize that the  peace process will remain deadlocked unless it changes its  conduct and concepts, particularly with regard to comprehensive  solution and the recognition of the Palestinians' just and  legitimate rights. No tangible accomplishment will be made  unless Israel effects these changes. For, despite their strong  eagerness to achieve peace, the Arabs will not bargain over  their territories and rights. Nor will they accept anything  short of complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab  territories. This is the only way to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace.</p>

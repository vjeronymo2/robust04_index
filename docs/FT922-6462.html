			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT on two houses IN 1980 I bought a property to provide a home for my mother, taking out a loan of Pounds 12,000. At that time I owned no other property, but in 1984 I bought a home for myself with a separate mortgage of Pounds 25,000. Tax legislation allows me a total Pounds 30,000 allowance on the combined loans, but I am uncertain as to the position of capital gains when, in the normal occurence of events, I shall have to dispose of my mother's property on her death. When I took out the loans I understood that no capital gains would be payable - is this still the case? If not, is there any action you recommend I should take now? Provided that your mother has lived in the 1980 property continuously since March 30 1982, there should be no CGT to pay on a sale of the property within two (or maybe three) years of the day she moves out, or dies in residence. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT4 (Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses); the title is a little misleading. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

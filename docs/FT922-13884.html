			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (2): Don't get frightened - Technology Training THE DAYS when the highest technology to be found in a management training room was a blackboard and chalk are long gone. Today's managers are being taught with the latest electronics equipment, ranging from interactive computer simulations to multimedia presentations and language laboratories. And one of the things they are learning is not to be intimidated by the technology. But at the same time companies are demanding greater value for money from management education and training schemes - one reason for the growth of 'distance learning' and training videos, and the launch in the UK next month of the Executive Business Club, a subscription television service from Management TV International. EBC will comprise an hour of management training and business information programmes each week broadcast in encrypted form over BBC Select - the new pay-TV channel of the BBC. The idea is that member organisations will be able to decode and tape the broadcasts, building up their own library of training videos. One recent study valued the total UK market for video-based training at more than Pounds 22m and estimated that it would grow by between 20 and 25 per cent this year. Such is the growth in the market that a few books have begun appearing to help trainers use video more effectively, among them 'Using Video in Training and Education' by Ashly Pinnington, a consultant to Henley Management College. Production and distribution companies such as Video Arts produce catalogues containing dozens of films dealing with subjects as diverse as sexual harassment, how to negotiate and telephone sales techniques. Most of Video Arts' titles run for between 15 and 30 minutes and cost Pounds 100 or more to hire for two days, around Pounds 185 for a week or from about Pounds 600 to buy outright. Many of them feature comedians such as co-founder John Cleese, or Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, and are based on the premise that managers are more likely to absorb a message if it is presented in a simple, concise and preferably humorous way. Video Arts' latest catalogue includes such nuggets as 'Agreeing to Agree' starring Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones on the art of negotiation, 'Cold Call' on telephone selling, 'How to Lose Customers Without Really Trying)' and 'Grime Goes Green' which explains the need for a corporate environmental strategy. In the UK other video producers include Melrose Film Productions and Longman Training whose new catalogue includes over 150 titles dealing with issues like Total Quality, sales techniques and health and safety for VDU users. Some of the management colleges themselves have begun to produce training videos. Sundridge Park Management Centre, a pioneer in the use of technology in several areas, will design and produce what it calls 'trigger' videos for use by corporate training departments. Sundridge Park's training technologies department has also developed a sophisticated interactive videodisc package called 'The Next Candidate' to help train managers in interviewing techniques. Some of the video production companies such as Longman Training have also begun to offer interactive videos. By combining the images from a laser disc with the power of a computer, interactive video provides a powerful training tool. The interactive video user can ask questions, receive information and work through a training package at his own speed. Among the discs available from Longman are several aimed specifically at managers including one on delegation and another on appraisal and counselling. Purchase prices range from Pounds 795 to Pounds 3,900 for 'Account Ability' which introduces the Price Waterhouse seven-step approach to understanding and interpreting financial statements. Hardware to use the interactive videos is available for hire. Personal Computers (PCs) are also making their way into training colleges in other guises, for example as gateways to other services. At Ashridge for example, the Learning Resources Centre houses not only the library but also a bank of PCs hooked up to electronic data bases. Desktop PCs now have the power to run interactive training programmes and the type of business simulation packages that not so long ago could only be run on a mainframe. Many management colleges now offer students a chance to play business games or work simulation packages on classroom PCs. Ms Monica Seeley, an expert on computer aided management training from Sundridge Park, points out that computers can also provide computer-shy managers with the chance to learn about computers and information technology itself. 'They provide hands-on experience in a non-threatening environment,' she says. Inter-active computer training programmes, once a rarity, are now available from many sources and some are extremely specialised. For example, Strat*X, an international strategic training consultancy, has developed a range of computer simulations including Markops and Markstrat, which enable users to apply and test marketing concepts and approaches in a realistic and highly competitive market environment. The firm recently launched a new simulation called Bidstrat which replicates the behaviour of bidding markets such as aerospace, medical systems and other high tech industries. Other companies such as London-based RBRC software have produced team business simulations which involve a team of four acting as a board of directors and running a company for five years. One of RBRC's seven programmes is called 'Beat the Boss' and forms an introduction to business dynamics; another called 'Handling Time' is a computerised exposition of the logic and mechanics of discounted cashflow (DCF) and its application to business decisions. Other software companies such as FSMD of Cheshire, set up by four former graduates of Manchester Business School, specialise in designing, developing and implementing educational programmes for individual companies, mainly in the financial services sector. Computers are also being used on their increasingly popular 'distance learning' courses, the 1990s successors to the correspondence course. A number of colleges including the Open University, Lancaster University and Henley Management College use computer conferencing - achieved by hooking home computers up to a college mainframe computer via a modem and telephone lines. The big advantage of computer conferencing is that it allows students, no matter how geographically dispersed, to communicate with each other and the college as a group. For example, Henley's Extended Learning Programme (Help) allows students to connect with a central college database to retrieve details about the course, workshops, examinations and administration. They can also exchange electronic mail and take part in computer conferences and have access to the college library and on-line databases. The other area in which technology is being put to good use is for language training, viewed as increasingly important on both sides of the Atlantic and symptomatic of the pronounced trend towards internationalisation in management education. At the University of Bradford's Management Centre, which has one of the largest MBA programmes in the UK, students have jumped at the chance to learn languages in the centre's state-of-the-art language teaching system - an interactive touch-screen system made by Sony and the first of its kind in Europe.</p>

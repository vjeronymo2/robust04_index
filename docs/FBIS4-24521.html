			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin stressed here today the importance of conscientiously  studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and correctly handling the relations  between the reform, development and stability.    Addressing a theoretical study class for senior officials,  Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, called for unremitting efforts to help arm the whole  party with Deng's theory.    He asked officials at all levels, particularly senior  officials, to attach top importance to the study of Deng's  theory during the current new period.    He noted that only by becoming clear-headed theoretically,  will it be possible for party and government officials to be  firm politically, to become more conscientious in carrying out  the party's basic line of taking economic construction as the  central task, and to attain China's modernization goal.    The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is  essential to the success of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, he told senior officials from across the  country attending the class in the party school of the party  Central Committee.    That is why all officials, veteran and young, must continue  to study Deng's theory assiduously and lead party members in  studying the theory persistently, he added.    In studying the selected works of Deng Xiaoping, it is  necessary to seek correct answers to the questions that have  arisen in the course of reforms and economic construction,  especially in building up a socialist market economy, Jiang said.    Speaking of how to balance the relations between the reform,  development and stability, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to  educate party members, officials and the people, on Deng  Xiaoping's ideas on the issue.    Meanwhile, it is imperative to correctly grasp the current  overall situation in China, and solve in a positive and  appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting the  reform, development and stability, he said.    Furthermore, "we must unswervingly follow the party's mass  line and give play to the initiative of all sectors of society,"  he said.    The establishment of a socialist market economic structure  and the deepening of reforms have made it imperative to  strengthen and improve party leadership and party building, and  bring the role of party organizations and members into full  play, he said.    He also called for efforts to train and promote younger  officials so that they will be able to assume leading  responsibilities beyond the year 2000.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Cheek by Jowl - a tour de force / Michael Arditti talks to director Declan Donnellan WHEN Lysander and Demetrius stop jockeying for position and agree to pursue Helena 'cheek by jowl', they can little have guessed that their exit line would provide the name for the most successful theatre company of recent years. But then, what's in a name? In Brazil Cheek by Jowl are known as 'face to face', in Argentina 'elbow to elbow', in Uruguay 'shoulder to shoulder', in Spain 'flesh and nails' - and somewhere even 'arse in knickers.' Few companies embodied the self-sufficient spirit of the 1980s more successfully - or more humanely. Frustrated by their inability to gain work from any established source, director Declan Donnellan and designer Nick Ormerod decided to mortgage their house and go it alone. They applied for a small Arts Council grant, patched together a nine-week tour and hit the road. From the start the company established a reputation for exciting small-scale productions of the classics; although the size of the operation is often underestimated. As Donnellan says, 'it's only in London people talk of our studio work; elsewhere we perform in huge auditoria'. An accompanying reputation for irreverence is, in the director's view, equally unfounded: 'From where we are, we are middle of the road purists'. After initial success with The Country Wife and Othello, it was their 1984 season of Vanity Fair, Pericles and Andromache which made their name with a metropolitan audience. The three productions exemplify the essential elements of the Cheek by Jowl approach - the narrative clarity and overt theatricality of Vanity Fair, with its heroic doubling by seven actors of 40 characters and inventive set in which boxes and banquettes became battlefields, boudoirs and ballrooms; the stylistic freedom of Pericles with its mime, music and direct address; and the rescue of Andromache from years of classroom tedium and theatrical neglect. Their repertoire has remained resolutely classical: seven Shakespeares, two Restorations, one each of Calderon, Corneille, Racine, Ostrovsky, Sophocles and Lessing. In 12 years they have included only one new play, Donnellan's own examination of his Irish heritage, Lady Betty. And yet he explains that this neglect is utterly pragmatic: 'It's rather ridiculous that we're performing plays by people so incredibly dead. But the reason is that we don't have the means to evaluate new ones. We get masses and masses of scripts which we simply don't have a chance to read.' It becomes increasingly clear that this pragmatism informs their whole operation. They never choose a play to score specific points, aesthetic or political, but rather to explore its meaning within a particular company. The main exception was in 1991 when they chose to examine the gender confusions of As You Like It with an all-male cast. Their current production is Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love, which reaches the Donmar Warehouse next week in Donnellan's own translation. He places it in the direct line of earlier revivals such as Andromache and Le Cid and its mix of styles fascinates him: 'It moves from an opening of commedia-type drunken priests to intense romantic duos which might have been written by Flaubert. It's a cross between Madame Bovary and opera buffo.' Donnellan sees the keynote of his direction as the liberation of his actors' imaginations: 'to help them act better, to steer them on the path that is most truthful.' What is yet more unusual is that it is also the keynote of Ormerod's design. Not a sketch is committed to paper until he has worked with the company for at least two weeks. And, uniquely in contemporary British theatre, he remains present throughout rehearsals. Such respect for their creativity is the reason that so many actors clamour to join Cheek by Jowl. The irony is that while both artistic directors consider it to be an actors' company, it is popularly perceived as a two-man band, existing solely to promote their own work. Only one production has ever been entrusted to an outsider, their former assistant Lindsay Posner. Certain actors do however remain constant; indeed it was the desire to create parts for company stalwart, Anne White, which led to two of their most contentious creations: the foul- mouthed female porter in Macbeth and the sex-changed King of Naples in The Tempest. But Donnellan insists that they never consciously try to be different. 'It may sound a paradox, but the truer you are to the play, the more original you will be. The more you try to put yourself in, the more you'll end up like everyone else.' My own criticism would be less of such incidentals than of an emotional reserve. It is sometimes easier to admire the wit of a Cheek by Jowl production than to be fired by the passion. And, although Donnellan considers the greatest privilege of his work to be the poetry, his belief that poetry is what lies behind the words, rather than the words themselves, can lead to an underselling of the verse. Poetry is, famously, what gets lost in translation; to which Cheek by Jowl have been more susceptible than most. In ten years of intensive international touring, they have become our leading theatrical ambassadors. They played in Eastern Europe before the revolutions. In Prague they risked official displeasure by using a press conference to salute the imprisoned Vaclav Havel. In Bucharest their female King of Naples, seen here as Mrs Thatcher, was taken for the still more authoritarian Elena Ceaucescu. Now that the cry of freedom has been heard, they stand at the forefront of cultural exchange with the new Romanian regime and next year will mount an epic production of Boris Godunov, first in Bucharest and then in Manchester, starring Ion Caramitru, who was that country's transitional vice-president and last seen here in the role of Hamlet. Only once have they been compromised by politics, when Macbeth was prevented from touring Chile for fear General Pinochet should see it as a reflection of his own career. After twelve years on the road, 1650 performances, and a pervasive influence on the style of British classical production, its directors could be forgiven for sitting back on their laurels - or at least their Olivier awards. But they remain dedicated to touring and discount the alternative of running their own theatre as one where artistic considerations are submerged in those of patching up leaking roofs. And, although they have diversified with productions at the National such as Fuente Ovejuna, Angels in America and the forthcoming Sweeney Todd, their primary commitment to the company remains. It is a commitment as much personal as professional. For, if not as symbiotic as Gilbert and George, they are rarely apart. Indeed the key to their success lies in their total embodiment of their own ethos: living and working 'cheek by jowl'. Don't Fool With Love: Donmar Warehouse from April 19 - May 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Those Russian oil refineries that have concluded  contracts with foreign firms to reactivate abandoned oil wells  will have to pay for their services at the expense of their  export revenue under main quotas.    A reliable expert at a Russian oil company told the Oil  Information Agency the decision was made at one of the recent  conferences of the leaders of the Fuel and Energy Ministry  (Mintopenergo).    Mintopenergo argues that it has "no chance of giving those  enterprises breaks or additional export quotas to pay for the  services of foreign firms." The ministry has obliged the  managers of oil enterprises to take measures to reduce oil well  repair costs. At the same time such oil companies such as  LUKoil, YUKOS and Rosneft have been asked to present their  proposals for government support for oil and gas producers in  paying their debts to foreign firms conducting oil and gas well  repairs.    So far 25 foreign companies have carried out major repairs  and maintenance under 46 contracts on more than 3,300 wells,  which have produced an additional 15 million tonnes of crude.  To pay the foreign firms for the work done Russian oil  producers exported 3.3 million tonnes of crude under additional  quotas in 1993. This year three million tonnes will be exported  for the same purpose under the main quotas.</p>

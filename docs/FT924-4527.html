			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Where Cambodia's peace deal does not reach: Victor Mallet visits the north where the annual dry-season battle with the Khmer Rouge is under way FOR Lieutenant Yang Souphat, an officer in the Cambodian government army guarding the road north of Kompong Thom, very little has changed since the signing of the Paris peace accords a year ago. The rains have ended, the swampy ground is beginning to dry out, and it is time for the annual battles against the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge. Already there is fighting with artillery or small arms almost every day. 'Khmer Rouge activities are on the increase,' says the lieutenant. His troops show off an anti-tank mine found that morning under the dirt road known as Highway 12; the only vehicles moving now are bicycles and heavily laden motorcycles re-supplying the troops further north. But what about the ceasefire? 'There is no success with this,' replies Lt Yang Souphat, 'because the Khmer Rouge still keep their weapons.' Across Cambodia, the refusal by Khmer Rouge leaders to adopt a ceasefire, disarm their forces or participate in an election due next May - all of which they agreed to do last year - is undermining both the peace plan and the Dollars 2bn operation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) which was supposed to implement it. In the area around Kompong Thom, UN troops are monitoring a non-existent ceasefire. Lt Yang Souphat, recently supplied with a new multiple rocket launcher from down south, is more concerned about the grid references of incoming artillery rounds than the ins and outs of the UN peace plan. UN military observers agree that the various Cambodian factions have started to manoeuvre their forces through Cambodia's forests, rubber plantations and swamps in their attempts to seize more territory. Numerous skirmishes are breaking out; they are usually between the Khmer Rouge and the government, but the forces of Funcinpec, the royalist party, are also occasionally involved. 'As it starts to dry out, there is an awful lot of factional military activity,' says Colonel Mark Walton, the British operations officer for the military observers in the area. Even more serious than the seasonal outbreak of fighting is a drive by the Khmer Rouge to disrupt the registration of voters for the election. Last week, two days after military observers had distributed election posters and radios (so that the villagers could listen to Untac radio) in a village in Kompong Thom's Sambur district, Khmer Rouge guerrillas entered the village, burnt the posters and - according to some reports  - took away the radios. A more ominous incident, also last week and in the same district, occurred in another village where civilian UN officials had already registered voters. Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized the registration cards at gunpoint and cut them in half, keeping the halves bearing the names of the inhabitants. Elsewhere in Kompong Thom province, two people were injured when six rockets were fired at a registration centre; and in yet another part of the province a Khmer Rouge general has ordered out UN electoral staff and demanded the removal of a cantonment site for Funcinpec soldiers. Near Kompong Cham a UN electoral officer came across the body of a man floating down the Mekong river. He had been tortured, burnt and tied to a stake. Not all the violence is attributed to the Khmer Rouge. Government officials, accustomed to a one-party political system, are suspected of grenade attacks on newly established Funcinpec offices and other targets in and around Battambang in the west. Untac insists there is no evidence yet of a systematic attempt to disrupt the election - indeed some Khmer Rouge guerrillas have registered themselves  -but many UN electoral officials, Cambodian and foreign, are frightened by the intimidating tactics of Khmer Rouge and government forces. Indonesia's 2nd battalion in Kompong Thom has called in reinforcements from Phnom Penh. The original idea, says Major Safzen Noerdin, was to accompany electoral officials only in 'high-risk' areas. 'But now almost all the teams ask us to provide security,' he says. Mr Reginald Austin, the Zimbabwean who heads the UN's electoral taskforce, is delighted at the high levels of voter registration so far  - about 2.7m people out of an estimated eligible population of 4.5m to 5m - although he believes the voting itself in May will be far easier to disrupt than the long process of registration. 'I think we probably will achieve a very high level of registration in spite of the fact that there is a lot of flak around,' he says. The seizure of registration cards does not deprive those affected of the right to vote, since they will still be on the list. He (the voter) belongs to us, provided he's got enough guts on the day,' says Mr Austin. 'We didn't expect to be registering in an armed environment. But we either register in an armed environment or we don't register at all.' Mr Ung Huot, Funcinpec's election campaign manager, believes that the Khmer Rouge must be made to comply with the peace accords if they are to succeed. 'Otherwise the mission of Untac is a failure,' he says. 'Otherwise the election doesn't mean anything. Cambodia would be divided into Khmer Rouge and government areas and there will be no peace.' For the likes of Lt Yang Souphat, there is not much peace even today. North of Kompong Thom it is business as usual, and the usual business in Cambodia is war.</p>

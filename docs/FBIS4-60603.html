			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kianush Dorrani] </F>   [Text] Qeshm, Iran, May 24 (AFP) -- Qeshm, a free-trade  zone and largest island in the Persian Gulf, is seeking to  attract foreign investment and become another eldorado like the  emirate of Dubayy across the water.    With an area of 1,500 square kilometers (600 square miles),  population of 60,000 and vast natural gas resources, the island  off southern Iran aims to turn into a major industrial and  offshore banking zone.    Qeshm "can compete with other free-trade zones in the region  and serve as a center for trade with Central Asian countries,"  said the managing director of the zone, Behruz Bushehri.  However, the authorities have failed to attract major foreign  investment since the island on the Strait of Hormoz, through  which one-fifth of the world's crude passes, was turned into a  free-trade zone three years ago.    Western economic experts blame reluctance to invest in Qeshm  on the lack of clear investment laws in Iran, saying the  existing regulations do not provide adequate guarantees.  Although officials on the island say potential foreign  investors can sink up to 100 percent in a project, the Iranian  constitution limits foreign ventures in Iran to 49 percent.    Bushehri acknowledged to journalists that foreign  investments  in Qeshm would "not be insured by the central bank," whose  guarantee most potential investors have sought. Guarantees  would come instead from the Organisation of Free-Trade Zones in  Iran, which oversees Qeshm, Kish (also on the Gulf), Chah Bahar  (on the Sea of Oman), Sirjan (in Kerman Province) and Bandar-e  'Anzali (on the Caspian). Bushehri also confirmed that  foreigners were not allowed to own land in free-trade zones.    After having been used as a platform for importing luxury  goods over the past three years, Qeshm now seeks to help boost  exports and serve as a financial center in the region and a base  for offshore banks.    These ambitious projects could prove difficult on a  sun-scorched island which up until recent years had been left  abandoned. Except for a 108-room hotel under construction with  Malaysian money, none of the joint-venture projects of the past  three years have yet been launched, mainly due to lack of funds.  Among the projects are a steel foundry with Japan's Kobe  company, a power plant with Germany's Siemens, a cement factory  with China and a fertilizer plant with India.    A Qeshm official, who declined to be identified, admitted  any  competition with the free-trade zone of Jabal 'Ali across the  Gulf in Dubayy, United Arab Emirates [UAE], would be difficult.  He pointed to "sizeable investments made there by multinational  corporations, which all have the green light from the United  States." Washington, which fell out with Tehran when the 1979  Islamic revolution deposed the pro-Western shah, has imposed  economic sanctions on Iran for its alleged support of terrorism.    The Qeshm authorities, however, are gradually developing the  island, having joined it to the nationwide electricity grid and  built hundreds of kilometers of paved roads over the last two  years. Work has also begun on the construction of an  international airport, although plans to build a 2.5-kilometer  (1.5-mile) road and railway bridge to connect the island to the  mainland are still on the drawing board. A project to build a  deep-water port to cater for big ships has also failed to make  headway.    But while the authorities await foreign investments and  economic prosperity for the island, the people of Qeshm are  casting their eyes across the Gulf at Dubayy, the eldorado of  the region. The port city in the UAE is the main source of  smuggled goods entering Iran.</p>

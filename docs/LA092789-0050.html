			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The judge in the case of a black teen-ager killed by a gang of white youths in  the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn denied a request that bail be set for  accused triggerman Joseph Fama. "My gut reaction tells me not to let him out,"  said state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens as the victim's family and  supporters applauded. Owens quickly ordered quiet. Fama, 18, has been in  custody since he surrendered in Oneonta, N.Y., Aug. 31. He and four others are  charged with murder in the Aug. 23 shooting death of Yusuf Hawkins, 16.  </P></p>

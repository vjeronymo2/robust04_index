			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Life beyond pots BRITAIN'S first comprehensive exhibition of 20th century ceramics was staged as recently as 1980, at the Christopher Wood Gallery in London's Motcomb Street. In the catalogue foreword, historian Ian Bennett claimed that studio ceramics constituted England's only major contribution to 20th century art. While some would consider Bennett's assessment unfair, it is indisputable that ceramics is an art medium no longer to be disparaged as 'crafts'. In the mid-19th century, ceramics was seen as an integral part of the total art scene, but in this century fine art has been elevated on to a pedestal all its own. 'Ceramic Contemporaries', new works by young ceramicists at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, (until Wednesday) may remove some of that imposed distance. Organised by the National Association for Ceramics in Higher Education (NACHE), an open competition for students and recent graduates brought in more than 606 applications across the country - a reflection of the expansion of studio pottery in the last decade. Each applicant could submit six slides and over 3000 came in. The jury whittled these down to 220 slides from 170 individuals. The Pounds 10 submission fee footed most of the bill. The exhibition is exciting, as much for its diversity and energy as for its technical facility. The spectrum is wide, ranging from the attitudes expressed by Michael Cardew, who said that pottery is about making pots to eat from, and Hans Coper, who did not really like working in clay but said he could not do what he wanted in anything else. This 'first' (there are rumblings of hope that the show will be repeated every three years) exhibition is not very much much about pots. The vessel takes a back seat to the surprisingly high proportion of figurative work. Ian Ramsey's 'Posse' would get my vote for the most expressive work. Placed on the floor are 14 nude men on horseback, each man and each horse in a different posture. These amazing Don Quixotes, with all their circular wheel-thrown markings, give us every mood and movement, from boredom to exuberance. I enjoyed the realism and humour of Catrin Howell's long-nailed 'Balancing Dogs' poised so emphatically, teeth bared, on all fours, and the flakey cow of Clare McGuinness, maintaining its one-eared dignity. Humour abounded. A three-spout jug dares you to get one single flow. R. Dawson's 'Fat Cups', the lips as wide as a doughnut, represent the ultimate demi-tasse. Of course there were mugs and teapots, too, and a handsome green/tan coffee service. Sadly, the tableware was just tableware. The British disease of worshipping the 18th century does not encourage interesting industrial production or young talent. All the more shocking, then, to see Dinah Body's elegant bone china, which looks good enough to be Italian. The 1980s were the years of greatest expansion at the V&amp;A for studio pottery; 250 pieces bought, of which 185 cost Pounds 42,672.45, or 85 per cent of the total money spent in that area over seven previous decades, but still less than half of 1 per cent of the Museum purchase budget for the decade. The largest number of pieces (22) are, not surprisingly, those of Dame Lucie Rie. Rie is the living master of 20th century ceramics in Britain, perhaps the world. Along with Bernard Leach and her friend and mentor Hans Coper, these great names still command high prices at auction. On March 25, Bonhams held an auction of these greats, and others. The company has dominated the market ever since Cyril Frankel (no relation to the writer) moved there from Christie's. Recession or no recession, their six-figure profit, according to Frankel, has remained much the same as in the glorious 1980s, leaning heavily on the big names. Last Thursday evening, Bonhams held an auction of these greats and others. Only 3 per cent remained unsold and Frankel says it was his best sale there, a 'confirmation that prices have held up'. Including the 10 per cent buyer's premium, the sale netted Pounds 257,834. An elegant white Bernard Leach pot reached its world record price of Pounds 10,000; a pink porcelain conical bowl by Dame Lucy Rie sold for Pounds 6,500, a Pounds 500 increase over a similar and superior one sold in 1989. A large unglazed red and orange dish by the internationally acclaimed potter Kitaoji Rosanjin sold for Pounds 11,000 to a Japanese buyer in the audience. The monumental stoneware pot by Hans Coper sold to a telephone buyer for Pounds 29,000. Two more current exhibitions command attention. Contemporary Applied Arts (43 Earlham Street, London WC2) is showing the ceramic pieces of Gordon Baldwin until April 17. His work, in particular the blue 'vessels from the place of stone' is extraordinary. 'Visions of Craft 1972-1993' at the Crafts Council (44a Pentonville Road, London N1) until May 9 presents, among the 200 outstanding objects, potters who have put Britain on the world ceramic map: Leach, Rie, Coper, Cardew, Britton, Poncelet, Henderson, Crowley and others.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Big French groups report lower sales A number of France's largest industrial groups, including Bouygues, the construction company, and Alcatel-Alsthom, the telecommunications concern, have underlined the pressures on the French economy by reporting reduced sales for last year. Alcatel-Alsthom saw its overall sales fall by 3.4 per cent to FFr156.07bn (Dollars 26.2bn) in 1993 from FFr161.68bn in 1992. Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, had previously warned investors that sales were likely to decline in 1993 and forecast a further reduction in 1994 due to the contraction in the company's European telecommunications activities. Mr Suard has also forecast static profits of around FFr7bn for the group in 1993 followed by a fall in profits during the current year reflecting the increase in its investments. Bouygues, the world's largest construction company, was also hit by a slowdown in its European business. It reported a 4.8 per cent decline in sales to FFr59.7bn for 1993 against FFr62.72bn in the previous year. The group has previously predicted a fall in net profits for 1993 to around FFr450m from FFr685m in 1992, mainly due to the downturn in the property market. Ciments Francais, the building materials company, was another casualty of the construction industry's difficulties. The company, which was recently involved in a scandal over off-balance sheet losses, saw sales fall by 9.7 per cent to FFr13.46bn in 1993 from FFr14.77bn in 1992. The gloomy mood was reinforced by the announcement of a 3.5 per cent decline in sales for Bollore Technologies, the diversified industrial concern that has been hit by the difficulties of SDV, its shipping division. Bollore, which fell into the red in 1992, has already warned of further losses for last year when sales slipped by 3.5 per cent to FFr24.81bn from FFr25.72bn in 1992.</p>

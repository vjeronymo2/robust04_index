			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 May (EFE) -- It was announced  today in this capital that the Colombian Government is opposed  to possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti to depose  provisional President Emile Jonassaint and to hand over power to  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Colombian Foreign Ministry sources, quoted by Emisoras  Caracol Network, said that the Colombian ambassador to the OAS,  former Foreign Minister Julio Londono, has arrived in Santa Fe  de Bogota for consultations with the government of President  Cesar Gaviria on the issue of U.S. intervention in Haiti.    The sources said that the official Colombian position will  be  stated on 6 June in Belem, Brazil, during the annual OAS  assembly, which will be attended by the foreign ministers of OAS  member countries. The Colombian Foreign Ministry last week  rejected the designation of Jonassaint and stated that the only  legitimate administration in Haiti is that of Aristide, who was  democratically elected in 1991.</p>

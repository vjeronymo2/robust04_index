Good morning to you.    [Oleksy] Good morning.    [Skowronski] I think there has never been a New Year's Eve  with this kind of rainy and hopeless weather.    [Oleksy] Yes, it is a dull day, very bad weather, and it is  warm and wet. It is not going to be a successful New Year's Eve.    [Skowronski] And how are you feeling, Mr. Speaker?    [Oleksy] Well, I am overworked, I am looking forward very  much to this weekend, the relaxation and the tranquility. And  this is exactly what how I will spend the three days.    [Skowronski] Will you have a New Year's Eve celebration, or  not?    [Oleksy] I am not planning on any. I have conducted  negotiations with my wife and we are not going to any ball -- we  will just stay home with the children, quietly. There could be  the problem of a possible traditional invasion by my colleagues  and friends, but I think I will be successful in avoiding it.    [Skowronski] But there is a bottle of champagne already  cooling in the fridge.    [Oleksy] Yes, there are a few of those to be used later.    [Skowronski] You said a few bottles, so that means two, or  perhaps more than that?    [Oleksy] Well, there are three bottles.    [Skowronski] What can one see from the top of the power  structure? What is happening in Poland?    [Oleksy] We can see that the end of the year is surrounded  by a situation of decreased emotions, as it were -- that is my  impression. By the way, the year was full of significant events  and issues, and if that perception of mine is correct, I think  one can look forward to 1994 as a relatively peaceful kind of  year. I think that the thing that could disturb the peace is  some kind of social tension, or problems in major factories, but  let us hope it will not happen because then -- with quite a  rigorous budget, as can be seen from the budget draft -- if the  budget was to be implemented within that rigorous framework and  if it would not be coupled with any major social disasters in  workplaces and in different social spheres, then one could say  that this relatively peaceful 1994 could be a sound basis for  1995, which would then be a year of a clear improvement of the  country's situation.    [Skowronski] You use phrases in your statements from time to  time, describing the danger of social disasters or protests. Is  there a major danger of this kind? Is Poland's situation....  [pauses] At what point are we now?    [Oleksy] I think that this type of tension will continue to  accompany the process of transformations for a long time still,  since there are differences in situations of different economic  establishments, in their financial conditions and consequently  also in the situation of people who are employed there, so it is  inconceivable that there should not be any tensions at all. The  main point is about the scale of those tensions and about the  possible tendency to use such tensions for political purposes.  I hope -- and I trust very much -- that the peace at the end of  this year means that next year there will not be any tendency to  use what are oftentimes natural tensions and the population's  dissatisfaction for political goals. May we see as little as  possible of that, as I said. May we see that there is a  relatively popular understanding of the situation, and also may  politicians and parties -- contrary to what happened not so long  ago -- abstain from using these tensions which may occur, for  purposes of their political games.    [Skowronski] When will the battle for the Belvedere begin in  Poland?    [Oleksy] I think it is already beginning, gradually -- it is  not very clear to the public at times, but sometimes one can  clearly see its signs. But I think it is too soon for that yet.  I think work on a new constitution will unavoidably mark the  beginning of at least a more clearly visible debate on future  power structures, on divisions among different authorities, on  who is to have how much power, and also on the mutual  relationships among the individual components of state power at  the highest level, and also on what kind of decentralization of  political power should occur in the direction of  self-governments. There are self-government elections coming up  in May which will not be legally prepared to a sufficient degree  as it were, I mean from the standpoint of executive laws and  comprehensive changes in the system of financing gminas [small  administrative units]. In a word, I think that the beginning of  work on the new constitution will mark the actual beginning of a  debate -- and also perhaps of emotions or of attempts to have  one's own way or of showing the direction one wants things to  head. I think that beginning sometime in mid-1994 -- or  practically speaking, from the moment the legislative initiative  submitted by the Union of Labor is voted upon -- then we will be  able to speak of the beginning of a constitutional debate,  including the part of the constitution related to presidential  elections.    [Skowronski] Due to your official duties, you have been  meeting very often with the president, that is Lech Walesa. What  is the rapport between you two? Could you give us more of a  personal type of answer?    [Oleksy] It is an overstatement to say I have been meeting  with him very often.    [Skowronski] But it is certainly more frequent than before  19 September?    [Oleksy] Definitely. Well, President Lech Walesa is an  extremely good conversationalist and a man who is capable of  even being extremely engaging and straightforward during direct,  personal contact with him, and one could also say he is human  and normal in such moments. This is different to what he  projects publicly when one's personality always comes through in  a different way, even somewhat artificially, too. But I miss  one thing in these contacts with the president: a more thorough  discussion of Polish issues, I mean the kind of discussion where  the country's president and Sejm speaker -- perhaps also with  some other participants, but not too many -- would be involved  in a deeper kind of wider debate. After all, it would not be  binding when it comes to decisionmaking, but it would reduce  differences in information levels and it could also contribute  to a convergence of views on some very immediate issues, but  ones which are significant in the long run. That is what I  would like to see. Our conversations very clearly pertain to  the immediate situation at hand, issues or even differences of  opinions, but there has not been any opportunity for  conversations about the country during which -- as I said -- the  highest ranking politicians would -- I can see it as in a  picture -- be looking for common ways and common views, while  very concerned for their country's fate.    [Skowronski] So the president has not revealed to you the  fundamental plan for Poland which he had prepared three years  ago?    [Oleksy] I am trying very hard to convince the president to  go back to that fundamental plan, but this time it cannot be in  the form of a slogan. I am convinced that a slogan....[pauses]  A fundamental plan is very important for Poland today because  it is time now -- after the change resulting from the elections,  after four years of accomplishments, after a certain clarity ....    [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean after four years of  success?    [Oleksy] No, success is a very dangerous term here, but  there were certainly some accomplishments and a democracy during  those four years, also a market economy was built and there was  all kind of turmoil -- which by the way is also a valuable  lesson -- so after the four years, after the post-election turn,  and after -- I think -- emotions and fears in connection with  the center-leftist government have subsided, it is now time for  a strategic kind of approach, a common approach, not just by one  or two governing parties, but by many ingredients which have the  power to shape public opinion or even to shape power in the  country; it is time for a common approach to a strategy which  would extend even beyond the next two or three years. That is  the equality plan -- this is the way I see it -- but it must  have substance to it and that is why I have been trying very  hard to convince President Walesa -- within his coming back to  the fundamental plan since he is already doing that -- to make  his staff return to the plan -- perhaps also in debates with  others -- in a way that would make it specific and adapted to  debates on practical solutions.    [Skowronski] If you were to outline such a fundamental plan  right now, what would be the first item there?    [Oleksy] Undoubtedly the first item would be the issue of  debts incurred by the state, both domestic and foreign, and  everything that must be done to eliminate or at least decrease  this phenomenon, which is extremely dangerous for the economy.  A second issue would be a constitution which would put in order  some principles of a democratic and legally based country since  there has been a lot of confusion created around those issues.  A third issue would beyond any doubt be a strategy of a more  thorough look at long-term security of the country, including a  thorough analysis of the radical events in Russia and their  impact on possible changes in Western views. I think that  Poland faces the danger of ending up in a kind of vacuum -- may  it not come to that, the activity in that area is quite clear.  I know and I have been saying that Poland is not secure, either  externally or domestically. The president has been saying the  same thing by the way, except -- as I said -- it requires more  specific proposals, and I think that apart from these three  issues, there is certainly also the unquestionably strategic  issue of self-governments and of adapting the state and its  structures to a new approach to our Third Republic, and so these  four issues are included in the fundamental plan. I ignored  here of course such issues as the civilization standard of  society's education....    Yes, we could go on listing such issues here.    Will the left wing win the self-government elections? Are  you convinced of that?    [Oleksy] We are all wondering what will happen and I think  it is not just us, the left wing. If the left wing were to win  the elections, that would be a very important confirmation of  the way the majority of society thinks politically, not only at  the top but also in local communities. There could occur  different outcomes and I think we will not manage to prevent a  process of making these self-government elections political, but  that would not be a good thing since in a well-ordered country,  self-government elections should be far removed from political  games.    [Skowronski] Do you think that the voters are disappointed  after the few months of left-wing rule?    [Oleksy] I think that there are no reasons whatsoever as of  yet to be disappointed. We did what was technically possible to  do for the poor and weak within a period of two and a half  months. There were also similar announcements made with regard  to 1994. It may be a disappointment with regard to the extent  of the measures, but the fundamental thing is that a trend to  have good intentions and the will to act was demonstrated, I  mean with regard to budget-type measures and not just for 1994,  with the main emphasis being put on looking for possibilities to  assist the weak of our society. The fact that the raises are  modest and that the valorization levels are not too high -- that  is an issue of financial possibilities and of the state of  public finances that the coalition took over from the previous  team....    [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean an empty state Treasury?    [Oleksy] And that requires time. I think a majority of  people understand that. I think what people need the most today  is the faith that they are being treated with honesty, that the  government thinks about them, and that their problems are  regarded as number one, while I think the majority understands  that the rates of increases and the scale of financial  assistance will increase with the passage of time.    [Skowronski] Do you like the budget draft presented by Prime  Minister Pawlak?    [Oleksy] To be honest, I will only begin studying it in a  thorough manner on New Year's Day. I am familiar with all the  main principles of the draft and also with the arguments that  were voiced. I think that among the draft's negative sides  could be its underestimation -- even though others say it is an  overestimation....    [Skowronski, interrupting] Underestimation of what?    [Oleksy] Of budget revenues. I personally think that taking  into account huge disputes which we may see on that occasion,  the budget I think will be adopted with minor modifications  only, but then the government will have to work very hard to  increase the revenues. Expenditure cuts are already out of the  question in most of the areas.    [Skowronski] Sejm Deputy and Minister Miller has been  announcing a major battle surrounding the budget. Are you  afraid of Deputy Miller? Is he capable of making the budget  fall apart?    [Oleksy] Deputy Miller is a very consistent type of  personality and he should be praised for that. I like it when  people display such traits. I think he has been performing his  job in a responsible manner and I think that constitutes a  certain discomfort to the prime minister, to the coalition and  to the Democratic Left Alliance....    [Skowronski, interrupting] But he still demands 6 trillion  zlotys?    [Oleksy] Exactly, and he also provided justifications for  his demands and he demonstrated from which sources he intends to  get the money. I do not think it is a good thing to have such  public disputes between individual ministers and the Council of  Ministers as a whole, which is the body that adopts the budget  as a whole. But if you look at it from the standpoint of a  certain course of action required for the sake of meeting social  needs, I say he has been doing that with dignity.    [Skowronski] You said you do not discuss the fundamental  plan with the president. Now what about Waldemar Pawlak?    [Oleksy] I have had many more discussions with him than with  the president, there is a very direct contact between us and  that is a natural thing to happen between a prime minister and  the Sejm leadership....    [Skowronski, interrupting] So the prime minister's female  assistant does not have to be an intermediary?    [Oleksy] But I have not debated the fundamental plan with  the prime minister yet.    [Skowronski] What about relations with Aleksander  Kwasniewski?    [Oleksy] I have been debating all kinds of plans with him --  both fundamental plans and also the less important ones, and  even additional or complementary ones, but we have not finished  the overall debate yet.    [Skowronski] Why did Aleksander Kwasniewski not make a  speech during the recent Sejm debate following the prime  minister's address?    [Oleksy] Because that was the first instance of the prime  minister deciding to make a speech in a kind of ad hoc manner,  and under that situation it was quite logical that the time for  debate and discussion should be given primarily to the  opposition. After all, what could a speech made by a member of  a coalition party contain? Of course it would be praising what  the prime minister said. I even thought it would be quite  logical not to have any governing party speak out then, after  the prime minister's speech. Yes, a Polish Peasant Party  representative did speak out, and Kwasniewski did not. It is  not the end of the world.    [Skowronski] What was the happiest day in 1993 for you, Mr.  Speaker?    [Oleksy] Definitely 19 September.    [Skowronski] Why is that?    [Oleksy] Because a lot of psychological burden was taken off  my chest at that point, which I had had inside of me before  then, as it turned out, and I was not even conscious of that  burden. The election results took that burden off me and  allowed me to breathe with relief again when I realized that if  you act according to rules of honesty and persistence in a  democracy, it must bring positive results sooner or later.    [Skowronski] Is a man who is speaker of the Sejm a happy  man?    [Oleksy] It is a hard and dangerous thing to speak of  happiness with regard to politics. My job is first of all about  work and service -- that is the way I see it and I am not  looking for happiness in the job of Sejm speaker but in hard  work, and if work is a source of happiness -- which it is in  some cases -- then my answer is yes.    [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation.    [Oleksy] Thank you.    [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today has been Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The "Ilso" books  publishing house in Seoul has printed and distributed more than  2,800 copies of books of the northern half of the country,  according to a radio report from Seoul.    In September last year, this publishing house procured the  literary and art work "Smelters" and other books of the northern  half of the republic through a dissident academic organisation  and reprinted it.    Upset by this, the fascist clique reportedly detained Pak  Chi-kwan, chief editor of the house, on April 21 on charges of  violation of the notorious "National Security Law".</p>

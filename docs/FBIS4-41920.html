			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F> by Mikhail Rudkowski on 28 June; place not given -- recorded, in  Russian]    [Text] [Lukashenka] Today, escorted by official  bodyguards provided to me by the Internal Affairs Ministry and  accompanied by a motorcade, I went to my office at the House of  Government. At the entrance, I was met by a colonel and  lieutenant colonel. Having introduced themselves, they informed  me that Internal Affairs Minister Danko had left orders that I  not be allowed into the House of Government and my office. This  was a scandalous violation of the Constitution and our nation's  laws, [words indistinct] the law on the status of people's  deputy. I told them about this. Escorted by the group of  bodyguards officially assigned to me, as well as one unofficial  bodyguard, I entered the House of Government. At the first  guard post in the right wing, I was met by a group of militia  officers; at least they were in uniforms, and there were eight  of them. They tried to prevent me from entering the Council of  Ministers building. True, they did not touch me at this point;  they only formed a human wall to prevent my entering. Of  course, I went past them and approached People's Deputy Leonid  Sinitsyn, head of my staff. They grabbed him by the arm, but he  managed to break free. Professor [name indistinct], a member of  our group and architect of our program, who became indignant  over the entire incident, was also grabbed by the collar; they  started to push him out of the House of Government, regardless  of the fact that he had all the necessary official documents.  The bodyguards lagged behind me, but, nevertheless, we went  past the guards and up to the second floor and room 241, where  my office is located. There were two militia guards standing  there, while six others were running after me and shouting that  Danko had forbidden me to be in the building -- there were four  guards, plus the colonel and lieutenant colonel. I do not  remember their names now, but they are identified in my  complaint. Four of them seized me by the hands outside the  office, one kicked me, and another tore my jacket. They  scratched and hurt my hands. Well, naturally, I was forced to  open the door with the help of [name indistinct] and Sinitsyn.  We opened the door and entered the office. I do not know where  they went after that. Still, all the necessary documentation to  begin criminal proceedings against the men has been submitted to  [Prosecutor General] Shaladonaw. In fact, I think that they  have already instigated criminal proceedings and an examination  by the Prosecutor's Office is under way. Doctors were already  here and documented the injuries, as it should be, to avoid an  incident similar to what happened at Lyozna [where shots were  allegedly fired at a car carrying Lukashenka].    [Rudkowski] What would you like to say to your supporters?    [Lukashenka] I would like them to participate in the second  round of elections. This is the only thing I ask of them --  they should not waver. Later on, we will examine all the facts  and nuances. These people will have to explain their deeds. I  think there is no place for them to emigrate. Or, maybe, there  is some place. At any rate, this is a general [Danko] who wants  to get Lukashenka out of the way. That will not happen. The  people have seen a real chance these days, and they will not  lose this opportunity. I am very sure of that. I am supported  [by the people] today. I believe that there will be 300,000  people who will support me, and we will bring order to the  Republic of Belarus. Namely, constitutional order, legal order,  (?where) law will reign.</p>

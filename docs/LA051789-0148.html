			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECHS FREE HAVEL ON PROBATION  </P> <P> Playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best-known opposition activist, was  freed on probation today after serving half of an eight-month jail sentence on  protest-related charges.  </P> <P> Havel was arrested in January during a week of anti-government protests.  </P> <P> His imprisonment, widely condemned in the West as well as by intellectuals in  Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, marked the start of a new crackdown on  dissent by Czechoslovak authorities. Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders have  resisted the political reforms that are sweeping through much of the rest of  the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Havel, a co-founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement, may have been  released early to head off criticism at an international human rights  conference opening in Paris on May 30, opposition activists said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lidiya Surzhyk: "Is Kiev Under Occupation?"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to official  estimates, foreign citizens currently residing in Kiev include  1,100 individuals from Afghanistan and Pakistan, 1,000  individuals from Vietnam, and 139 individuals from Angola, who  came from Russia. Incidentally, one of them is sick with AIDS in  the hospital, but cannot be sent back home if only because no  one has $3,000 to pay for the trip.    The uncontrolled stay of foreigners in Kiev triggered an  outbreak of different "exotic" contagious diseases -- the last  thing that we need after the Chernobyl catastrophe. This year,  123 cases of malaria were reported in Kiev, compared to 9 in  1991. There is no need to emphasize what consequences this  might have for a city with 3 million inhabitants. In Kiev, 92  individuals were reported to have AIDS, of which 27 are Kiev  residents and the rest foreign citizens. [Shestomatoz], a  highly unusual disease in Ukraine, also appeared in the country.  The spread of skin and venereal diseases has recently grown at  a particularly alarming rate -- their number tripled over the  past 10 years. [passage omitted]</p>

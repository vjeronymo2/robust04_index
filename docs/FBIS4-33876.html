			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The defense of  former rebel [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front -- FMLN]  commander Joaquin Villalobos, charged with libel, today  presented in court an alleged CIA document confirming the  existence of death squads in El Salvador.    The documents, which were delivered Friday to the Eighth  Penal Court, prove the links of Salvadoran businessman Orlando  De Sola to the deaths squads, which were responsible for the  death last decade of hundreds of civilians.    De Sola sued Villalobos in November for libel, after the  former guerrilla assured the local press that the businessman  financed these paramilitary groups.    "It is an official CIA text," Attorney Felix Ulloa told the  press after delivering the document that makes up a package  [words indistinct] that the U.S. Government "declassified" in  November 1993.    Washington released the documents following the October 1993  murders of former rebel commanders Francisco Velis, Heleno  Castro, and two other high-ranking leaders of the current FMLN  political party.    Ulloa has assured that the text states "that Orlando De Sola  is linked with isolated groups of Salvadorans in Miami, Florida,  which finance the death squads."    According to the Truth Commission -- in charge of  investigating violations of human rights during the civil war  that the country underwent for nearly 12 years -- these groups  were financed by Salvadoran businessmen residing in Miami and  backed by the [Salvadoran] state.    The defense attorney requested the court to verify with the  U.S. Embassy in El Salvador the document's "authenticity."    "We believe that with what we have presented, Villalobos is  exonerated of whatever penal responsibility in the libel case  because this (the document) proves what he said," Ulloa said.    Rigoberto Chicas, secretary for the Eight Penal Court said  that the evidence supplied by Villalobos will be "examined and  appraised" by the authorities.    He announced that it is possible that the court may issue a  resolution by the end of June or beginning of July.</p>

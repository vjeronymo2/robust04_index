			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor of Economic Sciences Yuriy Brovka: </F> "They Say `Confederation' but Mean `Federation'"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As for the creation of a  confederation on the territory of the former USSR, in my  opinion, we missed that opportunity back in 1990-91. Currently,  we can only discuss a slow moving forward toward a confederation  based on CIS structures. Given favorable circumstances, this  goal can be achieved no earlier than 10 or 15 years from now.  However, everything will depend on how quickly the European  Union members adopt a similar path.    We can speak about a confederation on the territory of the  entire area of the former USSR, including some neighboring  states, however, the idea of a confederation of two entities --  Russia and Belarus -- is absolutely illusionary. Two states, so  different in size (correlation in the population is 15:1 and in  territory -- 70:1), cannot unite in one confederation, a union  of sovereign states, which foresees not only formal equality,  but equal rights in adopting decisions. The point is that the  confederation is built on the "dual key" principle. However,  will Russia agree that one Belarusian vote has the same power as  15 Russian votes? I am afraid that those, who insist on setting  up a confederation of two entities, understand this all too  well. They say "confederation" but mean a federation, with a  strong centripetal tendency. Well, two subjects will hardly  establish a federation. Do they mean a simple incorporation of  the Republic of Belarus into the Russian Federation with some  rights of "autonomy?" This danger exists, and our citizens  should realize that the status of a former autonomous republic  within Russia cannot be compared with the status of a republic  within the former USSR. Though my attitude toward relations  between the federal and republican organs in the former USSR is  overly critical, I have to admit that from a legal point of  view, all the republics were formally equal before the center of  the federation. This formal equality had, at least,  psychological significance and encouraged, to a certain degree,  the preservation of a specific amount of national culture, and  even some economic welfare. Nothing of this kind has ever been  noticed within the Russian Federation. Many of its bodies, even  until lately, were of a purely unitary nature. Currently, the  issue of the status of the national republics within the Russian  Federation remains very complicated, even regarding regions  where people with a high national awareness reside in close  quarters to one another. Until now, none of the former  "autonomies" failed to obtain guarantees from Moscow for an easy  withdrawal from the Russian Federation.    For Belarus, incorporation into the Russian Federation would  mean a national catastrophe. Short-term advantages arising from  this decision will destruct everything that identifies the  independence of Belarus. This will happen not due to the  imperial aggressiveness of the Russians, but due to the weakness  of the national awareness of Belarusians. Therefore, during the  upcoming elections for president and Supreme Soviet deputies,  Belarusians should be on the alert: What do the candidates  propose? Do they support Belarusian sovereignty?    All the remaining issues -- a degree of economic integration  with Russia, the attempts to achieve the status of a neutral  state, cooperation within the CIS security system, with NATO and  other defense unions, currency union with Russia and other CIS  states -- can be resolved by various means regarding the  difference in voters' opinions and different approaches to the  domestic and foreign situation. However, any program should  unequivocally provide for the state independence of Belarus.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Anti-`Government' Struggle in South Korea" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Some 1,000 students of  13 universities including Yonsei and Korea Universities in Seoul  staged a demonstration Wednesday demanding a stop to the  "civilian defence training," according to a radio report from  Seoul.    In a literature they said that "the `government' is now  trying to avoid the failure of its anti-popular policy by means  of increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula through a massive  anti-communist campaign." They branded the "training" as "one  defining fellow countrymen as the enemy" and strongly demanded  its stop.    On the 14th, 50 odd young people threw some 40 paint bottles  at a police booth near Kyongpuk National University in Taegu and  vanished after destroying its furniture.</p>

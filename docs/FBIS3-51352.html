			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chilean Ambassador to Peru Alejandro Magnet has told  COOPERATIVA that the Chilean-Peruvian talks on the Lima  Convention have been suspended.    [Begin recording] [Magnet] I cannot disclose anything  because  sessions are secret, it was the sessions of the...    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But did you submit a  report? Can you tell us about that?    [Magnet] I was invited to the session.    [Reporter] What is the current status of the agreements  between Chile and Peru on the Lima Convention?    [Magnet] The meetings have been suspended. A decision has  been made to wait. [end recording]    The ambassador said this after attending a meeting that was  presided over by Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma. The  talks on the Lima Convention were on the meeting's agenda.    The Lima Convention, which was signed on 11 May 1993, seeks  to resolve matters that are pending from the 1929 Treaty, and  includes the construction by Chile of facilities at the port of  Arica.    Chilean representatives at the talks (Luis Vinter) and  (Eduardo Biogrossi) read briefings during the closed-door  session. Members of the foreign affairs committee of the  Chamber of Deputies also attended. Committee Chairman Jorge  Pizarro said that the Chamber of Deputies agreed that the Lima  Convention must be ratified in its entirety, the way it was  approved by the Chilean Senate.    Deputy Teodoro Ribera commented on specific topics.    [Begin recording] [Ribera] We believe we should wait until  the El Chinchorro issue is resolved through one of the  agreements signed in Lima. If that cannot be implemented,  however, Chile should obviously resort to the powers granted by  the law and the Constitution to resolve Arica's urban problem.  The state should thus use its powers as it would with any  private party, be it an individual or a corporation.    [Unidentified reporter] Will the Chilean Government pay  compensation for the land that we have occupied in El Chinchorro.    [Ribera] Without doubt. We are not speaking here... [changes  pattern] Chile always pays compensation for expropriations. A  fair price that will be negotiated, and if there is no  agreement, the price will be decided by a judge.    It is not a matter of expropriating without paying  compensation. We will simply implement the powers granted to the  Revenue Department and to the Chilean State under Articles 19  and 24 of the Constitution, which establish expropriation for  reasons of public need. [end recording]    The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies  decided to suspend a visit to Lima to meet its Peruvian peers,  because of the recess in the Peruvian Constituent Congress.</p>

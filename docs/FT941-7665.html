			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / France maps out military strategy into next century: White paper aims to preserve public consensus on defence and quash any notion of a 'peace dividend' The French government pledged itself to an ambitious defence policy, working in greater co-operation with its European and Nato allies, in a white paper designed to map out French military strategy into the next century. The dual purpose of the long-awaited white paper, according to a senior defence official, was to preserve the French public consensus on defence in the uncertainties of the post cold war world, and to 'torpedo the idea that France can reap a peace divided'. It is designed to lay the ground for a framework law later this year on military spending in the 1995-2000 period. In their foreword to the white paper, Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said France should 'set an example to Europe' which, while preserving its Nato link to the US, 'could not leave its defence to others'. But both men were earlier drawn into a clash with their fellow conservative Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist mayor of Paris who at a meeting on Tuesday criticised the government for buckling under to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand's insistence that the white paper implicitly endorse his April 1992 freeze on French nuclear weapon tests in the south Pacific. The argument has injected further tension into the rivalry between Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur for the gaullist nomination in next year's presidential election. The white paper merely endorses the compromise between the Balladur government and Mr Mitterrand for a new programme of simulated nuclear tests. France, which alone among the principal western countries has actually increased its spending on military equipment slightly this year, 'must maintain its effort, says the white paper. In addition to keeping the country's nuclear deterrent, the white paper calls for improvements in French conventional forces in areas like intelligence-gathering, logisitics and air trans-port. The white paper stresses that Germany and Britain are France's key partners in a stronger common European defence, as set out in the Maastricht treaty, as well as in more industrial co-operation in arms manufacture. As for French forces, it says that France should be able to transport up to 130,000 men and their equipment to overseas trouble spots, keep a navy of 100 ships and an air force of 20 squadrons of aircraft.</p>

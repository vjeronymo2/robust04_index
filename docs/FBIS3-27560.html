Qiao made the remarks when meeting with visiting French  Senate President Rene Monory here today.    He said that though China's economy has developed rapidly  over the past years but an overall development requires the  efforts of several generations to come.    "So, we hope that France would be a very good partner in the  development of China's economy and the two countries would  strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields," said Qiao.    He noted that this year is the 30th anniversary of the  establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties, and generally  speaking, China and France have conducted effective cooperation  during the past 30 years, but there were also difficulties and  setbacks.    Now that the two countries have opened up a new page in  their  bilateral relations, Qiao Shi said, they should make concerted  efforts to promote the development of such relations.    Qiao expressed the belief that that monory's visit, which  precedes that to be made by French Prime Minister Balladur,  would play a good role in strengthening Sino-French  parliamentary relations and in the bilateral relations as a  whole.    Monory said that the purpose of his visit is to strengthen  mutual understanding and create a good atmosphere for Balladur's  coming visit to China.    He said that he hopes the difficult period in the bilateral  relations will come to an end soon and a harmonious atmosphere  would prevail.    He also hoped that bilateral cooperation in economy,  education, scientific research and other fields can be  strengthened, so as to ensure a good fresh start in the  bilateral relations.    The two sides exchanged views on international issues of  common concern.    After the meeting, Qiao and his wife Yu Wen hosted a banquet  in honor of the French guests.    Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  NPC, was present at the meeting and the banquet.    Monory and his party will leave here for Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

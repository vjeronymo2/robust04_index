			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Chums' and Fans' 'Precious' - Dance The first thing that needs to be said about Precious, which occupies The Place for the next ten days, is that it should carry a health warning. The accompaniment to this latest show by the Cholmondeleys and the Featherstonehaughs is provided by the optimistically titled Victims of Death (ah] if only . . . ), and it is a brutish din performed live and fearsomely loud under its creator, Steve Blake. Medical research in Sweden has shown that when noise reaches levels of discomfort to the ear, then permanent damage may ensue. The management of The Place would be well advised to reduce the racket, which is alarming and acutely unpleasant. My own ringing headache at the end of a tasteless and fatuous evening I attribute in part to this mindless thumping - 80 minutes without an interval - and in part to the grinding banality of the performance. These sibling troupes (the Chums all female; the Fans all male) are directed by Lea Anderson. Publicity puffs speak of Miss Anderson's 'wit', her power to be 'humanly observant' and 'poised and bright with finesse'. What Miss Anderson shows me is a movement language that smacks of some worthy university dance department where being 'different' is more important than either technique or range of experience. She has an ability to make small absurdist comments through gesture, with a reliance upon repetition as a choreographic tool; and an inability to sustain an idea on anything but the shortest breath. Her pieces are examples of the direst 'Yoof Culcher' in their cheap-jack means and minimally convincing dance. Her performers look physically uninteresting, and propose a dead-pan manner that accords well with the undistinguished things they are called upon to show us. Precious falls into four parts, and pretends to be about alchemy. The cast move from wearing unisex black outfits (Viva grunge) by way of evening dress (white for the men; red for the women) to gold kaftans. The activity on view I found less entertaining than watching a dripping tap. The only alchemy on view is Miss Anderson's talent for turning dross into more dross, whatever the costuming may proclaim. I note that this enterprise boasts Arts Council funding, GLA Funding, and support from Digital. Heads should roll. Any prospective viewer is advised to take ear-plugs.</p>

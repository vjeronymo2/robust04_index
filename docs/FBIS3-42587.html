			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Sinitskiy under rubric "Plans of Russian </F> Companies for 1994": "Rostelekom Receives Ministry of  Communications License"]    [Text]    [begin boxed item] The history of the Rostelekom [Russian  Telecommunications] open-type joint-stock company began with the  first Soviet joint-stock company Sovtelekom, which was  established in June 1990. Its main function was to coordinate  the activity of the Ministries of Communications of the Union  republics in the sphere of organization of intercity and  international communications. After the breakup of the USSR,  Sovtelekom was reorganized into Intertelekom, whose founders  remained the Ministries of Communications of the CIS countries.  However, Intertelekom did not last long--until the Minsk  conference of the heads of state of the CIS in December 1993.  The reason for its "demise" was the registration in September of  that same year of the joint-stock company Rostelekom, which the  Russian part of Intertelekom joined. In the words of Mr. Belov,  general director of the Rostelekom joint-stock company, the  three stages of the development of the company personify the old  Russian saying: "The first son is for God, the second is for the  Tsar, but the third is for my support." [end boxed item]    Yesterday in Moscow's President Hotel, Vladimir Bulgak,  minister of communications of the Russian Federation, awarded  the Rostelekom joint-stock company a license to provide  intercity and international communications services on the  territory of Russia. The baptism of the new enterprise, which  was registered in September of last year, was held in the  Uspenskaya Church of the Novodevichiy Monastery. Rostelekom  acquired priority right to the development of a digital  communications system in Russia.    In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the Ministry of Communications  preferred the Western path of development of the industry, in  which all the company operators that provide communications  services function on a commercial basis, and the ministry  retains for itself only regulatory functions. About 20  international operators are now functioning in Russia. In  addition, Rostelekom enjoys the obvious preference of the  Ministry of Communications. As Mr. Bulgak declared, "all flowers  should grow, but Rostelekom will be the main bunch of flowers in  the flower bed planted by the ministry." Thus, given sensible  protectionism on the part of the Ministry of Communications,  great prospects obviously await it.    It would be possible to bring the Russian communications  system up to the world level by means of a gradual replacement  of the existing analog network by a modern digital network;  however, in the words of Mr. Bulgak, the construction of a  parallel digital network will be cheaper by a factor of four to  five. In the first stage of the creation of a modern Russian  digital system of international communications, Rostelekom in  April 1993 built its western Moscow-St. Petersburg-Copenhagen  sector. As Rostelekom's General Director Oleg Belov reported,  the joint-stock company is now performing work on the eastern  and southern sectors of this system. To complete the eastern  project by the end of 1994, which includes the construction of a  Russia-Japan-Korea submarine fiber-optic cable line, a main  Nakhodka-Khabarovsk line, and an international telephone station  in Khabarovsk will require more than $50 million and 30 billion  rubles [R]. The southern project will connect the fiber-optic  lines of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Italy (the volume of  investments will total about $50 million and R70 billion). The  establishment of the Moscow-Khabarovsk digital line will unite  the western, eastern, and southern sectors, and will guarantee  the receipt of income from the international traffic between  Europe and Asia. The construction of this line will cost $220  million and R125 billion. It is planned to complete all projects  in 1996. In addition, for the general "digitization" of Russia,  the Rostelekom joint-stock company plans to build 50 new  international stations and 50,000 kilometers of digital  fiber-optic and radio relay lines starting in 1995. This  project, which has been given the name "50 x 50" is calculated  for 10 years and will require $15 billion and no less an amount  of rubles. In the words of Mr. Bulgak, the joint-stock company  is the structure that is capable of attracting such resources,  inasmuch as no one will invest in a state company other than,  perhaps, the government.    After the presentation in the President Hotel, its  participants (including guests from 27 foreign firms) set off  for Uspenskaya Church where a church service was held in honor  of Rostelekom's being granted a license. It is possible that  this is tied in with the date of the event--13 January--although  the license itself absolutely fortuitously has the lucky number  777.</p>

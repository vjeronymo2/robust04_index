			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Angolan Government has offered 16 percent of  police posts to the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA], but the latter feels it is too little and wants  40 percent. A source monitoring the Lusaka talks told the  Portuguese news agency, LUSA, that UNITA has questioned the  government's failure to specifically state what posts will be  filled by UNITA members. UNITA wants to know how many generals,  captains, and agents will form part of the police, and what  percentage of each of those posts will be accorded to the  organization.</p>

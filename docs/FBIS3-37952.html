			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Poland and Latvia have similar views on issues most  important to both countries. This was stated at a news  conference of the Polish and Latvian presidents in Riga.    According to President Guntis Ulmanis, Poland as the largest  country in the region could become a guarantor for the unity of  the Baltic states. Imperial voices in Russia pose a real  threat, it was said at the conference.    Asked to comment on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev's  statement that the states of Central Europe should consider  their aspirations toward NATO, Lech Walesa replied: We have  already done that. I suggest Kozyrev should consider it and not  hamper our intentions.    According to Walesa the West does not know about a large  concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. One has  to ask publicly, what purpose is it serving, how much does it  cost and who is threatened by it.    During his visit to Riga, President Walesa today visited the  Latvian Saeima and met its speaker. He also continued talks  with the Latvian president and met Latvian defense and foreign  affairs ministers.</p>

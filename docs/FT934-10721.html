			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Economic indicators point to rising domestic demand Recent economic indicators point to rising domestic demand with low inflationary pressures, the Treasury reported yesterday. However, a drop in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index of economic activity, also announced yesterday, could signal a downturn in output about a year from now. A favourable short-term outlook for the UK was confirmed by the CSO's shorter leading index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points in activity around five months in advance. This sustained an advance which began last autumn, rising 0.8 per cent to 109.1 last month. The longer leading index, which is designed to highlight turning points in the economy 13 months in advance, has declined since a recent high in March, reflecting negative contributions from most of its components since the Spring. However, the CSO warned that the data used to compile the latest index was not complete.</p>

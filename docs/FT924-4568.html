			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Jordan's fledgling democracy takes wing: Fundamentalists to exert big influence in new parliament JORDAN's 80-member lower house of parliament reconvened yesterday, effectively marking the start of a four-month campaign for next year's multi-party general elections, the first since 1956. The parliament was elected three years ago in the first poll since 1967 but candidates were not allowed to organise themselves into political parties. Now, with a question mark hanging over the health of King Hussein, who says he is committed to democracy, the power struggle between government and parliament, and factions within the house, is expected to be intense, with parliamentarians determined to achieve a real share of power. Some of the more contentious issues likely to be debated are the Middle East peace process, a law banning alcohol, and amendments to the controversial state security court law, used while parliament was in recess to try two MPs for treason. Moreover, with the recent legalisation of political parties, the session will provide the last chance for MPs to forge a cohesive opposition to Moslem fundamentalists who form the house's largest bloc, of 30 seats, and have made significant gains in local council elections. For most MPs, yesterday's inauguration ceremony and king's speech could not have come soon enough. The extraordinary security court trial of two deputies accused of plotting to overthrow the king with the intent of creating an Islamic state, remains firmly fixed in their minds. The case was seen by many as an attempt by certain circles in government to clip the wings of Jordan's democracy, and many MPs privately consider the case against the two MPs to have been contrived. Although King Hussein succeeded in diffusing tension between parliament and government by granting an amnesty to the two MPs, whom the court found guilty and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour, the effect of the trial on on MPs will be the most closely-watched test of the next session. One of the two accused, Mr Leith Shbeilat, who was more vocal than most MPs in his pursuit of government corruption and democratic change before the trial, almost decided to abandon his political career. Potentially, the most damaging issue for the government will be a debate on the peace process. With nearly half the house, fundamentalists and leftist groups, fervently against the talks, many believe that a motion of no confidence in the cabinet is inevitable. Parliament cannot prevent the government from conducting the negotiations, but such a motion would be destabilising, especially as the king has committed himself to the talks. The crunch, however, would come if an agreement with Israel were to materialise, since this would need parliament's endorsement. According to one Moslem MP, parliament would reject a peace accord. Another stormy issue, already scheduled for debate, is a draft law proposed by the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. As one parliamentarian said: 'The Islamicists know that just as it is difficult for any MP to vote for peace as Arabs, they are unable to vote for alcohol as Moslems. They would never be re-elected.' The strength of the fundamentalist bloc in parliament and the wave of fundamentalism which is influencing local as well as national centres of power through the ballot box is causing growing concern to the government. Islamic groups are the most organised and active popular political forces in Jordan, and their opponents fear that they will benefit substantially in next year's election from the shifting alliances and factionalism which characterises other groups. For this reason, and given the ripples felt within Jordan's government from this year's aborted Algerian election, some government sources consider that the election, due in November, may be postponed to allow infant political parties more time to organise - a move which lies within the powers of the King.</p>

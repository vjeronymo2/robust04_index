			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Nun: "Gaza-Jericho: Implementation Agreement </F> May Be Signed Tomorrow"]    [Excerpt] London, Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Today, Monday, the  Palestinian leadership is waiting to hear about the Israeli  Government's position on the outstanding points concerning  implementation of Security Council Resolution 904 on Hebron  security arrangements, which were not settled at last week's  negotiations in Cairo between the Palestinian delegation, headed  by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, and the Israeli delegation, headed by  General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff.    Sha'th told AL-HAYAH over the telephone yesterday that the  Israeli response "which we might receive from Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's office by fax or phone will deal with two  fundamental points: first, the number of Palestinian police  elements, their weapons, and their authority. Second, the  number of international observers and their nationalities. If  we get something that satisfies us, the agreement will be signed  tomorrow, Tuesday, in Cairo, and a timetable will be drawn up  immediately to implement this agreement, then we will move to  complete the negotiations concerning Gaza and Jericho."    He pointed out that "utmost precedence is at present given  to  security arrangements to Hebron. We will not complete the talks  on Gaza and Jericho before we finish with this issue. And if  Rabin is expecting us to begin the self-rule negotiations  tomorrow, it means that he is going to offer us a satisfactory  reply on Hebron today."    He pointed out that Israel "is agreeing -- in principle --  for the first time to implement a Security Council resolution,  even though some of the details have not yet been completed."  He ruled out a meeting between President Yasir 'Arafat and  Rabin "at present." However, he said that this will be on the  cards "when we reach an agreement on all outstanding points."    Well-informed Palestinian sources in Tunis have told  AL-HAYAH  that the PLO is demanding the participation of U.S., Russian,  and Egyptian elements alongside the Norwegian elements in the  provisional international observation force in Hebron, while  Israel offers to accept only 20 Norwegian observers armed with  pistols together with 30 elements from the International Red  Cross Committee and 50 elements from the Palestinian police.  The sources say that Israel wants the occupation authorities to  be the authority to which the Palestinian police should refer,  and it refuses to allow the international observation force to  report to the cosponsors of the peace process, that is  Washington and Moscow -- which is unacceptable to the PLO, which  for its part believes that any effective foreign measures in  Hebron require "hundreds of international observers, Palestinian  police elements, and an international authority that guarantees  implementation of Resolution 904 and hence a nonrepetition of  the attacks on the people of the city."    The sources ruled out the possibility that the differences  between the two sides in this connection will be settled "today  or tomorrow." They believe that "this may require a meeting in  Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin before any measure is  implemented, whether with regard to Hebron, Gaza, or Jericho."    The sources confirmed reports released over the past two  days  by more than one Israeli and U.S. official regarding the entry  of Palestinian units into Gaza and Jericho "within days." They  said that Israel has informed the PLO of its willingness to  "immediately hand over to it the points the Israeli Army has  evacuated in Gaza and Jericho. This could take place within 10  days. Thus it can be said that the implementation of some  aspects of self-rule will begin before 13 April." [passage  omitted]</p>

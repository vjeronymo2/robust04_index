			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE ASKS FOR TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON LOPEZ CANYON  </P> <P> State officials Tuesday rejected as too lenient a Los Angeles County order  restricting use of Lopez Canyon Landfill, owned by the city of Los Angeles, and  asked the county to draft a tougher version by the end of the day today.  </P> <P> "We didn't feel that it did what we asked them to do," said Chris Peck,  spokesman for the California Waste Management Board.  </P> <P> The county Department of Health Services acts as the state's enforcement agency  for Lopez Canyon Landfill, located above Lake View Terrace in the northeast San  Fernando Valley. As the only Los Angeles city-owned dump, Lopez Canyon receives  about two-thirds of the city's residential trash. City officials say closing it  will hasten a trash-disposal crisis.  </P> <P> Edward Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, said he was  concerned about the state's response to the county order. Avila described the  county order as "at least fair" and said the state's proposed changes could  make it more difficult for the city to comply.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Questions  </P> <P> William Pellman, senior assistant county counsel, said the county may not  legally be able to alter an order it already has issued. Pellman said attorneys  would review the state request today.  </P> <P> At the request of the state board, the county issued an order Friday offering  the city three options: Close the dump immediately, submit a plan to comply  within 60 days with stringent state restrictions based on a 1978 permit, or  apply for a new permit.  </P> <P> What bothers the state is a provision in the county order that allowed the city  to rely, while it applied for a new permit, on operating guidelines contained  in a 1983 engineering report, Peck said. On July 7, the state had asked the  county to issue an order forcing the dump to return to a level of operations  agreed to when the 1978 permit was issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Order  </P> <P> Tuesday's request asked the county to agree by tonight to issue a new order by  Friday imposing that restriction.  </P> <P> Disagreement over which document -- 1983 or 1978 -- is valid forms the crux of  the city's legal challenge to the state order, which continues at a hearing  Aug. 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court. The city maintains that the later report  automatically became part of its permit.  </P> <P> "We operated under the 1983 requirements for six years and nobody said a  thing," Avila said.  </P> <P> The key differences between the two documents are restrictions on landfill  elevation, circumference and on the number of trucks that can dump there daily.  </P> <P> The 1978 permit included a reference to a 1977 engineering report that limited  the landfill to a 1,725-foot elevation -- 35 feet lower than it is now -- and  said it could accept trash from only 400 trucks a day. Recent logs indicate  that as many as 600 trucks dump there daily. The original permit also  restricted dumping to a 140-acre area of the 392-acre site, but the city has  dumped outside that area in several locations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full in a Year  </P> <P> The city has said that if the restrictions of 1978 are reimposed, the dump will  be declared full within a year and will have to close. The height limit is the  most difficult to meet, Avila said.  </P> <P> Charles Coffee, who oversees the dump as director of the county's Solid Waste  Management Program, said the state's proposed change in the order does not  appear unreasonable.  </P> <P> However, Coffee said he would have to discuss it with attorneys from the county  counsel's office, who helped draft the Friday order.  </P></p>

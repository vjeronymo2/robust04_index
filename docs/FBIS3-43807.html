Welcoming him, President Moi noted that the friendship between  the two countries goes back to 1963 when Kenya became  independent. He thanked the Chinese Government for undertaking  important development projects in Kenya, citing the Kasarani  sports complex as a monument of the cooperation between the two  countries. Noting that China played an important role in the  economic life of Kenyans, President Moi urged Chinese  entrepreneurs to invest more in Kenya.    On recent economic and political reforms, President Moi said  Kenya had undergone a very difficult time as the changes were  not only new but incomprehensible to the people. He said he  admired the Chinese policies because they were determined by and  formulated to respond to the wishes of the people and obtaining  local situations. His Excellency the president said although  Kenyan communities were not yet cohesive, the government was  working hard to unite the people. He said it was good to have a  friend like China who understood Kenya's viewpoint in the light  of the prevailing political and economic situation.    On the recent East Africa cooperation treaty President Moi  noted that the region had over 70 million people which he said  was a vast market for investors. He pointed out that market  opportunities are made even more bright considering the  preferential trade area. President Moi briefed the Chinese vice  premier on the efforts to resolve conflicts in the region and  especially in the Sudan whose peace initiative committee he  chairs.    Mr. Qichen congratulated President Moi for the 1992  successful general elections and also for his victory in the  presidential race. The vice premier said China admired President  Moi's role in promoting peace and stability in the region. He  also said the good relations existing between the two countries  formed a good basis for stronger political and economic  cooperation. Mr. Qichen said for the last 15 years China had  undergone a tremendous economic transformation after opening up  to the outside world.    Later, President Moi received the spiritual leader of Coptic  Orthodox Church, Pope Shenouda III. Pope Shenouda, who last  visited Kenya 15 years ago, said he had been impressed by the  country's development, especially through the spirit of  harambee. [passage omitted]</p>

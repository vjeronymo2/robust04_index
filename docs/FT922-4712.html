			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Unilever announces review to improve head office operations UNILEVER, the multi-national consumer products group, yesterday told its 1,800 head office staff of an extensive review of the corporate centre's workings. The review is expected to lead to job losses, although the company said yesterday it was too early to say how many or in which areas. The group divides its head office between London, with 1,200 people, and Rotterdam, where 600 are employed. Both offices will be maintained, Unilever said. It added that the process was not merely a cost-cutting exercise. The aim was to ensure that the head office was providing essential services to the operating units in the most cost effective way. The head office would be adapted to provide direction to the businesses into the next century, the group said. The review follows the succession of Mr Michael Perry to co-chairman last month, following the retirement of Sir Michael Angus. It also follows changes within many of the group's operations, such as the rationalisation of the European food business in preparation for the single market, and the unification of some of the detergent operations which had been organised on a national basis. The group has already decided to concentrate on four main areas - food, personal products such as toothpaste and shampoo, detergents, and speciality chemicals. It wants to look at each area on a more international basis. Each department in the head office will make proposals for its future organisation. These recommendations are expected to be completed by the year end and after consultations, implementation should begin early next year, although it will be carried out department by department.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (5): Huge demand expected on route to market economy / Exploring opportunities in eastern Europe ONE OF the great ironies of the European packaging industry is that, while the western half of the continent seeks anxiously ways to restrict what it produces, the eastern half tries desperately to raise its levels of production. East of the Elbe river, concerns about the environmental impact of packaging are submerged by the desire to achieve an acceptable standard of living. Packaging clearly plays a pivotal role in the process. Under the direction of communist planners, the packaging industries of eastern Europe generally suffered chronic under-investment and failed to provide adequate delivery systems for food and consumer products. An Economist Intelligence report on the market, prepared by the Budapest-based Echo consultancy, says investment was based largely on the 'residue principle': investment in packaging had a low priority. This resulted in severe under-development of machinery and infrastructure, leading to an appalling waste of resources. Estimates vary, but the EIU suggests the former Soviet Union squandered about a quarter of its food production because packaging was poor or non-existent. The sector has been targeted as an area of strategic importance by national governments and investing institutions from the west, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). They argue that good quality packaging will not only improve living standards within these countries, but will also facilitate the export of goods, enabling manufacturing companies to earn hard currency, vital for buying western capital plant to upgrade the manufacturing base. It is difficult for a capitalist system to flourish in the absence of capital, but even modest investments can yield huge benefits by reducing wastage. Visitors to the Ukraine tell how the roads are covered with golden wheat at harvest time, because it blows off lorries for lack of tarpaulins. A western project to provide plastic bags for Moscow has ensured lower wastage in transporting bread and lengthened its shelf-life. Given the vast scale of the challenges, it is all too easy to be pessimistic; but, conversely, the packaging industry's past neglect also creates great opportunities for future long-term development. As the countries of eastern Europe grope towards fully-functioning market economies, there is likely to be a phenomenal demand for packaging products  -outstripping growth in almost all other areas of the world. However, the instability caused by the collapse of Soviet markets, which were of crucial importance to many central European industries, may at least temporarily check the process. Marketpower, a UK research company, estimates that between 1990 and 1995 the value of packaging in the region will rise from Ecu37.8bn to Ecu74bn. The former East Germany will demonstrate the fastest growth at 18.6 per cent a year, it suggests, followed by the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland at about 14 per cent. This pattern of growth will seemingly break the truism of development in most industrialised economies where the rate of growth in packaging has simply mirrored the trend in gross domestic product. But although the overall market may increase significantly, individual segments are likely to perform very differently. The Marketpower study suggests that PVC and paper packaging products will decline in usage and tinplate, cartonboard, glass jars and polypropylene will show very little real growth. It suggests the fastest growing materials are likely to be be PET, cans, polyethylene, aluminium and corrugated materials. There are good opportunities for native and foreign enterprises to exploit these market opportunities. Western companies such as Huntsman, the US chemicals and plastic packaging company, and Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval, the Swedish liquid packaging and processing group, are already carving out significant shares of their chosen markets. Environmental concerns are acute in many countries in the region but, sadly, it is all too likely they will take a back seat in the dash for economic growth - confirming the belief that environmentalism is largely the prerogative of the affluent. However, the industries in some central European countries, and in particular, Hungary, are at a more advanced stage of evolution and provide greater hope. Earlier this year, Mr Gyorgy Viszkei, secretary-general of the Hungarian Association of Packaging and Materials Handling, told a Financial Times packaging conference that his government intended to introduce legislation to harmonise its environmental packaging policies with European Commission regulations within the next two to three years. He accepted, however, that the country would face an uphill struggle to implement such plans: Hungary had previously made no provision for collecting or recycling household waste and largely lacked the means to finance cost-intensive environmental investments. But an example of what it is possible to achieve is the success of Petofi Nyomda Rt, a Hungarian packaging and printing company, which received the first industrial loan from the EBRD last year. Petofi, in which the Italian industrialist Carlo De Benedetti has a controlling interest, is not only helping to develop the Hungarian industry but is also earning valuable foreign currency by manufacturing products for western companies in Germany and Austria, such as Marlboro cigarette cartons, MacDonald's French fry holders, Henkel detergent boxes and Mars candy wrappers. Last year, the company increased turnover by a quarter to the equivalent of Dollars 40m (Pounds 21.8m), about half of which is accounted for by exports. Eastern Europe will need many other such packaging companies if it is to create viable economies. 'A major reason why the previous political systems lost the support of the people was that they were unable to achieve economic success. It would entail consequences that are difficult to foresee if the functioning of market economies resulted in similar experiences,' says Mr Viszkei.</p>

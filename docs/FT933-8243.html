			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Observer: Haggle time Hard to believe that with the stock market flirting with its all-time high there are still some investment analysts who can't afford their subs. However, the Institute of Investment Management and Research, which represents Britain's 3,100 investment analysts, likes to think of itself as a caring organisation. Hence, it has asked members not currently employed to send a letter 'explaining their circumstances', and it will consider deferring payment of its Pounds 81 a year subscription fee. The society insists that this generous gesture is in no way related to the fact that it has just raised membership fees by 8 per cent.</p>

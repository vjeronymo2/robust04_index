			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Tokyo SE slide slows activity in in region THE chronic weakness of the Japanese stock market is dragging down other south-east Asian markets, hindering new equity offerings. Japanese investors, who had proved a mainstay, are scarce. However, dealers said US fund managers were showing increasing interest. China Steel's Dollars 400m offering of global depositary receipts, the first Taiwanese deal this year, could be rather large for the market to digest, according to some traders. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch the deal. Offerings of around Dollars 100m each are scheduled for President Enterprises via Credit Suisse First Boston, and for Asia Cement via Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics, the first Korean issuer to tap the market this year, has tested the water for a series of Korean issues in the next few months. The reception of Samsung's Dollars 100m convertible bond offering, launched on Tuesday, suggests terms for future issuers will also have to be enhanced. The deal was originally planned to total Dollars 150m, with a 3 1/2 per cent coupon, a premium of 10 to 16 per cent, and a yield to put of  1/8 to  3/8 point above the five-year Treasury. After initial marketing, the size of the issue was cut, the coupon was indicated at 3 1/2 -3 3/4 per cent, and the premium at 7-10 per cent. The yield to put was increased to  1/2 - 3/4 point above the five-year Treasury. 'Bonds are being sold, but it is not a hot deal,' said one banker associated with the transaction. However, Merrill Lynch said the deal was oversubscribed. Korea opened its stock market to foreign investors this year. The convertible bond market, which was dominated by equity investors, has suffered as a result.</p>

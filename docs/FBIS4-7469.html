			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President of the Republic Sali Berisha by </F> Vjollca Vokshi; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Vokshi] What are the conclusions of President  Berisha on his visit to Great Britain?    [Berisha] [passage omitted] I would say there were three  main themes of the talks. First, we discussed bilateral  relations between Albania and Great Britain. In the talks that  I held there, I pointed out all the developments in Albania and,  what pleased me the most, was the knowledge that my  interlocutors had about Albania and their assessment about the  great changes that Albania has achieved in two years on the  democratic road.    What seemed important to me, and it is extremely important,  was the complete predisposition I found in top British officials  to encourage further cooperation between both countries. For  this, I got assurances from Prime Minister Major, her majesty  the queen, and Secretary of State Douglas Hurd. I think that in  this spirit, the signing of four agreements on the last day of  my visit undoubtedly marks an important event in cooperation  between Albania and Great Britain. I would like to stress that  all the talks and meetings that I held were open, kind, and  friendly.    Another very important theme was the Albanian question, the  crisis in the region, and the Albanian issue. [sentence as  heard] In the talks, I stressed that the Albanian question is  the main question in the Balkan crisis. It is true that war is  being waged in Bosnia today and this constitutes a sharper phase  of the Balkan crisis. However, the most fundamental question is  the Albanian one, because Albanians are a nation divided in two  -- half live in Albania, while the other half in several states.  In this respect, there is no doubt that the most delicate point  of this question is Kosova. In general, this constitutes a very  serious issue.    I expressed my view that the Albanians are not seeking a  change of borders by force, but on the other hand Albanians will  react as a single nation toward every massacre or practice of  ethnic cleansing that anyone may undertake against them. I have  my doubts that that is possible, because as has been shown by  the developments of the two last years, Milosevic is practicing  and putting into practice the memorandum of the Academy of  Sciences of Serbia, according to whose map of Greater Serbia, 40  percent of non-Serbian peoples should be exterminated and  cleansed. Here I expressed Albania's readiness to make its own  contribution and assistance in resolving these problems through  dialogue. I pointed out that it is indispensable that a direct  dialogue between Chairman Rugova, a president elected through  the free vote of the people of Kosova, and Belgrade in the  presence of a third party is indispensable. I do not see this  as unfruitful if there exists the will on both sides.    I also stressed that it is necessary that the embargo be  related to the situation and the solution of the problem of  Kosova and that UN monitors be sent to Kosova, so as to monitor  and directly inform the UN Security Council about all the  progress, obstacles, and developments that are encountered on  the road to resolving this question.    I think that we achieved understanding in many directions. I  can say that the British Government is seriously worried about  the crisis in the region, and the situation and condition of the  Albanians in Kosova, and is committed to paying more attention  to them so as to resolve this problem gradually.    [Vokshi] Mr. President, in Great Britain you held talks with  many businessmen, the most famous in the British business world.  Did you see any concrete result, any concrete interest on the  part of British businessmen in these talks?    [Berisha] You are right. I did regard as very important and  I do consider very important the meetings that I held with  businessmen. What encouraged and pleased me very much was that  I found Prime Minister Major and Secretary of State Hurd very  determined to encourage British investors. For this aim, I held  a meeting at the Confederation of British Industry and presented  the great possibilities that Albania offers. Though a small  country to lokk at, in fact, at the investment level, Albania  should not be considered as such, as it is a country of great  possibilities, a country that achieves a 10-percent growth means  that it has a strong turnover and earnings and it is a country  where money is not lost. I think that the representatives of  major British industry got this message in full. [passage  omitted]    We discussed petroleum, airport supplies on the basis of a  contract signed with British Petroleum, tourism, chromium,  fishing, constructions, and other multiple fields, such as the  glass industry. I am convinced that British investors are  increasing their interest in Albania. The reform in Albania is  very encouraging for them. [passage omitted]    The third theme that I discussed extensively with high-level  British personalities was Albania's integration into European  structures and Europe. I assured my interlocutors that  Albania's great aim is its integration into Europe and that the  Albanian Government considers this not as an immediate process,  but as a process that will come, as an active process that comes  through Albania's dignified efficiency to become a member of  these institutions. Within this framework, we welcome the  Partnership for Peace. We also insist that the time is coming  to open negotiations for the association agreement into the  European Community, as well as to sign an agreement with the  Western European Union.    I can say that I found complete understanding among my  interlocutors and got their assurance that they will  unreservedly support Albania's integration into European  institutions.    To conclude, I can say that this visit was extremely  important and successful for us. I want to thank Prime Minister  Major heartily, her majesty the queen, Secretary of State  Douglas Hurd, and many other friends whom I met in Great Britain  and who showed a great interest both in the development of  relations between Albania and Great Britain and provided support  to Albania's integration into Europe and a solution to the  regional crisis.</p>

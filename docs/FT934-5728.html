			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Sharp rebuff for BJP in Indian polls Hindu militants, who last year unleashed civil unrest and political turmoil in India after storming the Ayodhya mosque, have suffered a serious setback in the most important polls held since the 1991 general election. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the radical Hindu opposition party whose supporters destroyed the mosque, saw a marked decline in its popularity in state elections. However, the ruling Congress (I) party failed to capitalise on the fading of the BJP's fortunes. Large numbers of voters in Uttar Pradesh, the heartland of north Indian politics and the most important state to go to the polls, deserted both major parties. Mr P Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, had pledged to put economic reform back at the top of the agenda following the polls. But the mixed results seem unlikely to inspire the government to tackle controversial problems - such as over-manning in the bureaucracy and in state-owned industries. Moreover, the prime minister could come under attack in his own party for its electoral performance. Nearly one third of Indian voters were given the opportunity to vote in six state elections in northern India. By last night, vote-counting was virtually complete in four states - Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and the city of Delhi. Counting is due to start tomorrow in Madhya Pradesh and in the small north-eastern state of Mizoram. Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were ruled by the BJP until their assemblies were suspended last year for allegedly encouraging the Ayodhya mosque's destruction. Congress has won Himachal Pradesh, a former stronghold, but the BJP seems likely to retain control of Rajasthan, though without an overall majority. In Uttar Pradesh, north India's political heartland, voters turned their backs in large numbers on both main parties and voted for the populist Samajawadi Janata Party and its allies, a grouping dominated by lower castes. Last night projections showed the BJP looked likely to win about 170 of the 425 Uttar Pradesh assembly seats, down from 221; the Samajawadi grouping was likely to secure about 180 and head an anti-BJP coalition government in the state. Congress, which once dominated Uttar Pradesh, was predicted to take less than 30 seats. In Delhi, where state elections were being held for the first time after 40 years of central government rule, the BJP won a clear majority. BJP officials claimed winning Delhi far outweighed losing Himachal Pradesh because of the capital's political importance. Congress officials said anti-BJP forces had gained ground in all the states which had previously experienced BJP government. Mr R L Bhatia, the deputy foreign minister, said: 'We have turned the tide against the BJP.' However, some Congress figures are unhappy with the party's electoral showing. In a letter to Mr Rao, Mr P R Kumaramangalam, a junior minister, urged the resignation of party officials responsible for the elections. 'The present collective leadership that manages the affairs of the party have failed the party and the people miserably,' wrote Mr Kumaramangalam.</p>

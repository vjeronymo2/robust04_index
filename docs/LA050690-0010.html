			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: WINTER OF DISCONTENT AT FOUR SEASONS  </P> <P> Joseph Seppi Renggli, who has been executive chef of New York's famed Four  Seasons -- one of the most famous and respected restaurants in the country --  for some 17 years, has been dismissed from his post.  </P> <P> Renggli, reached recently at his Upstate New York home, says simply, "From one  minute to the next, they told me they don't need me anymore."  </P> <P> According to some reports, he was to remain with the Four Seasons as a  consultant until the end of the year -- but, says Renggli, 'I left the  restaurant a month ago, and so far they haven't called me." Though he has  remained friendly with the establishment's proprietors, Tom Margattai and Paul  Kovi, Renggli adds, "I guess I couldn't get along with the younger group" --  presumably meaning manager Alex von Bidder and Grill manager Julian Niccolini.  </P> <P> The Swiss-born Renggli first came to the United States in 1966, to work for the  Restaurant Associates group -- which then owned the Four Seasons -- as chef at  the now-defunct Latin-American-themed Fonda del Sol. Now, he says, after a week  in May in New Orleans, cooking at a Cajun food festival with Paul Prudhomme, he  will go back to work for R.A. -- this time as executive chef for the American  Harvest and Sea Grill restaurants in Rockefeller Center. His replacement at the  Four Seasons is his longtime assistant, Christian (Hitch) Albin (also  Swiss-born), who formerly held the title of kitchen chef. Ironically, Albin's  own new assistant will be Stefano Battistini, who has been chef at the Sea  Grill.  </P> <P> Asked for a comment about Renggli's departure, Paul Kovi replies, "There's not  really much to add to the published reports. We have great respect for Seppi,  but the time came for the separation in a long marriage. Really, we just found  that we have to go in a different direction, in a different style." He adds,  though, that it was Renggli who first raised the possibility, about two years  ago, of partially retiring from the kitchen.  </P> <P> Shortly before Renggli's dismissal, critic Jane Freiman, reviewing the  restaurant in New York Newsday, had demoted it from three stars ("excellent")  to one ("good"). Though she quite rightly described Renggli as "one of the  first kitchen superstars," her review was otherwise filled with words like  sodden, flavorless, meager, greasy, hideously overcooked, and sickeningly sweet  -- and she concluded that the place was "a culinary legend that is running the  risk of becoming a myth." Some observers have suggested that this review was  the last straw, finally prompting Margattai and Kovi to give Renggli his  walking papers. "No," says Kovi, "that's not the way it happened. But the  article was basically a correct one."  </P> <P> WE'D RATHER BE EMPTY: Camelions proprietor Marsha Sands, her son Gene and  Provencal baker Maite Lombard have very quietly opened Pastis in Topanga. The  restaurant, now serving breakfast and dinner, features homemade breads and  pastries, assorted pastas, whole fish roasted Provencal-style in an open  fireplace, and other specialties of the south of France. Though Pastis is  already jammed with Topanga locals who have been watching the space for months  in anticipation, it is apparently attempting to keep a low profile. When one  Topanga resident called up to ask if the place was indeed in business, whoever  answered the phone replied, "Well, we're open but we'd really rather you didn't  come in yet." And Marsha Sands herself, taking such reticence one step further,  told this column flatly, a few days after Pastis opened, that it had not yet  opened.  </P> <P> SALT AND PEPPER: Some of the area's best chefs -- including Patrick Healy of  Champagne, Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken of City Restaurant and Border  Grill, Claude Segal of Ma Be, Michel Blanchet of L'Ermitage and Roland Gibert  of Tulipe -- get together with great California wineries such as Acacia, Stags  Leap, Vichon and Far Niente to cook up a benefit for the National Kidney  Foundation. The event is taking place today at the Westwood Marquis from 3 to 6  p.m. Tickets are $125 each. . . . Roy Yamaguchi, former chef at Los Angeles' Le  Gourmet and 385 North, and now owner-chef of Roy's restaurant in Honolulu, will  prepare a multi-course menu featuring Hawaiian products at Champagne in West  Los Angeles, this Tuesday, May 8. Price of the dinner is $42 to $52, depending  on main course. . . . The culinary arts department of Glendale Community  College hosts a fund-raising dinner to raise funds for the completion of its  new laboratory, May 18, at the school. Hugo Molina, executive chef of Parkway  Grill, is scheduled to cook a four-course dinner for the event. The price is  $60 per person, including wine and entertainment. . . . From Spain in West Los  Angeles now serves three-course dinners featuring the dishes of Spain's Catalan  region, Monday through Thursday evenings, for $19.95 each. . . . The Seventh  Street Bistro, downtown, has introduced an "American Bistro" menu at lunchtime  daily, featuring appetizer, main course, and dessert, plus a half-carafe of  wine, for $18.50 per person. . . . And Riccardo's Ristorante is new in Culver  City, serving "gourmet Italian/Continental cuisine."  </P></p>

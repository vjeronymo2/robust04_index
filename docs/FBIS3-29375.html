			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] On 16 February the Bangkok newspapers  THAI RAT and KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT publish editorials commenting on  the trade conflict between Japan and United States and the  possible impact on Thailand.    THAI RAT's 450-word editorial, on page 3, titled: "Keep a  Close Watch on Japan," says it is necessary for "the Thai  Government and the private sector to closely monitor  developments following the collapse of the U.S.-Japan trade  talks last week because they can have `considerable' impact on  the Thai economy in general."    The editorial says that the failure of the negotiations has  caused the yen's appreciation against the U.S. dollar.  "Consequently, Thailand is affected immediately in two ways.  First, it will have to pay more for raw materials and  semi-finished products imported from Japan. Second, the  exchange rate of the baht will rise and thus affect Thailand's  competitiveness in the international market."    The paper cites reports on Japan's move to open its market  for hundreds of countries with which it has been developing  trade surpluses in an attempt to prevent them from being  exploited by the United States. "We must closely monitor all  developments so that we can figure out what goods we can sell in  their market. Meanwhile, we must make the necessary  preparations to cope with the relocation of Japanese factories  to other countries. We have to attract them to our country."    "Labor costs in Thailand might be higher than those in  China,  Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, but that is not a problem  since labor forms only 22 percent of total production cost. We  have an open money market and telecommunications network that is  far superior to those of many other countries. If the state and  private sectors join hands, we will gain substantially."    KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2, titled:  "Beware, We Might Get It," cites reports from foreign news  agencies on U.S. President Clinton's pledge to impose sactions  against Japan in retaliation for the latter's refusal to  cooperate in solving the problem of the U.S. trade deficit. The  first retaliatory measure to be used by the United States is the  closure of its cellular phone markets. The editorial notes:  "Although the cellular phone is only a product, the closure of  the U.S. markets has psychological repercussions on U.S. trading  partners, including Thailand."    The paper notes: "President Bill Clinton said earlier he  would probably not take immediate retaliatory action against  Japan. Nobody knows why he changed his mind. Therefore, we  should try to find out why he changed his mind so fast."    The editorial assumes that the closure of the U.S. cellular  phone market is a warning to Japan that the United States takes  the trade deficit problem very seriously and proof of President  Clinton's decisiveness to the American people.    "As for Thailand, we must always remember that the United  States has been picking on us regarding its trade deficit.  Seemingly lenient, the United States is very strict with us on  violations of copyrights and other trade and service rights. We  are still in a dangerous position, watched closely by the United  States, and can also face trade retaliation.    "We cannot say that the United States will not do anything  against us. What the United States has done to Japan should  serve as a warning to all countries to not take advantage of or  cheat it. It is believed, however, that the United States will  use careful judgement before punishing any country, otherwise it  might cause excessive difficulties or a tense situation which  can trigger violent responses detrimental to the GATT endeavours  to eliminate tax barriers and other obstacles to strengthening  the international free trade system."</p>

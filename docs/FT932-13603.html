			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Steel shake-up delays move into chips KAWASAKI Steel, a leading Japanese steel producer, yesterday announced a restructuring plan that includes shedding 3,200 jobs during the next three years and the delaying of its drive into the semiconductor market. The rapid appreciation of the yen combined with the domestic economic downturn has forced Kawasaki to launch the cost-cutting drive, which is similar to those adopted by most Japanese steelmakers during the tough years of the mid-1980s. By March 1996, the company hopes to have only 14,800 workers, down from the present 18,000. Kawasaki does not plan to sack workers, but will introduce an early retirement scheme and not replace those who leave the company. Capital spending over the next three years has been cut to an annual Y45bn (Dollars 394.7m) from a previously-planned Y80bn, while a Y25bn semiconductor plant due to be constructed in 1995 has been delayed for at least a year, thwarting the company's ambition to become a leader in electronics. Like most other Japanese steelmakers, Kawasaki turned to the electronics industry in the mid-1980s in the belief that semiconductors would be the 'industrial rice' of the future, in the same way that steel was an industrial staple in the past. Steel demand has fallen in tandem with the downturn in the Japanese car, machinery and construction industries, and the pressure to shed staff and cut costs would be greater but for unexpectedly strong export orders from China, running at four times the levels of a year ago. For the year ended last month, Kawasaki expects sales of about Y1,100bn, down from Y1,208bn in the previous year, and a pre-tax profit of Y7.5bn, a fall of just over 80 per cent. Longer-term goals were also revised yesterday, with sales in the year ending March 1996 now forecast at Y1,400bn, compared to an earlier target of Y1,700bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand  National Assembly [TGNA], has said that those who have the power  to stop the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina but do not do so are  as responsible as those who actually perpetrate the massacre.    Cindoruk received Zarko Domljan, chairman of the Croatian  Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, and his delegation today.  Cindoruk stressed at the meeting that the Serbs will not escape  their destiny as the unjust party in history and in the eyes of  the world. A massacre of this nature in the middle of Europe  during a civilized age in history is unacceptable, he said,  adding that murdering defenseless people is also a bad example  for other parts of the world. The TGNA speaker asked: On the  eve of the 21st century, is Europe returning to its feudal  structure of the Middle Ages?    Cindoruk stressed that the United Nations and NATO failed to  display the required determination in the face of Serbian  aggression. Unless the attacks are stopped, he said, the  effectiveness of these organizations will be in doubt.    The TGNA speaker also said that the Serbian attacks violate  the Paris Charter and the Human Rights Declaration and strip  them of their importance. He added that the agreement between  the Croats and the Bosnians constitutes an important step toward  the solution of the problem by peaceful means.    In turn, Domljan said that the Croats have always maintained  that Bosnia-Herzegovina should have its independence and  territorial integrity. We are opposed to the forcible change of  borders or to the occupation of territory, he said.    Before meeting with Cindoruk, the Croatian parliamentary  delegation visited Erdal Inonu, chairman of the TGNA Foreign  Relations Committee, and Baki Tug, chairman of the TGNA National  Defense Committee.</p>

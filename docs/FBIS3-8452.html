			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] After yesterday's talks in  Bratislava with Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak,  senators of the Kingdom of Belgium who are here at his  invitation, visited southern Slovakia today. Peter Rohac has  more to say about their agenda today.    [Rohac] [passage omitted] Although both senators are experts  in defense and foreign policy, they also have great experience  in the working of autonomy and coexistence between citizens of  different ethnic backgrounds from their own country. [passage  omitted]    On the other hand, Peter (Baby), a deputy for the municipal  council, expressed the view that the local Hungarians, although  Slovak Republic citizens, belonged to the Hungarian nation,  which was artificially divided.    He alleged that the present Slovak state power was trying to  assimilate the Hungarians rather than integrate them into a  unified Slovak Republic. Our other state administration  representatives reacted against this opposition standpoint.  Senator Nestor Hubert Pecriaux, who is a member of the Council  of Europe, remarked that they knew about the Hungarian political  parties' complaints, but there was no need to dramatize the  ethnic minority problem. On the basis of their experience here  [in Slovakia], he thought that all who wanted to coexist could  prove that this was possible. It is apparently clear that all of  the European communities have a different approach to these  questions, and it is logical that everybody has the right to  organize himself according to how he feels, but, on one  condition, and that is that all voters and citizens are  satisfied.

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (4): A big trek to the US - Fund raising Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, tells an amusing story about fund raising in the US. Arriving at Madison, the capital of Wisconsin State, Smith and colleagues are searching in their bags for the address of the fund managers they are due to see that day, when the taxi driver interjects: 'I know where you are heading. This is Madison, Wisconsin. 'The only thing in town is the pension fund. If you are in there for less than an hour, you've had it, more than an hour and you are in with a chance.' Over the last 18 months, UK venture capital fund managers have been tripping over each other in some of the furthest flung corners of the US. From Wisconsin's pension fund in the north to the giant California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), corridors have echoed to the honeyed tones of salesmen trying to convince investors their track record is better than the next fund manager who will walk in through the door. Mostly, their efforts have been successful. In spite of clocking up many more air miles than they had wanted, Charterhouse Capital Partners, Candover, Schroder, Legal &amp; General and Morgan Grenfell have successfully raised more than Pounds 1bn of new capital this year, much of it from US investors. As Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover says, raising capital has taken a lot longer than for previous funds. Some smaller outlets may also have also been pleasantly surprised that, notwithstanding the additional effort, they have raised new funds. Eighteen months ago few in the industry would have bet on some of these funds raising much fresh capital. Their life raft has been the strong burst of flotations in the UK that began last year and transformed the performance of some funds that would otherwise have looked decidedly worse for wear. Unfortunately for venture capitalists who had hoped to spend less time travelling to raise funds, UK institutions' appetite has been dulled by the roller-coaster performance over the last five years. 'The underlying appetite is still there,' says one active UK investor in private equity funds. 'But there is a greater degree of cynicism about the claims of fund managers. I think that the proliferation of professional venture capital managers which we saw until four years ago won't recur for some time.' But the pilgrimage to the US is not driven only by the scarcity of capital elsewhere. Bob Johnston, president of Beacon Hill Financial, a Boston-based agency that specialises in raising funds, says there has been a steady growth in the number of investors interested in what used to be known as 'alternative investments.' These institutions - some of them big hitters such as Calpers with Dollars 80bn under management - are allocating fixed percentages of an increasing asset base to unquoted investments. 'What is attracting the US investors is the good news coming from the UK economy,' says Johnston. 'But there is a surprising amount being raised for MBOs.' The real newcomers are the state pension funds and increased activity by institutions like Harvard, Yale and the Andrew Mellon Foundation. Corporate pension funds first moved into overseas quoted investments in the mid-1980s, followed five years ago by the state pension funds. 'Now public pension funds are following corporate funds again,' says Johnston. 'That is why there is an increase in the amount of dollars available for unquoted investment.' This has led to another development. Many of these investors will only put large sums in venture capital funds. Investing in small amounts makes little sense for a group such as Calpers. As a result, more funds are being raised by fewer fund managers. The same phenomenon is apparent in the US market. Some observers say this concentration could increase competition for larger buy-out and late stage development capital deals, forcing down targeted returns, pushing up the amount of debt in each deal or both. Howard Cox, general partner at Greylock, the long established Boston-based venture capital firm, disagrees: 'If there is more money available, it can encourage opportunities, he says. 'The question is the quality of the deal flow.' Another dissenter is Alan Patricof, chairman of Patricof and Co, the US member of Apax Partners. He says there is no shortage of quality deals. 'The level of disbursements of venture capital funds has consistently run under or close to the amount of money raised,' Patricof says. For the fund raiser, however, one thing is certain. Fund managers will increasingly have to prove their track record or they will not get past the gatekeepers, the intermediaries who screen and rank the funds and their mangers for investing institutions. 'You really have to have a track record and it really has to check out,' says Robert Smith. 'Five years ago we were selling dreams and there was absolutely no track record. Now these gatekeepers really do know who we are and have comparative industry statistics for closed end funds.' Inevitably, the arrival of gatekeepers has increased the length of time  - and therefore the cost - of raising a fund. Johnston says it now takes up to a year, double what it took five years ago. 'They investigated investee companies, they looked at our performance numbers, our reference checks with banks and accountants,' says Stephen Curran, chief executive of Candover. For those funds who can show their quality, the US is likely to remain an attractive source of capital, as long as deal structures remain conservative. As the industry matures, however, managers with poorer performances will no longer be able to rely on a silver tongue and a winning smile. More visitors to Madison, Wisconsin, might consider keeping the taxi meter running - they could be out in 20 minutes and able to catch the same aeroplane out.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NADIA RECASTS HER FORMER PATRON AS A JAILER AND THIEF  </P> <P> Nadia Comaneci, the gymnastics darling of the 1976 Olympics, said the man who  helped her flee Romania last year, far from being her lover, kept her prisoner  in the United States, beat her regularly and cheated her of $150,000 in income.  </P> <P> Comaneci said the ordeal lasted three months and took her on a harrowing  journey through Florida, California, New York and Canada.  </P> <P> She said that shortly after arriving in the United States, she was locked in  hotel rooms and a Los Angeles apartment and was not even allowed to answer the  telephone.  </P> <P> Comaneci, 29, said Constantin Panait had taken her earnings from interviews and  magazine layouts and returned with his wife and children to his native Romania.  </P> <P> "I am not a scandal person," she said. "This is not my image."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has made an  appeal for national unity following the burial of President Ratu  Sir Penaina Ganilau. In a new year message, Mr. Rabuka said  Ratu Sir Penaina had always emphasized that Fiji's multiracial  population needed to live in peace and harmony. The body of  Ratu Sir Penaina, who died of cancer in the United Sates  hospital on 16 December, was taken back for burial to his home  island of Taveuni yesterday after lying in state at government  house in Suva.    Under Fiji's racially-biased 1990 constitution brought in by  Mr. Rabuka's government, indigenous Fijians are guaranteed 37 of  the 70 seats at parliament. Mr. Rabuka faces an election next  month after parliament failed to pass his government budget in  November.</p>

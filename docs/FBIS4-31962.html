			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Cvijetin Milivojevic: "With `the Front of </F> Peace' Against `the Coalition of War'"]    [Text] There is no doubt that one of the best informed men  in Yugoslavia, who is at the same time the host at the Palace of  the Federation, [Federal President] Mr. Zoran Lilic, thought  about Radovan Karadzic, Biljana Plavsic, Ratko Mladic, Vojislav  Seselj, Milan Babic, and perhaps about Vojislav Kostunica and  some other political leaders of the Serbs from Serbia,  Montenegro, and Bosnia, after he had been supported by Borislav  Mikelic, the Krajina prime minister.    The fact that the president of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia is virtually only the spokesman of those who  concentrated the real political power in their hands, is less  important than the fact that Zoran Lilic recently officially  proclaimed the things that had started several months ago.  Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president -- who forced himself  on the so-called international community as the only relevant  representatives of the Serbs and who is aware of the dark  economic future of Serbia should the sanctions last for "1,000  years" as he said himself -- was allegedly promised by the West  that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would quickly return to  the world if peace and a political solution were reached in  Bosnia.    According to this version, it is Milosevic's turn to make a  move now. He should, as quickly as possible, force the Bosnian  Serb leaders to agree to the 51 to 49 percent division of  Bosnia. In return, Serbia and Montenegro would gain the same  status in the international community as the other former  Yugoslav republics. Through the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  state of the Bosnian Serbs would be entitled to reconstruction  aid, just like the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia  would profit from the reconstruction aid, too, since it is  probable that there would be confederal connections between the  Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia. At the end of the peace agreement implementation  process, the Bosnian Serbs would be allowed to secede from the  Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- if they want to, naturally.    Since the initial idea about the political elimination of  Radovan Karadzic, as one of the impediments to this aim, has not  proved to be quite efficient, other options are being considered  now. One of them is that the president of the Srpska republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina cedes his unpleasant role of signing  agreements about the Serbian withdrawal from certain territories  to somebody else in order to retain the image he has in the  Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The other possibility is  to apply the model of Milan Babic's elimination from the leading  position and find a new leader. The options include Nenad  Kecmanovic, Nikola Koljevic, and some less-well-known people.  "Well-informed" sources even claim that the commander of the  army of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina [Ratko Mladic]  has been offered a high-ranking position in the Yugoslav Army if  he is ready to make compromises.    Naturally, all these ideas will not be activated if  Karadzic's negotiating team approves of the general model for  the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Official Belgrade would  compensate them for their approval by insisting that the Serbs  "get good territories," first of all the corridor along the Sava  River and a part of Sarajevo.    The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is now working on the  creation of the so-called big "coalition for peace," which  consists of the following parties, as we have learned so far:  the Socialist Party of Serbia, the Democratic Party of Serbia  [Depos], the Socialists of Montenegro, and the New Democracy.  In order to gain the favor of the West, the regime would  especially like the verbally most powerful opponent of the  Socialists, Mr. Vuk Draskovic, to enter the coalition. Dusan  Mihajlovic -- the new New Democracy leader, who is trying to  establish contacts between his coalition partners from the  republican government and his election partners from DEPOS --  has been assigned this task.    That this is not a joke has been confirmed by the event that  took place at a recent SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] Main  Committee session, in which Draskovic told his only remaining  vice chairman, Mr. Dragoslav Milacic, that he [Milacic] would  become federal minister. The SPO chairman is allegedly  interested in becoming ambassador to the United States, which is  the position also desired by Dragoljub Micunovic, the most  famous Democratic Party "dissident." According to reliable  sources, Vuk Draskovic was also very keen on entering the  government of national unity, so the present events can be  considered a continuation of the things that had already been  begun. The SPS has the newly established party of Slobodan  Rakitic in reserve, since the questionable DEPOS seats in the  Chamber of Citizens depend on the ruling coalition. Apart from  the use of force according to the principle "if you do not want,  Rakitic will take it," the SPS is also applying other  tried-and-tested measures, such as the activation of SPS  extended arms in the SPO.    If the SPO agrees with this proposal, the regime will  finally  isolate the Serbian Radical Party. The second candidate that  would remain outside the "national front" would be Kostunica's  Democratic Party of Serbia, and Djindjic could choose between  watching how his party opponents are favored and trying to reach  power himself.    The general pressure on the complete opposition, "which  should make the opposite become normal again," comes from clear  statements issued by the SPS that it will not organize early  elections, which would push the opposition "to the margin," as  Mirko Marjanovic would say. Four leading opposition leaders  claim that the opposition now only agrees about the name of  Radoman Bozovic, the radio-television, and the election system.  This is too little to be able to speak about an efficient  resistance to the intentions of the leading parties.    It is clear that the results of the latest differentiation  on  the Serbian political scene will depend primarily on the course  of the peace negotiations in Bosnia.</p>

It notes that the IAEA has  left a disgraceful stain on its name by launching an anti-DPRK  campaign, contrary to its competence and mission.    The article entitled "Indelible Stain and Disgrace" cites  facts to prove that some officials of the IAEA Secretariat took  a threatening posture from the very beginning in a bid to  overwhelm the DPRK and stubbornly demanded an unreasonable  "special inspection" and worked for an international "pressure  and sanctions", serving specific forces as their spy.    It says:    The IAEA made six ad hoc inspections of the DPRK from May  1992 to early February 1993.    At the time of the fourth ad hoc inspection in November 1992  some officials of the IAEA Secretariat urged the DPRK to  "declare more" of the inventory of nuclear material, threatening  that "it is the last chance of correcting the initial  inventory", "if the chance were missed, tragic consequences  would follow."    They behaved very insolently during the inspections,  threatening the DPRK over the "principal inconsistency" even  before hearing a scientific explanation from experts.    All this tells that they have sought from the very beginning  to overpower the DPRK with a threatening attitude.    Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat also served specific  forces as their spy.    The IAEA Secretariat, complying with the demand of specific  forces, tried to send as its inspectors those whom we considered  as personae non gratae. The agency's inspectors in the DPRK  also acted on orders from those behind the scene, making  inquiries into this or that in an effort to pry out secrets.    All the more exasperating was that they handed inspection  results over to the United States, South Korea and others in  violation of Article 5 of the safeguards agreement that provides  for protection of the data obtained in inspections.    This was a grave encroachment upon the interests of the  DPRK.    IAEA's inspections of the DPRK are characterized from a to z  by partiality.    On December 22, 1992, the IAEA general director requested  being allowed to "revisit" some military sites. The DPRK was  not obligated to show them the sites and facilities which were  no more objects of safeguards, but showed them, taking various  aspects into consideration. Nevertheless, some dishonest  officials worked hard to attain their sinister aim by abusing  the sincere cooperation offered by the DPRK.    The DPRK rejected it decisively.    On February 25, the IAEA general director convened a meeting  of the IAEA Board of Governors, which adopted a "resolution on  special inspection" of ordinary military sites of the DPRK.  This was something unprecedented in the history of inspections  by the agency.    And the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unjustifiable  "resolution" against the DPRK on June 10 when reactor core  refueling was under way at the DPRK's five megawatt experimental  atomic power plant.    The dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat took the  DPRK's "nuclear issue" even to the United Nations in an effort  to gratify their wicked aim by "internationalizing" it and  imposing collective "pressure and sanctions" on the DPRK.    The IAEA Board of Governors last year adopted one  "resolution" after another to transfer the DPRK's "nuclear  issue" to the UN and submitted even "an annual report" to the UN  General Assembly. They went the length of faking a "letter" of  the UN secretary-general.    Who can trust the IAEA which is behaving like this?    We will never tolerate any act of infringing upon our  national sovereignty and supreme interests of our country.    The IAEA must know clearly that whatever intrigue it may  hatch up to stifle the DPRK, it will only bring a stain and  disgrace to itself.</p>

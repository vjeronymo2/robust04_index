			<p>Computing   Project   <F P=102> BR3103093194 Breda TELECOMBRIEF in Dutch 11 Feb 94 p 35--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> BR3103093194 </F> <F P=104>  Breda TELECOMBRIEF </F> <F P=105>  Dutch </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Millions In Subsidies For New </F> Infotechnology"]    [Text] The Cabinet has decided to support the High  Performance Computing and Networking (HPCN) project with the sum  of 35 million Dutch guilders. HPCN looks at new information  technology for, among others, industrial, commercial and  scientific purposes. The project is researching into such  possibilities as fast processing of television images, quicker  processing by banks of payment requests, and an increase in  production quality, while machines will be controlled faster by  parallel processing (image processing and control).    It is expected that the use of HPCN will improve performance  in the field of information streams by a factor of 1,000. The  new technology could have great significance for the  reinforcement of both the knowledge infrastructure and the  economic structure. With HPCN, the processors do not work  sequentially -- as they do in traditional computers -- but  parallel. This requires a different hardware construction, the  peripheral equipment needs to be adapted, and other network  connections have to be used.  <H5>  HPCN Centers </H5>   The Interdepartmental Commission for Economic Structure  Support (ICES) has recommended the HPCN project for subsidies to  the ministries of Economic Affairs and of Education and Science.  ICES assumes that with this financial injection the Netherlands  can become one of the six future European HPCN centers.    Both commercial and scientific institutions have already  expressed their wish to collaborate on the development of HPCN.  ICES has, however, named as a specific condition for receipt of  subsidies the involvement in the project of medium-sized  enterprises and research institutions. Furthermore, no HPCN  institute will be created. The participants will set up an  R&amp;D  infrastructure, through which participants in the project can be  interconnected via networks.</p>

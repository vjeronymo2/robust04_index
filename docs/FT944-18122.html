			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Management: No need for excuses - Michael Hammer and Steven Stanton parry criticisms of re-engineering Suddenly, it is open season on re-engineering. While 18 months ago the term was known only to a handful of cognoscenti, today we are besieged by self-proclaimed 'experts' who busily assure all who will listen that re-engineering is too radical, insufficiently radical or nothing new. Many of these 'experts' do not know what re-engineering really is and have no first-hand experience of it. These critics are merely taking advantage of the fact that since the media are always hungry for controversy, a dissenting voice will usually attract attention. Since re-engineering has been phenomenally successful in many companies, and since the term has entered the general lexicon, asserting that it is bunk comes under the heading of man bites dog and may well get someone some notoriety. One give-away to the emptiness of such claims is that they are rarely substantiated by any specifics: no review of cases, extensive anecdotal experience or statistical data. In order to bolster their claims, however, some of the critics do slip in one bit of data: that re-engineering has a very high failure rate, often cited as 70 per cent. This 'fact', the critics claim, proves that re-engineering does not work. The use of this datum proves the critics' ignorance of re-engineering in two ways. First, we find it breathtaking when the 70 per cent figure is cited as an authoritative statement of re-engineering's successes and failures because we happen to know its source: one of us made it up. Obviously, the figure was not manufactured from the whole cloth, but was based on experience with companies attempting re-engineering. Nonetheless, it was only intended as a qualitative assessment. Moreover, that statement was made in late 1992 and its relevance in late 1994 is modest at best. Second, the statement was a descriptive assertion, not a predictive one. It merely observed that approximately 70 per cent of the re-engineering efforts that we had seen had not ended successfully. It implied nothing about the expected rate of success or failure of subsequent re-engineering efforts. To believe otherwise would be to believe that re-engineering's success rate is a matter of luck. Nothing could be further from the truth. Success or failure at re-engineering is determined by a company's understanding of it, the ability to execute it and the executives' commitment to it. Re-engineering has no natural failure rate. Those who do it right succeed; those who do not fail. In 1992, few companies knew what they were about and so re-engineering had a high mortality rate. Today there is little excuse. What then are the primary causes of re-engineering failure? They fall into two groups. The first we call failures of intellect, where a company simply does not know what it is doing. Enthusiasm and a desire for breakthrough results are not sufficient to yield re-engineering success. One has to know what one is about, and if one does not, one can expect problems. There are many traps into which companies unprepared for re-engineering and left to their own devices are likely to fall. One common error is expending too much time and energy on an analysis of the organisation's current operations. Since re-engineering entails discarding current process designs and starting again with a clean sheet of paper, virtually everything learned in such an exercise is destined for the rubbish heap. Those conducting such a study inevitably become captives of the existing way of doing things. After an extensive analysis, the old ways start to make sense to the analysts; they develop proprietary interest in the old processes; and their ability to think creatively is seriously and perhaps permanently impaired. In spite of its obvious dangers, it is easy to fall victim to the analysis temptation. Conducting an analysis is comfortable and postpones that fateful day when sweeping changes will have to be made. There are numerous other such re-engineering pitfalls, easy to fall into but also relatively easy to avoid: timidity in redesign, stretching out a re-engineering programme over a lengthy time frame, focusing on organisational units rather than on value-creating processes, and so on. Today, we have a substantial body of expertise about re-engineering so that companies that make these errors have only themselves to blame. Their failure is a commentary on their lack of preparation and experience rather than an indictment of re-engineering. However, re-engineering expertise is by itself not enough to guarantee success. Without committed executive leadership even the most intelligently planned re-engineering programme will fail. Re-engineering entails sweeping change to an organisation. When a company's operating procedures are rethought from the ground up, virtually every other aspect of the company is called into question: the content of people's jobs, the structure of the organisation, the mechanisms for reward and compensation, even the cultural norms that govern attitudes and behaviour. These must all be consistent with the ways in which the organisation's work is being performed, and changes in how the work is performed will be reflected in all these other arenas. Re-engineering therefore entails an unprecedented degree of organisational change. For that reason, we eschew the oft-used phrase 'business process re-engineering' (BPR), because it is too limiting, suggesting as it does that the process alone is the target of re-engineering. While re-engineering does begin with process redesign, it does not end there; the ripple effects are felt everywhere. Such mult-dimensional change can only be effected from the top of the organisation. Only senior executives have the authority to institute such changes: to reassign personnel, to recalibrate measurement and reward systems, to institute new organisational structures, and to compel the participation of those who might prefer to give the whole thing a miss. The other main cause of re-engineering failure is the absence of such executive leadership. Many executives claim they want the dramatic results that re-engineering promises but are unwilling to follow its consequences or are reluctant to pursue the effort with the vigour that it requires. Failures of intellect and character are encountered when an organisation has developed a superficial attachment to the concept of re-engineering but has not invested in the training needed to make it work and does not have the cadre of senior leaders needed to see it through. The failure of these companies is both predictable and avoidable, and says nothing about re-engineering itself. To paraphrase Shakespeare, 'the fault is not in re-engineering, but in ourselves'. Michael Hammer is a co-founder of the re-engineering movement; Steven Stanton is a re-engineering consultant with Hammer &amp; Co</p>

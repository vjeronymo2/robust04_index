			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Now we hear from Deputy Prime Minister Antonio  Maccanico, on why the elections were fixed for 27 March. He is  speaking to Sergio De Luca.    [Begin recording] [De Luca] March 27 -- a small concession  to  the Christian Democrat Party which wanted a little more time?    [Maccanico] Setting 27 March as the date of the election was  necessary. We could not go beyond that date because we would  have gone beyond the 70 days laid down by the constitution. We  could not bring the elections forward to the preceding Sunday,  20 March, because if we had we would not have had enough time to  fulfill our obligations before polling. I would like to remind  people that among these obligations is the one, for example, of  having to communicate to each and every Italian citizen the name  of their constituency.    [De Luca] Practicing Jews will not be able to vote [due to  Passover]. Could they take the matter to the Constitutional  Court or to the Regional Administrative Tribunal?    [Maccanico] I do not think that this will be possible. There  has been no violation of the law which enshrines the agreement  with Italy's Jewish community. There is no regulation within  that law which envisages a particular set of rules for general  elections. There is protection for the Sabbath, and there are  exceptions for safeguarding special services, but there are no  special rules regarding the constitutional life of the country.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The United Nations Is </F> Concerned That Czech Masks Might Be Used by the Croatian Army"]    [Text] Prague--The UN Sanctions Committee expressed its  concerns that the gas masks that the Zubri Rubber Works wanted  to export to Croatia could ultimately be used by the Army. The  Croatian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs stated in the  purchase request that most of the masks are intended for firemen  and a smaller number for the civilian population.    Dlouhy's Ministry of Industry and Trade originally consulted  on the sale with the Foreign Ministry, which, in turn, submitted  the request for assessment to the appropriate UN committee.  Acting on its recommendation, the License Administration of the  Ministry of Industry and Trade has not granted the Zubri Rubber  Works the required export license.    A diplomatic official who does not wish to be named for fear  of difficulties at work told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that,  although the Czech Republic and Croatia were to be trading  partners, the actual initiator of the contact was a certain  Slovak firm that mediated this deal for the Zubri Rubber Works.  The rubber works would have received almost 45 million korunas  for the sale of the gas masks to Croatia.</p>

Meeting South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Butrus-Ghali called North Korea's  decision a breakthrough in the nuclear problem that was heading  to a dangerous end. The decision, in the long run, will serve  as an important impetus for inter-Korean relations, as well as  maintenance of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the  United Nations, the secretary-general was quoted as saying.    North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA)  have just agreed on resumption of nuclear inspections last held  in February 1993. The inspectors are to check whether North  Korea has diverted any of its nuclear materials since then.    Foreign Minister Han called the development an incomplete  solution, but nevertheless satisfactory and important progress  that provides a breakthrough in the dispute.    South Korea will continue efforts to achieve stability in  the  region, Han told the secretary-general.    The foreign minister explained Seoul's decision to make an  early withdrawal of its army unit from Somalia, while promising  to take an active interest in future UN peacekeeping operations  there.    Seoul has announced it is pulling out its army engineering  unit three months ahead of schedule as most western nations are  withdrawing.</p>

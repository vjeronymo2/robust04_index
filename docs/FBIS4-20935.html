			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Faysal Makram and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah report: "Aden: </F> Sanaa Importing Chemical Weapons"]    [Excerpt] Sanaa, Aden -- A statement issued by the Defense  Ministry in Aden accuses "the economic military establishment in  the capital, Sanaa, of importing various types of  internationally banned chemical weapons and ammunition from a  number of East European countries."    The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Aden  yesterday, says: "These weapons and ammunition are imported  through a Jewish dealer who has strong links and ties with the  Zionist centers of influence formed recently in a number of East  European states."    The statement, which falls within the framework of the  resumption of media campaigns between the southern forces  supporting the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the northern  forces supporting the General People's Congress, describes "the  weapons brought to Yemen recently as weapons of mass destruction  like those which have been and are still being destroyed in Iraq  and which are banned in other states."    The statement says: "The military-economic establishment is  a close commercial establishment controlled directly by the  ruling military family in Sanaa. It controls most trade  activities in the republic without the knowledge of the  government and the House of Representatives."    The YSP, which controls Aden, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping  [YRG], which is led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar,  speaker of the House of Representatives, traded accusations  yesterday. The YRG said that houses belonging to its supporters  in Aden has been stormed, while security sources in the city  said that large quantities of weapons had been confiscated in  hideouts in the city.    The sources added that "the security services in Aden have  over the past two days discovered large quantities of weapons  which were smuggled in secretly and delivered to terrorist  elements belonging to the Jihad organization in Yemen." The  sources said that "interrogations of the suspects accused of  acquiring the weapons have shown that they belong to a major  Islamic party in the country" -- a clear reference to the YRG.

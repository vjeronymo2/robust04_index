			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "D66 Finds It Has at Last Become a </F> Major Party -- Double Number of Seats Unleashes Euphoria Among  Leadership"]    [Excerpt] The Hague -- On Tuesday evening [3 May], in the  Krasnapolsky Hotel in Amsterdam, the same venue where the party  was formed 28 years ago, D66 [Democrats 66] leader Hans Van  Mierlo made an American-style victory gesture to the vociferous  jubilation of his supporters. Raising both his arms and holding  them wide apart above his head he said: "We have done it. We  have become a major party."    In a single bound, the D66 doubled its vote. Consequently,  the D66 party in the Second Chamber will now make an historic  leap forward, from 12 to 24 seats. Never in its history had the  party earned more than 17 seats.    Referring to the opinion polls, which for months had been  dubbing the party for victory, Van Mierlo said: "From the  promised land we have arrived in the land of reality."    Week after week, that promise implied more than the result  which ultimately emerged from the elections. At its highest  point in the polls, the party scored 34 seats in the Chamber.    Only a few weeks ago, there was careful speculation about  the  possibility of Van Mierlo's party becoming the largest in the  country. And on the morning of the elections, the democrats  still rated 27 seats in the opinion polls.    The outcome of the election, according to Van Mierlo,  constituted "an historic disaster for government policy." He  also viewed the result as a signal for change, saying: "Now at  last there is talk of an unprecedented shift in Netherlands  politics. This is highly significant. And it is an historic  victory for a party that during its 28-year existence has always  called for renewal. We will make the most of the situation."    By the way, Van Mierlo is sticking firmly to his preference  for a purple coalition, a government comprised of the PvdA  [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy],  and D66. The D66 leader responded cautiously to the question of  whether it was inevitable that PvdA leader Kok, the head of the  largest party in the country, would become the new prime  minister. "It would be the first time that a party which  incurred such a loss would provide the prime minister," said Van  Mierlo. "On the other hand, Kok certainly has what it takes to  become prime minister." [passage omitted]</p>

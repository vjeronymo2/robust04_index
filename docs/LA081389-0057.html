			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POETRY AS PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> I've read in and supported the Cafe Largo poetry night club series discussed by  Jack Miles because I believe actors have as much right as anyone to try poetry  and even succeed at it. Dismissing their efforts by confusing their skill as  performers with their skill as poets does nothing but obfuscate the underlying  intimate relation between the making of the poem and the public sharing of it.  The poem is something we had to write but it is also something we want, like  the bards of old, to sing and shout.  </P> <P> Whether there's really a "shift" to performance is debatable. Certainly  "performance art," a loosely defined multimedia conglomeration, is a new  20th-Century genre, but it is a mistake to confuse the performance of poetry  with the poetic aspects of performance art. Poets have performed their poems  since Homer, with and without embellishments. Maybe poet/actor Michael Lally  and poet Eve Brandstein, founders of 'Poetry in Motion', noticed some incipient  talent among fellow actors and foster this by giving them a place to perform.  Maybe the exploding L.A. poetry scene is becoming so exciting and vibrant that  everyone is attracted to it, even celebrities. Anybody out there ever hear of a  bloke named Shakespeare?  </P> <P> AUSTIN STRAUS  </P> <P> "THE POETRY CONNEXION"  </P> <P> KPFK RADIO  </P></p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Fed vice-chairman resigns for private sector: Mullins' departure gives Clinton chance to increase influence on policy Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, yesterday announced his resignation with effect from February 14. His departure gives President Bill Clinton an opportunity to name a second governor to the Fed's seven-member board and so to wield considerable indirect influence on monetary policy. Last month the White House said Mr George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, was likely to fill the vacancy created by the departure of Mr Wayne Angell, a governor appointed by former President Reagan. Mr Clinton, however, has not yet formally nominated Mr Perry. The vacancies arise at a sensitive time. On Monday Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, indicated that the Fed was in the process of deciding when to begin raising short-term interest rates, which have stood at 3 per cent since September 1992. Mr Clinton has said he sees no reason for higher rates because inflation is not rising. Mr Mullins' departure could lead to Mr Perry's nomination as Fed vice- chairman. Mr Clinton could then fill the vacant governorship with one of the candidates considered for Mr Perry's position such as Mr Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University. Alternatively, Mr Clinton could opt to nominate a heavyweight administration economist, such as Mr Alan Blinder, deputy to Ms Laura Tyson at the Council of Economic Advisers, as Fed vice-chairman, with Mr Perry filling the vacant governorship as originally planned. Mr Mullins is leaving to become a partner in Long-Term Capital Management, a recently formed investment management firm based in Connecticut. Mr Mullins has been a governor since May 1990 and vice-chairman since July 1991. Before this he served as an assistant Treasury secretary in the Bush administration, where he helped devise the federal bail-out of the savings and loan industry.</p>

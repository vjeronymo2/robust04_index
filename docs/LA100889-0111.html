			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARLIN TOURNAMENT'S EFFECT ON SEA  </P> <P> We recently returned from a very successful weekend of marlin fishing with our  two youngest daughters. During the weekend we caught and released two marlin.  Our girls were not only able to witness -- but also to participate firsthand --  in the thrills, fire drills and satisfaction of catching the greatest fish of  the sea and then being able to release him -- free to live. It was one of the  most satisfying times of our lives, only to be ruined by the Catalina Gold Cup  Marlin Tournament.  </P> <P> The Gold Cup does not promote conservation; instead, it encourages participants  to rape the sea. This is a big-money tournament, with almost $40,000 going to  the heaviest fish brought to the scales -- that is what is disgusting. They  killed more than 80 fish. Thank God it is only a two-day tournament.  </P> <P> We understand several fish are donated to charities for food, and they have  people eager to receive the fresh fish, but let's be realistic -- 80 marlin!  </P> <P> What can we do to get people like this to understand that if they continue to  rape the seas, there will not be any fish for their children to catch -- and,  we hope, release? We would like to protest this tournament and end it. If the  city of Avalon feels it must continue with the Gold Cup, it should be  restructured as a tag-and-release tournament, similar to the L.A. Billfish  Tournament. The 1989 L.A. Billfish Tournament caught and released about 50  marlin.  </P> <P> We are not a couple of Greenpeace fanatics, but we do respect our seas and the  life they hold. We are avid sportfishermen, fishing every weekend during marlin  season and several weekends in the spring and fall for other species -- which  we also release. But we feel that this type of unnecessary slaughter must be  stopped.  </P> <P> MIKE CURRUTH  </P> <P> KATHY CURRUTH  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

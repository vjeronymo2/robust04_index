			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by an unidentified Bratislava correspondent: "The </F> Share of Private Enterprises in the Total Economic Production of  the Slovak Republic Is Constantly Growing"]    [Text] Bratislava--Last year, the private sector accounted  for more than 20 percent of the total Slovak Republic  production. The greatest share was accounted for by the  construction industry, where the overall share of private  businesses in production amounted to virtually 25 percent. The  results of the Slovak economy are thus sharply in contrast with  the results achieved by the Czech Republic last year, where the  share of private businesses in overall production is running at  a level of 40 percent. The report by the Slovak Statistical  Office contained this information.    The share of enterprises employing more than 25 workers in  overall production is virtually 100 percent in certain branches  of the Slovak economy. This trend is most pronounced in  industrial production, where the share of enterprises employing  more than 25 workers is greater than 92 percent. In the  construction industry, the share amounts to 64.4 percent, in  trade 21 percent, and in services 45 percent.    On the profit side of the balance sheet, the greatest share  was accounted for by enterprises owned by the state, something  that was expressly influenced primarily by the energy sector and  the Transgaz Enterprise. The energy sector, together with the  transmission of natural gas, accounts for a decisive share in  the formation of revenues flowing to the Slovak Republic. The  profit recorded last year by the private sector amounted to 6.2  percent. Enterprises of the cooperative sector were included in  the overall evaluation. Results of the public sector were  largely the result of the highly efficient activities of the  energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise.    As far as evaluating the productivity of labor from the  standpoint of output, production of goods, basic construction  activity, and the physical volume of retail sales (excluding the  energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise), the highest levels  were achieved by workers in the so-called other private  enterprises (foreign as well as international), where the final  results were valued at 1.187 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. The  situation was similar in the case of average monthly wages,  where the remaining private sector achieved a level of Sk6,521  and the domestic private sector achieved average monthly wages  of Sk5,532. Meanwhile, in all privatized enterprises, wages  amounted to Sk5,420, and in the public sector to Sk5,306. In  enterprises that were privatized within the framework of the  first round of coupon privatization, gross wages amounted to  Sk5,397.    As for indicators of profitability, not taking into account  the results of the energy sector and the Transgaz Enterprise,  the most efficient results were scored by domestic private  enterprises. Their share in the profit and outputs amounted to  1.7 percent, and profitability of costs as a share of profit and  loss amounted to a value of 1.8 percent. Enterprises privatized  through coupon privatization were more efficient (1.4 percent)  than those in the private sector (0.9 percent).    Indicators of profitability and wage costs thus indicate  that  the activities of private enterprises are more efficient than  the activities of enterprises in the public sector.    The relationship between labor productivity and average  wages  in this set of enterprises showed a more favorable trend in  1993, when compared with the previous period. Given the growth  in productivity of labor of 35.5 percent, average monthly wages  increased 19.6 percent. In the domestic private sector, labor  productivity rose by 6.9 percent (again excluding the energy  sector), and average monthly wages rose by 18.6 percent.    In 1993, wage development did not worsen in comparison with  1992, and wages expressed in nominal figures did not expressly  increase inflationary pressures. The development of real values  was also favorable. With the decline in labor productivity  recorded in the gross domestic product in constant prices by 0.1  percent, average monthly wages declined by 3.7 percent.    A comparison of profit and loss figures for enterprises  indicates that the volume of profits increased in agriculture,  the production and transmission of gas and electric energy,  ground transportation, and recreational, cultural, and other  commercial activities. The volume of losses increased in the  construction industry, the processing industries, and the area  of real estate. Generally, average monthly wages were higher in  profitable enterprises, and, on average, wages grew more rapidly  there. In more branches, however, the growth of average monthly  wages was higher in unprofitable enterprises than was the case  in profitable ones.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The trades would be cleared pursuant to the BSE member's agreement with a Canadian correspondent to clear and settle trades at the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') on their behalf. BSE members would give up a valid CDS account at execution and would be treated like a customer of the Canadian correspondent. This is the clearing arrangement that U.S. broker/dealers currently utilize in clearing trades in Canadian stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ME is an affiliate member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') and as such has elected to participate in the ISG investigative procedures. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  This structure will enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance departments with regard to transactions executed through the link, as is currently done today with southbound orders. Essentially, each northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book and will therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock trading monitoring system (``SECMA''). The ME currently focuses its trading reviews on insider trading, trading on non-public market information (``front running''), price manipulation (Market fraud of various types), short squeeze, short sales down ticking, normal course issue of bid up ticking, and restrictions on trading by members involved in a distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As an affiliate member of ISG, the ME has agreed to abide by the requirements of the ISG Affiliate Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting these types of trading reviews, the ME utilizes price alerts, volume alerts, exception reports based on high-lows and closing prices, as well as other technical information analysis and graphics that are available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

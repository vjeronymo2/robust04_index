			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Small business hits at cost of banking Small businesses believe that banks are providing worse value for money now than they were four years ago, according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business. The findings, produced by the University of Nottingham on the basis of 5,500 responses to questionnaires, found that small businesses see transaction charges as the greatest constraint imposed on their activities by banks. It also highlights the interest rates charged and the fear of having overdraft facilities withdrawn as significant restrictions. Barclays is seen as giving the worst value for money and Royal Bank of Scotland is seen as giving the best. Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive, acknowledged that banks had tried to improve service to small businesses but criticised their introduction of codes of practice as a 'one-sided' approach to the issue. Instead, he said, written contracts between banks and small businesses would bring greater understanding. While banks did not generally dispute the survey's validity, and some expressed concern at the perception of value for money revealed by the survey, they rejected Mr Mendham's claim that payments by small businesses were subsidising the charges paid by big companies. Barclays said it had not made any profit from small business transaction charges in recent years. Mr John Spence, head of business banking at Lloyds, said that in small business banking 'we have not been making the sort of profit that could be subsidising another part of our organisation'. The survey shows that 43 per cent of small businesses are considering changing their bank. The forum said, however, that only 5 per cent had changed their bank in the previous year. Several banks, including Barclays, Bank of Scotland and National Westminster, said the poll findings were at odds with higher levels of satisfaction indicated by their own internal research. They said that the survey should be seen in the context of constraints on small businesses arising from broader economic factors. The FPB plans to publish a further report on individual banks' relationships with small businesses next month.  --------------------------------------------------------------------     HOW SMALL BUSINESSES RATE BANKS IN PROVIDING VALUE FOR MONEY  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1=very poor, 5=very good            1990      1992      1994  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Aggregate overall results           2.91      2.59      2.39 Royal Bank                          2.91      2.88      2.54 Lloyds                              2.92      2.52      2.49 Midland                             2.84      2.52      2.39 Bank of Scotland                    3.01       2.8      2.36 NatWest                             2.83      2.55      2.25 Clydesdale                          2.92      2.74      2.21 Barclays                            2.91      2.57      2.12 Other banks                         3.15      2.75      2.72  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Forum of private businesses  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

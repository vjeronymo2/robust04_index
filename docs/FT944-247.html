			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Referendum for EEC only Sir, You state in your 'FT Guide to EU Inter-governmental Conference' (December 19) that Britain held a referendum on EU membership in 1975. But surely at that time we voted for continued membership of the European Economic Community and not for the federalist monolith we now seem to be rushing headlong towards.

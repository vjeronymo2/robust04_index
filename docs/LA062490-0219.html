			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALSO WORTH WATCHING  </P> <P> Actor-writer-director Henry Jaglom and Oscar-winner Sally Field probably would  like to forget the project they collaborated on a quarter of a century ago: An  episode of Gidget (Saturday at 10:30 a.m. on KTLA). Jaglom plays a folk singer  whom Gidget (Field) recruits for a protest.  </P> <P> Tom Hanks is a stoned Harvard student in Part I of the Taxi episode "The Road  Not Taken" (11 p.m. on KTLA), which recounts Jim's first use of drugs, among  other cabbie milestones. Part II follows.  </P> <P> The love between Arnold the pig and Cynthia the basset hound is tested when Mr.  Ziffel tries to break up the romance, on Green Acres (Saturday at 9 p.m. on  Nickelodeon).  </P> <P> Wayne Rogers guest stars in the Gunsmoke episode "Cody's Code" (Saturday at 1  p.m. on The Family Channel), which first aired in January, 1962. Rogers, though  best known for "M*A*S*H," was no stranger to Westerns; he had his own,  "Stagecoach West," in 1960-61.  </P> <P> Mel Torme wrote and stars in an episode of The Virginian (Saturday at 9 a.m. on  Family) about a drifter mistaken for a fast gun.  </P> <P> Passengers and crew of a spaceship to London crash, finding themselves in the  Land of the Giants (Wednesday at 11 a.m. on USA).  </P> <P> Michael Landon made his directorial debut on Bonanza with "To Die in Darkness"  (Saturday at 2 p.m. on Family), which he also wrote.  </P> <P> "Where Is Everybody?," the pilot for The Twilight Zone (Monday at noon on  KTLA), isn't remembered as a standout, but it did sell the series. The story,  about a man who panics when he finds himself alone in a small town, first aired  on Oct. 2, 1959.  </P> <P> More pilots: Cop show spoof Sledge Hammer (Monday at 7 p.m. on KTLA) and The  Equalizer (Saturday at 6 p.m. on USA).  </P></p>

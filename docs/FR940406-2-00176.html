			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 6: ADA Training on Standards for Accessible Design  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Titles II and III of the ADA require that new governmental and commercial facilities be built in an accessible manner and require that, when existing governmental or commercial facilities are renovated or otherwise altered, the alterations be made in an accessible manner. In their regulations implementing Titles II and III of the ADA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) adopted Standards for Accessible Design for purposes of enforcing the ADA's non- discrimination requirements in the built environment. For commercial facilities and public transportation facilities, they adopted the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. For government facilities other than transportation facilities covered by DOT, DOJ currently permits the use of either the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards or ADAAG as the ``Standards for Accessible Design.'' These Standards must be followed in new construction and alteration projects. They also serve as a guide for public accommodations undertaking to remove barriers in inaccessible existing facilities, as required under Title III. These Standards are complex and made up of scoping and technical provisions that contain many discrete requirements and necessitate referencing other technical provisions in order to make an element or space accessible. NIDRR proposes a project to develop a series of audio/visual and complementary training materials on the Standards for Accessible Design that can be used across the country at the local level. Local organizations whose members include persons with disabilities, business owners, building managers, employers, government agency officials, city planners, architects, designers, or other relevant parties need access to reliable materials that explain the ADA Standards. NIDRR proposes to develop this series of materials in short discrete segments that could be used in meetings normally scheduled by professional or business organizations such as local chapters of the American Institute of Architects, local Chambers of Commerce, and other groups. These materials could also be used by the DBTACs in carrying out ADA training activities. Grant applicants must be able to demonstrate knowledge, understanding, and experience in the following areas: in-depth knowledge of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design; thorough understanding of the rationale(s) underlying the Standards; understanding of the ways in which persons with disabilities use, or are unable to use, the built environment; experience in the development and dissemination of educational videos; and experience in using innovative and engaging video techniques such as animation and fade-ins or transformations from actual scenes to diagrammatic or conceptual material. Samples of an applicant's recent relevant work, including the use of animation or other innovative video techniques and the development of training materials related to the ADA Standards or training materials on accessible design, must be submitted with the grant application. Based on the estimated size of the award that will be published in the notice inviting applications, applicants may propose to cover some, but not all of the topics. Grant applicants must propose an order of production of the videos and identify the topics that will be addressed in each video. Applicants must justify their order of production, based on the importance of the topic. Applicants must propose to group topics on each of the videos and explain the rationale for the groupings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ADA training project on the ADA Standards for Accessible Design shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop, test, and disseminate a series of short, broadcast quality videos and complementary training materials that address the technical and scoping requirements of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. These materials shall cover  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> as many of the following topics as possible <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (emphasis added) as set out in the current Standards as well as new provisions that will be adopted: New construction; additions, alterations, and path of travel; historic buildings; parking and passenger loading zones; exterior accessible routes and curb ramps; drinking fountains; telephones and TDDs; ramps and stairs; platform lifts; entrances and exits (areas of rescue assistance); doors and gates; building lobbies and corridors (interior accessible routes); elevators; rooms and spaces; assembly areas; toilet rooms and bathrooms; bathtubs and showers; dressing and fitting rooms; signage; alarms; detectable warnings; automated teller machines; restaurants and cafeterias; medical care facilities; mercantile facilities; libraries; hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses, dormitories, and similar places; homeless shelters, halfway houses, transient group homes, and similar social services establishments; bus stops; fixed transportation facilities, bus and train terminals and stations; and airports. The project shall address the requirements of the standards from a Universal Design perspective; &bull;The videos shall illustrate how people with disabilities use the built environment and the rationale(s) that underlie specific technical and scoping provisions of the Standards and how discrete provisions in the Standards fit together with each other to ensure accessibility: &bull;Use innovative techniques, including animation, fade-ins or transformations to transition from footage showing a person using a space or element to footage showing design layouts and diagrams from the Standards relevant to that kind of space or element; &bull;Utilizing, as much as possible, materials that have been developed by Federal agencies, develop readily reproducible complementary training materials in conjunction with each video to supplement the video materials and to provide guidance on using the videos effectively; &bull;Identify organizations whose members include persons with disabilities, business owners, building managers, employers, government agency officials, city planners, architects, designers, and other relevant parties who would be an appropriate audience for the videos; &bull;Develop and implement a plan to disseminate the videos and complementary training materials to selected organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Produce the first video and complementary training material of the series within six months of the grant award; &bull;Coordinate with the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in the development and dissemination of the videos and complementary training materials; &bull;Ensure that the training videos and complementary training material are available in formats that accommodate persons with hearing impairments and vision impairments; &bull;Provide four one-inch NCSC standard fully mixed and open captioned edited master video tapes, including two master tapes and two safety dub tapes suitable for duplication, and four copies on VHS cassettes of each videotape produced, along with four reproducible copies of each set of complementary training materials to NIDRR for use by the Federal government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

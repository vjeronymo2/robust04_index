			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The newspaper EL TIEMPO today admitted that Father  Nel Beltran was not in Cuba, and the people of Sincelejo are  glad that their parish priest's name has been cleared.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] As for the  accusations leveled by certain media against the church, as well  as a campaign to discredit it, Monsignor Nel Beltran Santamaria  today said he forgives his enemies, adding that he does not  harbor any feelings of bitterness, resentment, or revenge.    [Beltran] Let us seek the truth. I especially urge the  media to seek the truth. Let us speak the truth. Truth will  make us free. Truth is light. Death is only present in  darkness.    [Reporter] The bishop today said at the public square in  Sincelejo that never before in his long career as bishop had he  had enemies within or outside the church. The monsignor urged  his parishioners to pray for those who accused him of having  participated in a guerrilla summit. Evil is not stronger than  good, monsignor added. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today  clarified his office's position regarding the case of the bishop  being in Cuba:    [Begin recording] [Reporter] De Greiff said this morning  that  his office has never been deceived. He explained that the  Prosecutor General's Office has evidence -- evidence that  includes testimonies and documents -- which proves a church  representative was involved in a guerrilla summit in Havana,  Cuba.    [De Greiff] Whether I should recant is not an issue here.  The Prosecutor General's Office cannot base its opinion on  anything but the evidence it has. As I told you, we have such  evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence countering this evidence is  respectable. We will have to compare their evidence to ours. As  for the case of the bishop, we have decided that this not our  responsibility. [end recording]    De Greiff also said his evidence will have to be compared  with the evidence of other investigative organizations to  determine which is genuine. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General's  Office said Bishop Nel Beltran is not the person in question, as  has been claimed from the very beginning.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Is it necessarily Nel Beltran?    [De Greiff] Not necessarily. One piece of evidence involves  a priest. Like I said, this is only one piece of evidence. The  integrity of this evidence has yet to be determined. [end  recording]    After comparing all of the evidence, the Prosecutor  General's  Office will present documents to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal,  the organization in charge of investigating church  representatives.

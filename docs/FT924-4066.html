			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Japan slides to the brink of recession THE Japanese economy is slipping dangerously close to outright recession, according to government figures published yesterday which show the economy contracting at 1.6 per cent a year in the three months to the end of September. The Economic Planning Agency, giving its figures for real gross national product in the third quarter, said the outcome was down 0.4 per cent from the previous quarter, largely because public spending failed to offset sharp declines in corporate investment and sluggish consumption. The most worrying aspect of the figures was a significant fall in public investment despite the government's decision in March to bring forward capital spending programmes. Public investment, which is the main engine of domestic demand growth in an otherwise stagnant economy, fell by 2.7 per cent in the third quarter to Y34,145bn (Pounds 180bn). The worse than expected figures open what will be an intense fortnight in which policymakers have to take crucial decisions about how to stave off recession. Both the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan maintain publicly that no further easing of policy is yet justified. However, they are likely to come under mounting political pressure to stimulate the economy. A string of business leaders yesterday called on the government to cut taxes next year to prevent a recession. The supplementary budget needed to enact the Y10,700bn emergency spending programme announced in August is likely to pass through the parliament next week. Details of the 1993 budget are likely to be finalised the week after that for publication over Christmas. The Finance Ministry is predicting a rise in public spending of only about 1 per cent because tax revenues have fallen steeply. As yet it has shown no signs of bowing to political pressure for tax cuts. Speculation that the worse than expected performance in the third quarter will lead to a further cut in interest rates will be fanned next week when the Bank of Japan is expected to release a gloomy quarterly survey on the state of the economy. The Japanese parliament's lower house yesterday took a step towards reducing the large imbalance in favour of sparsely populated rural constituencies in the country's electoral system by approving the reallocation of parliamentary seats. Votes in the least populated seats are worth more than three times as much as a vote in the most populated seats. The bill will add an extra seat to nine electoral districts in densely populated urban areas, while one seat will be removed from 10 less populated districts. This will reduce the discrepancy. The bill also includes 17 measures designed to meet public criticism of corruption in political fundraising in the wake of the Sagawa Kyubin scandal. The LDP is expected next week to publish details of more comprehensive electoral reform. This may include proposals to replace large multi-member constituencies with smaller single-member ones.</p>

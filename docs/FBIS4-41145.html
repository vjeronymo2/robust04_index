			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma's factions are against the idea of  extending parliament.    Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 Boris  Fedorov categorically opposes this idea. He told INTERFAX that  it was illegal and that he would resign on the day stated in the  Constitution -- December 12, 1995 -- whether or not a decision  on the issue was taken.    Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  believes that the deputies' powers may be extended, if his party  is given a chance to form a government. Otherwise, early  presidential and parliamentary elections must be held, he said.    Vice-Chairman of the Communists of Russia faction Viktor  Zorkaltsev said that the proposal on postponing parliamentary  elections was unethical. As the State Duma was elected for two  years, he said, it had no moral right to vote for the extension  of its powers. "Electors will not understand us," he said.    Representative of the Russia's Choice faction Aleksandr  Osovtsev views this proposal as an attempt to "buy" deputies.  "One can't change the rules either during the game or after it,  when a certain result has been achieved. This is not a  gentlemanly practice," he said.    In his opinion, the alignment of forces in the bodies of  state authority following the elections on December 12, is  "accidental rather than logical" and that new elections must be  held.    Member of the Yabloko faction Viktor Sheynis said that the  idea of suspending parliamentary elections was immoral, and  expressed hope that even the deputies who wanted to have their  powers extended would not dare to ruin their reputation by  supporting this idea.    In his opinion, the State Duma is not likely to provide two  thirds of the votes necessary for changing the Constitution.    Deputy Gennadiy Burbulis, who withdrew from Russia's Choice  faction recently, said that extending parliament was possible.  He believes, however, that the most important thing is to  ensure the stability of the current course, not to extend the  deputies' powers.    Burbulis also said that the question of extending the  president's term in office might be raised on the condition that  Boris Yeltsin pledged not to run for the presidency in 1998.</p>

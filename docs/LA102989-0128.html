			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MS SUFFERERS  </P> <P> Lola Falana may believe that her faith in God "cured" her multiple sclerosis  (MS), but she has no right to imply that the rest of us with this disease are  her spiritual inferiors because we haven't been cured of a disease that medical  science recognizes as incurable at the present time ("Private Lives," by Betty  Goodwin, Oct. 19).  </P> <P> Besides holding out false hopes, Falana's comments are guilt-inducing and  promote a blame-the-victim attitude that is both unfair and damaging to people  with MS.  </P> <P> As one who has lived with this disease for many years, some of which I have  spent as a peer counselor for others with MS, I also resent Falana's comments  on the use of canes, crutches, etc. She has the right to reject such items  herself, but for some people, going without walking aids leads to broken bones  and/or an unnecessarily limited life style. Her statements simply make a hard  situation even harder.  </P> <P> In short, Ms. Falana, don't use your prominence as a performer to preach a  message that does nothing more than undermine the efforts of other people who  are dealing with MS.  </P> <P> LAURA REMSON MITCHELL, Canoga Park  </P></p>

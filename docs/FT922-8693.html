			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: MMB shares suspended by bourse FRENCH stock exchange authorities yesterday suspended trading in the shares of MMB, a holding company which controls Hachette, the media group, and Matra, the defence electronics to transport company. The Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF) gave no reason for the suspension, which lasts until Wednesday. However, an MMB spokesman said it was to calm the market in MMB shares after the price had jumped more than the 10 per cent daily maximum at which a suspension is triggered. Speculation in MMB's shares has been intense since last week's announcement that Hachette and Matra were to merge by the end of the year. The two operating companies' share prices have also risen steeply since then. As part of the project, MMB is to be transformed from a normal company into a societe en commandite par actions, an unlimited share partnership. This is a way of locking up control of the group and making it nearly invulnerable to hostile bids.</p>

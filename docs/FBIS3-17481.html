The next step in the removal is the  Estonian Government's decision to give permission for extra  Russian military personnel to come to the former Russian naval  base town of Paldiski for the dismantling of the two nuclear  training reactors located there. Prime Minister Mart Laar said  after a government meeting that the permit had been issued for  "a small group of military." Mr. Laar said "no problems or  obstacles" with Russia had emerged over the issue of the nuclear  reactors' removal.</p>

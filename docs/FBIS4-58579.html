			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bari'ah 'Alam-al-Din report: "Suha 'Arafat: I Am </F> Boycotting Cairo Ceremony Because Palestinian Women Are Still in  Prison"]    [Text] London -- Mrs. Suha 'Arafat has apologized for not  responding to an invitation received from the Egyptian  Government to attend the ceremony marking the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo today. She told AL-HAYAH  that she has apologized to the Egyptian Government for being  unable to accept the invitation, "despite her appreciation of  the tireless efforts and assistance it offered to achieve  progress in connection with the agreement." She attributed her  failure to go to Cairo to "reasons related to her refusal to  participate in any ceremonies or occasions of this kind while a  large number of Palestinian women are still in Israeli jails."    Mrs. 'Arafat expressed her unwillingness to shake hands with  or stand beside Mrs. Rabin, who will accompany her husband to  the signing ceremony in Cairo today, before all Palestinian  women are released from prison.    She said: "I support the president's decisions and stance.  But I realize that the normalization process will need time. I  do not believe that we will be able to normalize relations  quickly amid this large number of psychological barriers which  we should surmount."    She added: "A week ago the Israelis sentenced 'Abir Lahidi,  a 20-year-old woman, to 20 years in prison. They also  demolished her house, ignoring all talk about peace and the  agreement. So how can I ignore or forget the suffering or  feelings of Palestinian women held in prison, and appear in  ceremonies before my people and the world?"    At another level, Mrs. 'Arafat said that she is going to  accompany the Palestinian president to South Africa to  congratulate President Nelson Mandela on his victory in the  elections and to attend his inauguration ceremony.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview for the Austrian TV station ORT2  following yet another round of Vienna negotiations, Bosnian  Prime Minister Dr. Haris Silajdzic said: I am glad that the  Bosnian-Croatian talks took place in Vienna. The Austrian  Government has invested a great deal of energy and effort to  ensure that peace is reached. We genuinely hope for peace  rather than war. We hope that human rights, mentioned in the  draft constitution, will become reality: the right to life, to  freedom, to free movement, to differing views.    Asked to comment on the deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina of  Russian troops as part of the UN contingent, Dr. Silajdzic said:  I was in Moscow three days ago. I was open about my concern at  the way the Russians have become involved. Several weeks ago  Zhirinovskiy visited the aggressor's territories and made  nationalistically charged speeches. Soon afterwards Russian  troops arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Government was  not consulted. The Russian troops have been deployed at  locations in Sarajevo as well. We fear that Sarajevo will be  divided. We fear a new war there. We shall do our utmost to  ensure that a new Berlin wall is not erected there. We are,  nevertheless, concerned.    Asked how stable the foundations of the new Bosnian-Croatian  trust are and if they could be undermined again in view of the  fact that until recently the two people have been engaged in a  bloody war, Silajdzic said: Everything is possible. The crucial  point is that a stable cease-fire, especially in Sarajevo and  Mostar, has come about as a direct result of the current rounds  of negotiations. This gives us encouragement and strength to  persevere. We hope for the best, Prime Minister Silajdzic said  among other things.</p>

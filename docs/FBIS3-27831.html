Kuriyama, who is back in Japan temporarily, made the remark  in discussions with Hosokawa in advance of the prime minister's  summit talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 in  Washington.    Economic issues such as easier U.S. access to Japanese  Government procurement orders as well as to the auto and  insurance markets are expected to be high on the summit agenda.    Kuriyama, however, was quoted as saying Washington has a  good  impression of the cabinet of Hosokawa.    Hosokawa staked his political fate on a controversial  package  of political reform bills which cleared the Diet on Saturday.  The four bills introduce major changes in the electoral system  for the House of Representatives and tighten controls over  political donations to politicians.    In a related development, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an attempt to break the  deadlock in the bilateral talks prior to the summit talks.    Hosokawa will leave for the United States on Thursday night  and return home Sunday after his meeting with Clinton.</p>

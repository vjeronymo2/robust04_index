			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE REVEALS ILLEGAL MANUFACTURING OF GENERICS, LAWMAKERS SAY;  </P> <P> DRUG FIRMS' BRIBERY HELD 'TIP OF ICEBERG'  </P> <P> Two generic drug companies already immersed in bribery charges have more  pervasive problems than originally thought, and the companies likely will be  investigated by the Justice Department's criminal division, two key members of  Congress say in documents to be made public today.  </P> <P> An admitted bribery payment to Food and Drug Administration employees "appears  to be only the tip of the iceberg in a story . . . rife with problems,"  according to statements by Reps. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and Thomas J. Bliley  Jr. (R-Va.). Dingell is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and  its subcommittee on oversight and investigations, while Bliley is the  subcommittee's ranking Republican.  </P> <P> The congressmen say their subcommittee investigation of the two companies and  the FDA revealed incidents of fraud and "an attempted cover-up of illegal  manufacturing practices." They further charge that current top officers  "attempted to mislead" subcommittee investigators.  </P> <P> The charges against Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiary, Quad  Pharmaceuticals, are expected to be detailed today in a hearing by the  subcommittee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guilty Pleas  </P> <P> The companies and two former top officials have already pleaded guilty to  paying off three FDA employees in an attempt to gain speedier approval of their  generic drugs. Dilip Shah, a founder and former president of Quad, is scheduled  to be sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Ashok Patel, a  founder and former senior vice president of Par, is scheduled to be sentenced  in October.  </P> <P> Dingell and Bliley told the sentencing judge that the company continues to give  only "grudging and limited" cooperation to the subcommittee. In a letter and  memo sent Friday to U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove, the congressmen also  said that the current top officers of the corporation "attempted to mislead"  congressional investigators "by representing that only two employees out of the  thousand employees in both companies had been engaged in wrongdoing. . . . That  is simply not true."  </P> <P> The memo also states that the two current top officers of the corporation --  Perry Levine, president, and Jeff Levine, executive vice president -- either  knew or should have known that the corporation violated federal laws regulating  the drug industry. Dingell and Bliley said these violations included:  </P> <P>  -- "Unapproved deviations" in manufacturing equipment and procedures.  </P> <P>  -- "Destruction or suppression" of evidence and records requested by FDA  investigators.  </P> <P>  -- Switches in drug samples that were undergoing tests, and changing formulas  after they had been submitted for study.  </P> <P>  -- Other unapproved alterations in the chemical formulation of drugs.  </P> <P>  -- Unapproved changes in manufacturing sites.  </P> <P>  -- Changes and alterations in record-keeping procedures.  </P> <P> "Any claim of honest ignorance on the part of . . . management is completely  disingenuous," the congressmen said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ignored Problems  </P> <P> Dingell and Bliley charge that corporate officers "failed to conduct any  investigation of problems" even after they were informed of Shah's involvement  with illegal payoffs to FDA employees. Further, they say, these same officials  continued to delay action after the FDA presented them with evidence of false  statements made by the company in their applications for drug approval.  </P> <P> The Levines initially told the subcommittee "that all illegality at the firm  was limited to the activities of two employees," Patel and Shah, the lawmakers  say.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, they say, "by the end of the same week" Par's attorneys told the  subcommittee that Jeff Levine "may have been aware of the deliberate  suppression of evidence" by another of the firm's founders.  </P> <P> Par and Quad officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.  </P> <P> The generic drug industry has been the subject of a widening federal probe by  both the House subcommittee and the U.S. attorney in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Under the charges already brought, Shah and Patel could each receive a maximum  of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and each of the corporations could  be fined a maximum of $500,000.  </P></p>

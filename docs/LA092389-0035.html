"It's the best  I've ever seen him."  </P> <P> Master's is now 5-3-1.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> The CSUN team, erasing memories of a mediocre performance in its own tournament  last weekend, stormed through the first day of the Portland State tournament,  defeating two traditionally strong teams in straight games.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors defeated Nebraska-Omaha, 15-11, 16-14, 15-9, in their first  match of the day and finished the evening with a 15-8, 15-5, 15-9 victory over  East Texas State.  </P> <P> Occidental d. Cal Lutheran 15-10, 15-1, 15-9 -- Heather Beach had a game-high  13 kills and Cathy Clarke had 23 assists as the Lady Tigers evened their record  at 1-1.  </P> <P> The host Regals, who were led by Jen Larson's eight kills, remain winless at  0-9.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S SOCCER  </P> <P> Colorado Christian 4, Cal Lutheran 2 -- Becky Belt scored twice in the first  six minutes of the second half in leading Colorado Christian at Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran's Vanessa Martin opened the scoring at the 33-minute mark with her  fifth goal of the season, before Tashia Vigil tied the score early in the  second half.

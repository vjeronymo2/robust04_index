			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Half-win awaits Brundtland: Why Norway's PM views election with ambivalence NORWAY'S prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, seems certain to lead her Labour party to victory in the country's general election next Monday. But she is deriving little cheer from that. For the election is likely to make her struggle to bring Norway into the European Community all the more difficult as anti-EC parties look set to boost their parliamentary representation. An electorate ever-resistant to the prospect of EC membership will see to that. And to make matters worse, she will not have support on Europe from the party with which she has formed an alliance. What this all means is that Mrs Brundtland and her party colleagues are going around campaigning for re-election with one of their most important policy issues virtually unmentionable. Judging from the polls, Labour is widely expected to retain 63 seats in the 165-seat parliament, while the Socialist Left (SV) party is set to increase its parliamentary mandate to 22 seats from 17. The majority that this would give the alliance may result in a shift to the left in current policy, with higher taxes and higher public expenditure in prospect. However, the deep division between them on Europe is likely to rule out a coalition government. According to the polls, the agrarian anti-EC Centre party is expected to boost its representation to 17 seats from 11, while the main opposition Conservative party will lose two seats to end up with 37 after what analysts describe as a 'faceless' campaign. The right-wing Progress party looks set to see its 22 parliamentary seats shrink to 12. For Labour the result is widely expected to be the same as it was in the 1989 election - around 34 per cent of the vote, its worst result since 1930. In 1989, Labour was forced to make way for a centre-right coalition government, when it became clear that the bloc of 80 parliamentary seats, 63 of which were won by Labour and 17 by the SV, was not enough to outweigh the five non-socialist parties which won 84 seats. A centre-right tripartite coalition formed a government which fell quickly on the Europe issue. Labour stepped in to pick up the pieces at the height of Norway's worst post-war economic crisis. As Mrs Brundtland trudged around northern Norway at the weekend, her message to the electorate - that a vote for Labour did not mean a vote for EC membership - for the most part fell on deaf ears. 'If we do not achieve a result which the government can recommend to the Norwegian people, we do not have a result that we can go out and fight for,' she told fishermen in Hammerfest, Europe's northern-most city. In the high north, where fishing provides the mainstay of household income, there is decided scepticism about EC membership. The fisherman fear membership means relinquishing part of their hard-earned fishing quotas to Europe's fisherman, who, after having depleted their own resources, will look to Norway to boost their catch. However, a feeling is emerging that if Norway can conclude an acceptable negotiating result on fish with Brussels, allowing free market access and unchanged quotas, then membership could be tolerated. The reason is that membership might have the effect of boosting Norway's exports to the Community of processed fish and fish products. During the election campaign Mrs Brundtland has adamantly refused to debate the EC question, insisting it is not an EC election and that the issue will be decided in a referendum to be held in 1994 or 1995. 'Many people are sceptical and many are negative about Norwegian membership. Despite this there is broad agreement about the Labour Party's and the government's strategy; that it was right of us to seek membership, that we must negotiate and that we must achieve a result which the people can vote on in a referendum,' she said.</p>

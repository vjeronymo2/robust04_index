			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: On the eve of the U.S. secretary of  state's visit to the region, Israeli officials renewed their  campaign of casting doubts on the peaceful intentions of both  Syria and Lebanon in an obvious attempt to foil any possible  outcome of the visit, even before it starts. Yitzhaq Rabin  claimed Syria has not yet made a strategic decision on peace.  He accused the Lebanese Government of failing to provide  security in the southern border areas. Rabin said Israel does  not covet a single inch of the territories of Lebanon or Jordan,  without mentioning the occupied Syrian Golan. He said he is  ready to withdraw his forces from Lebanon if the Lebanese  Government disarms the national resistance and provides security  to the Israeli occupation forces for a trial period of six  months. His third condition was merging the agent militias or  South Lebanese Army, which was established by Israel, into the  regular Lebanese Army and assigning the task of security in the  south to them.    The Israeli rulers have over the last two and half years of  Washington talks failed to drag Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to  partial, inequitable agreements as a result of the three  countries' adherence to the principles of a just and  comprehensive peace, the Security Council resolutions, and  international law. In view of this evident failure, the Israeli  rulers could do nothing but level accusations, intensify  falsehoods, and reverse facts. Daily events refute Israeli  officials' claims and condemn their double-standard policy.  Syria presented objective and balanced proposals for peace in  the Middle East at the sixth round. These proposals were  discussed by the Syrian and Israeli delegations throughout the  subsequent rounds. However, Israel evaded the Syrian paper  because it called for full withdrawal from the Golan. Likewise,  Lebanon has throughout the recent rounds sought to obtain an  Israeli agreement to implement Security Council Resolution No.  425, but to no avail. Israel insisted on its well-known  impossible conditions.    Israel wants the Arabs to fully recognize it, to fully open  their borders with it, to establish economic ties with it, and  to sign treaties with it, but without committing itself to full  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. In the same  manner as it is talking about testing Lebanon's intentions, it  is also talking about testing Syria's intentions. Testing  Syrian intentions will continue for several years. As for  Lebanon, Israel is looking forward to maintaining control of the  south through its agents, to whom it is extending both salaries  and weapons. It stipulates that those agents should be  responsible for security in the south. All this will take place  after disarming the national resistance and setting the stage  for Israel's agents to do what they like in the various areas of  the south. The situation is not different in the case of  Jordan, for Israel stipulates that a peace treaty should be  signed and ties be normalized before any commitment to the  relevant UN resolutions is announced.    Israel wants to drag the Arab parties participating in the  peace process to partial, phased agreements that consecrate the  Arabs' relinquishment of Security Council resolutions, the  Madrid conference formula, and the principles of a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East, as it did with the  Palestinian side. While such phased agreements will secure an  Arab recognition of Israel and open the markets for its  products, they do not secure an end to occupation or restoration  of occupied Arab territories. The region will consequently be  mortgaged to Israel's policies and expansionist schemes.    Syria cannot be swayed by delusions nor can it barter the  Security Council resolutions with ambiguous promises. Peace, in  Syria's opinion, is possible immediately after Israel's  withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the rest of the  occupied territories, and after Israel's compliance with the  Security Council resolutions. Syria firmly believes inequitable  agreements are doomed to failure because they do not lead to a  just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. A firm and  stable peace should secure justice, fairness, and equality. In  other words, partial withdrawal cannot lead to peace. What is  required is the dismantling of all settlements and the full  departure of the occupation troops. Only then can the desired  peace prevail in the Middle East.</p>

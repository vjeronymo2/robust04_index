			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 8 HURT IN CRASH TRIGGERED BY SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER  </P> <P> A pickup truck driven by an alleged drunk driver fleeing the scene of an  accident in Boyle Heights collided with another vehicle Tuesday, triggering a  chain-reaction pileup that seriously injured three pedestrians, one of them a  3-year-old girl, police said.  </P> <P> In all, eight people were injured and four vehicles were involved in the  chaotic event, which occurred near 1st and St. Louis streets and less than a  block from the the city's Hollenbeck Police Station.  </P> <P> Four men from the pickup, all of whom suffered moderate injuries, attempted to  run away from the final crash, police said, but they were quickly apprehended  by Hollenbeck officers who had heard the collision, rushed outside to  investigate and saw them fleeing.  </P> <P> The pickup's driver, Francisco Fonseca, 20, of Highland Park, was taken to  County-USC Medical Center with chest injuries.  </P> <P> He was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and felony hit and run  driving, according to Lars Oakander, a Los Angeles Police Department traffic  detective.  </P> <P> Police said the chain-reaction accident occurred about 2 p.m., moments after  the pickup collided with a car on St. Louis Street.  </P> <P> According to Oakander, the driver of the pickup sped away from the first  accident, in which there were no injuries. He headed south on St. Louis Street  and sped through a stop sign at the intersection of 1st Street.  </P> <P> In the intersection, the pickup slammed into a Ford Falcon, which struck a  middle-aged male pedestrian and crashed into a telephone pole. The pickup,  meanwhile, hit a Boyle Heights man and his 3-year-old daughter as they crossed  1st Street in a crosswalk. The pickup also struck a 1979 Ford Mustang before  coming to a stop.  </P> <P> Police said the man and his daughter, whose identities also were not available,  were both rushed to County-USC with serious injuries. The two were initially  trapped under the pickup, and were pulled out by bystanders.  </P> <P> The third pedestrian also was seriously injured and taken to County-USC,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The three other suspects in the pickup, and the driver of the Falcon, all  suffered moderate injuries, officials said.  </P> <P> The driver of the Mustang, Angelina Rodriguez, 25, was not hurt.  </P> <P> "I just saw the truck come head up with me," Rodriguez recalled later. "I heard  people screaming, it was coming pretty fast."  </P> <P> Five Los Angeles paramedic ambulances were called to take the victims to  County-USC and White Memorial Medical Center. Police handcuffed the pickup  truck driver and passengers before placing them in the ambulances. At least one  of the suspects "got quite belligerent and threatening," Oakander said.  </P> <P> A 13-year-old boy, who was in the Video Box shop at the corner of 1st and St.  Louis streets described the impact as "a loud boom."  </P> <P> "When I came out of the video store, people were lying all around the street,"  said the youth, who declined to give his name. "There were people trying to  pull the truck off a man and a little girl. We have accidents around here all  the time. Every Friday you see an accident around here. This is the worst by  far."  </P> <P> "There were pedestrians underneath the pickup," said Naomi Reyes, who works at  a medical clinic on the block where the collision occured. "It was a terrible  accident."  </P></p>

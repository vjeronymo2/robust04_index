			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLANNING COMMISSIONERS REPORTEDLY AID CANDIDATE  </P> <P> Two members of the Orange County Planning Commission helped host a private  dinner Tuesday where they solicited campaign donations on behalf of an Assembly  candidate from Huntington Beach, according to some of those present.  </P> <P> Among those attending were several representatives of South County developers,  including at least one who has a project pending before the Planning  Commission.  </P> <P> The dinner, on behalf of 58th Assembly District candidate Peter von Elten, took  place at a restaurant owned by Planning Commission Chairman Stephen Nordeck and  was attended by commission member Roger Slates.  </P> <P> Nordeck, however, strongly denied in an interview that it was a fund-raising  dinner, that he hosted the gathering or that he solicited any contributions. He  said he was present on and off throughout the evening only because of his  duties as owner of the Trabuco Oaks Steak House. Slates declined to comment.  </P> <P> Others at the dinner provided a different account of the evening.  </P> <P> Several of the roughly 15 people present said that the financing of von Elten's  bid for the Legislature was discussed, and that both Nordeck and Slates spoke  to the guests on behalf of the candidate, encouraging them to contribute to  him.  </P> <P> "Roger obviously and Steve Nordeck -- the two of them, they sponsored the  dinner -- were indicating it would be nice if they wanted to contribute," said  Huntington Beach City Councilman Don MacAllister, who was there. "But there was  no pressure."  </P> <P> Among those who attended were two representatives of the Arvida Corp., which  has a phase of its multimillion-dollar Coto de Caza development pending before  the Planning Commission. Also present was a prominent lobbyist who has  represented other South County developers that have periodic dealings with the  commission.  </P> <P> Dave Ellis, von Elten's campaign manager, said that no money "changed hands" at  the dinner. Others interviewed said that guests were encouraged to contribute  at a later date.  </P> <P> Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices  Commission, said Thursday that state law bars appointed members of public  commissions or boards from soliciting campaign contributions of $250 or more  from individuals who have matters pending before them.  </P> <P> Michioku stressed that her comments were general and that she could reach "no  conclusions" about the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant without further  investigation.  </P> <P> "Generally speaking, they may not accept, solicit or direct a contribution of  $250 or more for any campaign if the contributor is involved in a decision  which is pending before that body," Michioku said.  </P> <P> But Nordeck said he didn't solicit contributions from developers or anyone else  at the dinner.  </P> <P> "I have been in politics for years," said Nordeck, 48, who was appointed to the  Planning Commission last year by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "I am not naive  enough to ever allow a fund-raiser in my restaurant."  </P> <P> Reached by telephone, Slates said simply, "I'm not talking to the press."  Slates, a 60-year-old real estate consultant, first served on the commission  from 1972 to 1975 and was appointed to a new term last year by Supervisor  Harriett M. Wieder.  </P> <P> Von Elten, an executive with the Mola Development Co. in Huntington Beach, did  not return calls for comment.  </P> <P> Ellis said that neither he nor von Elten paid for their meals, and that he  understood the tab would be divided later between the two planning  commissioners and von Elten's campaign committee.  </P> <P> Richard Harlow, a consultant who represents developers before the Huntington  Beach Planning Commission, said that he attended but didn't pay for his meal,  either.  </P> <P> "I didn't get a chit set in front of me," Harlow said. "I left money for a tip.  . . . You paid for the dinner at your own option." He said he assumed that he  would "settle up" with Slates later.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Councilman MacAllister said that both Nordeck and Slates spoke  to the group on behalf of the candidate and encouraged the guests -- most of  whom he described as South County businessmen -- to contribute to von Elten's  campaign.  </P> <P> MacAllister also said that von Elten was introduced to guests by both Nordeck  and Slates and that he then talked about his goals as a candidate and the  difficulty of financing a campaign.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Councilman John Erskine, who also attended, described the  dinner as "a very typical political event" where "it's understood that this is  the guy that X, Y and Z is supporting." Guests at such events, Erskine said,  are encouraged to make contributions at a later date rather than writing a  check at the dinner.  </P> <P> Erskine said he was driven to the dinner with MacAllister, Slates, and Harlow  in a chauffeured white limousine, for which each passenger chipped in $50.  Erskine said he paid no one for his meal and assumed that Slates had picked up  his tab. Erskine said he plans to report the dinner as a gift from Slates on  financial disclosure statements that public officials are required to file  under law.  </P> <P> "I was basically asked to go by Roger Slates, who's a friend and a member of  the Planning Commission," Erskine said.  </P> <P> Campaign manager Ellis refused to disclose who was invited to the dinner,  describing the guests only as leading South County businessmen who do not like  "politics and publicity."  </P> <P> Nordeck said he did not know who was invited to the dinner because he was not  involved in planning the affair.  </P> <P> But Ellis said that Nordeck invited von Elten.  </P> <P> And Supervisor Vasquez said Nordeck called one of his aides about two weeks ago  to inform him of the "meet and greet" dinner that was to be held at his  restaurant. Vasquez described it as a courtesy call and said Nordeck did not  invite him to attend.  </P> <P> Vasquez said he would reserve comment on the dinner until he learns more about  it.  </P> <P> When told of the dinner, Supervisor Wieder expressed surprise. "That's the  first I've heard of it," she said.  </P> <P> Among the guests at the dinner in Nordeck's restaurant were Irwin R. Schatzman  and Kevin A. Canning, both representatives of Arvida. In addition to the  sprawling Coto de Caza subdivision near Trabuco Canyon, the corporation is  planning the Rolling Hills development near San Clemente, which is under  preliminary review by county planners.  </P> <P> Schatzman, a planning consultant who represents the Coto de Caza project before  the county, declined to comment beyond referring questions about the dinner to  von Elten's campaign manager.  </P> <P> Canning, a director of governmental relations for Arvida, acknowledged that he  attended as a guest of Schatzman, who also attended. He said he paid no one for  his meal, but assumed that Schatzman had picked up the tab.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday with The Times, Canning at first said there was no  discussion at the dinner of von Elten's campaign and that guests were there  simply to watch the Los Angeles Lakers game on television.  </P> <P> When told that others had acknowledged that the campaign's finances were  discussed, Canning said: "There was a general discussion of what it cost him to  run a campaign but that was as far as it went."  </P> <P> On March 5, Canning spoke on behalf of Arvida's expansion plans for the  southern end of Coto de Caza, which includes construction of an additional golf  course to be surrounded by 90 single-family houses. The county planning staff  recommended against the proposal, according to minutes of the March 5 Planning  Commission meeting. The proposal remains under review, county officials said.  </P> <P> Both Nordeck and Slates participated in the commission's questioning of Canning  at the March 5 meeting, according to minutes of the meeting.  </P> <P> Barnard Klein, a lawyer for homeowners who recently filed a lawsuit over the  Planning Commission's approval of another expansion in the Coto de Caza  subdivision, said he found reports of the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant  troubling.  </P> <P> "I think that asking someone to do a favor when you're in a position to do  another favor exposes you, rightly or wrongly, to being accused of a conflict  of interest." Neither Schatzman nor Canning live in the 58th Assembly District,  which von Elten seeks to represent. (The district includes Huntington Beach,  Seal Beach and portions of Long Beach, among other areas. Voter records show  that Schatzman lives in Fountain Valley and Canning lives in San Clemente.)  </P> <P> At least one of von Elten's opponents, Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays,  said he has questions about the dinner at Nordeck's restaurant.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned about this race being funded by special interests," Mays said.  "That's exactly what is happening. He (von Elten) has left Huntington Beach,  where the money is tight, and gone down to the South County."  </P> <P> "It appears to me the Planning Commission is putting the squeeze on the  developers. The developers can't say no to planning commissioners. . . . If  they don't play ball, they don't get their projects approved."  </P> <P> Also present at Tuesday's dinner, according to Canning and others who attended,  was Lyle A. Overby, one of the county's most prominent lobbyists and a  representative of the Santa Margarita Co., which has an ongoing development  project in South County.  </P> <P> Overby, who ran unsuccessfully for a Santa Ana City Council seat last year,  declined to discuss the dinner.  </P> <P> "I was at no fund-raiser. . . . I don't have anything to discuss with the L.A.  Times," Overby said. "Where I am and what I do is of no concern of yours."  </P></p>

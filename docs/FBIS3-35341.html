The sources told Qatar News Agency that the two leaders also  pledged not to sign a unilateral peace accord with Israel, and  that progress should be achieved on all tracks.    The two leaders denounced Israeli attempts to reach separate  peace accords with Arab states involved in the peace process and  expressed strong support for the comprehensive peace formula  based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the  sources said. The sources noted that Syria emphasized that it  was politically committed to working for the implementation of  Security Council Resolution 425 calling on Israel to withdraw  from southern Lebanon.    The sources said Syria has already turned down an Israeli  offer to separate the question of the Israeli occupation of the  Syrian Golan Heights from the Israeli occupation of south  Lebanon, and at the same time, Syria reaffirmed that a balanced  solution should be achieved on all tracks.    Syria has succeeded in convincing the United States, via  recent contacts between Damascus and Washington, about the  importance of implementing Security Council Resolution 425, the  sources said.</p>

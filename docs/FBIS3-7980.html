			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "The Sun Is Rising in the </F> East: Trade (Not Only) With Russia Is Picking Up"]    [Text] The times when a protocol on mutual deliveries was  signed once a year, and when, after that, Czech enterprises  expedited goods in a "standard" way to the Soviet market, are  gone forever. The times when Czech enterprises waited  fruitlessly (and are still waiting) for payments--again in a  "standard" way--are also gone. It seems that the era of genuine  standard trade, without the quotation marks, has arrived. The  trading conditions, however, may not be quite standard yet, but  Czech manufacturers and exporters are rapidly learning to tackle  them.  <H5>  A Small Exporter Myth? </H5>   From the naivete of the questions that some Czech  entrepreneurs are asking of the Mixed Chamber of Commerce "East"  it can be inferred that small exporters are really a myth. If  someone who is interested in the Russian market is inquiring  whether there are custom fees in Russia, what can be sold there,  and who buys what, then he has no great chances. Maybe it is  this naivete that makes the Chamber prepare more educational  courses for Czech entrepreneurs--the beginners. The chairman of  the Chamber, Josef Cerny, as well as its secretary general,  Miroslav Cuker, are stressing that small exporters do not have  do be a myth, however, a completely unexperienced exporter is  certainly a myth. All those who have successes on the Russian  market today have experience and know their territory. If an  exporter knows what products he wants to export, when he has an  idea about the price and the quality, then he can much profit  from the Chamber. The Chamber is connected to a network of  about 60 regional chambers in Russia, and through them our  Chamber "releases" information onto the Russian market. The  Chamber has a secretariat in Moscow that, every month, publishes  the offers of the Czech and Slovak entrepreneurs, and mails them  to about 3,000 addresses. Anyway, any Czech entrepreneur can  buy the directory of Russian entities at the Chamber in Prague.  Prospective Czech suppliers to the Russian market can order a  tailor-made service at the Chamber, for instance, research into  the marketing conditions for their product. This research can  by a simple report or a profound analysis. Since the Chambers  has its own contacts and Russian experts participate in drafting  the analyses, the results can really be considered to be real  information, and not imagination. As a service to its members  (and for a fee to nonmembers) the Chamber regularly publishes  commercial information, for instance, Russian laws, lists of  enterprises, privatization rules, instructions for establishing  joint ventures in Russia, etc., etc. The Chamber is capable of  securing the participation of Czech entities in Russian  expositions, and some expositions were even organized by the  Chamber (in Almaaty in April this year, and in Moscow in June).  <H5>  The Road for a Small Exporter: An Association </H5>   The Association for the Development of Trade with the East  (APROV) was established at the beginning of the year as an  interest group involving Czech firms that wanted to assert  themselves (not only) on the Russian market. President of the  Association Jiri Sedlmajer (and not only he) says that small  manufactures cannot assert themselves on the Russian market  since they do not have funds to at least have their own man in  Moscow. He believes (again, he is not alone) that the physical  presence is the alpha and omega of the success. APROV has the  ambition to gradually establish offices not only in Moscow, but  in other interesting places, too. Only several dozens firms,  whose turnover runs from one to several million korunas, have  become members of the association so far. Most of them are from  the industrial and agricultural complex. According to the  Association's idea, their members can conduct trade not only in  the classical way--that is, for money--but partially also as  barter trade. The Association has a list of Czech firms that  are interested in certain Russian goods (wood, plastic  materials, fertilizers, etc.). The management of the  Association is prepared to provide information to their members  (for a fee to nonmembers) about the situation in Russia.    APROV is not the only organization of this type. Today,  there are more of them and all are counting on the common  denominator: One's own man on Russian territory, information  from the source, and willingness to conclude barter deals.   <H5>    The Success of the Great Ones: Inekon </H5>   Regarding the number of employees, Inekon Ltd. is a small  firm, but its turnover ranks it in a different category. About  30 people made 1.7 billion [currency not specified] last year,  and the company foresees 2 billion this year. The company was  established in 1990, and made a profit in the trade in chemical  products. Later, they returned to trading in products with which  the founders have experience: engineering products. Director  Josef Husek admits that even their experience was not good  enough to prevent the company "falling for" the so-called spisky  [Russian word for lists] that were drafted by the then Soviet  Union and the Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Ministry. In good  faith, believing that these lists were a binding document,  Inekon exported 200 CKD-made [Ceskomoravska Kolben Danek-made]  locomotives to the Soviet Union. Only half of them have been  paid for, the rest represents their dollar-denominated claim in  Russia. Josef Husek affirms that the company is delivering  goods to Russia and other former countries of the Soviet Union  only against cash payments (in convertible currencies), and even  against advance cash payments. According to Husek, Western  European, U.S., and Japanese firms set the same conditions. The  Inekon company is trading on its own account. It exports  locomotives, street cars, and trolleybuses. According to the  company, enterprises in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, or  Kazakhstan are willing to pay, but the company is afraid that  Czech suppliers may not be able to manufacture and deliver the  required products on time. Inekon has certain reservations  about the Association of Czech Exporters and the assistance  provided by chambers [of commerce].  <H5>  A View From the Other Side </H5>   Alexander Safonov, chief of the Economic Department at the  Trade Mission of the Russian Federation, explains in good Czech  that the Czech-Russian trade has gotten over the "shocks"  already. In 1991, this trade survived the transition to  convertible currencies, in 1992, the breakup of the Soviet  Union, and in 1993, the establishment of the Czech Republic.  Nevertheless, Safonov stresses that the Russian market is far  from "easy," since the Russian industrial lobby is fighting for  the protection of the Russian market against "foreign  intruders." According to Safonov, Russian foreign trade is  liberal, and its legal and legislative basis is basically a  standard one. Nevertheless, while the list of products for  which import licenses are required is being reduced, the control  of the export of strategic materials is being intensified, and  so is the control of the quality of imported goods. Licenses  for the export of strategic materials are issued only within the  quotas fixed by the state (crude oil, gas, electricity,  nonferrous metals, corn, certain fish products, uncut diamonds,  etc.). By a decree of the Russian president last year, Russian  enterprises that are conducting trade with former COMECON [CEMA]  countries have been exempted from the obligation to sell half of  their foreign currency income to the state. However, this  applies only to the trade that is conducted in national  currencies, which, on the other hand, is not the case when  strategic materials are exported from Russia. Safonov believes  that the "trend to use national currencies in mutual trade  between the Russian Federation and the Czech Republic is a sound  trend, the development of which can contribute to the smoothness  of accounting." The Russian representative draws the attention  of the Czech manufacturers to the fact that the Czech products  will have to compete with Asian and Western products on the  Russian markets. The export of these products is often  subsidized. According to him, Asian and Western firms deliver  goods while using state-subsidized credits, and enjoy  state-provided support when establishing and operating  information services, etc.  <H5>  The Czech Government Is Also Doing Its Best </H5>   Jan Hronik, chief of the department in charge of countries  with transition economies at the Ministry of Industry and Trade,  points to the fact that we have succeeded in stopping the  decline in Czech exports into the countries of the former USSR,  while imports have declined, which means that the trade balance  has begun to improve. Last year's deficit declined by one third  compared with 1992. Hronik is saying that after the Czech  Republic was established, it was necessary to start negotiations  on drafting and signing standard legal documents, and, today,  they have been signed with Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other countries of the former USSR.  Today, the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the  Ministry of Industry and Trade, is drafting additional important  documents regarding the support for and the mutual protection of  investments, and on preventing double taxation. The Czech and  Russian sides have agreed on the establishment of the  Czech-Russian Intergovernmental Commission for solving the most  important and topical problems. The Czech claims certainly are  one of those problems. Ivan Kocarnik chairs the Czech part of  the Commission.    At present, a protocol on mutual deliveries of goods  between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation is being  drafted for 1994. A list of products in high demand will  certainly be attached as a supplement to this protocol.  Evidently, after the experience of 1991, no one in the Czech  Republic will consider these lists to be a guarantee for  exports--or payments.  <H5>  What About the Future? </H5>   Everyone with whom we have spoken--in the sphere of trade  and  in the state administration--agrees that Russia and the  countries of the former Soviet Union are, prospectively, a very  important market. To make these prospects materialize in the  nearest future, exporters must have the knowledge of the place,  the people, and the milieu. They must have their own man in  Russia. They must verify that their partner is solvent--at  least in rubles, since the Russian internal convertibility will  secure them access to the freely convertible currencies. Since  the Russian manufacturers are pushing for the protection of  their markets, it seems that the transfer of production into  Russia--that is, establishing joint ventures--could become a  partial solution. The infamous lack of technological discipline  is not necessarily an evil. When stricter control is applied,  discipline can be improved. Moreover, the sharp increase in  transport tariffs in Russia, which makes Czech imports logically  more expensive, would not play an important role if the  production was launched on the market there.    Some experts believe that joint ventures would contribute to  the unfreezing of Czech claims. However, the manufacturing and  commercial circles are pointing to the fact that the government  is expected to do something about it. The government should try  to find a global solution for dealing with the Russian side (a  task for the Intergovernmental Commission?). The Czech  Government is expected to persuade the Russian side to be more  willing to meet us halfway and to waive the requirement that the  exporters to the Czech Republic must "offer" half of their  foreign currency income to the Russian state coffers. This  requirement is hampering the development of barter deals,  despite the fact that Russia does have certain regards for the  suppliers from the former CEMA countries. When asked whether the  government should exert pressure on the Russian Government,  tradesmen speak about a trade-off. Of course, the Czech  exporters to Russia would be happy if a law existed on support  to exports that would provide them with easy access to cheaper  and long-term credits. They have come to terms with the fact  that guarantees are rare. The largest companies, however, want  to feel the "state" presence from time to time. The minister's  visit to these territories is also an important proexport  measure, despite the fact that he only shook hands and smiled at  everyone.</p>

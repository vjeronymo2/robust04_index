			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Resignation throws Brazilian presidential election wide open THE leader of Brazil's largest political party announced his resignation from the job last night. This surprise from Mr Orestes Quercia throws open the field for the country's presidential election next year, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. He has long been under pressure to quit as head of the Democratic Movement party (PMDB), in response to allegations of much corruption during his recent governorship of Sao Paulo state. However, he was thought to have stayed on course for his party's presidential candidacy.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Tricky tips from the horse's mouth - Serious Money Insider dealing is a criminal offence in Britain but directors' dealings are perfectly okay. So okay, in fact, that the Weekend FT publishes lists of such dealings regularly as a potentially useful tool for investors (this week's list can be found on page IV). The difference between the two comes down to the context. Essentially, insider dealings by directors are those where they can profit because of their superior knowledge of a company's affairs. For example, the stock exchange code bans them from dealing ahead of a company's results. This is because results often influence share prices. And a catch-all clause also forbids dealing whenever unpublished price sensitive information exists. It can be tricky for the outside observer to understand exactly where the line between acceptable directors' dealings and unacceptable insider dealing is drawn. Take, for example, the large sale of Telegraph shares in May by Hollinger, a company controlled by Canadian-born Telegraph chairman Conrad Black. When the management cut the newspaper's price last week, the Telegraph share price plunged. Investors who had bought shares from Hollinger were hopping mad and one of its brokers, Cazenove, has now resigned. The stock exchange cleared the sale because it found no evidence that a price cut was contemplated at the time of the share sale. But any other Telegraph shareholders who copied Hollinger's sale must now be counting their blessings. This is not an isolated example. In 1991, Alan Sugar sold a chunk of his large Amstrad shareholding and some of his co-directors followed suit. Four months later, the share price had halved. No wonder many investors reckon that following directors' dealings is like getting tips from the horse's mouth. In the United States, home of the serious investor, most fund managers and many private investors pore over such dealings. They are even catching on in Britain. But, like all investment indicators, directors' dealings need intelligent interpretation. Only a small minority are useful pointers. Generally speaking, it is more significant when directors buy than when they sell. Few people buy shares unless they expect them to rise. There are, however, lots of reasons for selling shares other than gloom about share price prospects. The director might, for example, simply need the extra money to buy a house or educate his kids. Directus, which provides the Weekend FT's weekly lists of directors' dealings has some other hints for would-be sleuths. Pay attention only to purchases which are meaningful in relation to the director's other holdings - say, 10 per cent or more. When more than one director buys at the same time, it is always worth a close look - unless they are just the token purchases of new directors. And if directors fail to take up shares in a rights issue, it is probably worth following their example. But directors' dealings should never be looked at in isolation. If a single director appears to be the only buyer in sight and everyone else in the market is worried, he could be fighting a losing battle, making him a dangerous man to follow. Look at any given deal in the light of earlier ones. If the directors have made massive sales near a market peak, a small purchase lower down does not necessarily mark a turning point. Remember, too, that the ban on dealings ahead of company announcements means that sales or purchases just before the barrier comes down may be particularly significant. Some directors - and some corporate shareholders - have an uncanny knack of getting their share dealing right while avoiding any hint of impropriety. Sir Phil Harris has always seemed to have as happy a touch in the stock market as he does in the carpet trade. The Beazer sale by the Hanson conglomerate caught the market just in time. And the Cayzer family, which is keeping its stake in new issue Exco (see page IV), has usually proved commendably canny in its stock market dealings. Always remember, though: even if you get your tips right from the horse's mouth, following them blindly is asinine. What a welcome sight. Still more competition is creeping into the financial services area. Abbey National, the building society turned bank, is nearly halving its overdraft rate. What is more, Abbey, unlike many competitors, does not charge a fee for allowing you to have an overdraft in the first place. True, Abbey is a minnow in this field. But its move could still exert some pressure on its larger rivals.</p>

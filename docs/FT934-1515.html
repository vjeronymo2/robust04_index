			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Revenue wins case on BES tax relief The Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that investors in two business expansion schemes issued by National Westminster Bank, Hambros Bank and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, are entitled to tax relief. The appeal was brought by the Inland Revenue in a case hinging on what is meant by the issue of a share. Lord Justices Dillon and Mann found for the Revenue with Lord Justice Hirst dissenting. NatWest said it was disappointed and was considering with Barclays an appeal to the House of Lords. A decision on this will be taken next week. The Revenue argued that shares in the Homeshare scheme, issued in February by NatWest in conjunction with Hambros Bank, and BZW's Gracechurch business expansion scheme, had not been issued in a way which would allow investors to qualify for tax relief. Loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months while retaining full tax relief, were abolished in the March Budget. The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. As a result, the Revenue did not accept that the shares qualified for tax relief. In July, the High Court found in favour of the banks and against the Revenue by ruling that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning.</p>

By the end of 1993, the region was making use of about 300  million U.S. dollars-worth of World Bank loans for seven  projects, involving the sectors of education, agriculture,  communications and public health.    Xinjiang started using loans from the World Bank in 1985. By  1989, most of the projects aided by the World Bank were in the  education sector, such as Xinjiang's Agricultural School,  Training Center for Middle and Primary School Teachers, TV  University of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and some local  universities.    After these projects, Xinjiang began to use World Bank loans  for economic construction including an agricultural project in  the Tarim Basin and a water supply project and an environment  improvement project in rural areas.    The water supply project benefited ten counties while the  the  agricultural project in the Tarim Basin reclaimed 80,000  hectares of wasteland and transformed 12,000 hectares of  low-yield fields.    About 400,000 farmers and herdsmen benefited from the World  Bank projects.    Recently, the World Bank has been planning to help  infrastructure construction in Xinjiang more.    The newly-planned projects include two highways, basic  education in poorer areas, and urban construction and  environment project in Urumqi, the region's capital.    It is expected that the bank loans for these projects will  be  440 million U.S. dollars.</p>

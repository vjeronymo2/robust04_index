			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / CSA address rules to tighten The government is to tighten rules governing the Child Support Agency to ensure that addresses of separated parents are not disclosed. The announcement by Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, came as the government told MPs that proposed changes to the way the agency functions are expected to take effect from next Monday. The new arrangements - due to be debated by parliament this week - will effect a number of changes, including enabling absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18 months. They follow a government review of the CSA conducted late last year after widespread anger over the formula used to calculate maintenance. The government yesterday remained under fire over the agency from all sides of the House of Commons, including its own back benches. Mr Burt rebutted a call by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, to consider following an Australian precedent by introducing a system of review officers. The Australian system was 'far more rough and ready', the minister said. Mr Burt's pledge on not disclosing addresses followed a warning by Mr Kevin Hughes, Labour MP for Doncaster North, that the leaking of confidential information while investigating fathers refusing to pay for their children's upkeep could lead to violence.</p>

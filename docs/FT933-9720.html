			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / How to Spend It: A craftsman by design - Big designers grab the headlines but sometimes the smaller workshops and ateliers give greater pleasure. Those heading for Italy might like to know that there are some little-known craftsmen and designers whose wares are well worth tracking down SILVANO CELLERINI is unashamed in his admiration of Hermes of Paris. As a young and penniless repairer of handbags in a one-room business inherited when his uncle died in the 1940s, he would marvel at the perfection of the craftsmanship, design and materials of the Hermes bags brought in for repair by frugal aristocratic Florentines. In his words: 'I had no money to buy the leather and make the bags.' One day a customer brought him her Hermes bag and asked him to copy it. Cellerini's fate was sealed. 'People said: 'it is not possible for you, Silvano Cellerini, so young and so poor, to copy Hermes'. It was a challenge. The Signora gave me the bag and said 'copy this please', so I copied.' In 1956 he moved to a one-room workshop in 16th century premises in the via del Sole in Florence and sold his entirely hand-made bags and belts direct to customers from the workshop. This was at a time when many people were producing Hermes 'knock-offs', but only Cellerini made them with the same skill and minute attention to detail upon which Hermes prides itself. Cellerini hand-cuts the leather from life-sized cardboard patterns for each part, from tiny straps to handles and buckles and fastenings. Some 200 to 600 different patterns hang from the wonderful period ceiling in his upstairs workshop. His designs are the epitome of restrained Florentine elegance, with imaginative use of coloured leathers and juxtaposition of materials. Waterproofed canvas and feather-weight Japanese pigskin are married with box leather. Belts that conceal money and credit card holders, and handbags with secret panels to foil muggers and pickpockets, are masterpieces of design. Cellerini's prices are less than half those of Hermes and are cheap when compared with those of factory-made designer leather goods. Meanwhile his profits are inevitably healthy - with no global market hype to bankroll. Publicity is strictly by word of mouth. The elegant shop at 37R via del Sole  -below his original workshop - is a testimony to his success. The business embraces himself, his daughter Alessandra and her fiance Alessandro, plus three craftsmen - two of whom have been with the family firm for 34 years and 25 years respectively. When her mother died four years Alessandra stepped into her shoes as works manager and now she supervises 'the factory' and the hand stitching of leather pieces. Cellerini claims his is the last remaining 'factory' in this historic part of Florence. In the stockroom adjoining the workshop above the shop, rolls of luscious leathers - pastel suedes from France and box calf from Italy, France and Germany, all dyed in jewel colours - are lined up on shelves. 'The best tanneries are in France and Germany,' explains Alessandra. Twenty years ago, Cellerini used to send out a catalogue of drawings of his designs to clients. No more. 'The customers who know our quality do not need a catalogue: they fax us and we fax back a drawing with dimensions, and quote a price. They order, we make the bag.' The fax number is 055-283 109. The telephone number is 055-283 533. The leatherwear is only available from the VIa del Sole and will stay that way: Alessandra and Alessandro are intent on keeping the business intact. 'We want only to speak direct to our customers. We enjoy the business: it brings us joy,' explains Alessandra.</p>

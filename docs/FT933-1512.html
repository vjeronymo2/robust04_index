			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Iberia may close Miami hub in drive to cut costs IBERIA, the state-owned Spanish national airline, is considering closing its hub in Miami - less than two years after opening the centre from which it hoped to service routes to Central America and the Caribbean. Mr Juan Saez, who was named as Iberia's new managing director in a management shake-up following the departure earlier this month of the chairman, Mr Miguel Aguilo, said yesterday that the hub was losing about Pta2bn (Dollars 15.5m) a year. A firm decision to close it down would be taken in the next two weeks, he said. Mr Saez said that the possible closure of the hub was among a number of measures that the airline was studying in an effort to bring down costs. Iberia, he said, was on course this year to make operating losses of around Pta11bn. The airline was finding competition from North American airlines too tough, Mr Saez said, and there was no point 'fighting battles you cannot win'. A new cost-cutting programme - which would affect the airline's routes at home and abroad, and the size of its fleet - would be quickly implemented in order to bring those losses to zero by the end of this year. Mr Saez said he recognised that this was an ambitious target. The Miami hub was one of the most prestigious manifestations of Iberia's ambitions, developed under Mr Aguilo, to become the leading European airline serving the transatlantic routes to Spanish-speaking America. As part of the same drive, Mr Aguilo bought large stakes in a variety of Latin American airlines, including Aerolineas Argentinas. Mr Saez said that there were no plans to shed any of the assets bought in Latin America. Like his predecessor, he believes that Iberia will be unable to escape the creation of larger airlines in Europe - through mergers or acquisitions - and that the carrier's large South American assets will lend it greater muscle when negotiating with potential partners. However, Mr Saez said that there was no point in Iberia even talking to other airlines while it was still making heavy losses. It needed to finance the costs of fleet renewal, the South American expansion and the losses of the past three years. 'If Iberia is not capable of generating profits then its financial problems are unsolvable,' Mr Saez said. Iberia would be in a position to talk to other airlines next year, he said. Iberia's debts totalled some Pta300bn, Mr Saez explained, half of which was long term. He expected the airline to make similar losses in 1993 as in last year, when the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pta42.2bn. The government injected Pta120bn into the airline last year and Mr Saez said he did not expect any more aid from the state.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Patten may act over doubts on GCSE standards URGENT ACTION to rectify an alleged decline in standards in the GCSE exam is being considered by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. He took the highly unusual step of issuing press comments yesterday after a report by the schools inspectorate cast doubt on the reliability of this year's results, sent out last week. The inspectorate's report has yet to be published, and has not been made available. However, according to Mr Patten, it expressed 'little confidence that standards are being maintained' and that 'the evidence could point to a gradual erosion of standards since the introduction of the GCSE in 1988'. In particular, the inspectorate was concerned at the objectivity of marking  -especially of coursework - and about assessment of spelling, punctuation and grammar. Results for this year's GCSE, the main exam for 16-year-olds in England and Wales, showed more than half of all pupils achieving the top three grades, generally considered to be the pass standard. In 1987, the proportion achieving grades A to C in O level, replaced by GCSE a year later, was 39.8 per cent. The examination boards said the improvement was due to teachers' increasing familiarity with the exams and better preparation of pupils. Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, last week appeared to endorse this view, congratulating pupils and parents and commenting: 'We can look forward to seeing more students than ever continuing in education beyond the age of 16.' However, Mr Patten yesterday backed Tory critics of the GCSE examiners. He said the inspectorate's report, given to him last week, indicates 'possible problems with the independent groups that conduct the GCSE exam'. The inspectorate visited the four examining groups responsible for the GCSE in England to observe the different stages in the examination process. Mr Patten has asked the boards to comment on the report by the end of the month. He will then consider appropriate action - though it is not clear what that might be, short of eliminating all coursework (now mostly limited to 20 per cent of total marks) or seeking to instruct boards to reduce the proportion of higher grades awarded in future years. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said Mr Patten's decision to comment on an unpublished report 'is a clear indication that he wants to affect its reception before it is released'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the report was 'a slap in the face' for young people who had just received their results.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lehman's world turns full circle  -Richard Waters considers the prospects for the firm after its spin-off For Lehman Brothers, the world will turn full circle in April. It will be exactly 10 years since the then-private investment banking firm, torn by rivalries between its partners, was sold to American Express. It is also likely to be the month the credit card group spins off Lehman Brothers again, replete with Dollars 1.25bn of new capital to enable it to become an independent company. The demise of the old Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in 1984 was one of Wall Street's greatest dramas. Its sale, after 134 years as a private firm, was triggered by a power-struggle at the top of the firm, setting off a chain-reaction of rivalries between Lehman's 44 partners. For American Express, it represented a way, along with the acquisition of the Shearson retail broking firm, to expand into businesses which were projected - rightly - to become among the financial industry's biggest profit-earners. Yet the credit card group was never able to generate the same profits as others in the industry, and has been bent on selling businesses in the past two years to shore up its core credit card and other consumer finance businesses. Lehman's new freedom emerged late on Monday, as American Express announced it would spin off the company to the group's shareholders in the form of a tax-free dividend, expected to be completed in April. To gain a single-A rating from credit rating agencies, essential for any financial company which has a large inventory of stocks and other securities to finance, Lehman's capital base is being boosted with Dollars 1.25bn of new capital, Dollars 1.09bn provided by American Express and Dollars 160m by Lehman's employees. The Lehman set to emerge from under American Express's wing is in many ways similar to the Lehman of 10 years ago, although it is considerably larger. It has always been seen primarily as an investment banking firm, known for its underwriting and corporate advisory work, rather than as a trading house. Yet Lehman had been building a trading business in the fixed income and money markets before the sale to American Express - headed at the time by Mr Richard Fuld, the firm's current president and chief executive. The firm continues to be known mainly for its investment banking work, although trading has become the bigger revenue-earner. Last year, while investment banking income rose a steady 19 per cent, to Dollars 802m, trading income soared by 47 per cent, to Dollars 1.6bn. The challenge facing Lehman is to lift profitability to secure its position as one of the so-called 'bulge bracket' of banks that dominate investment banking both in the US and internationally. Judged by its projected equity capital base, Lehman looks to be firmly in the leading group. The Dollars 1.25bn injection will catapult it towards the top of the league, giving it total capital of Dollars 3.3bn. At that level, it may not stand exactly shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like Merrill Lynch (which had Dollars 4.6bn of equity a year ago, a figure which is likely to have risen considerably since) and Salomon (Dollars 4.3bn). Yet it still ranks as one of the biggest institutions, and has come a long way since 1991, when its equity base was a mere Dollars 1bn. The extra capital is a mixed blessing. Even with its smaller equity base, Lehman's earnings last year - Dollars 376m after tax, leaving aside one-off items - gave it a lower return on capital than most of its rivals. With the swollen equity base, return on capital will look weaker still - just 14 per cent post-tax, based on last year's earnings, a scant return for a securities firm during what is widely seen as the peak of the market. American Express chairman Mr Harvey Golub certainly believes that the requirements of the rating agencies have left Lehman overcapitalised. As a result, the credit card group has kept an interest in the firm's future profits, which could allow it to take back Dollars 400m over the next eight years if Lehman's earnings rise above a certain level. Lehman has been striving for the past two years to lift revenue sources and improve profit margins. Known mainly for its fixed income expertise, Lehman has embarked on expansion primarily in foreign exchange, along with swaps and other derivatives markets. It has also invested in expanding its international operations in an attempt to catch up with the international dominance built up by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Competitors single out Lehman's lack of a US retail client base as a weakness (the Shearson broking business was sold to rival Smith Barney last year). However, the firm claims it has an adequate base of investors in the US, and has not targeted this as an area for investment.</p>

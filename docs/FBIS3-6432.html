			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sel A. Baysa] </F>   [Excerpt] A foreign-based Filipino communist leader, in a  letter intercepted by military authorities, said recently that  Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines  (CPP) chairman, is losing his grip on Philippine and Western  Europe cadres. Lucas Fernandez, believed to be the alias of  revisionist bloc leader Nathan Quimpo, wrote in a letter from  Amsterdam, The Netherlands, that Sison is no longer enjoying the  support of communist members abroad.    In a press statement, the Armed Forces of the Philippines  Civil Relations Service (CRS) quoted Quimpo as saying "almost  all solidarity groups in Western Europe, North America, and the  Asia- Pacific Region have started distancing themselves from  Sison."    Quimpo said the Sison-led Stalinist bloc has lost support  from revolutionary, progressive, and centrist political parties,  including the Eurocommunities, left socialists, "greens," social  democrats, and labor parties. As gleaned in his letter, he said  over 60 percent of CPP members in Western Europe and 70 percent  of National Democratic Front (NDF) members in the Philippines  oppose Sison's leadership.    He accused Sison of steering the underground movement  towards  a more extremist and violent strategy against the government.  "Sison is slowly transforming the CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party  of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front]  into another Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)," Quimpo said.

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Supplementing a pension I have retired and, to supplement my pension, I propose letting two rooms in my principal residence as bed-sits under the government scheme which allows an annual income of Pounds 3,250 without tax liability. 1. As this is my principal residence, will letting the rooms affect the CGT exemption? 2. If I keep within the Pounds 3,250 limit, need I declare this income on my annual tax return? 1. No (so far as we can deduce from the facts given). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and IR87 (Rooms to let). 2. Yes. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

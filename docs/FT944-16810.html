			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Free zone at centre of Turk trading hopes  -Eric Watkins visits a site well placed for new emerging markets Cases of galvanised steel, piles of aluminium ingots, and crates of electric fans testify to the growing importance of the Turkish city of Trabzon as a free trade zone. Located at the south-east corner of the Black Sea, Trabzon is well placed as a centre for trade with the newly emerging markets of the former Soviet Union. 'The fall of the Soviet Union has in fact played a crucial part in our new-found success,' says Mr Alaattin Yuksel, governor of the region. 'Trabzon's historic role as a key centre of east-west trade ended temporarily when the communists closed off the main trading routes. . . . Those routes can (now) be reopened and trade resumed, much to our benefit,' he says. Some of those benefits have already become apparent, especially through the growing influx of former Soviet citizens clamouring to buy Turkish goods for re-sale at home. According to Mr Yuksel, Trabzon last year had more than 750,000 visitors from the former Soviet Union, most of them on day trips via the Black Sea resort of Sochi. But the Turkish government envisions even greater benefits from Trabzon's free trade zone, one of five in the country. Established in June 1992, the free trade zone is owned and managed by Transbas Trabzone Serbest Bolge Isleticisi, a joint venture between the Turkish government's Maritime Corporation, the UK's Balli Group, and the Marubeni Corporation of Japan. The zone occupies 16 acres of the port area and offers 5,500 sq m of warehouse space in the first phase of its development. Two further phases are planned that will see warehouse facilities doubled to 11,000 sq m, including 1,500 sq m of cold storage facilities. Further developments will consist of storage tanks for chemicals and edible oils, as well as grain silos and bagging facilities for sugar and fertilisers. Current facilities in the port consist of seven quays, with a capacity of 2,000 ships a year and a modern container terminal. Cargo handling is, according to the port authorities, provided on a two-shift basis for 17 hours a day while pilotage is available 24 hours a day. Onward delivery by road is handled by local operators with up to 1,500 trucks available monthly, depending on seasonal demand. Trabzon's free trade zone has so far relied exclusively on sea and road transport. There are plans to link in the local airport as well. But even without use of the airport facilities, trade through the free zone has boomed. Indeed, in dollar terms, the total volume of trade has increased nearly five-fold in just more than two years of operations. 'The volume of trade for the first six months this year alone equalled last year's and we expect to repeat that performance in the next six months,' says Mr Kerim Kalafatoglu, chief executive officer of Cey International Trading, a firm which trades within the zone. 'Location is a primary asset, especially with the emerging markets in central Asia.' To capitalise on those markets Turkish businessmen are aiming to establish further free trade zones in neighbouring countries and to link them with Trabzon by road transport. The Ulusoy group, predominant in Turkish long-haul trucking, but also with interests in oil and insurance, have already begun negotiations for such zones in Batumi, Tiblisi, and Baku. Their aim, ultimately, is to use the linkages as a trade corridor with the central Asian republics, oil-rich Kazakhstan in particular. So far the bulk of trade through the Trabzon free zone has been from the west with European countries supplying nearly 45 per cent of the goods passing through the port. Much of that trade has involved industrial materials and such traffic is expected to increase substantially as developments associated with oil take off in nearby Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Authorities in Trabzon's free zone hope that such developments will stimulate an increased flow of trade from the east. But Turkish ambitions do not end there. 'The Turks,' says a local businessman, 'remember the days of their empire and are seeking to re-establish their presence through trade in all directions of historic interest whether in central Asia, the Middle East or North Africa'. 'Watch and you will see. The Turks are on the move and Trabzon plays a key role in their plans.'</p>

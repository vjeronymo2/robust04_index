			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / 'Miscarriage of justice' body faces delay The government has signalled that legislation to set up a body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice will not come until 1995-96 at the earliest by excluding it from its list of core bills for the autumn. A further criminal justice bill is not among the 10 or so measures the cabinet has decided definitely to include in the Queen's Speech in November. Supporters of the new body think the bill could still 'sneak under the wire' if ministers decided against pressing ahead with more controversial legislation - such as a Post Office privatisation bill - or if the bills on the list were unexpectedly short. One alternative being considered is to publish a draft bill setting out the government's proposals for the new body, which was recommended by last year's report of the royal commission on criminal justice. This would have the advantage of enabling the government's plans to be discussed in advance in some detail. Earlier this year Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said it was important not to rush proposals involving such significant constitutional change. The government came under attack in December for not including the creation of the Criminal Cases Review Authority in this year's criminal justice bill, which is currently before parliament. Ministers were accused at the time of ignoring those royal commission recommendations which did not suit its immediate purpose. Under government proposals presented in March the authority would act as a body of last resort after normal avenues of appeal had been exhausted and would have the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal.</p>

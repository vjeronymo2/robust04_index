			<p>BFN     [Text] Inchon, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Two South Korean fishing  boats were seized by Chinese patrol boats with their fishermen  aboard last month for violating the Chinese territorial waters.    One of the two has been set free on the condition of  arranging the payment of a fine. A source at the Inchon Maritime  Police said on Monday Tongwon-ho No. 61 and Tongwon-ho No. 62,  both dragnet fishing boats based in Inchon, were seized by the  Chinese around 3 PM April 16 while they were catching fish  beyond the Korea-China fishery self-restraint line.    The Chinese, while keeping Tongwon-ho. No. 62 as hostage,  released Tongwon-ho No. 61 on the following day, April 17, with  the order to arrange the payment of 80,000 U.S. dollars in a  fine.    The owner of the freed ship refused to pay the fine and  Tongwon-ho No. 62 is still held in captivity in China, the  source said.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / US dismisses Tokyo's target to trim surplus Japan plans to set a target for cutting its record current account surplus, in what seems an inadequate attempt to defuse its trade row with the US. The cabinet yesterday agreed to produce a market-opening plan by the end of March, including a goal proposed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, to reduce the surplus to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product, or Dollars 125bn (Pounds 84bn), this year, from the estimated 3.1 per cent of GDP for the year to the end of March. The current account surplus was Dollars 131.35bn in the last calendar year. This goal - not a binding pledge - is already in the government's economic target for the coming year, published two weeks ago. It received an instant dismissal from Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan: 'That's their current estimate. That wouldn't be anything. What we need is to bring about a highly substantial reduction of the current account surplus over the next four years.' The plan to set a firm goal for a reduction in the surplus also ran into criticism from Mrs Manae Kubota, director-general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, which draws up the government's economic targets. It has managed to stick to few of its own current account targets since the agency started compiling them in 1955, she pointed out. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration had no immediate response to Japan's latest efforts to formulate a trade peace plan. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, issued a statement of support for a tough new trade bill, introduced on Thursday by Congressman Dick Gephardt, Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives, and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. The bill would require the US Commerce Department unilaterally to set targets for foreign import penetration in Japan.</p>

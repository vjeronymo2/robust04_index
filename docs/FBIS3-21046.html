According to the spokesperson, Sweden's military authorities  grew very circumspect after a Saab JAS 39-Gripen crashed on 8  August 1993, during a demonstration, near the downtown area of  Sweden's capital. The pilot could no longer steer the aircraft  because of a failure in the control lever.    During a test bench session "sizable vibrations"  were registered in the engine's turbine.</p>

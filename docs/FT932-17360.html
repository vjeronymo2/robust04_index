			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: City of Angels - Theatre There is one fault in City of Angels: the first act is about 10-15 minutes too long. For the rest, however, here must be the wittiest musical that has ever been written. The wit runs all the way through: in Cy Coleman's music (largely jazz); in the lyrics by David Zippel; in the sets and the pace of the scene-changing designed by Robin Wagner; in some remarkable acting performances, especially by Martin Smith; and, above all, in the script by Larry Gelbart. The overall direction by Michael Blakemore almost never misses a trick. Although it is set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, Angels succeeds without resort to nostalgia, sentimentality or repetition. It is just sheer brilliant fun. Indeed there is one scene towards the end that made me think that the principal influence is not the Hollywood greats, but Pirandello. For Angels is about illusions and reality. There are other influences, of course. Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is among them. The piece is full of one-liners that could have come straight from Chandler's pages. As we look at the distinctly striking blonde, Mrs Kingsley, the comment is: 'Only the floor kept her legs from going on for ever.' When she offers the detective Dollars 10,000, he calculates; 'Next to Mrs Kingsley, that was the best figure in the room.' All of that is played very fast and not allowed to get in the way of other treasures. Some of the one-liners range wider. 'Everybody's in a movie,' says the Hollywood producer (Henry Goodman), 'sometimes we just turn the cameras on.' Goodman has earlier come out with the line that must be an editor's delight: 'Nothing any good was ever hurt by cutting.' The plot may be confusing. Basically, a script-writer is complaining that his best work keeps being not only changed, but hacked to pieces. At the same time, his text about money, sex and murder is being played out in real life. It is not always clear where real life ends and fantasy begins. Again, that is part of the charm and the relentless pace. It does not matter if you cannot keep up. The lyrics are cerebral, specialising in clever off-rhymes: 'It would be wiser/ If I kept my eyes off/ Her thighs', 'If you're not celibate, Let's make the hell of it.' Occasionally Zippel over-reaches himself, but I still admire the ambition of: 'Your fertile lies/ Don't fertilise'. Just as in the script there is a wonderful line from an old 1940s radio disc jockey: 'Just listen to this melody - you'll think your ears are getting laid.' There is no nostalgia here, but there is some gentle satire. The music is good, too, and compels attention, for it seldom repeats itself. 'With Every Breath I Take,' sung by Fiona Hendley as Bobbi, is breathtaking. It has one reprise, but no-one could complain that anything in this show is milked. In the acting, the summa cum laude goes to Martin Smith as the script-writer, Stine. This is the equivalent of the straight male lead: handsome, but dull. You would expect him to be overshadowed by the detective, Stone (Roger Allam), yet one of the pleasures is how he grows in his part and Stine and Stone come together. Sometimes Smith just stands there: on a large stage in a large theatre it takes a lot of self-confidence to do that. Angels, in short, is a hugely ambitious piece that reaches for the top and makes it. You may see now why I gave less than alpha to Kiss of the Spiderwoman, Carousel and Crazy for You.

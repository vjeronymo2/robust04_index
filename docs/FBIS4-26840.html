			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read video report; from the "National News </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, vice chairmen of the  Central Military Commission, recently inspected bases -- bases  operated by the Commission of Science and Technology for  National Defense -- for testing missiles, satellites, and  weapons as well as air dynamics research. After the inspection,  they pointed out: Efforts must be made to study and solve  problems of logistics support for units stationed in remote  areas where life is hard. The General Logistics Department  should immediately send working groups to remote bases to  investigate the problems of technical units' grass-root depots  and stations and problems with housing, drinking water, bathing,  heating, medical services, communications, transport, children's  care, and schooling. The department should also earmark special  funds to rebuild research facilities and improve the working and  living conditions of scientists and technicians who have long  been living in areas where life is hard.

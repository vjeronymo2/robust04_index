			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Prohibition on Use of ``Running'' Proxies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conversion regulations have been revised to prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies and to require the use of a proxy specifically designated for the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of commenters addressing the revision supported the prohibition of ``running'' proxies because it better ensures that members understand the proposed change in the association's organization. A few commenters expressed concern for the high costs of using professional proxy solicitation firms but none thought the costs were overly burdensome. Those commenters who opposed the prohibition asserted that there were already sufficient safeguards, that the old rule worked well since ``running'' proxies were only used if a member did not send a proxy or vote in person, that detailed disclosure was included in the proxy statements, and that the prohibition is an added expense for converting institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended adoption of a requirement that 50% of those voting approve the conversion, rather than the existing requirement that the conversion be approved by a 50% vote of all depositors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS agrees with the majority of commenters and continues to believe that the prohibition of ``running'' proxies is the most effective manner in which to assure an increased role for an association's membership in the conversion process. Accordingly, no change has been made to the interim final rule. Thus, 12 CFR 563b.6(e) will continue to require approval of the plan of conversion by at least a majority of the total outstanding votes of the association's members, unless state law requires a higher percentage for a state-chartered converting savings association, in which case the higher percentage will be used. Finally, the final rule revises section 575.13(a)(4) of the mutual savings and loan holding companies regulation to clarify the prohibition on the use of ``running'' proxies and the requirement for the use of a specifically designated proxy for a mutual holding company reorganization, mutual-to-stock conversion undertaken either by a mutual savings association or a mutual holding company, or any other material transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Re-Prioritize Stock Purchase by Tax-Qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its interim final rule, the OTS revised the stock purchase priorities so as to give eligible account holders first priority and tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans second priority. The conversion regulations continue to give supplemental eligible account holders third priority and all other voting members who have subscription rights fourth priority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of the commenters recommended that the ESOP be given first priority; a few commenters affirmatively supported giving the ESOP second priority. The commenters that recommended giving the ESOP first priority asserted that employees make the organization successful and should have the first stake in the company's performance, that the plans do not favor higher paid officers, but promote greater productivity and motivation, that the plans do not prevent long-term depositors from purchasing conversion stock, and that they protect institutions from hostile takeover situations. These commenters further asserted that if the ESOP is not established in the conversion, it will be established later and will dilute shareholders' ownership interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters requested that the methodology for distribution of shares in the event of oversubscription be clarified. The commenters requested that the regulation be written to make clear the intent that the ESOP would be able to purchase stock through open market purchases or through authorized but unissued shares in the event of an oversubscription. If this was not the intent of the regulation, one commenter requested that the OTS clarify that it will grant a waiver or no-action letter to permit the ESOP or any other tax-qualified plan to purchase shares in the open market immediately following conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the preamble to the interim final rule, although the OTS believes that it is still appropriate to provide management incentives and to encourage employee stock ownership in the converted association, these interests have been overshadowed by other factors. The former provision which granted a first priority to tax-qualified employee benefit plans was a means to afford undercapitalized mutual savings associations a measure of anti-takeover protection through the opportunity to place a significant block of conversion stock in friendly hands, and thus, encourage capital raising through conversion. Because most mutual savings associations are now healthy, there is a need to balance the interests of management and employees against those of account holders by providing core depositors at mutual savings associations the first opportunity to buy conversion stock. The final rule will continue to give eligible account holders first priority. The wording of 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(23) has been revised to clarify that eligible account holders have first priority to purchase conversion stock, tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans have second priority, supplemental eligible account holders have third priority, and other voting members who have subscription rights have fourth priority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

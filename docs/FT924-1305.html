			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: American Express may sell control of Shearson Lehman AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services and travel group searching for a successor to Mr James Robinson, chairman and chief executive, is considering the sale of majority control of its wholly-owned Shearson Lehman Brothers stockbroking and investment banking unit. The group declined to comment yesterday, but executives are said to have prepared a plan under which shares in Shearson could be offered to the public. A company insider, who asked not to be named, warned yesterday the plan was not the only option for Shearson, which has proved an expensive albatross for the American Express group. The share plan is likely to be discussed by the board of American Express in January. If it is approved, it could result in a one-time write-off charge by American Express of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn. Although Shearson made Dollars 43m of net profits in the first nine months of 1992, it suffered a Dollars 25m third-quarter loss compared with Dollars 63m net income in the third quarter of last year. The only comment American Express would offer yesterday was to say its strategic goal was to bring Shearson back to where it could achieve a single-A credit rating as a stand-alone company. The present rating of its senior long-term debt is single-A3. The board is also wrestling with the question of a replacement for Mr Robinson, who earlier this month said he would give up his job as chief executive during 1993. The American Express board is believed to be divided over the choice of Mr Robinson's successor with some directors in favour of Mr Harvey Golub, the group's president, and others opposed. Mr Golub is believed to be the personal choice of Mr Robinson, who is heading the search committee.</p>

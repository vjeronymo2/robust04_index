			<p>BFN     [Text] A resistance group detonated an explosive device on  the Sifray-Rum road at 0900 today, destroying a vehicle and  killing the Kafr Falus post commander on the spot.    The Islamic Resistance has called for participation in the  funerals of Martyrs Nasrallah 'Abd-al-Hasan Zahir and Ayman  Hamzi Ba'labakki, who fell in a clash with the occupation forces  on the Bi'r Kallab-al-Rayhan road.    At dawn today the occupation forces shelled Qabrikha with  tank guns, causing damage to houses and crops. The shelling  extended to Wadi al-Saluqi.    In retaliation for the enemy's continuing attacks, a  Resistance group at dawn today attacked the agents' [South  Lebanese Army] positions in Tallusah and al-Qantarah, in the  central sector of the occupied border strip. A clash ensued  with the guards of the two positions, involving the use of  rockets and automatic weapons. No reports about the results of  the two operations have been received.</p>

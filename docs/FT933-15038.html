			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: So silly not to make a will PROPOSED changes to the intestacy laws announced by the lord chancellor, Lord Mackay, should be a powerful incentive to avoid dying without a will, or intestate. Although the changes, implementing most of the recommendations made by the Law Commission, improve the position of surviving partners, not all can become law at once. Anomalies may arise during the transition. Mackay said the government wanted to enable most surviving spouses to stay in the matrimonial home with enough to live on - size of estate permitting. As more than 90 per cent of people dying without wills in England and Wales leave less than Pounds 125,000 net, he is to make an order 'as soon as practicable' increasing from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 125,000 the statutory legacy (or fixed net amount) to be paid to a surviving spouse with children, and from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 200,000 the amount going to survivors without children. The government chose to make these increases rather than accept the commission's recommendation that a surviving spouse should always receive the entire estate left by someone dying intestate, as this might have been unfair to children from a previous marriage. Other changes which will have to wait for parliamentary time are the abolition of a provision known as the 'hotch-pot' rule; the introduction of a 14-day survivorship clause; and increased discretion for the courts in the treatment of unmarried people living together. The hotch-pot rule affects very few estates but lays down that, in certain circumstances, children wishing to inherit must bring into account any money or property paid to them, or settled for their benefit, by the person who has died intestate. This can mean that amounts received up to seven years before have to count against any pay-out due from the estate. The survivorship clause to be included in the intestacy rules will provide that surviving wives or husbands will inherit only if they outlive their partner by at least 14 days. Under the present rules, if a husband and wife die simultaneously or within a short time of each other, the younger is treated as having died first. (If the couple had wills, the older partner would be assumed to have died first.) 'The reason is to preserve the estates for the respective families,' said Pauline Walker, a solicitor specialising in family law with Manches &amp; Co. 'Saying that the younger died first in effect ignores that estate.' So a younger wife who survives her husband by fewer than 14 days will be deemed to have died before him. Walker added that the change on survivorship would also cut down on administration costs, but saw no obvious explanation for the choice of 14 days given that, in most wills, the survivorship clause covers 30 days. Unmarried partners will still have to go to court if they are to receive anything from the estate of the person they were living with. But instead of having to prove complete dependence, they will be able to apply for 'reasonable financial provision,' meaning reasonable for their maintenance. With a spouse, the same words would have a wider meaning: reasonable in all the circumstances whether or not required for maintenance. The commission rejected the idea of any automatic provision for unmarried co-habitees. 'The general feeling was if you are not prepared to take on the burdens of marriage, it did not seem right you should reap the benefits,' said Walker, describing the proposed changes as a nod towards co-habitees. The new rules will give the courts wider discretion in deciding how much of an estate an unmarried partner should receive. In particular, they will be allowed to take into account such factors as the age of the person applying for a share of the estate, how long they have been living with their late partner, and what contribution each had made to the household. Claims from unmarried partners will remain subject heavily to the discretion of the courts, with decisions based on past cases as well as the modified rules. 'The advice has to be - make a will,' said Walker. 'If you don't, you are going to leave an unholy mess.' As an example, she said that if a married man had been maintaining another woman and died without a will, the other woman could claim against the estate. At the same time, the wife could apply for more than the statutory provision. Walker added: 'If you make a will there can be disputes, but this is less likely provided it is not totally off the wall with outrageous provisions cutting out dependents. If you take advice, it won't be. It will stand up.'</p>

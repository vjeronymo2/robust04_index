			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Setback for Canadian Airlines' survival plan CANADIAN Airlines Inter-national's survival plan, including a CDollars 246m (USDollars 195m) equity infusion from American Airlines, has hit a new obstacle. An Ontario court dismissed an application by PWA, Canadian's parent company, to have the Gemini Group computer reservations company declared insolvent. This would have allowed PWA to leave Gemini for American's Sabre system  - a condition of the equity infusion. Gemini is jointly-owned by PWA and rival Air Canada and several smaller airlines. Air Canada is fighting the Canadian-American deal and maintains PWA's withdrawal from Gemini would bankrupt the group. In Calgary, Canadian said its lawyers would decide later this week whether to appeal the Ontario court decision.</p>

The premier urged an affiliated working group on information  and telecommunications to propose ways to ease regulations in  the two fields, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told  reporters. The panel was asked to report as soon as possible.    The group will meet once or twice a month and is expected to  make its proposals by the end of June. The next meeting is  scheduled for early April.

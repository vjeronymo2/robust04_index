			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Private-sector road project launched Four road building schemes worth a total of Pounds 380m are to be offered to private contractors under a government initiative to involve private-sector expertise in the management of roads. Mr John Watts, roads minister, yesterday announced the details of the roads to be included in the first stage of the government's 'design, build, finance and operate' programme. Contractors will be expected to design new roads or improvements to existing ones, finance their construction and manage and maintain the roads for the next 15 to 25 years. They will be paid 'shadow tolls' by the government which will reflect traffic volumes on the roads and the extent to which they meet set performance standards. The four schemes announced yesterday are: A Pounds 190m project to build a 19-mile link joining the M1 and M62 south of Leeds with the A1. All three existing roads will be widened to dual four-lane capacity on their approaches to the new link road. A Pounds 145m scheme to widen 13 miles of the A1 to motorway standard between Alconbury and Peterborough. A Pounds 35m scheme that will see the widening of a 34-mile stretch of the A419 and A417 between Swindon and Gloucester, including two local by-passes. A Pounds 10m project to by-pass Haltwhistle on the A69 plus the management of the entire 53-mile length of the A69 between Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle. Mr Watts said involving the private sector would allow the Department of Transport to speed up its roads programme and provide better value for money during the life of management concession. He added: 'There is a great deal of enthusiasm in the City and industry for these schemes.' Contractors must register an interest by September 30. Tenders will be invited in November and work on the first scheme is expected to start by the summer of 1995. Due to the novelty of this sort of contract the government has yet to decide on the terms and conditions. It will publish an illustrative draft contract to get negotiations started. Trafalgar House, a big contractor, said it expected to bid, although it would probably act with a partner or partners. A 15-year concession was the minimum period which would be attractive for it to be involved, it said. Balfour Beatty, another construction company, said it hoped that the government would give the maximum freedom to contractors to manage the roads. Involvement would help the company expand its roads activities internationally.</p>

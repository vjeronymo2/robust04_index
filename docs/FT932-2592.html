			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / New faces give Bundesbank coalition look VACANCIES at the top of the Bundesbank are to be filled by candidates who are expected to maintain the bank's hardline policies but also to improve relations between Bonn and the Frankfurt monetary authorities. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a close associate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is to take over as vice-president on October 1 when Mr Hans Tietmeyer moves up to replace the retiring president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. At the same time, Mr Edgar Meister, currently finance minister in the Rhineland-Palatinate state government, will join the bank's permanent directorate. Mr Meister, 53, a moderate member of the Social Democrat party (SPD), is known to get on well with Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister. His appointment follows the selection earlier this week of his boss, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Rhineland-Palatinate's prime minister, as candidate for the vacant national chairmanship of the SPD. Mr Scharping is the logical choice to stand against Mr Kohl for the chancellor's job in next year's federal elections. As one observer noted yesterday, the directorate has the characteristics of a 'grand coalition' - seen by some as the most likely outcome of the elections. Mr Gaddum, who is 63 today, also served as finance minister in the Rhineland-Palatinate in the 1970s when the state was controlled by the Christian Democrats and Mr Kohl was the state's prime minister. The appointments, to be rubber-stamped by the cabinet, ensure a friction-free transition in the country's most important non-governmental institution, and a continuation of the Bundesbank's conservative monetary policy aimed at the defeat of inflation and the preservation of stability. Mr Tietmeyer, long acknowledged as Mr Schlesinger's heir, and another Kohl confidant, is a well-established, authoritative international figure, and a stout proponent of monetary rigour. His official term in office will run until 1999, when he reaches the age of 68. As the directorate member most directly involved with the transformation of the former east German monetary system, Mr Gaddum is especially knowledgeable about the unification difficulties which have complicated the Bundesbank's job in the past three years. The Bundesbank said yesterday it had left its key discount and Lombard lending rates unchanged after a meeting of its policy-making council, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The German discount rate remains at 7.25 per cent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 8.5 per cent.</p>

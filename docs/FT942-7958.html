			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / ARM licenses its chip technology to Samsung The UK-designed silicon chip which powers Apple's 'Newton' electronic notepad seems set to enjoy a vastly bigger market as the heart of a wide range of consumer and professional products from the US and the Pacific Rim. Acorn Risc Machines, which designed the chip, says it has now licensed its microprocessor technology to Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the world's seventh largest semiconductor manufacturer. The value of the deal has not been disclosed. It is the sixth licencing deal ARM has struck with a large electronics group since it announced its microprocessor designs in 1991. The others are Texas Instruments, Cirrus Logic and VLSI of the US, Sharp of Japan and GEC Plessey of the UK. VLSI, a chip designer and manufacturer, holds an equity stake in ARM along with Acorn Computers, owned by Olivetti of Italy, Apple Computers of the US and Daiwa Securities of Japan. Samsung Electronics, part of the broadly based Samsung trading and manufacturing group, intends to use the chips in consumer products such as mobile fax-phones as well as professional computer equipment including hard-disk drives and laser-beam printers. VLSI and International Business Machines plan to use ARM-based chips in a new high speed computing technology that IBM is attempting to establish as an industry standard called Serial Storage Architecture. ARM processor circuitry is so small it can easily be embedded in the silicon chips VLSI is making for IBM. ARM said its technology would also be used by European companies looking at ways of improving smart card security systems. Smart cards, which are increasingly being used in payment, identification and security systems, are no larger than a credit card but contain a complete microprocessor. The ARM chip is said to have more than 100 times the processing power of existing smart card chips, making possible voice recognition and other advanced forms of secure identification. Mr Robin Saxby, ARM chief executive, said ARM processors were ideally suited to consumer electronics products and to hand-held devices because they were small, used little power and provided high performance. Competitive chips were large and power-hungry. It was his intention to establish ARM designs as the industry standard for portable devices. Shares in Acorn Computers, the largest supplier of systems the UK schools, have been boosted by excitement over the prospects for ARM. The chip designer contributed about Pounds 100,000 to group profits last year, moving into profit about a year earlier than expected. Japanese purchase, Page 23</p>

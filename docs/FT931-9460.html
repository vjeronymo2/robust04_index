			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds out in front Lloyds Bank has set a cracking pace for other banks to follow. A 28 per cent recovery in pre-tax profit, a 10 per cent increase in the dividend, and a 17 per cent net return on shareholders' funds are evidence of the extraordinary inner strength with which the bank has come through the recession. Dividend growth can easily continue to outstrip the market average. If nothing else, the residual surplus of Pounds 820m on problem country debt should help take care of that. Strip away the veneer, though, and familiar strategic questions re-emerge. That may prevent the shares from outperforming. Annual profits were bolstered by a Pounds 64m increase in foreign exchange trading profits. That bodes well for banks such as Barclays and HSBC with heavy specialisation in this market, but, though Lloyds denies it sold sterling short on September 16, the bonus will not necessarily recur. By happy coincidence almost all the Pounds 50m of permanent diminution of UK property values could be charged to reserves. Had the remaining Pounds 153m diminution not been temporary, it would have had to be charged against profits. Above all, though, Lloyds' flow of operating income looks structurally weak despite an improvement in the second half. One problem is that Lloyds' large cash surplus means lower UK base rates hit its domestic income more than that of other banks. Another is that second-half net interest income grew more strongly on international business where Lloyds has retrenched in recent years. Yet another is the limit on further cost reduction and growth in fee income. The easy answer is to go for volume, but Lloyds will not sacrifice margin for the sake of market share. That makes an acquisition more likely. Sensible opportunities are few and far between. After its embarrassing withdrawal from last year's Midland bid, Lloyds may have to wait until a willing partner hoves in view. It will be accused of dithering just the same.</p>

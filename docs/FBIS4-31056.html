			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 3 (AFP) -- Serb forces resumed Friday  their withdrawal from the UN-declared exclusion zone around  Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, raising hopes that truce talks  stalled since Thursday would be able to get under way, UN  special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Friday. Speaking after a  meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Akashi said  he hoped the Geneva talks, aimed at securing an overall  ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, could start on Saturday morning.</p>

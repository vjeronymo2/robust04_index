			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Leading Article: A better deal for car buyers Few issues excite fiercer controversy between European consumers and producers than the workings of the new car market. This month, battle will be renewed when the European Commission considers whether the motor industry's distribution arrangements should continue to be exempted from EU competition rules. The current nine-year-old system, due to expire next year, grants carmakers a degree of control over distribution which would be illegal in other industries. They are free to decide which dealers they supply, the sales territories they serve and the number of cars they sell, and to prohibit them from stocking rival brands. Car manufacturers want the system extended and appear to have the support of Mr Martin Bangemann, the European industry commissioner. They argue that the arrangements are necessary to persuade dealers to invest in sales promotion and in the facilities needed to provide reliable after-sales service and maintenance. Mr Bangemann also has his own agenda. The industry's tight grip on distribution offers a convenient way of administering the EU's 'transitional' curbs on Japanese car sales by keeping deliveries to individual countries within agreed limits. In effect, Brussels is preaching a single market while allowing it to be segmented by the back door. Aligned against the system are the Commission's competition directorate and consumer groups, which argue that the costs to car buyers far exceed the benefits. In spite of efforts by Brussels to simplify 'parallel imports' across borders, critics say the distribution arrangements impede trade and perpetuate price differentials between EU members. Greater choice In weighing their decision, the 17 commissioners need to keep two points clearly in mind. One is that the existing arrangements look archaic, at best. When the emphasis in most of retailing is on greater choice and convenience, it is hard to justify 'exclusive' dealerships restricted to one brand. The much-increased reliability of modern cars also weakens the case for restricting servicing to franchised dealers, which surveys have in any case found to perform no better than independent garages. Nor does manufacturers' defence of the dealership system square with their increasing tendency to sell direct to fleet operators - a practice blamed for inflating prices for individual buyers. The second point is that conditions in the European car industry have changed radically since the existing exemption was granted. Competition has grown much fiercer and the pace of restructuring and product innovation is accelerating. Furthermore, the EU is committed to a barrier-free car market by 1999, when curbs on Japanese car sales are due to be abolished. Biggest anomalies It is against this perspective that the future of car distribution arrangements should be judged. Any further exemption from competition rules should not extend beyond the end of the decade and should be modified to remove its biggest anomalies. The most obvious is the exclusive dealership provision. There is a case for requiring franchised dealers to meet certain standards. But this is best achieved by setting objective criteria and obliging manufacturers to supply any dealer who satisfies them. Another positive step would be to allow distribution and sales to be performed separately from servicing. The main argument for keeping them integrated is that it enables dealers to cross-subsidise between the two activities - a practice not obviously to consumers' advantage. Finally, the Commission should ensure that its efforts to encourage 'parallel imports' really bite. These provide the strongest incentive to move towards the harmonisation of car prices across the EU which will follow from the creation of a true single market. Manufacturers will undoubtedly protest against any change in the existing system while they are beset by weak demand, excess capacity and the impact of violent currency fluctuations. However, the Commission should make it clear that their long-term interests are best served not by throwing them another lifebelt, but by helping them better to swim.</p>

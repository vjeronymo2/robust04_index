			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'National champions' become obsolete - Cross-border deals In 1967 two important structural changes took place in the UK motor industry  -the formation of Ford of Europe, and the merger of Leyland and British Motor Holdings to create British Leyland. The first, uniting Ford's British and German subsidiaries, was designed to achieve Europe-wide economies of scale. The second was a nat-ional affair; it did nothing to remedy one of the industry's most serious competitive weaknesses: lack of marketing presence in continental Europe. The subsequent 25 years have underlined the wisdom of Ford's approach and the sterility of the 'national champion' strategy. As barriers to intra-European trade and investment have come down, companies in many industries have had to follow Ford's example; those that left the transition to Europe too late, such as most British Leyland companies, have paid the penalty in dwindling market share. In the early 1970s, before and after the UK's accession to the Community, British companies were unfamiliar with continental systems and management practices, yet felt the need for a big leap forward to take advantage of the enlarged market. The result was a series of ill-judged mergers and joint ventures - the Dunlop-Pirelli partnership was an example - which failed to produce economies and led to some disillusionment with Europe. Today a European strategy is not an adventure; it is an accepted part of doing business. As Ford recognised in the 1960s, integration came quickest in sectors like cars, where customer needs were sufficiently uniform to justify a continental approach to design and manufacture. This, in turn, has encouraged the leading component suppliers, such as Valeo in France, GKN and T&amp;N in Britain, to build or acquire factories throughout Europe to serve vehicle assemblers. Pilkington's moves into Germany and more recently Italy are part of this trend. Progress has been slower in traditionally protected sectors like electric power and telecommunications. But even here nationally based procurement is giving way to open competition, providing a further stimulus to cross-border alliances, such as GEC-Alsthom and Siemens's stake in the British telecommunications equipment industry. Nationalism, of course, is not dead, as is clear from the angry reaction in Britain to BMW's proposed takeover of Rover. No doubt the tendency for European countries to try to look after their own will persist. It was, after all, one of Germany's national champions, Siemens, which took over the loss-making Nixdorf computer group; one of Germany's largest lame ducks, AEG, went to Daimler-Benz and not to Britain's GEC, which came close to buying parts of the business in the early 1980s. In steel, local political pressures still impede structural change, although another sector plagued by over-capacity, petrochemicals, has been reshaped through asset swaps and divestitures, many involving cross-border transactions. No doubt, too, European mergers and acquisitions will continue to be complicated by differences in management style and shareholder expectations. But where the underlying commercial logic is sound, these cultural and organisational strains are usually manageable. How much further will European rationalisation go? In the motor industry it seems unlikely the present structure, with six high-volume producers each holding about 11-15 per cent of the market, will survive the removal of restrictions on Japanese imports; the trend towards higher concentration, which has already eliminated most smaller players, will probably go further in the next decade. But whether all Europe's manufacturing industries will move in an American direction is more doubtful. Even if all artificial barriers are dismantled, differences in consumer tastes between Italy and Britain will remain greater than, say, between California and New Jersey. Hotpoint, the British domestic appliance maker, has been successful without embracing a fully European strategy; national markets can still provide the basis for healthy profits. Not all national markets will go regional, nor will all regional markets become global. What matters is that strategies can now be based on normal commercial criteria, with fewer distortions arising from government intervention or conflicting national regulations. While European integration is not complete, the focus of management attention may be shifting. In some industries the ability to compete in the US and, perhaps more important, in the Asia-Pacific region is increasingly crucial to profitable growth. Companies such as Renault and Peugeot, whose business is based almost entirely on west Europe, could be vulnerable if they fail to break out of Europe. Just as the 1980s saw a shift from national champions, so in the 1990s being a Euro-champion may no longer be enough.

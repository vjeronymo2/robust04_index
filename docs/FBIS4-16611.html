			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent 18 April, TASS -- Chinese Prime Minister Li  Peng has called for broader cooperation and closer friendship  with Uzbekistan which dates back to the time of the great silk  route.    Li Peng arrived in Tashkent on his first official visit on  Monday. During his three-day stay he will meet with Uzbek  leaders to discuss bilateral relations, regional and  international issues.    The visit is the first leg of his foreign trip, the first in  the last 18 months, during which he will also visit  Turkmenistan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Kazakhstan and Mongolia.  He is the highest foreign leader to visit the four Central  Asian republics since the collapse of the Soviet Union in  December 1991.    Li Peng said China is interested in maintaining good  relations with Central Asian republics and Russia. He said  China wants to have long-term, stable and friendly relations  with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence.    China established diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan in  January 1992. The two countries have also agreed to establish  embassies and trade offices in China and Uzbekistan and signed a  bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation.    "I am glad that I am here, in this ancient and world-known  city of Tashkent," Li Peng said. "The visit by President Islam  Karimov of Uzbekistan to our country in 1992 opened a new page  in the history of friendly relations between our countries" and  gave a powerful impetus to their development and expansion, he  continued.    The Chinese premier expressed the hope that "the documents  to  be signed during the visit will strengthen friendly ties and  elevate our economic cooperation to a new height."    Karimov stressed that Li Peng's visit is taking place at a  time when political, economic, trade and cultural ties between  the two countries are growing ever stronger. He expressed the  confidence that the visit will become a new step towards  strengthening relations between Uzbekistan and China. "Friendly  ties between our states date back to the time of the `great silk  route,'" he said.</p>

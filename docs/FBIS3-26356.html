			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): </F> "Interviewing Yuan Zheng, Director of State Land Department, on  Value-Added Land Tax"]    [Text] Yuan Zheng, director of Guangdong Province State  Land Department, said that Guangdong Province will not be an  exception and will implement the value-added land tax policy  promulgated by the central authorities this year. However, they  will continue to reflect to the central authorities the strong  reactions of foreign businessmen.    During an interview with MING PAO yesterday, Yuan said  frankly that they had recently heard quite a lot of strong views  about the value-added land tax from foreign businessmen.  However, the state is listening to views from various quarters  and will soon publish detailed rules on the implementation of  the value-added land tax. Therefore, before the rules are  published, the Guangdong authorities concerned will accurately  reflect the views of foreign businessmen to the central  authorities.    He said that in the past, the local governments of some  cities and counties in Guangdong Province had formulated their  own regulations on levying value-added taxes on a trial basis.  After the central authorities published regulations on levying  a unified value-added tax, Guangdong of course will implement  the regulations by the central authorities. However, he  believes that the detailed rules on the implementation of the  value-added land tax to be published by the central authorities  will certainly have relatively great flexibility.    He said that the purpose of levying the value-added land tax  is to crack down on land speculation. However, if the  first-hand land market is strictly controlled by the state and  the management of the second-hand land market is strengthened,  the practice of speculation can be curbed. At present, the fact  that the practice of speculation has developed to a red-hot  state is a problem whose origin lies in the lagging behind of  the management of the second-hand market. For example, in some  places, the work on large quantities of title deeds for houses  is in arrears and this has provided loopholes of which  speculators take advantage. Yuan also talked about the  situation of approving land for development across Guangdong  Province last year and this year. He said that this year, the  amount of land to be used for various purposes in the whole  province will be limited to 465,000 mu, of which land for real  estate will total 116,000 mu, slightly less than the 136,000 mu  of land for real estate last year.    Last year, the revenue from sales of land throughout the  province was more than 8.6 billion yuan and in the previous year  it was 9.4 billion yuan. This year, the sales of land are  expected to bring in about 9 billion yuan to the provincial  government treasury.    Yesterday, Yuan also gave a brief account of the situation  of  putting things in order in development zones across the  province. During the peak period in 1993 there were as many as  315 development zones of various kinds across the provinces.  After things have been put in order and rectified, only 53  development zones remain at present (approved by the State  Council or the provincial government). Besides, 14 are being  examined and verified. All the land in more than 200  development zones which do not have the necessary conditions has  been taken back and the total amount of such land has reached  580,000 mu.</p>

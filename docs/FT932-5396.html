			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Inquiry launched as seven die in tanker crash AN official inquiry is to be launched after seven people were killed and two were missing feared dead in a tanker collision in thick fog off the Belgian coast early yesterday morning. Four Britons and two Irishmen are among the dead or missing. The rest are from Sierra Leone. The British Petroleum-owned tanker British Trent (above), with a 24,000 tonne cargo of petrol, collided with the Panamanian-registered cargo ship Western Winner.

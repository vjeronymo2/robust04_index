			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Eurotunnel wins leave for appeal EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel group, has been given leave to appeal to the House of Lords against a Court of Appeal ruling. The ruling allowed British and French contractors to renew a threat to stop working unless they receive extra payments to cover the cost of completing the project. Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction companies, had said it would stop work on installing a cooling system unless it received sufficient money to cover the cost of the work. Eurotunnel had asked the courts to grant an injunction preventing the contractors from carrying out their threat. Lord Staughton, one of the appeal judges, said that an English court should not grant an interim injunction in a disagreement that all the parties had agreed ought to go to arbitration abroad.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: Risks in making false analogies - Economic Eye 'So let's start telling the truth: competitiveness is a meaningless word when applied to national economies. And the obsession with competitiveness is both wrong and dangerous.'* The author of the quote, Paul Krugman of MIT, is a progenitor of 'strategic trade theory', sometimes used to justify the Clinton administration's interventionist industrial and trade policies. For this reason, his robust assault on half-baked notions of competitiveness is most welcome. In the same article, Prof Krugman notes that Ira Magaziner and Robert Reich, both important members of the Clinton administration, once argued that 'our standard of living can only rise if capital and labour increasingly flow to industries with high value-added per worker'. The absurd implications of such a rule of thumb are shown in the chart. In the case of international trade, people are readily attracted by two false analogies. The most malign is the view that trade is war. Larry Summers, undersecretary for international affairs at the US treasury, argued last week that 'some would have the US and other industrial democracies . . . pursue policies directed at containing threats posed by foreign commercial rivals in an effort to preserve something called economic security. In my view this is a profoundly misguided vision. It fails to recognise the fundamental difference between prosperity and power. Power can be gained only at someone else's expense. Prosperity can be shared.'** The second false analogy is the belief that trade is similar to inter-firm competition. But countries, unlike firms, cannot go bankrupt; the bulk of the economic transactions of almost all countries are internal; and, most important, relations between trading partners are mutually beneficial, being more like those between suppliers and their customers than among competitors. Various meanings can still be given to the idea of international competition. New, or lower cost, suppliers of goods and services competitive with a country's exports may emerge, imposing terms of trade losses (reductions in the prices of exports relative to imports). Regulatory and fiscal regimes may be forced to compete for flows of mobile factors of production, particularly capital. Countries may be subjected to yardstick competition, namely, international comparisons of performance. Internationally exposed segments of an economy may fare particularly poorly. The effects of imports on wages may look malign. None of these is much like inter-firm competition. The closest to it is the possible effect on the terms of trade. But this, notes Prof Krugman, has been insignificant for industrial countries (though that has not been true for commodity exporters). The salient feature of the last two concerns is what is happening to internal relative prices. The competitiveness of internationally exposed industries, for example, is largely determined by the real product wage - the cost of labour, adjusted for productivity, relative to the price of output. Similarly, if trade lowers the wages of the unskilled, it raises those of the skilled. Mr Summers asserts that 'notwithstanding Paul Krugman, competitiveness is important. People who talk about competitiveness want to see America produce more, better products at lower cost, and sell them into more rapidly growing and more open markets. What is wrong with that?' Nothing at all is wrong with it, except that he is talking about overall economic performance. Prof Krugman is right to complain about this habit of confusing performance with competitiveness. It is bad analysis, likely also to lead to bad policy, with foreigners blamed for domestic problems. Trade liberalisation can improve performance, a point Prof Krugman should have emphasised. All the same, he is right to insist that international commerce is quite unlike inter-firm competition. Analogies can be highly misleading. Phenomena have to be analysed, instead, for what they are. *Paul Krugman, 'Competitiveness: a Dangerous Obsession', Foreign Affairs, March/April 1994. **Lawrence Summers, 'Shared Prosperity and the New International Economic Order', speech before the Institute of International Economics, May 20 1994.  ----------------------------------    VALUE ADDED PER WORKER, 1988       (THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS)  ---------------------------------- Cigarettes                   488 Petroleum refng              283 Automobiles                   99 Steel                         97 Aircraft                      68 Electronics                   64 All manuf.                    66  ---------------------------------- Source: Krugman  ----------------------------------</p>

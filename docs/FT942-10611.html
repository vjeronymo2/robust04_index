			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / People: Usborne One of the side effects of the change of control of USBORNE, the grain trading and pig production company whose chairman is Lord Cecil Parkinson, is that chief executive David Frame has stepped aside rather earlier than his planned retirement on reaching 60 in July this year. Michael Adams, the director responsible for the group's grain trading operations, has taken over as group managing director. Frame, who last week sold a 36 per cent stake in the company to David Thompson, a shareholder, is staying on as a director of the company until July and thereafter will act as a trade adviser to Usborne Grain. Financial problems hit the group early in April, forcing the suspension of its shares. Thompson's company, Thompson Investments, now controls just over 50 per cent of Usborne's equity.</p>

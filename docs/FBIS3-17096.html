He said Tajikistan would plunge into a new war as  soon as Russian troops were gone. On the plight of the Russian  community there, Kondratyev said there was no possibility of  evacuating them to Russia at the moment because of the country's  economic hardships.    The general said that Russian peacekeepers were used as a  stopgap in areas of conflict or wars which might spill over to  Russian territory if no measures were taken in time.    He also spoke of Russia's geopolitical interests saying that  an estimated 25 million Russians living in other republics of  the former Soviet Union needed protection.</p>

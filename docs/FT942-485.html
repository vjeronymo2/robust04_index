			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Reactor-grade plutonium was used in bomb 'Reactor grade' plutonium - produced in commercial reactors - can be used to build nuclear bombs, according to information released by the US energy department. The department revealed in a 200-page statement declassified on Monday that plutonium from a UK reactor was used in 1962 for detonating a nuclear bomb at the US underground test site in the Nevada desert. Greenpeace, the environmental group, has said that British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria could lead to the spread of nuclear weapons capability. The plant, which started operating earlier this year, extracts plutonium from used reactor fuel, and plans to send it to overseas nuclear power companies, particularly in Japan and Germany. The UK government has argued that plutonium from civil reactors does not pose a security threat because constructing a bomb from the fuel is extremely difficult. However, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday: 'This test proves that it (using plutonium from reactors to make bombs) is possible. But our understanding is that the difficulties involved in practice were such that no one would really dream of trying it.' The plutonium used in the US test was derived from military work carried out by the UK Atomic Energy Authority at the Calder Hall reactor at Sellafield, the DTI said. BNF said yesterday: 'We have always said you need considerable skill to make bombs from reactor-grade plutonium, not that it is theoretically impossible.' Ms Janet Bloomfield, who chairs the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: 'This shows that all those who gave categoric assurances that Thorp's plutonium cannot be used for nuclear weapons, and accused CND of scaremongering, were lying.' And the Washington-based lobby group, Nuclear Control Institute, called on Britain to 'halt . . . needless production of weapon-usable plutonium'.</p>

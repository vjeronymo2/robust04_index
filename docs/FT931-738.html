			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Eyes on French franc DEALERS will keep a close watch on the French franc this week, following the second round of the National Assembly elections in France, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, there has been a growing feeling that the accession to power of a right-wing government in Paris will coincide with another speculative attack on the French currency. A landslide victory for the RPR/UDF coalition has long been discounted, but the new administration's commitment to the franc fort policy is certain to be tested. But dealers are uncertain over when exactly the pressure on the franc might come, if it comes at all. The franc's immediate future may depend on when the Bundesbank lowers interest rates again. There was some disappointment last week that the central bank continued to offer funds to commercial banks at an unchanged repo rate of 8.25 per cent. There are expectations that this rate will be cut this week, possibly when the Bundesbank council meets on Thursday. But the pressure on the franc may not come until the summer. Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris says: 'The danger point for the franc is not the next two weeks, but two months down the road. 'It is difficult to suggest that the new French government could break with the strong franc policy this week. They will have no choice but to maintain the policy. However, the dangers will increase if French interest rates can't be brought down sharply in the next two months.' Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International believes the most likely outcome to the crisis is that the new government will maintain the commitment to franc fort, patiently waiting for German interest rates to come down. However, he believes there is a 30 per cent probability that the markets will force a devaluation, possibly because tensions elsewhere in the European exchange rate mechanism will spill over.</p>

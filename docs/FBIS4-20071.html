			<p>BFN     [Text] Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjorck is highly  critical of the way the United Nations peacekeeping operation is  being conducted in Bosnia. Sweden has troops there as part of a  Nordic battalion, as well as observers. Speaking to the youth  movement of his own Conservative Party, Bjorck said no nation  would dream of sending 70,000 troops into the field without a  modern, efficient command structure. He specifically called for  a local commander able to make decisions in Bosnia under a  mandate from the UN secretary general.    The Swedish defense minister said the lack of a UN force in  and around the safe haven of Gorazde is the reason for the  catastrophe there. His words were echoed by Sweden's Armed  Forces Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson.</p>

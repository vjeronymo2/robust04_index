The ministers also reaffirmed support for signing a  partnership agreement with the former Yugoslav republic of  Slovenia.    Deputy Greek Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou,  presenting  results of the meeting, acknowledged that: "These past weeks,  economic evolution in Russia raises certain questions."    Reformers recently quit the new conservative government in  Moscow, throwing into doubt the future of free-market reforms  initiated by President Boris Yeltsin.    But Brittan, European Commissioner in charge of trade  policy,  said: "95 percent" of the problems over the accord with Russia  have been resolved.    Although issues to do with trade in nuclear products and  financial aid still remained outstanding, he said, the  Commission would do as much as possible to finalize negotiations.    Brittan said the decision to support an agreement with  Slovenia was of "capital importance" and sent an important  signal to other ex-Yugoslav republics.    The Council also backed signing a free-trade agreement with  the Baltic countries "with an eye to a future association  agreement," Papandoniou said.</p>

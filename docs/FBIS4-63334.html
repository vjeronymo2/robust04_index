			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Size of Defence Forces Decreased"] </F>   [Text] Riga, 13 May -- The number of soldiers engaged in  mandatory military service in the Defense Forces has been  reduced because the state lacks financial means for their  support, DIENA was told by Juris Kvelde, state secretary in the  Defense Ministry. From the beginning of May, the mobilization  of the mandatory state military service is canceled, due to the  fact that the number of soldiers currently serving in the Army  exceeds the number envisioned by the state budget for 1994 --  4,323. In the beginning of April, there were 4,600 soldiers  serving in the Defense Forces.    The Chief of the Defense Forces Headquarters, Juris Arness,  told DIENA that the reduction will be even larger -- the forces  will be limited to 3,891 soldiers. According to him, the budget  foresees a 10 percent reduction in the number of mobilized  soldiers. However, the persons exceeding the number fixed by  the Ministry of Finance cannot be released if they have not  served a specific period of time.    As DIENA was told by J. Kvelde, Latvia does not have any  document or plan other than the defense concept adopted in 1992,  which determines the number and development of separate  structures of the Defense Forces. It specifies that the defense  forces should number 9,000 people. The only law that  effectively regulates this number is the state budget law for  1994 prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Raisa Bika,  representative of the Budget Department in the Ministry of  Finances, reported to DIENA that they have determined the number  of soldiers for which support is available, and that the Saeima  [parliament] has adopted this law.    Officers of the Defense Forces are of the opinion that the  reduction will have a negative effect on the activities of the  Forces. Janis Adamsons, commander of the border guards brigade,  told DIENA that at present they do not feel a lack of manpower,  but in the autumn there will be approximately 750 fewer people.  The largest segment of the mobilized soldiers -- 3,000 -- are  serving in the border guards brigade.</p>

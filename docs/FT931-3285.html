			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / George Wimpey reports Pounds 112m loss GEORGE WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, yesterday announced a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss, the worst result in its 100-year history. The loss, taken after an exceptional provision of Pounds 113.8m, underlines the depth of the recession in the UK housing and construction markets. It follows a Pounds 16.1m pre-tax loss in 1991. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, however claimed that the worst may now be over - particularly in the UK housing market where Wimpey's sales had risen 33 per cent since the New Year against the first 10 weeks of last year. 'There are clear signs that the market is strengthening. I believe this trend will continue provided measures in the Budget do not undermine fragile returning confidence,' said Mr Dwyer. The company's shares rose almost 8 per cent to 136p following Wimpey's upbeat comments on UK house sales and on reports that group borrowings had reduced further than expected. Net debt, benefiting from disposals and a strong cashflow from construction, fell last year from Pounds 206m to Pounds 136m reducing the company's gearing from 35 per cent to 30 per cent, its lowest for a decade. The group raised more than Pounds 300m from selling commercial properties and peripheral businesses since 1989. Provisions, mostly against the group's UK and US housing and commercial property operations, included Pounds 25.5m for unwinding interest-rate hedging deals. Arrangements agreed in the late 1980s to protect Wimpey against rising interest rates had worked against the group as borrowing costs had fallen, said Mr Dwyer. These added about Pounds 7m to interest charges which last year fell Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 19.4m. Mr Dwyer said: 'We believe that our 1992 results represent a low point in our profitability. I expect trading overall to remain difficult during 1993. However there are now positive signs emerging that the business cycle is beginning to turn both in the UK and US.' The company, in spite of losses per share after exceptional and extraordinary provisions of 41.31p (compared with 11.13p loss per share in 1991), is paying a final dividend of 3.25p (down from 6.5p) making a total for 1992 of 5.25p (against 10.5p) Lex, Page 18; Hedging details, Page 42</p>

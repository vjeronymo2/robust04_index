			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Nissan to cut output in Japan by 4.7% Nissan, Japan's second largest car producer, is planning to cut domestic output by 4.7 per cent this year, possibly presaging production cuts elsewhere in the Japanese car industry. In the current year to March, Nissan expects to reduce output from 1.7m vehicles to 1.62m units in the coming 12 months, because of the continuing weakness of the Japanese market and a fall in exports to Europe, according to company officials. The decision will be confirmed by the end of the month. This will be Nissan's lowest output for 23 years and well below its 2.2m vehicle annual capacity, they said. Production capacity will fall slightly to 2m units after the closure next year of Nissan's Zama plant, south of Tokyo. The Japanese car industry currently has surplus production of around 2m units, roughly equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France, according to estimates by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. So far, Japan's car industry has avoided heavy redundancies. Instead, it has given workers extra free time, frozen new employment and cut prices paid to suppliers. Nissan does not plan more job cuts on top of the 5,000 posts it already plans to phase out within three years. Workers will instead be given an extra seven to 10 days off per month, on top of the three days per month holiday given to workers since November. Industrial output across the board is weaker than expected. Japan's overall production fell by 1.9 per cent from November to December, slightly worse than the provisionally estimated 1.7 per cent, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (4): Stalled on the runway  -Airlines and Aviation FOR the first time since World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline last year. Several well known airline names, including Pan American, one of the most illustrious, disappeared. Savaged by the collapse of air travel provoked by the Gulf crisis and the economic recession and the introduction of fiercer competition as a result of increasing deregulation and liberalisation, the weaker carriers are struggling to survive. Consolidation is expected to accelerate in the industry this year through mergers, acquisitions and commercial partnerships. The latest, and undoubtedly most significant, deal under discussion is the attempt by British Airways to link up with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest of the US to form a global airline to take on the new breed of so-called US 'megacarriers' and the expansionist Far East airlines. Other airlines are scrambling to forge alliances. Air France is hoping to link with Sabena of Belgium and has agreed to lead a consortium to acquire 40 per cent of CSA of Czechoslovakia. SAS, Swissair and Air Austria have formed a commercial and marketing partnership. In the US, the market has become dominated by three large carriers: American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have all grown by acquiring international and domestic routes from weaker US carriers. In the Far East, where traffic is expected to continue to show above average growth, carriers have been seeking to expand their international networks while consolidating their operational bases in the Asia-Pacific region. These airlines have also been anxious to develop alliances with other international partners. Singapore Airlines has cross-shareholding links with Delta and Swissair; Qantas is now seeking an international partner to take an equity stake in the Australian carrier as part of its privatisation; Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways have forged commercial links with international carriers to bolster their international networks. But the most immediate problem facing the airline industry is its low level of profitability. International airline losses last year are expected to total more than Dollars 4bn compared with a Dollars 2.7bn loss in 1990. Even though traffic has started to pick up and the industry is expecting to see growth eventually stabilising at around 5.5 per cent - 6 per cent a year during the rest of the decade - yields remain under intense pressure because of heavy and unprofitable discounting of fares. Airlines will have to improve their overall profitability if they are to meet their long term aircraft fleet renewal and expansion commitments. Mr Gunter Eser, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has warned that traffic recovery is being bought at the expense of yield. 'It simply is not possible with today's cut-price passengers to pay for tomorrow's full-price aeroplanes,' he said. The industry faces a host of other pressures. Liberalisation will intensify competition in the European market and force cost-heavy European carriers to continue rationalisation to enhance productivity, while improving service and frequencies to fend off the expansion of US and Asian carriers in more open European skies. With the eventual recovery in traffic after last year's Gulf war aberration, the old problem of congestion in the sky and at airports is expected to return to the fore. Inadequate air traffic control systems in Europe and in some other parts of the world coupled with congestion at crowded international airports risk clipping the wings of any recovery in air transport unless governments and aviation authorities accelerate efforts to improve the infrastructure of the industry.</p>

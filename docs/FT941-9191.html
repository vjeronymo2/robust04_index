			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Squeeze on London offices An upturn in tenant demand last year pushed the availability of offices in central London down by more than a fifth to stand at 14 per cent of the total stock, say property advisers DTZ Debenham Thorpe. The advisers say in a survey that last year 'provided clear evidence of the market cycle turning'. The availability decline stemmed from a 20 per cent rise in take-up, principally from the banking and financial services industries, together with a contraction of the development pipeline. About 500,000 sq ft of the total take-up of 12.9m sq ft was directly attributable to the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb last April. Docklands registered a strong rise in take-up of more than 200 per cent as a result of lettings by Mirror Group Newspapers, London Regional Transport and of Tower Hamlets Borough Council. DTZ Debenham Thorpe's report suggests that development activity will remain at historically low levels this year, but will increase markedly in the next two years. The survey highlights sharp variations in the fortunes of different locations and quality of buildings. Core areas of central London registered a fall of 45 per cent in the volume of available new space and a fall of 12 per cent in the availability of second-hand units. Fringe areas, however, including Docklands, fared less well, registering a decline in the availability of new space of almost a fifth. Central Office Research - London.

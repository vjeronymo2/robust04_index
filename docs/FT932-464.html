			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / High loan scheme take-up expected BANKS EXPECT the reformed version of the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme to attract greater involvement from both borrowers and lenders when it is launched this week. The British Bankers' Association yesterday said the scheme, which extends the maximum loan for existing businesses from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000, would probably be attractive to companies trying to obtain debt to trade into recovery. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the association, said banks were expecting 'some lively business' from the revised scheme, under which the government guarantees banks against defaults on loans by small businesses. Banks have been criticised for lending too little under the 12-year-old scheme, although they argue that they have only responded to a lack of demand. Banks are only allowed to use the scheme if they have exhausted alternatives. Mr Stuart White, chairman of the association's small-business committee, said it was hard to predict the level of demand for the revised scheme. However, he said the changes would make it particularly relevant for companies emerging from recession. Mr White said the scheme was likely to 'come into its own perfectly well' for companies whose equity capital had been reduced by trading in recession and were now seeking loan capital in order to finance increased orders. Banks have yet to disclose the terms on which they will offer fixed-rate loans when the revised scheme comes into effect on Thursday. The revisions announced in the last Budget include the introduction of fixed-rate finance. The altered scheme prohibits loans being offered to 'local service' businesses such as small retailers, although 23 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn lent so far has gone to such enterprises.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Council of Europe and LKB dollar issues meet strong demand THE market for fixed-rate US dollar Eurobonds, comatose in recent weeks, was shaken back into life yesterday with strong demand for large issues from the Council of Europe and the Export Development Corporation of Canada. With a third big dollar issue promised for today from Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB), the continuing weakness of the US currency appears to have done little to dent the interest of investors willing to believe the dollar is near its bottom. The Council of Europe's Dollars 250m deal, launched at a spread of 32 basis points over US Treasuries, met good demand equally from the far east and Europe. The joint lead managers, which took Dollars 164m between them, reported a sell-out soon after launch. Although there was reported to be stronger demand for five-year paper, the Council of Europe's seven-year bonds found a ready home and were trading late in the day at a slightly narrower spread, despite a rally in Treasuries. The proceeds were swapped into fixed rate yen: however, at least one other big issuer is planning to come to the Euroyen sector directly. The European Investment Bank is reported to be planning a Y50bn, five-year issue, perhaps before the end of this week. The second large dollar deal of the day from a top-rated borrower, EDC, caused some surprise in being pitched at a maturity of 12 years, against the general view that most demand was for shorter-dated bonds. However, several banks reported good demand for the issue, which was formally announced after the close in the far east. Meanwhile, barring a disaster in the US dollar market, LKB is due tomorrow to launch its much-trailed Dollars 500m, 10-year issue. The spread over Treasuries will be set at 33 to 35 basis points, said JP Morgan, which is leading the issue. IN a rare mortgage-backed issue from a continental European institution, Svensk Fastigetskredit, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, announced plans for a Dollars 384m deal through Goldman Sachs. The third issue of its type through the special purpose vehicle Osprey Mortgage Securities, the AAA-rated bonds, issued in four tranches, will be priced today. The first two tranches, totalling more than Dollars 160m and with average lives of 3 years and 3.9 years, will be priced to yield 77 to 80 basis points and 61 to 65 basis points over US Treasuries respectively, Goldman said. The remaining tranches are being placed privately.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Lower rates are key to Nordic markets' success - Christopher Brown-Humes says that prospects are still bright for some of Europe's best performers A potent cocktail of falling interest rates and rising corporate earnings, spiced by devaluations and dollar sensitivity, has put the Nordic stock markets among Europe's top performers this year. Indeed, Finland's Hex index has led continental Europe with a 34 per cent rise, while Oslo's all share index has shown a 28 per cent gain. With both Copenhagen and Stockholm having strong runs, the Nordic Securities Market calculates that the average rise for the four exchanges this year is close to 20 per cent. Falling interest rates and the expectation of further cuts have been the main influence. This has increased prospects for economic recovery, soothed nervousness over the state of the region's loss-making banks, and bolstered corporate earnings. Interest has been enhanced by increased buying by foreign investors switching away from the German and French markets. The upturn in both Finland and Sweden has been helped by significant currency depreciation, following the decision to float the markka and krone last autumn, and by the expectation that both economies will emerge from three years of negative GDP growth in 1994. But perspective is important here. At the end of May, the Nordic markets were only up 6 per cent from the same time last year. That is a good indication of the extent to which Stockholm and Helsinki, in particular, have recovered since the autumn currency turmoil. The question, as they go into their summer lull, is whether the impetus can be maintained. Some analysts feel that much of the corporate earnings recovery is now discounted in Sweden and Finland, and they are nervous about prospects in Denmark, with its strong currency and dependence on the German market. There are also worries about new political turbulence in Sweden and Finland in the autumn, as well as the general economic malaise in Europe. At the same time, the firm expectation that European interest rates will follow German rates downwards over the rest of the year has led most analysts to conclude that the Nordic markets stand to make further gains during the autumn, with little talk of anything more than a technical downward correction. Finland has already seen a correction, the Hex having fallen by around 12 per cent since its May 24 high of 1,258. Having more than doubled since last September, its ebb on pre-holiday profit-taking was hardly surprising, but it has prompted some commentators to suggest that the market has got ahead of itself. Sweden also saw a correction this week as a weakening currency postponed hopes of further interest rate cuts, and the market reacted to news of a 3.8 per cent fall in first quarter GDP. But there is a feeling that share prices could move further ahead if the dollar strengthens further, and as companies begin to feel the full benefits of last November's effective devaluation in the second half as hedging programmes expire. Nevertheless, there are outstanding concerns over the robustness of the economy and the size of the budget deficit. Expectations are arguably highest for Norway, in spite of the spurt it has already put in this year, because of improving economic fundamentals and the high percentage of corporate earnings linked to the strengthening dollar. There are also clear indications that the country is past the worst of its banking and insurance crisis. A strong recovery in shipping share prices - based on dollar strength rather than improving market fundamentals - is already under way, with the Oslo shipping index rising to 505 this week from 345 at the beginning of March. Mr Tom Skjelstad, a stockbroker at Norse Securities, believes there could be further gains in the autumn, taking the total index to around 550 at the end of the year from 485 this week. In the meantime there is likely to be nervousness about the outcome of the September election, with the governing Labour party likely to poll fewer votes because of its support for EC membership. Denmark is probably the least favoured of the four. The 'Yes' to Maastricht is May was already discounted, and so is likely to have little bearing on the market's development over the rest of the year. In addition, the country's exporters are struggling with a strong currency, worsening conditions in Germany, and a negative impact from recent tax reform proposals. In spite of this, not everyone is pessimistic. Mr Fleming Madson, head of equity research at Danske Securities, predicts that Danish corporate earnings will still rise by 17 per cent this year, and that the market can rise by a further 10 per cent over the next 12 months.</p>

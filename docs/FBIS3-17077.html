			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Germany Will Support the Baltic </F> States in Their Efforts To Join the EU"]    [Text] Riga, 9 Mar -- Beginning on 1 July, when Germany  assumes the rotating Presidency of the European Union [EU], it  will do everything in its power to ensure that negotiations on  concluding an association agreement with the three Baltic states  are started immediately, German Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus  Kinkel announced today in Bonn, during his meeting with the  three Baltic foreign ministers. Latvian Ambassador in Germany  Andris Kesteris told DIENA in a telephone interview that a few  months prior to Germany assuming the leadership post, it wants  to clarify, along with the Baltic states, what concrete steps  should be taken to reach this goal.    Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs presented  a  speech on the problem of Baltic states receiving associate  status in the EU, saying that by granting associate member  status to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the EU could affect a  much more effective neutralization of the Russian concept of the  "near abroad" -- this according to the press center of the  Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry. "These concepts -- near  abroad and zone of special interests -- are denied categorically  by us and our neighbors," said K. Kinkel, according to REUTER.  As DIENA correspondent in Bonn O.J. Rozitis reports, referring  to information released by the German Ministry of Foreign  Affairs on K. Kinkel's consultations with the Baltic foreign  affairs ministers on the morning of 9 March, K. Kinkel  emphasized that the Baltics have always mirrored European  stability. This is why Germany is interested in consolidating  relations between the Baltic states and Russia. As an example,  K. Kinkel cited the positive role of Germany in talks between  the United States [as published] and Latvia concerning a  compromise on the Skrunda radar station.    A. Kesteris told DIENA that in the course of discussing the  relations of the Baltic states with Russia, the German minister  of foreign affairs expressed his approval of the Russian troop  withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August of this year,  and congratulated the foreign ministers on the agreement which  was reached on the issue of the Skrunda radar station continuing  to function, albeit temporarily, after the troops are withdrawn.  The Latvian ambassador to Germany stated that the problems of  the inhabitants who came to Latvia after the 1940 occupation are  understood by Germany with greater precision.    The DIENA correspondent in Bonn, Ojars J. Rozitis, reports  that the British newspaper FINANCIAL TIMES has cited the German  foreign affairs minister as saying that Russia should not link  the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states with the  rights of Russians residing in these states. After the recent  break in Russian-Estonian talks, Great Britain and the United  States have also expressed similar opinions. This question is  also said to be a topic of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's talks with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, which are scheduled for next Monday [14 March] in  Vladivostok.    At the same time, world press agencies report that during  the  meeting with the Baltic foreign affair ministers, the German  minister of foreign affairs encouraged Latvia and Estonia to  integrate the Russian minority. This integration is vital for  future relations with Russia, the chief German diplomat said,  advising the Balts to avoid angering the Russian nationalists  and to promise to observe the rights of ethnic Russians.    In reply to a question at a news conference, as to what  could  possibly be the reaction of the West if Russia does not comply  with its agreements, Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs  Andrejevs answered that thus far Latvia has fulfilled all the  recommendations of Western countries. The West has accepted it,  and therefore they will be responsible for it, G. Andrejevs  said. The German foreign affairs minister agreed on that point.  Nevertheless, K. Kinkel expressed the belief that it would not  be advisable to create sharp, provocative political borders with  Russia. At the same time, K. Kinkel emphasized that during his  recent meeting with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister A. Kozyrev  in Athens, he told him categorically that Germany expects Russia  to observe its international obligations regarding troop  withdrawal from the Baltic states, O.J. Rozitis reports.    Germany is categorically against granting Russia a special  mandate for peacekeeping on the territory of the former Soviet  Union. In the event it becomes necessary, it should be the  mandate of the United nations or CSCE, for every different case,  providing that the legal government of the country agrees to it.  The Baltic states should not be included in the formula of "the  former republics of the USSR." Such is the position of Germany  conveyed by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. O.J. Rozitis reports that the Baltic foreign ministers  unanimously stated at the press conference that they are not  afraid of close relations between Russia and Germany, or Western  countries in general, because only with the assistance of these  countries can Moscow be influenced. "The only thing we fear is  that these big countries may once again sacrifice our small  countries for the purpose of stabilization," said G. Andrejevs.    As for the often asked question concerning so-called human  rights violations, A. Kesteris told DIENA that this question had  not even been mentioned during the talks of the four ministers.    Issues related to the Partnership for Peace program and the  associative status of the Baltic states with the Western  European Union were also discussed.</p>

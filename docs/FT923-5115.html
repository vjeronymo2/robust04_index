			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Wrong end of the Maastricht stick - Campaigners are misinterpreting the treaty for their own ends FOR all the fateful international consequences of their September 20 verdict on the Maastricht treaty, most French voters will have uppermost in their minds domestic considerations - the future of President Mitterrand, recent scandals involving senior socialists, and worries about job security in a sluggish economy. But, formally, the debate over the next two and a half weeks, now at last reaching fever pitch, is supposed to turn on the pros and cons of European political and monetary union. Both sides in the referendum battle are having great difficulty in drawing accurate information from the dry Maastricht treaty to suit their campaigns. The 'Yes' and 'No' coalitions are, unwittingly or (more often) wittingly, misinterpreting Maastricht. Of the two camps the treaty rejectionists appear to be rather more successful in getting the wrong end of the Maastricht stick, or making insufficient political use of the correct end of the Maastricht stick, or simply blaming on a treaty that has yet to come into force existing irritations with Brussels that have flowed from the 1986 Single European Act and the European Community's internal market programme. The French are not alone in this. Debates about Maastricht in other European countries, notably Britain, have been similarly distorted through the prism of domestic politics. One theme, stressed by all 'Yes' campaigners ranging from socialist ministers, to Mr Raymond Barre, the former Giscardien prime minister, to Mr Edouard Balladur, leading member of the neo-Gaullist RPR, is that Europe and France now need Maastricht to contain the growing political and monetary strength of newly enlarged Germany. If diplomatically put, this is a point which is accepted by many Germans, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will speak in favour of Maastricht on French television tonight. But, in seeking to back up this general point, the 'Yes' campaigners stray from the real import of the Maastricht treaty. Most of them lay too much store by Maastricht's vague provisions for common EC foreign policy actions which can be exploited. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Socialist renegade and former minister, pointed out quite correctly that this kind of chain-gang diplomacy allowed Germany to hustle its EC partners into recognising Croatia in December, leading to an escalation of the Yugoslav war. By contrast, few 'Yes' campaigners, with the exceptions of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister, and Mr Balladur, make sufficient political capital out of Maastricht's very concrete provisions for economic and monetary union (Emu), and the way in which France can recover some control over its monetary policy through Emu. It is at least highly appropriate that Mr Balladur should make this point, because it was he, as French finance minister, who in 1987-88 started lobbying his EC colleagues for a European central bank and an end to German dominance of Europe's money. 'Without a European currency, Germany will stay free to act as it likes,' Mr Balladur wrote this week. 'This is the present situation which is the most damaging to France's sovereignty.' To considerable political effect, but with little real justification, warnings about Maastricht bringing France higher unemployment and taxes loom metres-high on the 'No' campaigners ubiquitous billboards. The rejectionists are right to claim that the Maastricht criteria for Emu are generally deflationary. But passage of the treaty is most unlikely to cause further austerity for France, one of only three EC states which already meets the Maastricht targets on inflation, public spending and debt, as it surely will for a country like Italy that has yet to bite the bullet of financial discipline. Proposals to tighten the EC's purse strings are at least an easy way of getting back at the Brussels bureaucracy - one enemy the French electorate has clearly identified to pollsters. A close reading of Maastricht shows the treaty does little to increase the power of Mr Delors and his Eurocrats. Indeed one of the Mr Delors' initial gripes was that Maastricht puts the making of foreign and internal security policies squarely in the hands of governments, not of the Commission. There may, however, be some rough political logic in believing that a defeat for Maastricht would intimidate the EC bureaucracy, particularly Sir Leon Brittan's trust-busters and state aid controllers whose activities have riled French governments. An equally strong complaint of the 'No' campaigners is that Maastricht would see a tide of immigrants and criminals washing into France. This fear is being exploited most obviously by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader, but also by rebels like Mr Philippe de Villiers of the UDF. Yet the 'frontier control' pass has already been sold, with France's ratification of the Single European Act and the Schengen free-travel treaty. Maastricht's proponents in France are exaggerating when they prophesy Armageddon if the treaty dies on September 20. But the other side is being even more disingenuous in forecasting business as usual. A quick and smooth renegotiation is most unlikely. One just has to recall that Ireland's partners refused this spring to let Dublin excise one sentence about abortion from the signed treaty text, to see how nervous they all were and are about tampering with the Maastricht construct. This is the first dispatch from Paris by David Buchan, formerly chief of the FT's Brussels bureau.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE MAIN PARTIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What their leaders are urging and what their supporters intend to do*.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The right  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UDF: Leadership under conservative former President Valery Giscard      D'Estang, says 'Yes'. But minority faction led by nationalist      Phillipe de Villiers says 'No', as does 39% of the party's      traditional supporters. RPR: Gaulist party leader Jacques Chirac gives reluctant 'Yes'. But      two-thirds of party's members of parliament, led by Phillipe Seguin      and Charles Pasqua say 'No', as does a similar proportion of party      voters. National front: The extreme-right leadership says 'No' and is supported      by 88% of its voters.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The left  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Socialists: Leaders of President Mitterand's party say 'Yes' but are      being defied by the 19% loyal to five members of parliament led      by former Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement. Communists: Leadership says 'No' and 61% of party supporters agree.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Greens  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Generation Ecologie: Leadership says 'Yes' but is opposed by 38% of its      supporters. Les Verts: Unable to adopt official position despite pro-Maastricht      stance of party leader Antone Waechter. However, 47% of the      party's supporters say 'No'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * According to end-of-August opinion polls conducted by SOFRES for TFI and Le Figaro, and BVA for Paris Match.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE MAIN POINTS OF THE MAASTRICHT TREATY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Political union  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Inter-govermental foreign and security policy, 'which might in time lead to a common defence' European citizenship.

Modest increase in powers for European parliament. Upgrading of court auditors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic and monetary union  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Commitment to economic and monetary union by 1999 for countries which fulfil economic criteria.

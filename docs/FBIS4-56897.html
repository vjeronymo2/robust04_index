			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Matanzas correspondent Manolo Garcia] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Antonio Guiteras  thermoelectric plant in Matanzas is operating at full capacity  and absolute efficiency. This plant resumed operations Saturday  afternoon after a brief 72-hour down time period for maintenance.    Engineer Jesus Valdez Torra, plant director, reported that  all defects have been fully eradicated. Therefore, the plant  will be fully operative until the next maintenance period, which  will require six days.    The engineer added that maintenance work will also be done  on  another 330 megawatt unit. This work will include regulating the  valves and cleaning the boiler walls.    The Antonio Guiteras plant has provided more than 500,000  megawatt-hours to date and expects to conclude the year with a  total of 2.2 million megawatt-hours, 10 percent of the total  amount of electricity generated by Cuba's Electric Union.</p>

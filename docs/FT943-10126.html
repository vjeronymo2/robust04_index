			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Travel: The red tribe of the Namibian veldt - Nick Haslam drives across Kaokoland, one of the last great stretches of African wilderness At first I thought it was the setting sun which made them seem reddish in colour. We had seen them from afar, a group of figures on donkeys surrounded by the golden grasses of the veldt. As we came closer, we saw that they were women, and that their skins were oiled to a bright henna colour. It was our first meeting with the Himba, a tribe of nomads in the far north of Namibia. We had left Windhoek, the capital, a week previously, but it seemed more like light years. With the full tanks and jerry-cans of the Land Rover giving us a range of more than 1,000 miles, we were travelling in Kaokoland, a huge area in north-west Namibia and one of Africa's few remaining wildernesses. Already, an asphalt road seemed like a distant memory, and we had become adept at cooking on wood fires, sleeping under the stars and waking at first light to strike camp. It was surprising how natural it felt, and how easy to forget about washing, shaving and all the other trivia of civilised life. Our way into Kaokoland lay along the Hoanib River. Running down to the Atlantic from the hinterland, the river cuts through canyons in the mountains, making a natural highway to the sea. It was the rainy season, but rivers in this part of Namibia may stay dry for years, and we were able to drive along the river bed. Perched on the roof of the Land Rover, we scanned the foliage at the bottom of the cliff walls. The river is used by desert elephants, which have adapted to the harsh climate of northern Namibia. But our luck was out. There were many elephant spoor, and droppings the size of a loaf but our guide crumbled the soggy mass of half-digested grass between his fingers and pronounced it at least two days old. We camped that night beside the river under a huge tamarisk tree which had been gouged and torn by elephants. There were fresh spoor everywhere, but the only excitement came when the most nervous member of our small group, startled by some jackal calls in the middle of the night, decided to forsake his hammock between the branches of the tree and sleep in the security of the Land Rover. Afraid of stepping on scorpions, he shuffled through the camp still in his sleeping bag and, in the gloom, fell over the recumbent guide. Anglo-Saxon curses rent the soft African night and we were all immediately awake, struggling out of our bags, convinced that a rogue elephant had run amuck. We left the Hoanib after two days, and struck north-east. The country changed from rocky bare mountains to wide, sparsely grass-covered savannah. It was hot: about 35'C (95'F) in pools of shade cast by the few thorn trees dotted across the plains. There was plenty of wildlife here: herds of lithe springbok grazing on hillocks and bounding away if we came too close; ostrich and their chicks running at speeds of more than 30mph beside the Land Rover; and oryx: beautiful grey-and-black antelope with long straight horns. We drove along tracks made decades before by poachers who had decimated the black rhino population. Only 150 rhinos survive in Namibia; not surprisingly, we saw few traces of these rare animals. At dusk, a day later, we came out on to the Marienfluss, a swathe of prairie bounded on three sides by mountains and on the fourth by the Kunene River, Namibia's border with Angola. This area had seen fierce fighting between the South African army and the South West African People's Organisation when Namibia was ruled from Johannesburg. The occasional bullet-riddled car wreck was a reminder of the guerrilla war fought over these hills. It was here that we met the Himba. They were a family of five, on donkeys, and at first were wary of a Land Rover full of unshaven, dust-caked whites. The two women finally rode over and asked for a little salt. They were dandling babies, and the donkeys were slung about with numerous leather pouches which held everything they needed. Rolled in goatskin within easy grasp was, I noticed, a heavy knobkerrie, a club which looked as if it could do some damage. In addition to the pleasant, spicy aroma of their oiled skins, the women exuded an air of dignified independence. It felt symbolic, this meeting, of two different ages. We, with our cumbersome vehicle, were intruders on these graceful people who live in harmony with their environment. Our last night in the bush was spent at Epupa, a Himba word meaning 'the place of water noise'. The Kunene River here plunges over a 60ft drop, and its constant roaring filled the night. The sandy beaches above the falls were dotted with crocodiles, though an Afrikaaner setting up a permanent tented camp told us that they were relatively timid, because they had been used for target practice during the border war. 'But downstream of the falls, watch out]' he said. 'The crocs'll come running for you there.' There was torrential rain that night, or, as the Afrikaaner told us, it 'rained old maids with knobkerries'. We set off to cover the last few miles of dirt road but found our track cut by a torrent of brown water. Three Namibians, workers at a local mine, had parked their old Ford pick-up on the edge and were staring disconsolately at the turbid waters. They told us that the waters could take three days to go down. We waded across, and found the water only 3ft deep. For 10-day veterans of the bush, this posed no problem. Our vehicle stuck half-way, but we quickly staked out an anchor and winched ourselves out. Once on the other side, we pulled their pick-up safely through the waters. Then we shared our last cans of beer before shaking hands and heading down the road to Windhoek. Nick Haslam flew to Windhoek c/o Air Namibia, London tel: 081-543 2122. Twice-weekly flights cost Pounds 499 for a low season return.

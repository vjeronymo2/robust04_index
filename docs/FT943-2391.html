			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Strike threatened at Skoda Unions at Skoda Automobilova, the Czech car maker which is part of the Volkswagen group, have threatened strike action after the company said yesterday it intended to lay off 800 workers by the end of the year in an effort to increase competitiveness. Skoda said the redundancies were necessary to help it 'slim a little' and become more competitive on the world car market. But the Czech-Moravian council of trade unions said it would support the unions at Skoda if workers at the company's main Mlada Boleslav plant north of Prague voted for strike action. Mr Jiri Hrabovsky, a Skoda spokesman, said unions and management would meet tomorrow to try to resolve the dispute, which threatens to delay the introduction of Skoda's new compact car, the Felicia, due to begin production next month.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia protests at US tuna ban INDONESIA HAS protested to the US about its ban on imports of Indonesian tuna and has intimated that it will not accept conditions which would allow the ban to be lifted. The embargo, which began in January, is the result of US concern that the catches of yellow fin tuna had entailed the netting of sea dolphins, and that Indonesia was importing tuna from other countries with similar practices. A statement from the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture said that Indonesian fishermen did not catch dolphins, and that there was an active environmental programme to protect rare wildlife species. The statement said that Indonesia had never imported tuna from Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu - countries which the US says are the worst offenders. Nevertheless, the statement said that Indonesia expected the ban to be withdrawn soon. Indonesia will not ban the possible import of tuna from these countries. That would be contrary to the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the statement says. The US embassy in Jakarta said it had noted the protest but had not been asked for an official response. Indonesia's raw and processed tuna exports to the US in 1990 were worth Dollars 25.4m (Pounds 14.70m). Indonesia's main export market for fish products is Japan, which has itself recently complained about residue levels of the anti-biotic tetracyclin in Indonesian shrimps. In 1990, Indonesia exported Dollars 918m of fish products, mostly to Japan, of which shrimps made up about three-quarters of the total. Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture is checking procedures to ensure shrimps meet export quality standards.</p>

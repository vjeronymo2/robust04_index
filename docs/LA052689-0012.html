			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 STEPS TO CURB DRUNK DRIVING  </P> <P> Your editorial praise of our soon-to-retire U.S. surgeon general "A Doctor Up  to the Task" (May 13) was right on: "Dr. C. Everett Koop put public health  before politics as the nation's surgeon general, and President Bush should keep  that example in mind as he seeks a replacement."  </P> <P> But the public-health perspective and pro-activity practiced by Dr. Koop went  far beyond providing "much-needed leadership in educating the public about  acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the hazards of smoking."  </P> <P> Dr. Koop conducted a surgeon general's workshop on drunk driving on Dec. 14-16,  1988, to develop recommendations for a comprehensive plan to bring impaired  driving under control and eliminate it as the leading cause of death and  disability among young people. Highlighting the 250 recommendations and  implementation activities developed by 11 expert panels are these 10:  </P> <P>  -- Equalize federal excise tax rates for all alcoholic beverages by raising  the rates for beer and wine to that of distilled spirits.  </P> <P>  -- Adopt or strengthen server/seller liability statutes and practices to  encourage responsible serving and selling practices.  </P> <P>  -- Require alcohol advertisers to give equal time to health and safety  messages.  </P> <P>  -- Eliminate alcohol advertising and promotion and sponsorship of public  events where the majority of the audience are under the drinking age.  </P> <P>  -- Require state and local police to obtain the blood alcohol concentration of  all drivers and non-motorists involved in fatal and serious motor vehicle  crashes.  </P> <P>  -- Integrate drinking and driving information in all health promotion/risk  reduction programs.  </P> <P>  -- Conduct research on effective community approaches to drinking and driving  prevention.  </P> <P>  -- Establish a coalition of national and local advocacy groups for  coordination, exchange of information, and strategic planning.  </P> <P>  -- Include drinking and driving information in health professionals' training.  </P> <P>  -- Strengthen laws concerning hours of sale, characteristics and density of  outlets, and other factors relating to retail availability of alcoholic  beverages.  </P> <P> RAY CHAVIRA  </P> <P> Board Member  </P> <P> Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

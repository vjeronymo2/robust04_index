			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANTONOVICH CALLS FOR COMPROMISE ON WETLANDS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS, LANDOWNERS AT ODDS ON DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR DESERT OASIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Wednesday that he hopes a  wetlands area near Palmdale that has been the subject of a debate over proposed  development can be protected because of its archeological and biological value.  </P> <P> Antonovich toured the Barrel Springs wetlands in the Antelope Valley with  residents who oppose a plan to build 8 homes on the 63-acre county parcel on  the edge of Palmdale between Avenue T-8 and the California Aqueduct.  </P> <P> "It's a very valid issue," Antonovich said. "Because of the archeological  significance, this area could be a learning center for young people from  kindergarten all the way up through community college."  </P> <P> Antonovich and his staff members said the supervisor is not taking sides in the  dispute. Antonovich said that he hopes local activists, government agencies and  the landowners, Stanley and Lois Sevilla, can fashion a compromise, and said  that state parkland or education funds might be available for preservation of  the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biological Study  </P> <P> Last month, the county Regional Planning Commission instructed Sevilla to  commission a biological study of wildlife in the wetlands, delaying until  October the appeal of a hearing officer's approval of the construction  proposal.  </P> <P> State and federal environmental officials have urged stringent restrictions on  development of the Barrel Springs area because it is a rare oasis in the  desert. It has been a hub of human activity for thousands of years, yielding  the earliest archeological evidence of human presence in the Antelope Valley  and a wealth of Indian artifacts.  </P> <P> Antonovich's comments were praised by Jim McAvoy, president of the North Los  Angeles County Coalition for Planned Growth and Responsive Government, who  arranged the 5th District supervisor's tour. "I think he seemed genuinely  interested," McAvoy said. "I believe he recognized the uniqueness of the area  and the fact that it's worth saving."  </P> <P> Also touring the area was Antelope Valley Community College President Allan  Kurki, who said he is interested in preserving the area because of its  potential educational value.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Density  </P> <P> While the landowner has said his low-density development would not harm the  natural resources of the area, McAvoy said even minimal development would be  ecologically devastating. He and others want the county to acquire the property  and designate it an environmentally protected area.  </P> <P> The dispute could come to the Board of Supervisors if either side appeals the  eventual decision by the Regional Planning Commission. But before the  commission reviews the case Oct. 11, Antonovich suggested compromises, such as  clustering the proposed homes away from wetland areas, or obtaining county  approval to transfer the proposed housing to a 118-acre site south of the  California Aqueduct, the southern boundary of the Sevillas' property.  </P> <P> But Lois Sevilla said Wednesday that moving the project is impossible because  she and her husband have already sold the land they owned south of the  aqueduct.  </P> <P> "It has been our feeling all along that the development could be done  consistently with ecological values," she said. "That's why it's low density.  We are surprised that we're getting this kind of response."  </P> <P> In another development, the Palmdale City Council and Planning Commission will  hold a joint meeting Tuesday to discuss possible methods of preserving the  wetlands.  </P></p>

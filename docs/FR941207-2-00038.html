Lanston &amp; Co., Inc., New York, New York (Company), from Applicant's subsidiary bank, IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Company, New York, New York, and thereby engage in the following activities: 1) executing and clearing, clearing without executing, executing without clearing, purchasing and selling through the use of omnibus trading accounts, and providing investment advisory services to institutional customers with respect to previously approved futures and options on futures contracts on financial commodities; 2) providing investment advice pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4); 3) underwriting and dealing in securities as permitted by 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16); 4) trading foreign exchange in the spot market for nonhedging purposes; 5) trading over the counter options on U.S. Treasury securities for nonhedging purposes; 6) trading options, futures, options on futures and forward contracts in accordance with 225.142 to hedge foreign exchange and securities positions; and 7) acting as an agent for affiliates in the purchase and sale of over the counter interest rate contracts, including swaps, forwards, options (including caps, collars and floors), and any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks, and providing the above-listed futures commission merchant services to affiliates. The activities will be conducted on a worldwide basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by order or regulation that all of the proposed activities are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Northern Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 723 (1994) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P.

Applicant has stated that Company would conduct the proposed activities in accordance with the limitations and conditions imposed by the Board in its orders and regulations. Applicant also maintains that the proposed activities that it would conduct on behalf of affiliates fall within section 4(c)(1)(C) of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal would produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal would produce operational and management efficiencies for Applicant's United States operations. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities would not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than December 23, 1994.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ruan Chongwu, provincial party secretary and </F> governor, entitled: "Conscientiously Implement the Program for  Reform and Development of Education in China and the Teachers'  Law So as To Promote the Development of Educational Undertakings  in Our Province"]    [Text] In February last year, the CPC Central Committee  and the State Council promulgated the Program for Reform and  Development of Education in China. This was a matter of  fundamental importance to the promotion of educational  development in the motherland, as well as the modernization of  society as a whole. In November of the same year, the state  again promulgated the PRC Teachers' Law, which officially came  into effect as of 1 January this year. This shows that the  development of the teaching contingent in our country has been  brought onto the tract of legalization and standardization.  Conscientiously implementing this Program and this Law has a  direct bearing on the training of qualified personnel, and is an  important matter of strategic importance for construction in our  large special economic zone [SEZ]. This is also a heavy task of  the CPC Committees and governments at all levels which are  striving to attain their short-term target.    Since the promulgation of the Program and the Law,  governments and educational departments at all levels in our  province have done a lot of work to enforce them. Investment in  education has been increased by a bigger margin. In 1993,  educational spending covered by our province's budget was 26.8  percent higher than in 1992. Investment in education accounted  for 17.7 percent in our financial expenditure, and 3.3 percent  in the GDP of our province. This was higher than the average  level of the whole country. In 1993, multichannel spending on  school buildings for secondary and primary schools throughout  the province reached 333.9 million yuan. Special allocation for  secondary vocational education reached 39.34 million yuan. All  these investments were the highest in Hainan over the years.    We have adjusted our educational plans to accelerate the  pace  of popularizing our nine-year compulsory education. It has been  decided that the nine-year compulsory education should be  basically popularized throughout the province by 1997, with the  exception of some difficult areas inhabited by minority  nationalities. We plan to basically wipe out illiteracy among  teenagers and youths, and to promote various kinds of  educational reforms. New dimensions are being opened up to  simultaneously develop various kinds of schools, including  schools run by the government, schools run by local people,  schools run jointly by the government and local people, and  schools based on investment from abroad and lateral links at  home, and others. The situation of using varied ways to develop  education has been initially created. There have been more  units selected to carry out experiments in the reform of  schools' internal management system. Conscientious efforts are  being made to do practical and beneficial work for teachers.  Various cities and counties have done a lot of work with regard  to the problems facing teachers, including houses, salaries,  medical service, and jobs for their children. They also have  done a lot to make teachers in people-run schools become regular  teachers, and to improve welfare for teachers in people-run  schools, and for substitute teachers as well.    However, we also should realize that there still are many  problems and difficulties facing our province's education, and  we must pay sufficient attention to them. For instance, the  fact that our educational system does not conform with our  economic structural reform gradually has manifested itself.  Training of qualified personnel has lagged far behind the  demands of the rapid development in our large SEZ. Our teaching  contingent has not become stable enough. To truly solve these  problems, on the previous basis of implementing the Program and  the Law, we should further sum up our experiences, take more  measures, and do a solid job for the implementation of the  Program and the Law. With the further establishment and  operation of the economic system in our SEZ's market, we  urgently need a large number of professionals who have a fine  ideological and moral character, have profound professional  knowledge, and are good at making policy decisions, doing  management work, and [words indistinct] in accordance with  market economic law in the interest of the adjustment of our  economic and industrial structure. In the meantime, we also  urgently need to train a large quantity of middle-ranking and  junior skilled technicians, and laborers working in the  forefront to thoroughly optimize our investment environment.    Governments at all levels throughout the province must have  far-sighted views, and must treat the training of qualified  personnel as a fundamental project for developing our socialist  market economy. We should follow a down-to-earth manner in order  to solve some difficulties and problems, and should do some  solid work in the interest of education. We should make  persistent efforts to grasp well the work of implementing the  Program and the Law. The emphasis in implementing the program  and the law is laid on basically popularizing our nine-year  compulsory education, and wiping out illiteracy among teenagers  and youths in the 1990's.    Educational departments must do a conscientious job in  making budgets and formulating plans involving teachers'  salaries, school funds, school buildings, equipment, and  facilities. In addition, city and county governments must grasp  well the work of implementing relevant plans for developing  basic education, and compulsory education in particular. They  also must do well the work of ensuring teachers' salaries, and  carrying out assessment and examination of educational  development. All townships, towns, and villages must be truly  responsible for improving local conditions for running schools  to ensure that school-aged children and teenagers can start  school on schedule, and that the majority of these children will  not discontinue their schooling.    It is necessary to protect, according to law, the legitimate  rights and interests of schools, teachers, and students. It is  necessary to speed up and deepen internal management reform in  various schools to ensure the establishment of their vigorous  and dynamic operational mechanisms. Course content must be  based on practice. Schools should be run by various different  institutions or individuals. It is necessary to follow  different patterns and forms for running schools. It is  necessary to deepen the reforms involving the recruitment of new  students for universities and colleges, secondary vocational  schools, tuition fees, and job assignments for graduates. The  responsibilities of the state and of society with regard to  education must be linked. It is necessary for us to actively  support work-study programs and school-run industries so as to  increase income in the interest of the development of education.  It is necessary for us to continue to implement the guideline  of relying on the people to run education. It is necessary for  us to continue the practice of raising funds to run schools on a  voluntary basis, and not overrating one's ability. It is  necessary to encourage people to donate money to support schools.    We must make efforts to enhance the ideological, political,  and professional quality of our teaching contingent. We must  energetically encourage the practice of respecting teachers and  attaching importance to education so as to protect teachers'  rights and interests, and to improve their pay and conditions.  The key to implementing the Program and the Law lies in taking  a matter-of-fact attitude. CPC Committees and governments at  all levels throughout the province must proceed from their own  local conditions to do some excellent work to make achievements  in developing education.</p>

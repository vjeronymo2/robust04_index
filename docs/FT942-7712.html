			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Hobson has 53% take-up of shares Hobson, the vehicle for 28-year-old Mr Andrew Regan, yesterday reported the take-up of 52.7 per cent of the shares available in last month's public and open offer. Shareholders yesterday also gave the go-ahead at an extraordinary general meeting for the company's plan to buy the food manufacturing division of Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited for Pounds 111m. Swiss Bank Corporation, which fully placed shares worth Pounds 26.6m with institutions on April 28, underwrote the public offer. Mr Regan became chief executive after reversing Cadismark, his household products business, into Hobson at the end of 1992. The shares, traded on the USM, were suspended on February 10 at 27p pending the announcement of the CWS deal. The acquisition is expected to be completed on Friday when dealings in the new shares are expected to begin.</p>

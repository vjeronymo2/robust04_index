The joint Korea-Canada Economic  Committee, in its second meeting, Wednesday and Thursday  discussed ways to cooperate in several economic groupings,  including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Son Chun-yong, assistant foreign minister for economic  affairs, headed the Korean committee members, and Howard  Balloch, assistant deputy minister for Asia and Pacific in the  Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, led the  Canadian side. The Canadians said they will actively study ways  to extend the period of the Generalized System of Preferences  (GSP) for Korea. They also said that the reduction of tariffs  for Korean-made automobile parts decided early this month was  not temporary and Canada will deal with anti-dumping regulations  on some Korean goods fairly.    Balloch expressed an interest in the opening of Korea's  agricultural market and said that Canada will actively study  Korean demands, including exemption of short-stay visas and  shortening the period for issuing visas to resident businessmen.    Son explained the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations,  plans for implementation of the results, the opening of Korea's  financial market and efforts to improve the environment for  foreign investment before asking for increased Canadian  investment in Korea.    The next committee meeting will be in Canada in the first  quarter of 1995.</p>

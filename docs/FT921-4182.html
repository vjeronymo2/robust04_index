			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): 'Qualified rapture' from film industry - Film Industry MR WILF STEVENSON, director of the British Film Institute, produced a suitably theatrical response to yesterday's tax concessions for the British film industry - 'qualified rapture'. The main concession from Mr Norman Lamont, who has a reputation as a film buff, will allow production costs to be written off against tax in three equal annual tranches after production is complete. At the moment costs can usually only be written off when a film is released and starts to earn revenues. Sometimes this is as long as two years after production is completed. But after more than two years of intensive lobbying the film industry failed in its main objective - to persuade the government that the costs of a film should be written off as soon as they are incurred. This was granted for pre-production costs such as script writing - a small part of a film's costs. 'I don't know whether (the change in the Budget) is generous enough to have much impact,' said Mr Larry Chrisfield, head of entertainment and media at accountants Ernst &amp; Whinney. Mr Lamont's estimate of the sums involved as a result of the concessions - Pounds 5m this year and Pounds 15m in 1993-4 - is, Mr Chrisfield believes, an indication of the significance of the concession. The government may have been influenced by a confidential meeting last month between Mr Jack Valenti, the legendary lobbyist for the US film industry, and Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr John Woodward, chief executive of Pact, the producers association, who was also at the Maude meeting, yesterday described the changes as quite helpful. 'I think it's a sign that the government does recognise that there is a British film industry,' Mr Woodward said. Last year, according to Pact, 15 totally British films were made with a budget of Pounds 33.4m. There were also a further 20 British productions, largely made abroad, costing a total of Pounds 82m.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Elga to pay Pounds 4.94m for furnace maker Elga, the laboratory equip- ment and water purification company, is buying Carbolite, a manufacturer of laboratory furnaces, for Pounds 4.94m. The company, which is changing its name to Protean, will issue 6.5m new shares to help fund the acquisition, and has offered shareholders the chance to buy one share for every 2.6 held on January 28 at 95p apiece. The shares closed at 99p yesterday. The placing is fully underwritten. The purchase will be funded by Pounds 683,000 in loan notes and 4.1m shares. The remaining 2.4m shares will be used to redeem loan notes and reduce Carbolite's Pounds 1.7m borrowings. 'This is an exciting development of the group,' said Mr Alasdair Culshaw, finance director. 'We are very pleased about the acquisition.' Carbolite employs 141 people in Bamford, Thetford and Market Harborough. Its managing director will join the Elga board. The acquisition and change of name must both receive the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting at the end of this month.</p>

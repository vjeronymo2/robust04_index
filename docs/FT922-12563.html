			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Marco Polo satellite may soon be redundant A LEGISLATIVE Catch 22 threatens to turn the multi-million Marco Polo satellite into a useless piece of scrap metal by the end of this year. The Independent Television Commission would like to see the former BSB satellite carry a variety of public service channels such as ones devoted to parliament, the Asian-language, and education. The ITC yesterday called for expressions of interest on how the Marco Polo satellite could be used from the beginning of next year. At present the satellite carries five channels of Sky Television for former BSB customers with 'squarial' dishes. From the beginning of next year Sky Television will be available only from the Astra satellite system and cable networks. The problem is that under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the ITC has to issue licences for 15 years and make sure that applicants have the finances to sustain the service throughout that time. The Marco Polo satellite has only another eight to 10 years before it runs out of power. That means applicants must have enough money to buy or rent a new satellite for the last six years or so of the licence. Mr George Russell, the chairman of the ITC, said recently: 'Once again we can see that the Broadcasting Act was drawn up far too restrictively.' The very lack of flexibility, the ITC chairman added, 'could bring this particular aspect of broadcasting to a shambles'. If the ITC has not licensed any new service by the end of this year former BSB viewers will get no service from their equipment. BSkyB does have an obligation to replace the equip-ment free of charge with Astra equipment. New channels aimed at minority and special-interest groups would get a satellite channel at a token rent. If nobody is prepared to take on the obligation to fund and run a service for 15 years the ITC may have to try to persuade the government to amend the legislation.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: BANKROLL, SEX STYLE RELATED?  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Both my husband and I are very generous with money so we're  surprised that our 17-year-old son is so cautious with his spending. His father  says that he saves almost everything and has built up quite a bank account. For  the past year, he's had only one girlfriend and he seems as cautious about  women as he is about his money. What does this mean? -- V.R.  </P> <P> DEAR V.R.: What you're describing isn't necessarily bad. There does seem to be  some relationship between fidelity and closeness with money. Psychotherapist  Rosemarie Schultz, who wrote the book "Sex and Money: Strange Bedfellows," says  that the way a person handles his bankroll is frequently the way he handles his  sex life.  </P> <P> Generally, careful spenders are equally cautious about the selection of their  sex partners, while big spenders may use less discretion and are more likely to  be unfaithful.  </P> <P> There are just two points, however, that I'd like to make. One, it's generally  a good idea for young people to date a number of different people before going  steady, because this is one of the ways in which they learn about themselves.  And two, it would be a good idea to teach your son to be compassionate and  generous toward those who have less than he. Empathy and generosity toward the  less fortunate needs to be taught. Too much thrift can soon become greed.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I guess because my wife was left alone a lot as a child, she  won't leave our baby's side for a moment. But I would like my wife to attend  social functions with me related to my work. Is it necessary to be with an  infant every moment? -- G.B.  </P> <P> DEAR G.B.: No. It's healthier to have some separation. Of course, babies need  round-the-clock care and nurturing, but this doesn't mean that the mother or  father have no time to themselves. The child's legitimate needs should be  filled as soon as possible, but there are also times when the baby should be  left alone to sleep in her own crib or to play by herself.  </P> <P> During the first three or four months, it's a good idea for the baby to sleep  in the parents' room, but after that it's fine for him to sleep in a room  nearby.  </P> <P> Little children need to get used to the idea that when mother leaves the room  or the house she'll return later. If the baby cries, that's fine. This is a  part of growing up and the fact that mother does return is one of the ways the  child builds a sense of faith and trust.  </P> <P> Parents need time off for their health, as well as their child's. Encourage  your wife to go with you. Find a responsible substitute to care for your baby.  </P></p>

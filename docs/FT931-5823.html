			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Lotus wins Taiwan order: General Motors may now find selling the division a difficult option GROUP LOTUS, the Norfolk-based sports car and engineering concern, has won a Taiwan government-backed contract to help develop car engine production in the country. The contract, which the company said yesterday would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may make a decision by General Motors to sell Lotus more difficult. GM has owned Lotus since 1987. Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or parts of Group Lotus including a management team led by managing director Mr Adrian Palmer. GM has not disclosed details of any of the other approaches, which followed a decision last year to abandon production after less than two years of the Elan small sports car which Lotus had hoped to sell at a rate of 3,000 a year. The car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales targets. As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels. Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released. The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the business, with 500 employees. The Taiwanese deal involves technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute. Four Taiwanese carmakers - Yulon Motor, China Motor Corp, San Yang Industry and Yeu Tyan Machinery Manufacturing - are also taking part in the project, which aims to bring into volume production a range of 1.2 litre and 1.6 litre car engines by 1997. Taiwanese officials said the project would help to upgrade the island's car industry and reduce its reliance on imports of components from Japan. General Motors' dilemma is that while it would probably be glad to be rid of the loss-making car side of the business, GM is itself one of the biggest customers for Lotus Engineering's design and development services.</p>

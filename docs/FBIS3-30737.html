The Croats forcibly mobilized by the  Muslim army are being sent to the front lines and forced to  shoot at their dearest ones -- fathers, brothers, and sons.  Recalcitrant Croats and those refusing to be mobilized are  being arrested in large numbers.    The building housing the Croatian cultural center, which is  a  symbol of Croatian struggle, has been turned into a Muslim  forces' military building. Before that it was a frequent target  of Muslim fire. The Croatian population of Zenica is quietly  resisting all forms of imposed Muslim authority.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / People: Regional attraction for Dighe Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, has appointed Ian Dighe a director with responsibility for expanding corporate finance operations in the Midlands from a base in Birmingham. For Dighe, the appointment is one of a series which has taken him through the worlds of banking, accountancy, industry and individual consultancy, always working in financial and managerial capacities. Immediately before joining Singer &amp; Friedlander, he was an executive director at McLeod Russel, the surface coatings and property company, where he was in charge of acquisitions and disposals. His appointment is unusual in two senses. First, merchant banks have been retrenching in the regions rather than expanding. 'There is no point in having regional offices unless you have them fully staffed in all disciplines,' Dighe says, with an eye on providing corporate advice especially to companies with a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 150m. Second, according to Dighe, 'there are very few jobs where you get a high degree of autonomy and a task to get on with.' Dighe, 37, and married with three children, is also attracted to the Midlands for an extra-curricular reason. He is a country pursuits and shooting man which is, he says, 'why I'm not anywhere near London.'</p>

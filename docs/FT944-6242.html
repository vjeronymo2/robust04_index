			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Unquoted companies 'more attractive' - High-risk investment Investing in unquoted companies will be a much more attractive proposition in future with the broadening of tax incentives on two schemes: Enterprise Investment Schemes and Venture Capital Trusts. In some cases, tax relief of up to 60 per cent will be available. With both schemes, the chancellor has made use of an extension of the reinvestment relief for investing in unquoted companies, which was introduced in last year's Budget. This relief allows a capital gains tax liability from any investment to be deferred indefinitely if the gain is invested in an unquoted trading company meeting certain conditions. Rules on which companies qualify as unquoted trading companies under the scheme were also relaxed in yesterday's Budget. The main restriction to be abolished was the 'interest in land' rule, which disqualified a company if more than half its assets were in land and buildings at any point during the three years after investment. Relief has also been extended to property development and farming companies. Enterprise Investment Schemes were introduced last year as a successor to the much-exploited Business Expansion Scheme, to encourage direct investment in small unquoted trading companies. They carry a basic incentive of 20 per cent up-front income tax relief on investments up to Pounds 100,000 a year, if shares in the company are held for at least five years. Now the chancellor has added the possibility of combining the income tax relief with rollover reinvestment relief for capital gains, giving a potential total tax relief of 60 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers who have gains to reinvest. The reinvestment relief applies to assets disposed of on or after yesterday. It can be used if the disposal of assets is made up to one year before or three years after the subscription for shares under the EIS is made. Venture capital trusts: plans to introduce a new kind of venture capital trust were announced in the 1993 Budget, with further details given in a consultative document published earlier this year. The trusts will take the form of quoted investment funds, intended to provide ordinary investors with an easy way to invest in a portfolio of very small, growing unquoted companies. The original proposals gave investments in the new trusts tax treatment in line with personal equity plans: tax-free income and capital gains, but no up-front incentives. Yesterday, however, the chancellor said that investments in the trusts would attract both 20 per cent income tax relief and capital gains tax reinvestment relief, adding up to a possible total of 60 per cent tax relief, as with enterprise investment schemes. Investors can put up to Pounds 100,000 a year into the trusts. Again, the reliefs only apply if the shares are held for at least five years. The chancellor also announced details of what restrictions there would be on the type of investment the new trusts made. Investments can include both equity and loans (with a minimum term of five years), but at least half the investments must be in new ordinary shares. At least 70 per cent of their investments must be in unquoted trading companies, with no more than 15 per cent in any one company or group of companies. To qualify as unquoted trading companies for this purpose, companies must have assets of less than Pounds 10m before the investment is made. Venture capital trusts are due to be introduced from April next year.</p>

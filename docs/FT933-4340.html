			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Silliness' of radiation proviso Sir, On reading that Nuclear Electric had applied for authorisation for radioactive discharges from Sizewell B ('Talks on Sizewell application', August 13) and being worried for my children's future, I wrote to the National Radiological Protection Board for reassurance that the lower annual radiation dose limits which it had recommended in 1987 would be enforced. Its reply advised me that its role is 'advisory rather than regulatory' and that it is up to the 'authorising departments' and the Health and Safety Executive to ensure discharges and doses are 'within the appropriate limits'. The NRPB also enclosed a memorandum on potential Thorp discharges. Reading this lengthy document, I came to this statement: 'It was assumed that infants and children spend 90 per cent of the time indoors.' I read no further. To me, the silliness of this statement rivalled that of the Health and Safety Executive/UK Atomic Energy Authority's in their publication of January 1989, The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations (HMSO Pounds 12). This told us that if there was 'a Chernobyl-scale accident' in this country, 'no one will die,' people would merely 'suffer some degree of life-shortening.'

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (25): Cars by the million - Profile, Maruti is a showpiece company, with a Japanese flavour THE factory of Maruti Udyog, India's largest auto maker, is a showpiece of Indian industry. The company, a joint venture between the government and Japan's Suzuki Motor, builds cars to Japanese designs, using Japanese equipment and a liberal sprinkling of imported Japanese parts. Seven Japanese engineers are on hand to give advice. If India cannot make world-class vehicles here, it will find it difficult to make them anywhere. Since the plant went into production 10 years ago, nearly 1m cars have rolled off the production lines at the purpose-built factory outside Delhi. Over time, the Japanese content of the best-selling model - a cheap and cheerful 800cc compact - has fallen from over 90 per cent to just 5-6 per cent. Maruti 800s have been sold abroad, albeit in small quantities, not just to developing countries but also to France and Italy. Nevertheless, even with a decade's experience behind them, Maruti managers are unable fully to convince their customers that they have reached world-standards in quality. Mr R C Bhargava, the managing director, admits that in the second-hand market older Marutis, with a higher Japanese content, command a premium over newer cars. He says: 'Our cars are 90 per cent as good as the cars made by Suzuki in Japan, We want to reach their level but are not there yet.' The commitment to quality is visible in the factory. Japanese-style slogans hang over the production lines - 'Let's work together and achieve our goals,' says one. 'Fight absenteeism,' says another. Boards on the walls give detailed information on quality performance, with the numbers up-dated every day. No-one pretends that the factory has reached Japanese levels of efficiency. The lines do not move as fast or as smoothly as in Japan. Around the factory components are piled high in boxes awaiting assembly. Just-in-time manufacturing is impossible given the slowness of the Indian transport network. Nevertheless, as far as in-house production is concerned, the gap between India and Japan is slowly being closed by training: every year, about 100 Maruti workers spend six months working in Japan. One engineer says the main thing they learn is not technical knowledge but Japanese work habits. 'You can see the difference.' The factory has an engine plant - but virtually all the other components, including key items such as steering and transmission systems, are bought from outside suppliers. From the earliest days, deficiencies in quality often originated from defective parts - and they still do. To raise quality, Maruti has invested in six joint ventures with suppliers of all its key components - to secure a managerial voice in the running of their operations. Mr Bhargava says that improving the quality of bought-in components has been 'the major effort all these years'. Production costs are also a concern for Mr Nandy. At an ex-factory cost of about Rs106,000 (166,000 on-the-road with taxes), Maruti 800s are cheap by world standards. The price is kept down partly in response to pressure from the government which would like to put the car within the reach of as many Indians as possible. So profits are squeezed. Maruti made just Rs366m pre-tax profit in the year to March 1993 on sales of Rs22.22bn. Until now, Maruti has had the luxury of operating in a market with very limited competition. Its main rivals have been restricted by India's autarchic industrial policies from importing technology to modernise their output. For example, the venerable Ambassador, made by Hindustan Motor, is little different from the 1950s Morris Oxford on which it is based. Premier Auto, in Bombay, makes models based on 1960s and 1970s Fiats. Not surprisingly, Maruti has over 70 per cent of the auto market. It sells every car it makes with little marketing. Often customers must pay in advance and wait two or three months for delivery. With the liberalisation of the Indian economy, Maruti could now face real competition. Earlier this year, Delhi removed government controls on investment in the auto industry. Hindustan Motor is talking to General Motors of the US about manufacturing the Astra model and Premier is planning a link with Peugeot of France. But Maruti has plenty of time to prepare for the onslaught. Its rivals' plans are some way from fruition. Also, they concentrate on mid-sized cars - not direct competitors to the Maruti 800. In the meantime, Maruti is in the midst of expanding its plant capacity from 130,000 cars a year to 250,000 in two or three years. It is also enlarging its model range - as well as the staple Maruti 800, the factory has for several years also made jeeps and small minibuses. Three years ago it launched a 1000cc mid-sized car and this year it introduced a sporty-looking 1000cc compact, which will be by far the fastest home-made car on Indian roads. The launch of the new car called the Zen has created a big stir in India, even though only 2,000 will be made before next March and all these cars have been sold. Maruti is also planning a modest expansion in exports. It has been exporting since the mid-1980s, with a peak of 23,000 vehicles in 1991-92, falling to 14,600 last year. Mr Bhargava says the main purpose has not been to increase sales, though export revenues have been very welcome, but to raise quality by exposing Maruti to foreign competition. Indeed, so satisfied are Suzuki's Japanese managers with the improvements in the quality of Maruti's exports that next year they intend to sell the Zen car in Europe under the Suzuki label, a first for an Indian-made car.</p>

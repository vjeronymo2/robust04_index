			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Du Pont turns in profits down by 4% for quarter DU PONT, the biggest US chemical company, yesterday turned in first-quarter earnings that were slightly better than expected due to strong gains from its petroleum business which offset the erosion in earnings from core fibres and plastics operations. Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 4 per cent to Dollars 590m, or 88 cents a share, from Dollars 615m, or 90 cents, a year earlier. The 1990 earnings included a one-time charge of 6 cents a share. Strong petroleum sales spurred a 3 per cent improvement in Du Pont's overall sales in the first quarter to Dollars 9.7bn from Dollars 9.4bn while the petroleum business recorded sales of Dollars 4.06bn, up 15 per cent in the quarter. However, Du Pont said combined sales from other segments fell 2 per cent in the first three months of 1991, reflecting a 6 per cent decline in US volume. On Wall Street, Du Pont's shares had added Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 by the close of trading. Strong margins for refined products and higher prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas contributed to a 63 per cent improvement in earnings from Du Pont's petroleum business in the three months, to Dollars 322m from Dollars 197m. Du Pont's results underscored the importance of a diverse earnings base to companies operating in the cyclical chemicals industry. Monsanto, one of the more diversified US chemicals companies, posted a 14 per cent drop in first-quarter net to Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.31 a share, on revenues which fell 3 per cent to Dollars 2.22bn. Du Pont's chemicals business recorded after-tax operating income of Dollars 78m, against Dollars 129m in the first quarter of 1990. The 1991 figures include an Dollars 18m charge associated with Du Pont's partial withdrawal from the freon manufacturing business. Earnings were also hurt by higher costs for developing alternatives to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and falling demand for CFC products. Income from Du Pont's fibres business dropped 17 per cent to Dollars 85m, including one-time charges of Dollars 27m. In Du Pont's polymers business, the impact of the slowdown in the North American vehicle and construction industries was partly offset by improved results in Europe. After-tax income from the polymers segment fell 17 per cent to Dollars 68m from Dollars 82m.</p>

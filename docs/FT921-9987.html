			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Despatches (Buenos Aires): Argentina names its Nazis - The secret files that shed light on a murky world of intrigue WHEN Argentina's National Archives opens its doors at 10am on Monday morning, the bundles of yellowing, tattered memos, telegrams, letters, forms, fingerprint cards and newspaper cuttings that constitute the formerly top secret files on the Nazi connection will at last become public knowledge. The files that President Carlos Menem ceremoniously ordered declassified this week are unlikely to reveal any sensational new clues on Nazis in South America. But the documents depict vividly the extraordinary sense of security some of the world's most wanted criminals felt in Argentina, not just under the junta that first let them in, but under subsequent civilian and military governments as well. Shimon Samuels, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, the organisation established to trace former Nazis, who sifted through the records for four hours on Wednesday, says: 'They confirmed what we already knew. It's the tip of the iceberg, the beginning of a process. But what is really striking was the total indifference of (Argentine) governments to the Nazis.' Although Samuels says there are gaps in the files - where they were probably purged of embarrassing or incriminating material - we can still read that Josef Mengele, the notorious Angel of Death, lived undisturbed in Buenos Aires for ten years following his arrival in Argentina in 1949. In one remarkable Federal Police document dated November 9 1956, the West German consulate confirms Mengele's identity, providing a copy of his birth certificate. Mengele used the certificate to shed the alias of Gregor Helmut and assume his true identity, complete with authentic Argentine documents. Nobody in Bonn or Buenos Aires, it seems, ever thought of arresting him. The Nazis' quiet, peaceful life in Buenos Aires ended suddenly in 1960, when a Mossad team captured Adolf Eichmann and took him to Israel for trial and execution. Some Nazis, like Mengele, fled. He went to Paraguay and later to Brazil, where he is believed to have died in 1979. Another police letter shows why many were right to stay put. The letter, rejecting a German request to extradite Mengele shortly after Eichmann's arrest, states that: 'The Argentine government informs that it has denied the request because of failures of formality and procedure, since extra-officially it had been explained that the crimes alleged against the accused are of political character, and thus it would not be correct to accept the request.' It is easy to see how lesser criminals such as Abraham Kipp, a Dutch Nazi, were able not only to evade arrest but to acquire Argentine citizenship and live out the rest of their Israelis, who had other concerns, decided to abort the hunt for Mengele and other war criminals, and the Germans and Argentines never showed much energy in arresting Nazis. Only two Nazi suspects out of at least 16 known to have lived in Argentina were ever arrested. During the 1980s, when Raul Alfonsin was president, the police arrested Walter Kutschman, who died while in custody, and Josef Schwamberger, who is awaiting trial in Germany. Both were charged with mass murders. Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, has claimed that the military junta that ruled Argentina in 1945 handed out thousands of passports to fleeing Nazis through its consulates in Lisbon, Madrid and Rome. The role of the Spanish and Italian authorities in assisting the Nazis is now well-established. Over the years it emerged that even Red Cross officials and Catholic churchmen helped Nazis to escape. Juan Peron came to power in Argentina in 1947 and remained president until he was toppled in 1955. He was also a key figure in the previous junta and his fascination for the Nazis, and especially the Fascist movement, is well-known. But Tomas Eloy Martinez, an Argentine historian, says Peron's post-war relationship with Nazis was more opportunistic. He believes Peron was motivated by an admiration for the 'superiority' of German technology despite the Nazi defeat. He felt Nazi brain power would help industrialise Argentina and modernise the armed forces. Nonetheless, Martinez comments wryly: 'Buenos Aires was short on (Nazi) brains and long on criminals.' Samuels adds that 'there is speculation of Nazi payoffs.' Files from the Central Bank could throw light on the widely-held belief in Argentina that the Nazis brought tons of bullion with them. Anti-semitism has deep roots in Argentina and Nazi and Fascist tracts are still widely available at the late-night bookshops in central Buenos Aires. Following Eichmann's arrest, police memoranda show that officers were busier tracking possible Israeli agents than in hunting for other Nazis. Indeed, police warnings are believed to have allowed suspects to evade arrest. Rabbi Morton Rosenthal, of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League, added that there is a link between the Nazi presence in Argentina and the thuggery with which the armed forces there suppressed political opposition. The forces resorted to abductions, torture and mass murders during the 'Dirty War' of the 1970s, in which between 6,000 and 30,000 people died or 'disappeared.' Rabbi Rosenthal says: 'There are reports of torturers singing Nazi songs and Nazi flags hanging in police stations.' Jews, some of whom were children of concentration camp survivors, were often subjected to especially severe treatment. It is an irony that has not escaped human rights activists that Menem not only pardoned a year ago the generals who sanctioned the killing, but turned down requests that secret police and armed forces files also be opened. Menem has also been attacked from within his own Peronist party for allowing the memory of Juan Peron to be sullied by opening the files. The declassification of the Argentine files coincides with the opening of historical and security police archives in east Germany and the countries of the former Soviet Union and the information cross-referenced. The pressure is now on other Latin American countries to come clean. A key target is Paraguay, where former dictator Alfredo Stroessner offered citizenship to wanted Nazis, including Mengele. Rabbi Rosenthal says that despite the new democratic government's promise 'to throw out all the trash', it has not kept its word to arrest two Ukrainian criminals still living in Paraguay. It may be true that there are few war criminals left alive, making Menem's decision little more than a politically astute gesture. However, Jewish leaders are genuinely impressed by the efforts of Menem  - who is of Syrian descent - to respond to the anxieties of Argentina's 300,000 to 400,000 Jews. He has spoken in synagogues, visited Israel, banned a local Nazi grouping and scrapped a missile being developed with Egypt and Iraq. If nothing else, they say, opening files will help Argentines and people everywhere to remember the Holocaust.</p>

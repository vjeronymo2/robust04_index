			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / MoD publishes D-notice details THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday published for the first time details of the D-notice system of press and broadcasting self-censorship on security matters. The move was an early fulfilment of a pledge in last week's white paper on open government. The notices, issued by a committee of civil servants and media representatives, give advice and guidance on the sort of information about defence, intelligence and security matters which should not be published in the interests of national security. Publication of the notices came a week after Mrs Stella Rimington, head of the security service, emerged from the shadows to face the cameras. After a review, the eight current notices have been revised, reduced to six and published. They are also to be renamed 'defence advisory notices' - or DA-notices - to emphasise the nature of the system. Publication of the six notices will disappoint conspiracy theorists, who are prone to allege that 'they' will 'slap a D-notice' on a wide range of fascinating information to keep the public in the dark. The six DA-notices cover general matters such as: Operations, plans and capabilities which could help a potential enemy. Classified information on weapons, equipment and installations. Details of government ciphers and secure communications. The identities of members of the security and intelligence services, their operations and methods. Information which DA-notice 2 says should be withheld on non-nuclear weapons and equipment is code names and numbers, design, performance figures, numbers and areas of vulnerability. The rationale given is that such details could enable potential enemies or terrorists to improve their chances of success in an attack. Detailed advice on implementing particular notices is offered by Rear Admiral David Pulvertaft, secretary of the defence, press and broadcasting advisory committee which issues them. he receives several requests a week for guidance from newspaper editors or, more rarely, from TV and radio. He sees his job as trying to help journalists to publish their stories without damaging national security. 'Occasionally I have to ring an editor and say: 'I'm sorry that you published that',' he said. 'When I explain why, they're usually very sorry and say that they hadn't realised.'</p>

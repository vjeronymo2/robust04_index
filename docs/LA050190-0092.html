			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Ames Department Stores Inc., the discount retailer that last week filed for  bankruptcy protection, has named Stephen Pistner chief executive.  </P> <P> He replaces Peter Hollis, who resigned. Rocky Hill, Conn.-based Ames said  Pistner's appointment is subject to court approval. The 58-year-old served as  president and chief operating officer of Dayton Hudson Corp. from 1977 to 1981  after he successfully revived the Minneapolis-based retailer's lagging Target  discount stores. In 1981, he joined Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., where he was  credited with implementing the strategies that brought that retailer back to  health.  </P></p>

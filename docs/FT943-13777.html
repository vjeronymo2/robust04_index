			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Profits of more than Pounds 1bn seen for Lloyd's in 1993 Lloyd's of London can expect to make comfortable profits in 1993 and for the next three years and investors should buy shares in a number of the listed Lloyd's investment trusts formed last year, a securities firm argues. Mr Nick Bunker, analyst with Hoare Govett UK Investment Research, predicts pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.02bn in 1993. However, the figure will be reduced by additional provisions for past losses, stemming mainly from US asbestosis and pollution related claims. Mr Bunker expects 'headline' pre-tax profits to decline thereafter, to Pounds 810m in 1994, Pounds 739m in 1995 and Pounds 155m in 1996, thanks to a number of factors including the Los Angeles earthquake in January this year, losses from which are expected to cost Lloyd's Dollars 700m (Pounds 460m). In addition, losses from shipping and aviation are expected to rise, while premium rate competition will intensify. The forecasts, the first medium term assessment of the market's prospects, were calculated on the basis of eight computer models. The research stresses 'these forecasts have been struck conservatively, on the basis of assumptions which are set out explicitly and in full'. In particular Hoare Govett does not expect any upturn in rates for US casualty business. The relatively upbeat forecast follows five years of record breaking losses. Most recently Lloyd's announced a deficit of Pounds 2.1bn for the 1991 underwriting year, bringing its total losses since 1988 to more than Pounds 7bn. Losses are also expected for the 1992 underwriting year, when results are reported next year. Hoare Govett says that in some sectors of the market, notably in marine business, returns will be very high by historic standards, and that therefore, 'signs of rate reductions in some areas this year should not be surprising or necessarily worrying'. The forecasts assume that Lloyd's can finance the creation of NewCo, the reinsurance company into which it aims to transfer all liabilities stemming from 1986 and earlier.</p>

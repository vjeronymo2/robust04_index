			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Efforts to seize full  control over the mass media are becoming increasingly marked,  according to Aleksey Simonov, head of the Foundation for  Protecting Openness. He told a news conference on Wednesday  that these efforts included the intention of the Russian  Committee for the Press "to take all publishing facilities into  one fist", as well as too wider powers to be given to the  Federal Broadcasting Service under a law which is being drafted  at the moment.    A bill on state support of the "fourth power" by granting it  tax preferences has stumbled in parliament. For this reason,  the press will have to live on state subsidies this and next  year.    The situation over broadcasting media is even more strained,  since they have been continually threatened with strikes of  communications workers. Simonov expressed puzzle as to why the  state cannot "free" the TV and radio companies it cannot  maintain. He also complained about disunity of journalists'  actions in solving these issues.    The Foundation for Protecting Openness, numbering only five  staffers, was founded three years ago. It is engaged in  monitoring violations of journalists' rights throughout the  Commonwealth of independent States. The foundation also set up  a mass media law school and participated in actions aimed at  release of newsmen illegally jailed in zones of inter-ethnic  conflicts.</p>

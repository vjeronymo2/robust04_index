			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Aslef acts over rail strike safety The rail dispute took a new turn yesterday with Aslef, the drivers' union, informing its members that they have the right to refuse to take charge of trains on signalling strike days. Aslef has written to its 14,500 British Rail members telling them that they are legally entitled not to drive a train if they have concerns about safety. The move follows advice from the union's solicitors after an alleged string of complaints from drivers about the competence of staff working signal boxes during strike action by members of the RMT union in its pay dispute with Railtrack. Anger has been expressed by Aslef over BR's move to offer Railtrack some of its staff to run signal boxes during strikes. BR's rulebook obliges drivers not to move a train and to approach a supervisor if they have serious concerns. BR said the legal advice given to Aslef was absolutely correct. 'We would not expect any staff to act in an unsafe manner,' it said. Aslef said solicitors had advised the union that drivers who decided not to run a train were protected under the 1993 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act. The union said: 'We are told that the act gives employees the right not to be dismissed, made redundant or subject to any detriment if they take appropriate steps to protect themselves because they believe they are in serious or imminent danger.' Aslef's solicitors have told the union that the legislation was 'untried' and there could be a test case involving an individual driver if action was taken following the advice. A mass walk-out of drivers during next week's action is unlikely. Drivers who did walk out would risk laying themselves open to disciplinary action for negligence if, for example, a train was stopped between stations. In its letter to its members Aslef stresses: 'We will encourage our members to act responsibly and adhere to these procedures but we cannot just carry on warning about safety hazards, being ignored and waiting for the inevitable accident to occur.' The Health and Safety Executive said it had investigated about two-thirds of complaints by Aslef members and had found nothing to jeopardise public safety. Railtrack said last night that it planned to run freight trains on the East Coast line from London to Scotland for the first time during a signal workers' strike. A 48-hour strike is scheduled to start at midday on Tuesday.</p>

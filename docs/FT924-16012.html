			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sears Roebuck holds a multi-billion stock clearance - The restructuring of once the world's biggest retailer - its second in four years ONCE derided by Wall Street as a lumbering giant that sold a mish-mash of 'socks and stocks', and under criticism from its shareholders for poor performance, Sears Roebuck has taken the plunge. It is going to pull its socks up by getting rid of the stocks. In a bold move aimed at ending the company's decline from its once-unchallenged position as the world's largest retailer, Sears announced on Tuesday a large chunk of its financial services business, the most profitable part of the group, would be sold to public and private interests over the next 12 months. By spinning off much of the non-retailing business, the company's long-time chairman, Mr Ed Brennan, is admitting that his ambitious plan launched in the early 1980s to meet the shopping and financial services needs of America's middle classes has failed. After the demerger is complete, Sears will be left with two core businesses  -retail merchandising and composite insurance - and a lot less debt. Analysts estimate that the restructuring will shrink Sears' total debt load from almost Dollars 40bn to not much more than Dollars 16bn. About Dollars 3bn will be paid off from the proceeds of the sales, and the rest will simply be shifted off Sears' balance sheet to the books of the newly-sold companies. Gone will be the highly-profitable stockbroking and credit card operation Dean Witter Financial Services, the residential property brokerage and relocation, mortgage and savings bank businesses of Coldwell Banker Financial Services, and 20 per cent of Allstate, the group's big composite insurance subsidiary. The remaining 80 per cent of Allstate, which has been part of the Sears empire since 1931, will stay within the group, where it will be run alongside the struggling retailing operation which has acted as a drag on the group's share price since the late 1980s. It was the poor state of the retailing business that prompted this week's dramatic move. For several years Wall Street analysts have argued that the strong performance of the financial services operations was being overshadowed by the weaknesses on the retailing side. Shareholders felt they were not getting their full value from the company because the share price never properly reflected the merits of the individual businesses. The performance of the stock has certainly been disappointing. After hitting a high of almost Dollars 60 in 1987, Sears shares spent the next five years bouncing back and forth between Dollars 30 and Dollars 40, despite a prolonged bull market in US equities. The problem was twofold: earnings were in decline, from a peak of Dollars 1.63bn in 1987 to a low of Dollars 902m in 1990; and investors' perceptions of the company were dominated by the troubles of the retailing business. Dissatisfaction with the way Sears was being run reached a head at the annual meeting in May this year. A large group of shareholders, led by Mr Robert Monks, a professional shareholder activist, put forward five proposals aimed at shaking up the company and improving shareholder value. One of those proposals was a demerger of the financial services operations. Although Sears' management, led by chairman Mr Ed Brennan, initially rejected the demerger idea, there is little doubt that the restructuring announced on Tuesday is a result of the pressure from shareholders. Mr Monks described the restructuring this week as a 'victory for the corporate system in America'. Wall Street certainly believes the demerger is good for shareholders. The day it was announced, Sears stock jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 , and many of the analysts who had been quietly bullish on the stock this year said Sears' actions justified their confidence in the outlook for the company's earnings. Mr Peter Siris of UBS Securities in New York was one of the many who applauded Sears' move. He said: 'Sears has a good value of between Dollars 80 a share and Dollars 90 a share, and the demerger does three things. It helps shareholders realise some of that value, it creates pieces that people will be able to understand so that the stock can fetch a fairer value, and it leaves the retail people free to turn around the retail side.' The restructuring of the retail operations is already under way. The company has reduced staff by 48,000 in the past two years, and taken out Dollars 1bn of costs on an annual basis. Further cuts are likely, says Sears' chairman, Mr Brennan: 'In today's business climate you have to continue to pare away at costs.' Cutting costs is one thing, repairing the battered image of the company's stores is another. During the 1980s, Sears was squeezed between specialty and discount retailers, while its own stores looked increasingly antiquated alongside the brash newcomers. Customers stayed away in droves. Since the start of the 1990s, Sears has worked hard at reorganising the layout and look of its 860 stores to bring them more up to date. Even so, shoppers have been reluctant to embrace the new image. In the first half of this year the merchandising side made a profit of Dollars 95m, but that was entirely due to earnings from Sears' charge card business. Domestic retailing actually made a loss over the six months of Dollars 140m. Analysts say more work needs to be done to sharpen the identity of Sears stores in a crowded market, and to nurse back to health the frail mail-order catalogue business. The Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, however, said this week it believed 'a more focused approach to marketing, broader merchandise assortments, along with continued cost savings should yield some near-term benefits'. Allstate, meanwhile, should require little attention. The company, which brought in profits of Dollars 723m last year, is the second largest underwriter of property/casualty premiums in the world, and unlike many other insurers, it has a solid investment portfolio. Although it faces a loss of Dollars 700m on claims filed in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, Allstate should benefit from an expected upturn in the insurance cycle and a rise in rates over the next few years. The sale of the financial services units are expected to go well. Sears says it hopes to bring in more than Dollars 3bn on the transactions. Dean Witter, bought for Dollars 607m in 1981, has built a strong presence in retail stockbroking, and last year, with the help of the fast-growing Discover credit card business, made a profit of Dollars 345m. Coldwell Banker made a profit of Dollars 61m last year, and it is possible the operation will be sold in three different pieces: property brokerage and relocation, mortgage provision, and banking. The 20 per cent stake in Allstate that Sears is floating on the stock market should also attract plenty of demand. Analysts estimate it could fetch between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn, depending on how the insurer's assets are measured. The tumultuous changes at Sears leave its chairman, Mr Brennan, in a shaky position. He will find it difficult to portray the demerger as his idea. When dissident shareholders proposed spinning off the non-retailing businesses earlier this year Mr Brennan reiterated his belief that the diverse parts of Sears were more valuable operating under the umbrella of a single corporate entity. This is also his second major restructuring of Sears in just four years. In 1988 he proposed selling the Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest office building, buying back Sears stock, and launching a new discounted price strategy for the group's stores. The only part of the plan that succeeded was the stock buy-back programme. Mr Brennan will be hoping for a better success rate this time.</p>

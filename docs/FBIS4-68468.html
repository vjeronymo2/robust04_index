Meshkov in  Simferopol on 11 April 1994]    [Text] Pursuant to subsections 10-13 of Section 2 of the  Law of Ukraine "On the Delineation of the Powers of Government  Agencies of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and in accordance  with the first paragraph of Edict 228/93 of the President of  Ukraine of 23 June 1993 "On the Open Economic Policy Within the  Territory of the Crimean Republic" referring to the creation of  an open economy in the Crimean Republic, envisaging the  liberalization of foreign economic financial and banking  relations,    I hereby decree that:    1. The banking system of the Crimean Republic will be part  of  the banking system of Ukraine, will operate on two levels, and  will consist of the Republic Bank of Crimea and commercial banks  of various types and forms of ownership.    Banks of all forms of ownership within the Crimean Republic  will be guided in their actions by the laws of Ukraine and the  Crimean Republic, by this edict, and by other legislative  instruments issued in accordance with existing laws and  regulating banking operations.    2. The Republic Bank of Crimea will be owned by the Crimean  Republic. The Republic Bank of Crimea will be autonomous of the  National Bank of Ukraine in its activities (with the exception  of the right to issue currency, which will be the exclusive  prerogative of the National Bank of Ukraine).    The Republic Bank of Crimea will pursue state policy in the  areas of monetary circulation, credit, and settlements and will  regulate and oversee the activities of commercial banks within  the confines of its jurisdiction.    For the performance of its duties, the Republic Bank of  Crimea will take part in drafting state programs for the  economic and social development of the Crimean Republic, the  state budget of the Crimean Republic, the payment balance sheet  of the Crimean Republic, and other state programs with a  possible impact on the state of monetary circulation.    3. The Republic Bank of Crimea will do the following:    --plan and carry out measures to regulate the volume and  structure of the total amount of money in circulation by means  of the appropriate consultations with the National Bank of  Ukraine.    The regulation of the volume and structure of the total  amount of money in circulation will be accomplished by changing  the amount of credit extended by commercial banks; buying and  selling securities and foreign currency; changing the standard  limits on the compulsory reserves of commercial banks in the  Republic Bank of Crimea; changing the interest rates of the  Republic Bank of Crimea on its credits; and imposing limits on  the credit investments of commercial banks;    --service the state debt of the Crimean Republic by  conducting operations connected with the extension of state  loans of the Crimean Republic, the repayment of these loans, and  the payment of the interest on these loans;    --collect cash and other forms of payment for the state  budget of the Crimean Republic and organize and carry out the  execution of the state budget of the Crimean Republic  autonomously and through commercial banks;    --organize settlements between commercial banks through the  correspondent accounts these banks open in the Republic Bank of  Crimea, the settlement organizations established by commercial  banks, and other methods acceptable to commercial banks;    --represent the interests of the Crimean Republic in  relations with the National Bank of Ukraine, the central banks  of other countries, international banks, and other finance and  credit organizations envisaging interstate cooperation by  central banks;    --conduct any foreign currency operations envisaged by  existing laws;    --submit reports each year at specific times on its  operations and balance sheet and the summary balance sheet of  the banking system of the Crimean Republic. These documents will  be forwarded to the National Bank of Ukraine. The Republic Bank  of Crimea will publish its balance sheet and the summary balance  sheet of the banking system of the Crimean Republic.    4. The Crimean Republic will accumulate and use its own  credit resources, consisting of bank assets, the funds remaining  in the bank accounts of republic enterprises, institutions, and  organizations, deposits by citizens, interbank settlements, and  other monetary resources.    5. The Republic Bank of Crimea and commercial banks within  the territory of the Crimean Republic will not be liable for the  obligations of the state (with the exception of those for which  the republic bank assumes responsibility). The state will not be  liable for the obligations of banks, except in cases envisaged  by this edict and other cases in which the state assumes this  responsibility.    6. The Republic Bank of Crimea will consider and make  decisions on the registration of banks (including banks with  foreign participation and the branches and offices of foreign  banks) and on amendments and additions to the articles of  incorporation of previously registered banks within the  territory of the Crimean Republic.    7. The Republic Bank of Crimea will issue permits  authorizing  commercial banks to conduct operations in foreign currency  within the territory of the Crimean Republic and abroad at the  request of the banks and with a view to the economic  advisability of the operations and the ability of the banks to  conduct them.    The permits authorizing operations in foreign currency by  joint-stock banks, foreign banks, and branches and offices of  the banks of foreign states will be issued at the time of their  establishment or closure.    8. The Republic Bank of Crimea may set compulsory standard  indicators for commercial banks to secure their financial  stability and protect their creditors.    9. The Republic Bank of Crimea will oversee the compliance  of  banks within the territory of the Crimean Republic with the  standard indicators instituted in accordance with this edict and  existing laws and the correct application of banking laws and  the legislative instruments it issues.

The capital stock of a commercial bank will consist of the  charter contributions of the founders.

The amount of capital stock will be decided by the founders  (or stockholders) of the bank, but may not fall below the amount  established by the Republic Bank of Crimea.    In the event of insufficient funds for the extension of  credit to clients and the fulfillment of assumed obligations,  commercial banks may apply to the Republic Bank of Crimea for  credit. The procedure for carrying out these credit operations  and their maximum amounts will be defined by the Republic Bank  of Crimea.    Commercial banks founded in the Crimean Republic may open  branches and offices abroad with the permission of the Republic  Bank of Crimea.    11.

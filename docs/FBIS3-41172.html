To help various localities continue stepping up their drug  control program, the Ministry of Culture and Information  recently delivered an additional eight sets of television and  video cassette players together with video films in the Mandarin  and H'mong languages to various sensitive areas for the various  propaganda teams to entertain the people in the mountain regions  during the Tet new year festival.    During the first quarter of this year, a series of  publications including one on paintings and photographs for  exhibition purposes, a pamphlet with questions and answers on  the drug issue, a book of songs and poems, and a pictoral  pamphlet on drug control will be widely published in mountain  regions, especially in areas where poppy growing and opium  smoking have become traditional activities.    On this occasion, the participating comrades proposed that  the government and relevant ministries and sectors make an  appropriate investment in the information and propaganda task.  In particular, an economic policy must be mapped out for those  areas where the compatriots are shifting from poppy growing to  substitute crops.</p>

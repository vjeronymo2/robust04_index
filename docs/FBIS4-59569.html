			<p>BFN     [Text] In today's Tehran Friday prayers, Ayatollah  Emami-Kashani condemned the British Government for installing a  bugging device in the Iranian Embassy in London.    The interim Friday prayers leader of Tehran referred to  Britain's record in espionage activities and said: This recent  espionage activity in London against the Islamic Republic of  Iran demonstrates the continuation of plots hatched by arrogant  countries against the Islamic revolution; but such conspiracies  are, as ever, doomed to fail, thanks to the vigilance and  alertness of the Muslim people of Iran.    On the great hajj congregation, he said: The gathering of a  cross-section of one billion world Muslims at pilgrimage is a  suitable opportunity to review various political, social, and  economic problems of the world of Islam and their solutions so  that, upon their return to their countries, Muslims could  implement those solutions.    He said the designation of a day for the support of Bosnian  Muslims by the eminent leader's representative office was a  correct use of the hajj to draw the attention of Muslims to  problems of the world of Islam.    Ayatollah Emami-Kashani praised the people for participating  in the international book exhibition and said: That matter shows  that the people of Iran care about cultural issues.</p>

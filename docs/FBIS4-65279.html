			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["egl"-signed report: "Kopper Praises General Conditions </F> for Companies and Financial Institutions"]    [Text] Prague -- With the establishment of a branch in  Prague, the Deutsche Bank wants to step up its activities in the  Czech Republic, explained Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank  spokesman, at the opening ceremony. Speaking at the opening,  Vaclav Klaus, the head of the Czech Government, welcomed the  increased presence of foreign banks in his country.    The Prague branch, which is headed by Gerd-Dieter Griese and  Jaroslav Kudena, is the first Deutsche Bank branch in one of the  neighboring states in the east. "We not only want to give Czech  companies access to the international capital market, but also  assist them with local capital market transactions," said Kopper.    The opening of the branch in Prague comes a few months after  the opening of the Prague Stock Exchange. In view of the bank's  long-term business strategy, the fact that these events are so  close in time can only be a coincidence, but the Deutsche Bank's  heightened presence comes "at the right time in light of the  development of the capital market also."    Over the past few years, foreign investors have made direct  investments totaling 5 billion German marks in the Czech  Republic, stressed Vaclav Klaus. Germany is among the largest  investors. "This figure shows how companies and investors from  all over the world view this country's prospects." The economic  transformation process in the Czech Republic has followed a  particularly straight course so far. It has only taken four  years for a private sector to emerge which already accounts for  a large part of GDP. Numerous plants have been privatized in  the meantime, but what is even more impressive for foreign  observers is the great number of new business that have been  formed.    Deutsche Bank, which has had a representation in Prague  since  1990, wants to provide better support in the Czech Republic for  investors from Germany and other countries. Finally, there is a  growing demand for banking services from Czech companies,  especially with respect to leading companies into the European  single market.    Deutsche Bank will make a resolute effort to ensure that  "the  EU's [European Union] markets will be opened up even more." If  the states of Central Europe are rapidly drawn into the  international division of labor, this will serve to bolster  political stability on the continent. "We need an EU that is  open to all Europeans."</p>

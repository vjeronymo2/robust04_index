			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P raises credit rating on The Equitable STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, has raised its credit rating on The Equitable, the large US life insurer, from A to A+. The upgrade follows the insurer's conversion from mutual status, where it was controlled by its policyholders, to a conventional shareholder-owned company. During the process, the insurer sold shares to investors - about Dollars 110m will be added to capital as a result - and received a further Dollars 1bn capital infusion from Axa, the large French insurer. As a result Axa now holds a 49 per cent stake in The Equitable.</p>

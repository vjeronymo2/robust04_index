			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine pledge on coal sell-off MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, guaranteed yesterday that British Coal employees will get a stake in its future, whatever form of privatisation is chosen. Addressing the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM), he said that no final decision had yet been taken on how to privatise British Coal but expressed sympathy for the UDM-led consortium which aims to take a 25 per cent stake in the corporation. Mr Roy Lynk, president of the UDM, said he would approach British Coal board members to join the consortium as well as the main management unions. The open-cast mining company R. J. Budge Mining of Retford, which employs about 1,000 people, has already joined. Privately, UDM officials have made clear that they would welcome the participation of Mr Albert Wheeler, deputy chairman of British Coal, but do not want Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, or Mr Ken Moses, the other deputy chairman. Mr Clarke was criticised by some delegates for not standing up strongly enough for the coal industry. A buy-out led by the UDM, the union that broke away from the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1984-85 miners' strike, would be politically attractive for the government, but is not possible without a secure agreement for supplying coal to the privatised electricity industry. Mr Heseltine said he could not dictate to privatised companies but did say to the electricity generators: 'Remember when you are negotiating these contracts that you are determining the future availability of a national resource for which you will have longer-term need. Remember also that you are talking about communities of men and women whose lives will be affected by your decisions.' Mr Heseltine warned that even with an agreement, the number of pits would fall from the present total of 50 after privatisation, but he said the industry should still be able to win the 'lion's share of the domestic market'. He also tried to reassure the UDM that privatisation would involve no compromises over health and safety, pensions, or concessionary coal. Mr Lynk said he welcomed Mr Heseltine's speech, which amounted to a 'green light' for the UDM-led bid. The consortium of mineworkers that took over the Monktonhall colliery outside Edinburgh from British Coal yesterday has no sources of finance apart from the money the miners invest themselves, it emerged yesterday, James Buxton writes. Each of the 200-odd members of the consortium is investing Pounds 10,000, making about Pounds 2m. Monktonhall Mineworkers, the company created to run the mine, the first deep mine to be operated by the private sector since 1947, has been granted a lease and licence to operate Monktonhall by British Coal, which mothballed it in 1987. It expects to commence production within six months.</p>

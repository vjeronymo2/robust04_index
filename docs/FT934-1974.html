			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Japan and Germany welcome launch The decision on Thorp was welcomed in Japan and Germany, the countries which will be the plant's biggest foreign customers. In Japan Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, director at the Science and Technology Agency's nuclear fuel division, said the decision meant the country could now implement its nuclear policy as sched-uled. Mr Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said: 'We're glad that the government has decided as we had hoped.' The launch of Thorp would not lead to proliferation as long as the countries which have contracts with it acted responsibly, he said. BNF's control over the amount of plutonium reprocessed at Thorp would prevent the problem of plutonium that is not needed leaving the plant. But Mr Tadatoshi Akiba, one of the group of Japanese MPs opposing Thorp's launch, regretted the decision and hoped there would be time to reconsider. Japan already held more plutonium than it could use, he said, and the launch would add to this. In Germany the decision came as a relief to the electricity utilities - including RWE, the country's largest electricity generator - which have contracts for reprocessing at Sellafield. But it is a blow to the anti-nuclear movement, which had hoped that blocking the recycling of nuclear fuel would bring the entire nuclear power generation industry to a halt. Dr Thomas Roser, chief executive of the German Atomforum, the main lobby group for the nuclear industry, welcomed the decision last night. 'I am glad about that,' he said. 'Competition is always good for business,' referring to the fact that France's Cogema will not now have a monopoly on reprocessing. But he left open the question of whether German utilities would place further orders for the second decade of Thorp's life. He said no one knew if the alternative of direct disposal  - disposing of waste fuel without reprocessing - would be cheaper. German utilities have planned to reuse some of the reprocessed fuel by converting it into mixed-oxide fuel elements (MOX). However, the Siemens plant at Hanau has been prevented from operating by the local Social Democrat-Green government. The utilities are likely to ask Cogema or BNF to produce MOX.</p>

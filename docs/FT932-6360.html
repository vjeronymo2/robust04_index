			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon pays Dollars 88m for bank cheque printer MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing company, is expanding its US printing activities by buying Checks in the Mail, a printer of bank cheques sold directly to customers through the post, for Dollars 88m (Pounds 56m). It is the first purchase by Caradon since it sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox (CMB) for Pounds 473m, leaving it with net cash of Pounds 428m. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the market should not infer that the takeover meant the group was looking at completing a series of small bolt-on acquisitions. 'A big deal is still what we would like to do; I am not as pessimistic as some that big acquisitions are unattainable,' he added. Checks in the Mail is being purchased from Rexham, the US subsidiary of Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group. The net assets of Checks in the Mail at the end of 1992 were Dollars 5m and net profits were Dollars 3.8m on sales of Dollars 38.7m. Caradon's US printing activities generates revenue of almost Dollars 300m accounting for 15 per cent of the US cheque printing industry. The business of selling cheques directly to customers in the US is growing by 12 per cent a year while the usage of cheques is rising by 1 to 2 per cent a year. Mr Jansen said he was effectively paying 'an entry price' to get into the lucrative business of selling cheques directly to customers by mail. Mr David Lyon, Bowater chief executive, said the sale would enable his company to focus on its core industrial films and coatings, packaging and building products.</p>

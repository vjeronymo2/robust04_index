			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (47): Prescription could fall well short of a cure - Spain / The host country for this year's meetings has the OECD's highest jobless rate The economy in Spain, host nation for this year's IMF and World Bank meetings, is recovering like those in other OECD member states. But, in its effort to achieve sustainable GDP growth, Spain may face greater problems than many of its partners. The Madrid authorities can take credit for laying the foundations for sound money. They are curbing inflation and cutting back on the general government deficit. The current account balance of payments deficit, which was slightly above 3 per cent of GDP in 1992 and narrowed to 0.8 per cent in 1993, is expected this year to break even or show a slight surplus. The devalued peseta has had an electric effect on exports and on tourism receipts, amply compensating for weak domestic demand. GDP growth is on line to reach possibly as much as 2 per cent this year. Yet, the patient in this case is especially sick and the prescription could still fall well short of a cure. Even when there was a healthy current account surplus, as there was in the mid-1980s, and even when GDP growth outstrips that of the OECD average, as occurred in those years, unemployment has remained very high and participation rates very low. Spain has the highest jobless level in the OECD - a gap of around 10 points has for several years separated Spain's unemployment level from that of the OECD average - and the participation rate of its working age population is, at 49 per cent, embarrassingly low in comparison with those of its trading partners. At the end of June, Spain's jobless total stood at 3.7m, 24.2 per cent of the working population, according to the government's quarterly employment survey. This figure followed a net job rise of nearly 30,000 in May and June. Such statistics, indicating that one in four Spaniards of working age are idle, should be balanced against estimates which suggest that as many as 1m are employed in the submerged or informal economy. The political fall-out of such a high jobless rate is, in addition, contained by the extended family network that for the time being remains strongly entrenched in Spanish society. The economic ministry's latest forecast is that in December the number of employed Spaniards should be slightly higher than the 11.7m registered in December 1993. Should the number of workers rise in December, the increase will represent the first positive inter-annual variation since the third quarter of 1991. The problem, however, is not that there are very few people working in Spain, but that not enough jobs have existed for Spaniards for a long time. In a recent report, ICAE, the economic analysis institute of Madrid's Complutense University, noted bluntly that over the past 20 years the Spanish economy had 'shown itself to be manifestly incapable of generating sufficient jobs'. Diminishing employment is a general story in the European Union but nowhere is it more compellingly serious than in Spain: over the past 30 years Spain's GDP has tripled in volume and the domestic population has grown by 25 per cent. But with just under 11.7m employed, there are no more job holders in 1994 than there were in 1964. The consequence of the domestic economy's structural imbalances, as evidenced by the unemployment level, is that when these disequilibriaare added to the cyclical problems which the Spanish economy shares with the rest of the OECD, international markets are prompted to set Spain's finances apart, and to penalise them accordingly. When bond yields rose in Europe earlier this year, on the back of interest rate rises in the US, they became especially volatile in Spain. To the dismay of a domestic industry which desperately needs internal demand to be kick-started, Spain's economic ministry acknowledged in its latest bulletin that the great increase in the yield of long-term domestic bonds has 'provoked a more prudent posture' on the part of the monetary authorities. On August 3, the Bank of Spain cautiously lowered its key intervention to 7.35 per cent from 7.50 per cent, its first cut since May 13. There are several factors behind the Spanish economy's incapacity to create jobs, including labour costs. If the OECD had an 'oil shock' in the 1970s, Spain had both that and a 'salaries shock' on top of it. Rises in wages continued through the 1980s and up to December last year when, despite a 3.5 per cent fall in registered employment during 1993, real wages rose by 1.5 per cent compared with December 1992. Between 1987-1992 Spain registered a 42.2 per cent leap in unit labour costs, measured in domestic currency terms, against an average rise of 12.8 per cent in the Benelux nations, and Denmark, France and Germany. The OECD said in its 1994 report on the Spanish economy that 'in order to keep the wage bill under control, firms are obliged to shed labour massively when there is a cyclical or structural shock.' The rigidity of Spain's labour market legislation is viewed as another chief cause behind joblessness. Employers are deterred from increasing their labour force by rulings which are based on General Franco's job-for-life model. The growth of trade union muscle since democracy was restored after Franco's death in 1975, as well as the social security burden placed on employers, has helped to create an environment unfriendly to business. A third factor is the paucity of vocational training in Spain, together with a mismatch between the supply of labour and the working positions that demand to be filled. According to the OECD only 16 per cent of Spain's total 1990-1992 expenditure on unemployment went on training and job creation schemes. Average EU spending on such programmes represents 34 per cent of unemployment-linked expenditure. The domestic recession, that began to bite extremely deeply in 1993 when the economy shrank by 1 per cent, has finally had an impact on wage increases and on unit labour costs. Wage agreements this year represent average salary increases of little more than 3 per cent, against a year-on-year headline inflation rate of 4.7 per cent in June, and unit labour costs have risen by about 2 per cent. The rigidities of the labour market have been addressed by a reform of the existing legislation approved by parliament this year. The overhaul, which made hiring and firing rules more flexible and cheaper, and which allowed for part-time employment and altered guidelines on job mobility and job classifications, was viewed as timid by employers and as Draconian by trade unions. The labour market reforms also gave an impetus to apprenticeship and youth employment schemes. These, together with a national programme for vocational training which was the outcome of a government agreement last year with employers organisations and the unions, seek to correct the employment mismatch and to make inroads into the very high jobless rate among first-time job seekers. A start has been made in tackling the most searing feature of Spain's structural imbalances but it is only a start. Madrid's Complutense University's ICAE report ominously asserts that the domestic jobless problem is 'of such a magnitude that a substantial reduction of the unemployment rate, to a level similar to that of the more advanced European nations, is not feasible in either the short or in the medium-term.'</p>

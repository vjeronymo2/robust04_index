			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service reports  that calm prevails on the borders. Let me remind those who  missed our previous newscasts that the Azerbaijani Army shelled  Armenia's northeast border last night. Fire was opened on the  defensive positions around Berdavan in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon.  There are wounded. Our border guards did not retaliate.    Active military operations are continuing in the southeast  of  the Karabakh war front. Fierce battles continued in the  direction of Fizuli yesterday for the control of hills  overlooking Alkhanly. The Karabakh military units maintained  all their positions in that sector. Some 40 enemy soldiers were  killed and one tank and one artillery piece were destroyed. Two  fighters were killed and 11 were wounded on the Karabakh side.    The Azerbaijani Air Force planes bombed the Karabakh  positions around Fizuli this morning. We have received no  reports on the consequences.    No substantial changes have taken place on the other fronts.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Officials of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Museum of the  American Indian in New York signed an agreement to transfer the world's largest  collection of American Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian. The museum  agreement capped years of often-acrimonious negotiations among federal, state  and local politicians, officials of the Smithsonian and the Indian museum, and  American Indians. Besides the building of the National Museum of the American  Indian in Washington, the agreement also calls for moving the existing Indian  museum to larger quarters in the old U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, where part  of the Heye Foundation collection will be exhibited.  </P></p>

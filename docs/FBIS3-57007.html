			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- "The decision for the Black Sea  Fleet to remain Russian--and it must be fully implemented--does  not raise any doubts," Yuriy Meshkov, candidate for the  presidency of Crimea and leader of the Republican Party of  Crimea, said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS today.    The leader of the Crimean Republicans, who won approximately  40 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential  elections, while speaking in favor of an independent Republic of  Crimea "which would maintain multi-faceted ties with Ukraine  and, independently of these ties, would determine the forms of  economic relations with Russia," thought that the sympathies of  the population of the peninsula are on the side of the "Russia"  opposition bloc which he represents. Yuriy Meshkov pointed out  that the rest of the votes were distributed between the  supporters of the Communist and Russia Parties. He noted that  "not a single external force is capable of upsetting our  progress toward closer relations with the republics of the  former USSR and uniting the Russian and Ukrainian peoples."  Yuriy Meshkov is convinced that his voters would be able to  consolidate their positions in the second round of the elections  and ensure a victory in the presidential race for the leader of  the Crimean republicans.    Replying to the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the  reasons behind the increase in crime in Crimea since the murder  of Andrey Lazebnikov, head of the Black Sea Fleet's press  service at the end of 1993, Yuriy Meshkov said that these "are  the consequences of the full atrophy of the present Crimean  leadership and its inability to maintain law and order in the  region." In the event of his victory in the presidential  elections the leader of the Crimean republicans promises "to  establish order and eliminate organized crime in the peninsula."    In Yuriy Meshkov's view, the implementation of the  tripartite  agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine  signed in Moscow on 14 January by the presidents of Russia, the  United States, and Ukraine, would make it possible "to  significantly reduce tension in the world and contribute to  strengthening nuclear security throughout the world."    Commenting on the removal of Ivan Yermakov from the post of  the Ukrainian president's representative in Sevastopol, Yuriy  Meshkov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that this decision was  made by the Ukrainian leadership "out of political motives." At  the same time, he noted, "Yermakov who has been enrolled in the  staff of the Black Sea Fleet, should be proud of this  appointment." It is known that Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander  of the fleet, issued an order on 20 December enrolling under his  command the former representative of the Ukrainian president in  Crimea.</p>

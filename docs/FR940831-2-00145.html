			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Overall Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1&blank;Measurement of Living-Cost Differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most common and most widely accepted way to measure living-cost differences between and among locations is to select representative items that people purchase in these locations and to calculate the relative cost differences, combining them according to their importance in terms of consumer expenditures. Runzheimer applied this methodology to compare living costs in each of the allowance areas with living costs in the Washington, D.C., area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To move from this basic concept to computing comparative living costs between each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer followed five main processes or steps:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Step 1&blank;Identify the segment of the population for which this analysis is being targeted (i.e., the target population).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 2&blank;Determine how these people spend their money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 3&blank;Select items to represent the expense categories for which these people spend their money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 4&blank;Conduct pricing surveys of the selected items in each area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 5&blank;Analyze cost ratios for the selected items and aggregate them according to the relative importance of each item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.1&blank;Target Population: Federal Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer's living-cost model measures living-cost differences for non-military federal employees having annual base salaries between $10,000 and $80,000, the salary range of the 1990 General Schedule of the Federal Government. Because living-cost differences may vary depending on an employee's income level, Runzheimer designed its analytical model to identify living costs at three income levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its first report to OPM, Runzheimer used the salary distribution of all General Schedule employees as of March 31, 1990, which OPM supplied, to determine the income levels that most accurately represent the federal employee population. After analyzing the array of salary data, Runzheimer picked the midpoints of the lower, middle and upper thirds of the distribution as its three income levels ($18,000, $28,400 and $45,200 respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer applied the same income levels for this report as it did for the first. In previous reports, Runzheimer recommended that OPM consider introducing changes in income levels and weights on a gradual basis. OPM agreed, and this year OPM introduced new Federal employment weights that are based on a moving average. OPM has informed Runzheimer that OPM plans to introduce other changes, such as new representative income levels and Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) weights, in future surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer uses Federal employment weights in the model in two ways: (1) to combine survey data from multiple survey areas within a single allowance area and (2) to combine relative living costs by income level within each allowance area into a single index for the area (as required by section 591.205(c) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM's moving average allows the gradual introduction of new employment distribution data over time. The weights are based on a three-year average of GS employment. Each year, the latest GS employment data will be added to the three-year average, the oldest data will be deleted, and a new three-year average will be computed. This will keep the weights current while mitigating any fluctuations due to short-term changes in Federal employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this first application of the moving average, OPM is departing slightly from the process described above in that the three employment distributions used are for the periods of 1990, 1992, and 1993. The 1990 rather than the 1991 employment is used because the model previously used 1990 data only. (See Appendix 13.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.2&blank;Determination of Expenditure Patterns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.1.2.1&blank;Source of Expenditure Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming with last year's process, Runzheimer used the ``prepub'' statistical reports from the 1988 CES dated February 13, 1990 (see Appendix 1) as the basis for weighing expenditure patterns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.2.2&blank;Income Level Adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the CES reflected 1988 expenditure levels, Runzheimer reduced the three 1990 incomes back to 1988 levels before beginning the expenditure analysis. To calculate estimated 1988 income levels, Runzheimer used the average percentage salary increases of federal employees for the two-year period in question as supplied by OPM officials (4.1% increase 1988&hyph;89 and 3.6% increase 1989&hyph;90, resulting in a 7.85% two-year increase). This adjustment reduced the 1990 income levels to estimated 1988 levels of $16,700, $26,300, and $41,900.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.2.3&blank;Family Size Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A family size of 2.6 was inherent in the weighing scheme Runzheimer employed to price all allowance areas. Derived from CES research, the number represented an average for the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Christian S. Ortner] </F>   [Text] Changes have been made in the group of  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE shareholders. KURIER, which has so far held  49.5 percent, is leaving and transferring its shares to the  HANDELSBLATT publishing group, which now holds 99 percent of the  company (1 percent still belongs to Peter Michael Lingens).  Thus, the Austrian WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE has finally been integrated  in a highly reputed, international publishing group, which  comprises publications such as HANDELSBLATT, the German  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, or the Swiss monthly BILANZ. In addition,  linked with the group are the S. Fischer publishing house, the  Rowohlt publishing house, the Droemersche publishing company, as  well as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN in the United States, to mention  just a few.    These products and publishing companies have one thing in  common -- a high standard which imposes a duty on us and gives  you, the readers, the guarantee that WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE's lead in  quality will be steadily increased.</p>

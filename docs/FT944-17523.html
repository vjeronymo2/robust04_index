			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Paper industry passes the parcel - Deborah Hargreaves finds ample evidence of inflationary pressures If Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, wants proof of the pressures of inflation in the economy he need look no further than the paper and packaging industry, where prices have risen by at least 30 per cent this year. Paper companies are looking to pass on massive increases in raw materials costs after a doubling of wood pulp prices to Dollars 700 a tonne in recent months. The price of waste paper, which is the raw material for many packaging grades, has trebled this year. But companies in the sector, which are all predicting a surge in income from the turnaround in the economic cycle, talk of price recovery rather than price increases. 'These prices are only coming back to the level they were at four to five years ago,' says Mr Brendon Smurfit at Dublin-based paper and packaging company Jefferson Smurfit. Pulp prices peaked at Dollars 840 a tonne at the top of the last cycle in 1990, which suggests that the latest round of rises may well continue as supplies become tighter. Non-integrated paper and packaging companies must pass on these costs to their own customers or face a squeeze on margins. 'The size of the cost increases have been such that, if the industry did not recover them from its customers, companies would go bust,' says Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group. Some companies have been more successful than others in forcing through increases but most see the market heading upwards. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper company, reported a 45 per cent rise in costs at its interim results meeting, with more increases in the pipeline. Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive, said the fine paper market had been slower to accept price increases, but the company was managing to push through rises of 5-10 per cent for most grades this month. Mr Smurfit said the recovery of raw materials costs had been 'slower than we'd like, but it is starting to happen in most major markets'. According to research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, prices for packaging grades of paper - waste-based testliner used for making corrugated board - increased by 85 per cent this year in France to the equivalent of Pounds 279 a tonne, and by 95 per cent in Germany to Pounds 283 a tonne. A similar grade made from virgin fibre - kraftliner - rose by 52 per cent to Pounds 339 a tonne in the UK. Increased demand for paper and packaging goods is an important indicator of economic recovery - companies need more packaging material to wrap their surging shipments. Mr Lyon reckons that, very crudely, for every 1 per cent rise in gross domestic product, demand for packaging materials increases by 1-1.25 per cent and for paper by around 2 per cent. Mr Lyon says Bowater has seen demand rise by about 3-4 per cent this year. Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of David S. Smith Holdings, the UK paper, packaging and office supplies group which produces waste-based packaging material, says European demand has risen by 6-7 per cent. In the current economic cycle, pulp prices have risen more rapidly than at other periods as growing environmental restrictions on forest products, and the threat of a strike in British Columbia - one of the world's biggest suppliers - combined to tighten world supply. In addition, changes in recycling rules in Germany have pushed up waste paper prices. Demand for paper and packaging goods has finally caught up with increased capacity installed by companies at the height of the previous boom. In a fiercely competitive market where companies are producing a commodity product, many companies sought to hold on to market share during the recession by deeply discounting prices. Price discounts have now mostly been eliminated and the market for most paper grades is set to go higher. Mr Soulas said the European market for paper prices in June had only recovered to the same level as in June 1993 after dropping in some cases by 25 per cent in the second half of last year. But price increases in September and October had pushed the market generally 7 per cent higher than last year, he noted. Price rises will soon extend to the newsprint sector, where newspapers begin annual supply contract negotiations in coming months. Mr Tim Rothwell, paper and packaging analyst at BZW, expects spot prices for newsprint to increase by 7-10 per cent this month with more rises coming through next year. The turnround in the market for most paper and packaging companies has seen share prices recovering from the doldrums of recent years. The paper and packaging sector of the FT-SE-A All-Share index has risen by 14.5 per cent in the past year. Most observers believe there is considerable room for further advances. 'I don't think anyone can predict the cycle accurately, but I think companies will get a good run until 1998 and maybe even 2000,' says Mr Rothwell. Most companies are upbeat on the outlook for the next couple of years. 'We are looking towards the whole of 1996 as the peak of the cycle,' says Mr Lyon. One problem for the industry is that as soon as companies' fortunes start to improve, they are tempted to add capacity, which contributes to the next downturn. 'The roller coaster ride over the past 20 years has been due to too many global players chasing volume,' says Mr Rothwell. Mr Smurfit hopes companies will be more cautious about re-investing: 'We hope the industry has learned some of the lessons from the depth of the last recession. It wasn't a recession in volume terms, but oversupply led to deep discounting.' Mr Williams says the tougher environmental legislation that many companies face, particularly in North America, could discourage them from building new plant. Environmental restrictions are also likely to limit the availability of forest products for paper-making, and waste paper supplies are becoming tighter. These factors could give the industry a better long-term outlook than it has enjoyed for many years.

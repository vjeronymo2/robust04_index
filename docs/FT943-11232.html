			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Blair welcomes M&amp;S overture on funds Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, has cautiously welcomed an invitation from Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman of Marks and Spencer, to discuss whether the supermarket chain could give financial backing to the Labour party. Amid growing signs that leading business figures could develop contacts with Mr Blair, M&amp;S confirmed yesterday that Sir Richard had sent the Labour leader an invitation to hold talks. Sir Richard's move coincided with reports that Mr David Sainsbury, the millionaire supermarket chief, financially backed Mr Blair's campaign for the Labour leadership. In recent years M&amp;S has invited Mr Blair's predecessors Mr Neil Kinnock and the late John Smith to discuss policy issues and the prospect of financial backing. Both men declined these invitations. But there were indications yesterday that Mr Blair, who has spearheaded a drive to modernise Labour, could break with previous practice. 'If the chairman of Marks and Spencer wants to discuss matters of mutual interest, then it would be churlish not to agree,' said Labour. M&amp;S said that Sir Richard would want to hear what policies Labour had that might affect retailing. 'If they were of benefit, the main board would discuss finance (for the Labour party),' it said. In its 1993 annual report M&amp;S revealed a donation of Pounds 40,000 to Conservative Central Office. The company said yesterday that 'whatever happened, we would continue to support the Conservative party'. But it added that supporting both Labour and the Tories would not be a problem in principle. Labour officials underlined that Mr Blair could not be expected to tailor policies in exchange for financial backing. They would not confirm that Mr Sainsbury, who backed the formation of the Social Democratic party in the early 1980s, had donated Pounds 5,000 to Mr Blair's leadership campaign.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS NEARLY MISSES ST. PAUL'S MAYOR SCHEIBEL  </P> <P> One citizen whom the U.S. Census Bureau almost missed this year was Mayor Jim  Scheibel -- but officials promised to right their mistake.  </P> <P> Scheibel's apartment was among the 5,000 households in the St. Paul area that  did not receive census forms.  </P> <P> "I'd been promoting the census and the importance of filling out the forms when  I realized I didn't have a form," Scheibel said last week. "They almost didn't  count the mayor."  </P> <P> Rod Swenson, district manager of the St. Paul census office, called Scheibel to  assure him that a form was on the way.  </P></p>

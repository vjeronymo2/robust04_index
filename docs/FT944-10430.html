			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Indonesian bank surges in first nine months Bank Umum Nasional, the Indonesian bank, said unaudited after-tax profit for the first nine months this year rose 164 per cent to Rp39.11bn (Dollars 18m) from Rp14.82bn a year earlier, on a 16 per cent rise in revenue, AP-DJ reports from Jakarta. It attributed the sharp rise to a slower rate of increase in interest burdens, up only 6 per cent to Rp285.06bn. Meanwhile, PT Lippo Bank, the banking arm of the diversified Lippo group, said its after-tax profit for the third quarter ended September 30 was Rp16.5bn, up 60 per cent.</p>

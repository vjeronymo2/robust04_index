			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Walesa in clash over forces A tug of war between Poland's President Lech Walesa and the government over control of the armed forces broke into the open yesterday when Mr Walesa asked Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, defence minister, to resign. The move came after Mr Kolodziejczyk opposed new draft laws which would bring the military under control of the general staff, answering directly to the president and sidelining the defence minister. Spokesmen for the defence ministry said yesterday that Mr Kolodziejczyk was not ready to resign immediately and implied he was looking to Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, to support him. Mr Kolodziejczyk is due to report today to the parliamentary defence committee called to review the situation. Matters came to a head last week at Drawsko, in north-western Poland, where senior military commanders present at an annual training session openly criticised Mr Kolodziejczyk. The defence minister is a retired Warsaw Pact admiral and was once favoured by Mr Walesa. It is commonly accepted that Mr Walesa, who attended the meeting, encouraged Mr Kolodziejczyk's critics at Drawsko to speak out. Yesterday, Mr Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a former defence minister and member of the opposition Freedom Union, called the meeting 'an inexcusable attempt to bring the army into politics'. The incident marks the first time the military have been brought into the political arena since Polish democracy was restored five years ago. Under Poland's present constitutional arrangement, the president has general responsibility for defence, internal and foreign affairs; his nominees head these three ministries. But all three formally answer to the prime minister and are cabinet members.</p>

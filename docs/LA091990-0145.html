			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARMY SEIZES ARMS IN MOHAWK CLASH  </P> <P> The army today displayed about 50 weapons seized from a Mohawk reserve south of  Montreal during a search that provoked the most violent clash yet between  troops and natives in a 2 1/2-month-old standoff over a land dispute.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Greg Mitchell, battalion commander for the Canadian army, said the  weapons, including shotguns, rifles and handguns as well as walkie-talkies and  camouflage uniforms, were found in about 10 caches on the Kahnawake reserve.  </P> <P> "They were hidden away in plastic or duffel bags, under trees. The intent for  their use was obviously illegal," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> Police, soldiers and Mohawks at two Quebec reserves have been involved in a  land dispute that began July 11 when Quebec officers stormed a barricade  erected by natives around a proposed golf course they claimed was an ancient  burial ground. One officer was killed in the raid at the Kanesatake reserve,  south of Montreal.  </P> <P> The search for weapons Tuesday at Kahnawake led to the worst clash yet between  soldiers and Mohawks. In the resulting riot that lasted nearly seven hours,  soldiers used three rounds of tear gas to restrain the crowd of about 300  natives who tried to stop the search.  </P> <P> Although the natives were equipped with only rocks, clubs and sticks, they  almost overpowered the soldiers. According to Mitchell, 19 soldiers required  medical treatment, including one with a broken hand.  </P></p>

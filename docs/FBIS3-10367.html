			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Estadao Column" by Cristiana Lobo] </F>   [Text] A recent poll shows a substantial growth in [Finance  Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy for the  presidential race: He moved from 6 percent, a level at which he  remained stable for some months, to 12 percent of the electoral  preference, climbing to third place in this race.    PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva still  is the favorite, even though he lost 3 percentage points: He  fell from 30 to 27 percent of the votes. PPR [Progressive  Renewal Party candidate] Paulo Maluf remains in second place  with 17 percent of the electoral preference.    After this poll, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  will press Fernando Henrique Cardoso even more to leave his post  by the end of the month in order to run for Itamar Franco's job.  Meanwhile, the PSDB says the decision remains with the minister  himself.    Senator Mario Covas said: "Fernando will entirely let events  take their course. He is a man with public spirit. Thus, he  will decide if he stays or leaves. He is not a vulgar  opportunist."    President Itamar Franco's advisers already are acquainted  with the poll. During the past few days, Franco has discussed  this issue with politicians and has begun to consider a  replacement. The PSDB is very interested in this issue because  the economic program's success depends on Cardoso's management.</p>

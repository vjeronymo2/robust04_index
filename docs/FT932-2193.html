			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: An ace invention for tennis elbow - Lucia van der Post swings her racket and heads into the garden IT IS open season for tennis elbow again. With the tennis bonanza of Wimbledon upon us and the parks already beginning to fill with fair-weather players, it is time to look to your racket. If tennis elbow is your problem then Dunlop has developed new technology to deal with it. Since powerful modern rackets cause greater vibration than the simpler, older rackets (said to be the major cause of tennis elbow) Dunlop reasoned that if it could break the circuit and stop vibration reaching the arm, then the elbow should be better protected. A racket incorporating what Dunlop describes as its 'Impact Shock Isolation System' (ISIS) Technology was launched last year. Essentially, it involved separating the handle from the racket shaft just below the top of the grip and then rejoining and reinforcing it with carbon rods encased in a shock-absorbing elastomer which prevents vibration travelling down the shaft. In spite of the price - Pounds 199.99 - the tennis world, particularly in America, went wild about it. Tennis nuts kept off the court by physical ailments will go to almost any lengths to get back on again, it seems. There are now four rackets in the ISIS range (each code-named Revelation) ranging in price from Pounds 99.99 to Pounds 199.99. If you are dissatisfied with your local garden centre, if you cannot find the steamer chair, the bamboo rake, the wrought-iron weather vane of your dreams, Reid &amp; Waterers will deliver it to your door. The company's summer catalogue does not claim to be comprehensive - you will not find here the reams of sheds and plastic coverings, the pesticides and seedlings that are the stuff of most gardening catalogues. What you will find is an edited selection of things either useful or decorative. There is a choice of just three different barbecues, a small selection of some good garden furniture, sturdily made spades and gardening knives, forks and edging tools (particularly nice, being British-made with solid ash shafts). There are oval metal planters, glass lamps for using when eating out of doors (Pounds 29.50), verdigris candlesticks (Pounds 12.95), Victorian jardinieres (Pounds 29.50 and Pounds 39.50), and some ineffably plain painted trays (Pounds 34.50). There are garden torches and Versailles planters, a particularly elegant bottle carrier (Le Baladeur, Pounds 24.95) and beeswax candles. Many of the products would make splendid presents - the gardener's holdall, for instance, which is a tough canvas bag with eight separate pockets in which tools can be stored, for Pounds 29.95. The catalogue, in short, offers almost everything the keen gardener or conservatory owner might hanker for - apart that is from the serious horticultural products. For a free catalogue telephone 081-572 3225. To order telephone 0345-626268. You pay only local call prices and the lines are open seven days a week.</p>

This is  the highest fire death toll Guangdong Province has ever  experienced since the beginning of reform and opening up, and  also a disaster rarely seen in the whole country.  Investigations have showed clearly that this is a major  accident due to negligence, and both the foreign investors and  the managerial staff of the Chinese side have unshirkable  responsibility for the tragedy.    Though there are only a small number of foreign-invested  factories which, like Zhili, give no thought to the safety of  workers, yet it has been learned that some foreign-invested  enterprises, especially those operating on a small-scale, have  been found to have various problems with labor protection, and  they often infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of  workers. For instance, the lack of labor safety devices in  these enterprises has led to many industrial accidents, and the  adverse labor environment has done great harm to the workers'  health. In addition, many enterprises arbitrarily lengthen  working hours and make most of their workers work extra shifts  or hours; some arbitrarily reduce or embezzle part of workers'  wages, and reduce or even cancel insurance and welfare  allowances which should be extended to workers; while others  punish and dismiss workers at will, and even exercise physical  punishment, make body searches, and place their workers in  confinement. All these will, undoubtedly, result in the  resentment of workers and staff working in these enterprises,  and trigger off a number of labor disputes. People in all walks  of life also find things in these enterprises totally  intolerable.    The whole world has noticed that China is currently carrying  out the principle of reform and opening up, and will go on with  the principle for a long period of time to come. China opens  its door wide to businessmen coming from outside the country.  We extend warm welcome to foreign businessmen who make  investments and run enterprises on the mainland, treat them with  due respect, and try our best to make things convenient for  them. Their wish to make money is tenable. Yet one thing they  must bear in mind is that they must abide by Chinese laws, which  includes rules and regulations on production safety and labor  protection. China is a socialist country, and workers are  masters of our country. By the same token, Chinese workers and  staff working in foreign-invested enterprises are also masters  of our country, and their political and economic rights and  interests are protected by the Chinese Constitution and law. It  is true that a small number of our workers did violate labor  discipline, and some engaged themselves in little pilfering.  What should we do with these people? We can cope with them in  accordance with factory regulations, conduct criticism and  education, hand down appropriate punishment, and even take their  names off the books. However, no enterprise can set its  regulations against Chinese law; and beating and cursing of  workers at will, body searches, confinement, encroachment on  personal freedom, and damage to personal dignity are not allowed  by the law.    Some foreign businessmen know very little about Chinese law.  They believe that since the workers are hired hands, the boss  and managerial executives of an enterprise can do anything they  want to the workers. This is an extremely incorrect concept.  Local governments and trade unions (if they have already been  set up) of these enterprises should help foreign investors get  familiar with relevant Chinese legal regulations, supervise  implementation of these regulations, request amendments to any  factory regulations that proves contrary to Chinese law, and ask  for improvements to deficient conditions stipulated in labor  contracts. While protecting the legitimate operation of foreign  investors, we also need to safeguard the legitimate rights and  interests of our workers. On this issue, we should firmly speak  what we must say, and stand firm on matters of principle. What  we do will not scare away foreign investors; on the contrary,  the number of labor disputes and various accidents can only be  reduced when people stand firm on matters of principle and act  in accordance with the law. Only by so doing can we base our  cooperation with foreign businessmen on a solid foundation so  that the cooperation can grow in a healthy way.    Wise foreign businessmen also understand this point. Not  long ago, two Japanese guests staying in the Shanghai Nikko  Longbai Hotel suffered loss by theft. Two Chinese female  workers working in the hotel came under suspicion of the hotel's  Japanese managerial staff, who instigated others to conduct an  illegal nude body search on the two female workers. Workers and  staff of the hotel expressed their strong indignation, and urged  relevant sources to handle such encroachments on personal rights  in accordance with the law. In the end, the Japanese side dealt  with the matter sternly: Among the three managerial staff  involved, one was recalled back to his country, while the other  two were punished by serious warnings and a six-month period of  salary reduction; the general manager of the hotel was also  given punishment of serious warning and a 10-month period of  salary reduction. In addition, the hotel made an apology to the  two victimized Chinese female workers and offered them financial  compensation. In this way, the labor dispute was settled in a  fairly satisfying manner. The way Nikko treats the mistakes  made by their subordinates is worth using for reference by other  foreign businessmen.</p>

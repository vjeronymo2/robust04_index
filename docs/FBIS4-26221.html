			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The reform of China's  distribution system for crude and refined oils is going on  smoothly.    From May 1, China instituted reforms of its distribution  system for crude and refined oils so as to stabilize oil prices  and normalize oil transactions on the market, rationally  allocate oil resources and promote the production of crude oil.    In the past month, despite planned rises in prices of crude  oil, retail sales prices of refined oil all over the country had  declined due to the reduction of intermediate links in the  distribution of refined oil.    Sources said that at present, the oil prices and oil market  in China are stable and the channel between supply and demand is  unblocked.    The reform of China's oil distribution focuses on the  balance  between supply and demand in oil production and consumption and  coordination between domestic and international oil resources  and the oil market; rational allocation of crude oil processing  resources and refined oil resources; maintenance of rational oil  price differences according to regional differences.    The reform also aims to reduce the intermediate links in oil  distribution, unclog oil distribution channels and set up risk  price funds for crude and refined oils.    The State Council stressed that from now on the state will  exercise unified control over the prices of crude and refined  oils.    All refineries must implement the sales prices of refined  oils set by the state and all gas stations must strictly follow  the stipulated oil prices in sales transactions.    No party, government or military organizations are permitted  access to the wholesale or retail sale of crude oil and refined  oil.    The State Council also stressed the role of the sales  department of the China National Petrochemical Corporation as a  main channel in the distribution of refined oil.    The government also stipulated that the refineries will  directly supply big oil-consuming sectors including railways,  transportation, civil aviation, armed forces and oil export  companies.</p>

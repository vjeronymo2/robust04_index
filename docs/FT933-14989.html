			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Ukraine threat to keep N-arms as Russian parliament claims port THE RUSSIAN parliament claimed control yesterday of the naval port of Sevastopol, the main base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, opening the vexed question of control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Ukrainian officials in Kiev denounced the move as 'tantamount to a declaration of war' and said the Russian claim would make the Ukrainian parliament more likely to assert full control over the nuclear missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory. A resolution 'confirming the Russian federal status of Sevastopol' was passed by 166 votes to 1. It also decreed that the Russian government negotiate on the use of Sevastopol as a base for a 'unified' Black Sea fleet. This would be a direct contradiction of the agreement between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to divide the fleet 50-50, a move which has angered many Russian officers and drawn protests even from General Pavel Grachev, the Defence Minister. A further clause was added before the vote which demanded that the Ukrainian government, 'in order to avoid an increase in tension', withdraw its 'special units located in the area' - that is from its own territory. The decree gave no details of how demands for Russian possession of Sevastopol was to be carried through - and the Russian government, as well as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is likely to ignore the decision. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, warned that the stand-off over Crimea could easily escalate into 'a situation like that in Abkhazia or the former Yugoslavia'. He said the Ukrainian parliament could react to the Russian move by asserting operational control over the nuclear weapons. Last week, parliament claimed ownership of the weapons, but Ukrainian leaders insisted they had no plans to develop positive control over the weapons on their territory. 'The nuclear problem cannot be resolved now,' said Mr Pavlychko, one of the main policy makers on nuclear issues. 'How can we give up our weapons to a neighbour which is making territorial claims on us? 'Maybe now we must say we will seek operational control over the missiles on our territory.' American experts believe Ukraine has the know-how to assert control over the weapons, although they fear Russia could react to Ukrainian efforts to take control over the missiles with a pre-emptive military strike. Mr Pavlychko said that the situation could still be defused if Mr Yeltsin distanced himself from parliament's declaration. endrule Bank chief gloomy, Page 3</p>

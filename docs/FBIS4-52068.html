			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Correction by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman"; </F> dated 5 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] The report that I have sought foreign military aid  for the Khmer Royal Armed forces [KRAF] is totally untrue. This  morning I only told national and international journalists in  Phnom Penh that I would welcome a decision by friendly foreign  powers to provide the KRAF with urgent military aid in the form  of arms and training.    I also added that I would always work for the benefit of a  peaceful solution to the Khmer Rouge issue.    My proposal for a roundtable to be held in the Royal Palace  in Phnom Penh or in the Royal Palace at the Lake of Longevity  [near Pyongyang] is still valid.    Issued in Phnom Penh on 5 May 1994    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

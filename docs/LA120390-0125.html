			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO JIGGLE AND THAT'S NEWS IN MISSOURI  </P> <P> High noon came and went today and the people of New Madrid issued a collective  sigh of relief. The great earthquake scare of 1990 seemed to be over.  </P> <P> Noon marked the midpoint in a disputed but disruptive prediction of a major  earthquake in the central United States along the 120-mile fault line named for  New Madrid.  </P> <P> New Madrid Mayor Dick Phillips, engulfed by a sea of cameras, lights and sound  booms, summed it up: "After noon it's history. I think after today people will  rest easier."  </P> <P> The man in the Tom's Barbecue truck from St. Louis who had been selling  sandwiches packed up and headed out of town.  </P> <P> Some of the invading swarm of news media people had apparently decided as well  that the story wasn't worth another 48 hours of waiting.  </P> <P> The prediction by Iben Browning, a climatologist from New Mexico, called for a  quake of 7.0 magnitude 48 hours either side of today. Some schools were closed  in parts of five states, police and fire departments were on standby and  disaster plans had been drawn up from Arkansas north to Illinois.  </P> <P> For New Madrid, the center of attention because of geography and name, each  hour that passed uneventfully spelled relief from a relentless media  microscope. Some of the hundreds of press and broadcast representatives and  scores of satellite dish-equipped TV trucks were already making plans to  depart.  </P> <P> While most residents were hospitable to the intruders, some were showing the  strain of being interviewed repeatedly.  </P> <P> "You can't walk down the street to pick something up at the store without  having someone stick a microphone in your face and asking you a lot of  questions that you just answered 10 feet earlier," said Dianne Barrett.  </P> <P> One man sitting on a curb was selling interviews for $5 a shot.  </P> <P> "It's getting a little tiresome," said the mayor.  </P></p>

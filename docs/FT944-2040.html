			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: Aristocratic excesses THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GRENVILLES, DUKES OF BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS 1710-1921 by John Beckett Manchester University Press Pounds 45 (Pounds 14.99 pbk), 320 pages This excellent account of aristocratic finances will confirm John Beckett's already high reputation as the leading scholar of the modern English aristocracy. He concentrates on the financial and social fortunes of the Grenvilles whose trajectory was more spectacular than that of most aristocratic families. In 1710 they were a Buckinghamshire gentry family with a relatively modest seat at Wotton. By 1822, when they gained the long-sought dukedom, the Grenvilles owned over 70,000 acres, two large London houses and five country seats. Yet their fall was also spectacular. Thanks to debts of over Pounds 1m by 1845 the family lost most of their land and in 1889 the dukedom became extinct. The great house of Stowe was sold in 1921 and became a public school. Beckett offers an essentially chronological account of this process. His study benefits from a formidable account of archival research. He skilfully integrates economic and social history and is alert to many other factors, ranging from landscape development to the benefits of political opportunity. The nature of an aristocratic dynasty is ably discussed: a succession of male heirs, with few other dependants, was crucial. Beckett is also alive to the importance of the role of personalities. For example, Temple's desire to recreate the Dorset estate of Bubb Dodington made little sense other than in terms of his pertinacious personality. The Marquess Buckingham was obsessed with gaining a dukedom. The First and Second Dukes of Buckingham spent and thought nothing of massive debate. The First Duke married the heiress of the Duke of Chandos in 1796 and from her, and his father, had a rent roll of over Pounds 70,000: but the Duke's collecting, electioneering and houses ensured that he always lived beyond his means. He was extravagant and was swiftly involved in a spiral of debts. The Duke exacerbated the problem by neglecting the estates and fraudulently interfering with the settlements. By late 1832 four-fifths of his income was going into paying interest charges. In 1833 a trust was created to run the Grenville estates. The Duke prepared to take an extended cruise only to find he had used the yacht as security for loans, and before he could leave port it was sequestered. The Second Duke was similarly dishonest, precipitating a crisis in 1847 that set peer against heir. His debts led to his loss of control over his estates and he spent his final years as a pensioner, living on money provided by his son and anything he could borrow. The Third Duke had no sons, but his caution and efforts ensured that he left no debts. However, Richard Morgan-Grenville, the heir to Stowe, died in the Great War, and Lady Kinloss, who neither needed nor could afford Stowe, arranged for its sale.</p>

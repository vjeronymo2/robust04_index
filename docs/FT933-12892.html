			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM plays for high personal stakes HE cannot afford to lose. The Maastricht treaty will survive a government defeat in today's Commons vote on the social chapter. The same cannot be said with confidence of Mr John Major. Defeat could come in more than one form. Enough MPs might support Labour's amendment demanding that British ratification is delayed until Mr Major embraces the social chapter. A majority might vote down the government's own motion asking for parliament's approval to complete the process. The whole procedure could be left in limbo if neither Labour nor the government score a decisive victory. But the treaty would remain recoverable - through another vote in the House of Commons, through a confidence motion which would force Tory Euro-sceptics into line or through some combination of both. The battle might drag on until the autumn but of one thing the cabinet's most powerful members are certain: however difficult ratification might prove the government could not survive abandonment of the treaty. But speculation about the constitutional and legal manoeuvring which would follow a defeat - much of Labour's rhetoric about the 'will of parliament' smacks more of opportunism than constitutionalism - obscures the central political point. Maastricht is Mr Major's treaty. It was once his triumph. The social chapter opt-out he negotiated for Britain was part of that now-tarnished victory. If he cannot now command a majority for it in the House of Commons, his own already much-diminished political authority could evaporate completely. The parliamentary battle over Maastricht has dragged on now for 16 months, widening and deepening the wounds which Europe has always inflicted on the Conservative party. In the process Mr Major has lost much of the instinctive respect that Tory backbenchers traditionally accord their leaders. No one expects that a defeat today would trigger an immediate crisis for Mr Major's leadership - particularly if it is followed by the expected government victory in any confidence vote. But the prime minister would be still more vulnerable to another outbreak of Tory panic in the autumn. Within a few days the Christchurch by-election is expected to paint another devastating picture of the government's unpopularity in the country. Mr Major can then claim the refuge of the long summer parliamentary recess - and hope that the strengthening economic recovery refloats his premiership. But he should not underestimate the level of disenchantment in his own party. His administration is perceived from within to lack coherence and direction. His enemies are not alone in talking about the possibility of a different leader. So tonight he must win. He might well. In spite of the seemingly impossible arithmetic thrown up by the combined forces of the opposition parties and the Euro-sceptics, the mood at Westminster suggested that somehow the government would find enough votes to scape through. Mr Major cannot afford to admit any other option.</p>

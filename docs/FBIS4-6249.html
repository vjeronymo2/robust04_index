			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang April (KCNA) -- A meeting of  representatives of the General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan (Chongnyon) and its organizations supporting the  convocation of a national conference proposed at a joint meeting  of the government, political parties and social organizations of  the DPRK was held in Tokyo on April 13.    The joint meeting held on April 11 proposed to the South  Korean authorities, political parties, organisations and  individual figures and overseas Koreans to hold a national  conference in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15.    So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee  of Chongnyon, in his report at the meeting said the proposal is  fair and feasible one acceptable to anyone either in view of the  time or in view of its content.    The proposal of the joint meeting for convening a national  conference enables all Koreans who want national reunification  to unite as one nation, transcending the difference in idea,  ideology and system, no matter where they live and what they do,  and enables not only the authorities but also the compatriots of  all walks of life in the North and South and overseas to take  full responsibility for the reunification of the country, he  said.    He strongly demanded that the South Korean authorities  renounce confrontation and nuclear war exercises and actively  respond to creating a favorable atmosphere for convening a  national conference from the stand of great unity of the nation.    He called for waging as an all-compatriotic movement the  struggle to bring to a success the convocation of a national  conference proposed at the joint meeting.    A statement supporting the convocation of a national  conference was adopted at the meeting.</p>

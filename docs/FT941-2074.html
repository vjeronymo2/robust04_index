			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Brandenburg coalition falls The tripartite centre-left coalition which has ruled Brandenburg since 1990 collapsed yesterday, amid allegations that Mr Manfred Stolpe, the state premier, had contacts with the east German Stasi. The Social Democratic party had threatened to oust the Alliance 90 party from the coalition unless its leader withdrew charges that Mr Stolpe had lied about his connections with the former secret police. Alliance 90 leader Mr Gunter Nooke said he would not retract his comments. The Social Democrats and the Free Democrats will now run a minority government until state elections on September 11. However, the two Alliance 90 ministers yesterday said they would quit their party and stay with the two-party coalition, which has 41 of the 88 seats in the state parliament.</p>

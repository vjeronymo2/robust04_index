			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cengiz Kuscuoglu] </F>   [Excerpt] Ankara -- A campaign is being waged against  National Education Minister Nevzat Ayaz within the True Path  Party [TPP] for ousting three high-level bureaucrats from  office, who are said to be members of a religious sect. Ayaz  declared that it is out of the question to retract the decision  on the appointments.    The campaign launched by 80 nationalist-conservative TPP  deputies following Ayaz's dismissal of three high-level  bureaucrats, who are said to be religious sect members,  triggered a deep crisis in the party.    Kocaeli Deputy Ismail Amasyali, who is leading the campaign  within the TPP, said: "The minister should either make a  statement to satisfy us, or he should reinstate the officials.  Otherwise, the assembly group is determined to overthrow him."  Ayaz, on the other hand, noted: "These changes were effected  with the knowledge of the prime minister, on professional  grounds. There is no question of retracting the decision."  [passage omitted]</p>

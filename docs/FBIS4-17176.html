			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Kolosov report: "The Volcano Has Stirred, It Has </F> Stretched..."]    [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy --  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy is on the alert. Having laid dormant  for many years, the Koryak Volcano, whose white bulk is an  integral part of the city landscape, has started to show signs  of life....    Since the beginning of March, seismological stations  affiliated to the Institute of Volcanology have been recording  weak but ever more frequent earth tremors at the foot of the  mountain. This is an unusual phenomenon, because nothing like  it has been seen in 40 years. Stanislav Balesta, doctor of  geological and mineralogical sciences and deputy director of the  Institute of Volcanology, explains:    "The fact that the cluster of earth tremors beneath the  Koryak Volcano are occuring at a depth of between two and 15  kilometers indicates that it is pushing magma up toward the  surface. There are two possibilities for the further  development of events: The volcano's internal energy may turn  out to be insufficient, and the earth tremors will stop after a  while; or, should there be a further strengthening of seismic  activity, a powerful eruption will be unavoidable. It is quite  possible that the situation will be resolved in the next few  weeks."    Meanwhile, volcanologists have addressed the Kamchatka  Oblast  Administration in an official capacity with a warning of the  possible danger.  <H5>  FROM OUR FILES: </H5>   The Koryak Volcano (3,456 meters high) is located in the  direct vicinity of the cities of Petropavlovsk and Yelizovo.  The 100-year silence on the part of this rocky giant may be  proof that sufficient energy has accumulated in its bowels to  render it capable of producing an explosive eruption. Depending  on the direction of the explosion, it is not only the populated  areas but also the numerous dacha sites located literally at the  foot of the sleeping mountain which may be placed in serious  jeopardy.    Around-the-clock monitoring of the status of the Koryak  Volcano is now being carried out. Residents are advised to  listen to local radio frequently, and as far as possible not to  switch it off at night.</p>

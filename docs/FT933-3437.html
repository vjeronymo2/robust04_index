			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A social side to business (1) - Samuel Brittan's views on the legitimacy of the social elements of corporate responsibility, reported on September 2, generated a large number of letters. This is a selection When Samuel Brittan told the British Association ('Social tasks of business', September 2) that there is a 'systematic ambiguity' in the arguments for corporate responsibility, he missed a vital point. Business in the Community has always agreed that the primary role of business is to create sustainable wealth by meeting customers' needs. We differ from Brittan in our belief that, by working in the wider community, business can help to build the social environment it needs for long-term wealth creation. As unemployment rises the demand for goods contracts, and as crime rates soar the costs of security improvements and insurance premiums grow. So there are sound business reasons behind Unipart's project with government, police, magistrates and Oxford companies to combat car crime by training young offenders to tune up old cars and giving them the chance to race them. Similarly, business needs well-educated and highly skilled people to succeed in more competitive global markets. That is why companies are playing a more active role in education and training by, for example, training teachers in skills like financial management and marketing and by giving young people quality work experience placements. There is clear evidence that customers increasingly expect businesses to play their part in tackling social issues; in 1992, Mori research found that 73 per cent of adults are more inclined to buy products from companies that support the community and society. At the same time, companies are choosing community involvement as a way to meet business needs for staff development and training, marketing, and building positive relationships with employees, customers, shareholders and local communities. For instance, Marks and Spencer sends high-flyers to work for community organisations to broaden their experience and test their leadership potential; Grand Metropolitan encourages employees to get involved in community projects to build teams, motivation and morale; and Whitbread builds links with schools to enhance its local profile and position itself as an attractive employer. A survey by MSS of the UK's top 1,000 companies found that 75 per cent believe that employee involvement in the community improves morale, 71 per cent that it builds teams and 65 per cent that it offers training opportunities. Employees are even more enthusiastic - 84 per cent told Mori that a company that supports society and the community is probably a good company to work for. Samuel Brittan argued that corporate responsibility attempts to achieve public policy objectives 'on the cheap'. Our view is simply that business has legitimate interests in public policy matters. Social priorities like protecting the environment, raising the quality of education and regenerating local communities call for participation by all partners in society - seen in relatively recent partnerships like Training and Enterprise Councils and City Challenges. This is not about business replacing government, but 'adding value' by bringing its own skills, attitudes and resources to the public policy table. Brittan said that 'several' business leaders are associated with Business in the Community. If that includes the leaders of Business in the Community's 470 member companies, the 6,000 leaders of companies who support small businesses through local enterprise agencies and the tens of thousands of executives who get involved with schools, then we are happy to be among the 'several'.

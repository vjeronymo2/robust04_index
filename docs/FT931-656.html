			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / China's leaders send a message to the world CHINA'S parliament appointed new state functionaries at the weekend to smooth the transition from old-guard revolutionaries to a younger, more technocratic leadership, Tony Walker writes from Beijing. The appointment of Mr Jiang Zemin, 67, the general secretary of the Communist party and chairman of the Central Military Commission, to the additional post of state president is aimed at strengthening collective leadership in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Likewise, the reappointment of Mr Li Peng, 65, to a second five-year term is intended to solidify the leadership group in this transition phase. Mr Deng, China's supreme leader, is 88 and has aged noticeably in the past year or so. He has urged Chinese officials to speed economic reform, and has been engaged recently in promoting a younger generation of reformists to preserve his legacy, although doubts persist over the cautious Mr Li's commitment to change. The leadership was clearly intent on sending a strong signal to the international community of its intent to continue opening its economy with the appointment as vice-president of Mr Rong Yiren, the millionaire head of China International Trust and Investment Corporation. Among other significant appointments was that of Mr Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, to the post of chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Mr Qiao, 69, who is in charge of security matters, is likely to emerge as a key figure in the post-Deng era. His security responsibilities have tended to keep him in the shadows until now.</p>

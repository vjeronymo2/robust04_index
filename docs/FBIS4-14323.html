			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher ended at the  prime minister's bureau in Tel Aviv a short while ago. During  the meeting, Rabin again complained about Syria's refusal to  enact confidence-building measures while continuing to demand a  complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Our  correspondent Sefi Hendler reports from the prime minister's  bureau in Tel Aviv:    [Begin recording] [Hendler] The Americans and the Israelis  split up into three working groups. One group, dealing with the  Syrian track, is headed on the Israeli side by Itamar  Rabinovich. In the second group, dealing with Lebanon, Israel is  represented by Uri Lubrani. Israel's representative in the  third group, dealing with the Jordanian track, is Elyaqim  Rubinstein. Prime Minister Rabin proposed that the group of  officials attending the meeting split up into three smaller  working teams and return for a concluding discussion in the  presence of Foreign Minister Peres, Secretary of State  Christopher, and Prime Minister Rabin at 1600 [1300 GMT].  Statements will apparently be released to the media following  this afternoon's meeting.    During this morning's meetings, Rabin made several remarks.  The prime minister briefed Christopher on Israel's plans for  the continuation of the talks with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.  The prime minister reiterated that Syria's maximalist demands  for a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights had not been  accompanied by any confidence-building measures vis a vis  Israel. This was not right, the prime minister asserted. Rabin  also mentioned two problems related to terrorism that Israel was  currently facing. Raising the problem of Hizballah terrorism in  Lebanon, the prime minister stressed that Hizballah was  intentionally shelling Christian villages. Obviously, Rabin  also spoke of Palestinian terrorism in the territories and  specified in general the type of security arrangements Israel  wanted on the Golan Heights. These are the initial details.  The working groups are currently holding discussions and the  prime minister will meet Warren Christopher again at 1600. [end  recording]</p>

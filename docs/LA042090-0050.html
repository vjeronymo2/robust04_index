			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON;  </P> <P> CHOLESTEROL AND FAT  </P> <P> Question: I've followed your advice about reading labels on the food I buy, and  it's really been a valuable piece of advice.  </P> <P> But sometimes I'm not clear about what the label is telling me. For example, if  a label says the food does not have cholesterol, does that mean it doesn't have  much saturated fat?  </P> <P> Answer: A cholesterol-free food can be either high or low in saturated fat.  </P></p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Community in trouble With any luck, the Treaty of Maastricht should soon be ratified in all 12 member states. But the European Community is now in deep political and economic trouble, and it will not be resolved by getting the treaty on to the statute books. The political problem is that the member states have not yet taken on board the full consequences, and therefore have not accepted the full responsibilities, of the post-cold war era. The economic problem is that the process of economic integration, which should be carried a great stride forward by the single market and Maastricht, is in fact in jeopardy from the recession and the growing anxiety over Europe's competitive weaknesses. France and Germany last week called for a special European summit later this year to revitalise the Community, and their proposal was immediately endorsed by five Christian Democrat governments. What we don't yet have is evidence that the member states have remedies for the Community's problems. The tell-tale of the post-cold war era, is the comprehensive muddle over the war in Bosnia. After weeks of feverish transatlantic diplomacy, five UN Security Council members last month drafted a 12-point action plan for containing the conflict. But that ambiguous document was really a cloak for continued disagreement between the US and Europe; and the disagreement has not been ended by Friday's Security Council vote to protect 'safe areas' in Bosnia. Sanctions have not stopped the Serbs from killing Moslems nor from conquering more and more Bosnian territory; above all, they have not persuaded the Serbs to submit to the Vance-Owen plan. If that plan is to be brought back from the dead, and then implemented, much more forceful military compulsion would be needed. But troops on the ground, in sufficient numbers credibly to threaten the use of force, would require a substantial US contribution. That is what we shall not get. The US is determined not to get involved in the war. On the campaign trail Bill Clinton criticised President George Bush for the limpness of his Bosnia policy and promised he would be more vigorous. But now, after much reflection, he has evidently concluded that the Bush policy was not so bad after all. He does not say that Bosnia is Europe's problem, but that is what he means. The fiasco of the Washington 'agreement' was underscored by an off-the-record briefing by a senior state department official, who told journalists the new administration would be adopting a lower international profile, and would be 'setting limits on the amount of American engagement in Bosnia and around the world'. His words were immediately repudiated by the White House, and secretary of state Warren Christopher assured the world that America would continue to lead 'because the need for American leadership is undiminished'. But these were just the gesticulations of national vanity: the state department official was merely telling us what we already knew. If America was the uncontested leader of the west for the past 50 years, it was primarily because of the cold war: Europe and America needed each other desperately, and only America could lead. But leadership is a heavy burden. Now that the Soviet threat has vanished, America has much less incentive (and fewer resources) systematically to bear the burden of leadership seven days a week. In the new loose world after the cold war, Europe may find that sometimes America has quite different strategic objectives, and sometimes simply does not want to get involved at all. The implications of this for Europe are profound. First, Europe can no longer take America for granted. We share many values, and many common interests; but we may not necessarily have the same strategic objectives. Therefore, the Community needs to decide whether it is serious about the Maastricht objective of a common foreign policy; if it is, it must go much further than anything in the treaty. If the Community is to be more self-reliant, the tasks of a full-gamut foreign policy can no longer be left to France and Britain: the Germans must recognise that their posture of atonement may be a critical obstacle to the European integration they say they want. Europe's economic problems are, if anything, even more intractable. When Maastricht was being negotiated, the centrepiece was regarded as the programme for economic and monetary union. But today's most pressing economic problem is high and rising unemployment, and it is not being helped, and may be made worse, by the Emu programme. Europe's economic downturn has been aggravated both by the costs of German unification, and by Germany's tight money policy. But the high rate of unemployment may also be due to the relocating of European jobs to low-cost countries elsewhere. A report to the French senate calculates that France has lost 450,000 jobs in clothing, footwear and electronics in the past 15 years; and it estimates that another 2.7m French industrial jobs are vulnerable to the same threat. Last week an official at the OECD warned privately that rising unemployment could trigger a 'social explosion'. The prescription of the French senate report is that 'Europe must be protectionist'. Free-traders will regard this as outrageous, and typically French. But we should note that it would be all of a piece with the human protectionism that Europe is already practising on a massive scale. We are not ready to do anything to stop the war in ex-Yugoslavia; but we have no shame in merely excluding the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war, death and destruction.</p>

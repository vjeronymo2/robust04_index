			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Cannabis `Just 10pc of Total'"] </F>   [Text] Cannabis worth &pound;57m has been seized along the  Cork coast in the last two years--but that is only 10pc  [percent] of the estimated total shipments, it was claimed  yesterday.    Primitive surveillance techniques have also made Ireland  `the  drugs capital of Europe' and the 500-mile coastline of West Cork  and South Kerry has become a haven for the global drug runner,  the British magazine Esquire said.    The article claimed the seizures of drugs in the Cork area  owed more to "nosy coastal dwellers" and carelessness than to  law enforcement.    A spokeswoman for the Revenue Commissioners said, however,  that the National Drugs Team had an extensive mobile network and  its operations were based on intelligence gathering and  co-operation across Europe.</p>

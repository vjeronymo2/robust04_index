			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / More staff cuts at Alliance Alliance &amp; Leicester building society yesterday announced that it is to shed up to 550 jobs, almost all before the end of next year, as part of its restructuring, which includes integration of personal customers of its Girobank subsidiary with those of the society. Mr Paul Clifton, director in charge of human resources, said the effect would be felt in administration, where the group wanted to flatten its management structures. The aim is to ensure that it can make faster decisions. The job losses come on top of an announcement last November that about 700 jobs would be lost over the next four years as a result of the closure of the society's headquarters in Hove. Mr Clifton said he did not expect any further job losses as a result of the organisational review. Mr Clifton said he regretted the job losses, but tight control over costs was essential.</p>

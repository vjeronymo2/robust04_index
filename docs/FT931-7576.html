			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Canada pushes ahead with Nafta CANADA is taking steps to ensure that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is on the statute book before the general election later this year. Mr Michael Wilson, trade minister, may introduce in parliament as early as today legislation implementing the Nafta provisions. The accord, signed by the US, Mexico and Canada last year, is due to take effect next January 1. Passage of the bill through parliament is likely to take several months and to be fought at every stage by both main opposition parties, the Liberals and New Democrats. However, Mr Wilson and his Conservative colleagues appear eager to present Nafta as a fait accompli during the election campaign which is expected to start in late summer or early autumn. The Liberals, who are far ahead in public opinion polls, have yet to spell out a clear policy on the agreement. Opposition to North American free trade is far more widespread in Canada than in either the US or Mexico. A Gallup poll last autumn revealed that 60 per cent of Canadians believe Nafta will on balance be bad for the country, against 27 per cent who think it will do more good than harm. Only 24 per cent of Americans and 17 per cent of Mexicans were against free trade. A trade official said Ottawa expected the Clinton administration to submit Nafta legislation to Congress in late spring or early summer, pending negotiations with Congress. After that, it thought passage of the bill would be relatively quick. In Mexico, most of the Nafta provisions are self-implementing or can be put into force through executive regulations. US, Canadian and Mexican officials are due to start talks next month on parallel agreements covering environmental and labour issues.</p>

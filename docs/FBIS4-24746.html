			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry  spokesman Shen Guofang made the following announcement at a news  briefing today. [passage omitted]    Responding to a question on the DPRK nuclear issue, Shen  Guofang said: The International Atomic Energy Agency and the  DPRK did not reach any agreement on the inspection of the  replacement of fuel rods. There have reemerged some  difficulties on the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, and this is a situation about which China is very  concerned.    He pointed out: The key at present is that the parties  directly involved should treat the issue calmly and make  positive efforts in order to leave room and keep alive the  possibility of a proper settlement. China's position favoring a  proper settlement of the issue through dialogue and  consultations remains unchanged. The only goal of China on this  issue is to realize denuclearization and to safeguard peace and  stability on the Korean peninsula, and these are in the  interests of all.</p>

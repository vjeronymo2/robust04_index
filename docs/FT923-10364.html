			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UN's 'humble servant' not a man to be pushed around: Boutros Boutros Ghali's independent thinking in troubled times upsets critics NEAR THE Security Council chamber at United Nations headquarters an exhibit designed to inform tourists includes this description of the office of secretary general: 'The most impossible, frustrating, daunting, challenging, clearly unique job on earth.' Like his five predecessors in the top UN post, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali would surely agree that the adjectives are no exaggeration. Barely seven months in office and reeling under a mounting load of problems, not to mention criticism of his independent style of running the organisation, he may wonder why he ever wanted to give up Egypt's single-issue Middle East diplomacy for this. In an extraordinary period in history, the former Egyptian deputy prime minister has to supervise UN operations at flashpoints around the world and try to avert other crises. Yet members continue to impose new tasks on an over-extended organisation already showing signs of stress, and his job is not helped by their refusal to provide finance for his extensive battery of activities. Cambodia, where the biggest ever UN operation is under way, is expected to cost more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) and after only a few months is recording a Dollars 465m shortfall. The peace-keeping effort in former Yugoslavia is Dollars 83m in arrears and governments owe more than Dollars 910m in regular budget assessments. More than half of this is US debts. A report yesterday said the UN was owed nearly Dollars 1.75bn in regular and peace-keeping dues and might have to cease operations at the end of the year without an immediate inflow of cash. The sea of red ink has not deterred states from engaging the UN in ever more ventures and the Security Council is now in virtual permanent session, breaking all records this year for number of meetings held. The secretary general can hardly be blamed if his patience is running out. In testy mood last week he took sharp issue with the Security Council for approving a potentially hazardous new mission for UN troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina, requested by the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia chaired by Lord Carrington, claiming he had not been properly consulted. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, in his capacity as current EC president, made an unscheduled stop in New York on his way to the Philippines to mollify the furious secretary general. In the end, the disagreement was papered over and an enlarged Yugoslav peace conference, in which the UN will play an important role, was the direct result. Significantly, Mr Boutros Ghali stuck to his guns. He is his own man, not to be pushed around and, he believes, entitled to express his objections vigorously if he considers a programme for UN action to be ill conceived. Officials have tried to minimise the affair, but many acknowledge it may be symptomatic of basic differences between Mr Boutros Ghali and the membership over the relative priority to be given to developing and developed countries' problems. It may also have served as an excuse for some members to vent pent-up grievances against a man who, not so long ago, had proclaimed himself the council's 'humble servant' but has lately demonstrated his independence of thought and attitude. The row over Bosnia-Hercegovina may to some extent have grown out of his experience at the Organisation of African Unity in Nigeria last month, where he was repeatedly questioned about the UN's alleged 'marginalising' of Africa under his leadership. The criticism stung. Back in New York, Mr Boutros Ghali lectured council members for their preoccupation with what Africans regarded as a 'war of the rich' in Europe. Its victims appeared well fed, he observed, when compared to the harrowing scenes on television of starving women and children fighting over a spoonful of rice in shattered Somalia, whose sufferings he believes the UN has done far too little to relieve. Under his goading, the Security Council this week agreed on further measures. But Mr Boutros Ghali's sharp comment have, in turn, upset leading western countries, who feel such distinctions should not be made by an organisation with a universal peace-keeping and humanitarian vocation. A sophisticated, westernised Christian Arab, born in a palace, a millionaire married to a millionaire, Mr Boutros Ghali has spent a long career in international politics and diplomacy, and it shows. Ambassadors in New York resent his going over their heads with his ready access to their leaders, whom he does not hesitate to call with a problem to discuss. But such intimacy could be advantageous for the UN. In his dealings with foreign diplomats and journalists in Cairo, Mr Boutros Ghali was considered a charmer. The UN has observed a less appealing side, of a man who can be abrupt and dismissive of diplomats and staff alike and who, some say, is over-confident in his own judgments. But few fair-minded observers in New York doubt that as he develops in the post the organisation will be well served.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Deputies on Kaliningrad </F> Oblast. Immanuel Kant's Homeland: The Struggle of the Ideal and  the Material"]    [Excerpts] The problems of Kaliningrad Oblast do not allow  politicians a minute's peace. Recently, the enclave was visited  with a great fanfare by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who spoke at  length about its strategic importance. However, Kaliningrad is  also the district that gave the Federation Council its chairman,  Vladimir Shumeyko. He ran there under the slogan of setting up  a free economic zone, and an edict on creating it was signed by  the president right after the votes were counted. Yesterday,  the oblast's problems came to the attention of joint, carefully  organized hearings of State Duma and Federation Council  committees. Their leitmotiv was the politically low-risk, albeit  hardly new, idea of making the oblast Russia's economic,  political, and military outpost. [passage omitted]    The Kaliningrad hearings could not, however, be contained  within the limits of a purely economic discussion. Sensational  reports were heard that Germany, Lithuania, and even Belarus  have been recently calling -- so far unofficially -- for postwar  borders to be redrawn, implying primarily Kaliningrad Oblast's  alienation from Russia. The problem of having an enclave and  protecting national interests finally came to dominate the  statements of nearly all speakers. Historical exposes were also  to be heard. One of the popular theses was that neither  Lithuania (which has never owned Klaipeda and, moreover,  received Vilno [Vilnius] only from the USSR), nor Germany, which  lost the war, has the right to lay claim to the former East  Prussia. A Foreign Ministry representative, who did not wish to  keep aloof from the debate, recalled that it was Germany that  sponsored the well-known resolution by the European Parliament  on Kaliningrad in February. It stressed the enclave's "special  nature" and emphasized the need to give it the right to forge  direct ties with European structures. The Foreign Ministry,  however, did not manage to avoid criticism. It was taken to  task by the deputies for "bungling the opportunity" of granting  extraterritorial status to the railroad connecting the oblast  with the rest of Russia.    The main result of the hearings was the recommendation to  both parliament chambers that the drafting of a law on a special  status for Kaliningrad Oblast should be considered a priority in  their lawmaking activity in 1994. It cannot be ruled out that  the consideration of the bill may acquire dialectical features:  "Kantian idealism" (that is, political rhetoric) may sweep the  State Duma owing to Zhirinovskiy's efforts, while entirely  "Marxist materialism" may gain the upper hand (with Shumeyko's  blessing) in the Senate.</p>

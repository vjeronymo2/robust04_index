			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY OPENS 6TH SEASON WITH RUSSIAN MUSIC AND GRATITUDE GALORE  </P> <P> An aura of determination and optimism permeated the first concert of the South  Coast Symphony's sixth season Saturday night. With subscriptions reportedly up  32% over last year, and with J.C. Penney picking up the tab for the evening,  there were expressions of gratitude galore at Robert B. Moore Theatre on the  campus of Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> First, radio personality John Santana saluted the audience for supporting arts  in Orange County. Then founding president of the orchestra, Peter Staudhammer,  and Richard J. Burrell presented the symphony's 1989 Man of the Year award to  managing director Albert Wong for "re-energizing the orchestra."  </P> <P> The orchestra did seem to have been re-energized, and not just financially,  though it remains -- with roughly 60% professional personnel and four  preparatory rehearsals for each concert -- a community orchestra.  </P> <P> Still -- despite some ragged entrances, particularly among the woodwinds in  Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" Fantasy-Overture, and in spite of  inconsistencies in balance -- conductor Larry Granger led his group with a  sense of purpose in this Russian program.  </P> <P> Soloist John Walz's aggressive and soul-searching First Cello Concerto of  Shostakovich formed the focal point of the evening. Though Walz appeared  markedly uncomfortable in the warm hall, frequently mopping both brow and  instrument, he drew every mournful drop from each note of the second movement  and its corollary cadenza and attacked the outer movements with sure skill.  </P> <P> Yet, while the orchestra members partnered admirably, the results were less  rousing than efforts merited, thwarted by a sound-absorbing auditorium.  </P> <P> Nor was there inordinate excitement in the Second Symphony of Aleksandr  Borodin, though ominously biting lower brass choirs spoke pointedly. Only  distinguished solo passages -- exemplified by Linda De-Roche-Duffin's subdued  and confident horn solo in the Andante, which was given graceful echo by Steve  Roberts on clarinet -- interrupted an otherwise competent and predictable  reading.  </P></p>

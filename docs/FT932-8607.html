			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Steep fall at K mart surprises Wall Street ANALYSTS scrambled to cut their full-year earnings estimates for K mart yesterday morning after the US retail group surprised Wall Street with a 57.1 per cent fall in underlying profits for the first quarter of 1993, in spite of a 9.2 per cent rise in sales. Stripping out extraordinary items and the effects of accounting changes, the underlying net profits fell to Dollars 50m, or 11 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 9.03bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 116m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 8.27bn a year earlier. In the 1993 quarter, K mart had a one-time charge of Dollars 10m. Accounting changes reduced earnings by an additional Dollars 17m, bringing first-quarter net income to Dollars 23m, or 5 cents. Although the company, which operates around 2,400 discount stores and several chains of specialist stores, had warned investors to expect a shortfall in first-quarter earnings, the erosion was worse than most analysts had expected. K mart shares closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 22 1/2 . The company blamed severe weather in March for its disappointing performance. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said consumers had responded well to the company's spring and summer merchandise, suggesting 'that the unsatisfactory results in the first quarter were largely weather related.' K mart's Pace warehouse club chain made a Dollars 24m operating loss, while the Builders Square unit recorded slim operating earnings of Dollars 1m. A year earlier, Pace broke even and Builders Square had operating earnings of Dollars 15m. Profits at Builders Square were hurt by a Dollars 4m increase in pre-operating costs, linked to a more aggressive expansion programme, and by the entry of new competitors. K mart's gross margin slipped to 23.6 per cent of sales, compared with 24.4 per cent.</p>

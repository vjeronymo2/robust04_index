The conference approved a mechanism for  using television and radio in the election campaign. It was  agreed that, during the period left until the election, parties  can use 21 hours of air time on television and 10 hours on the  radio.    The first stage, at which parties presented their election  programs, is over. At the second stage, electors will be  informed in detail about the goals of political parties and  movements. It was agreed that these broadcasts will take the  format of a debate, involving only those party representatives  who are not registered as candidates for people's deputy of  Ukraine.    A proposal on panel composition put forward by State  Television and Radio Broadcasting Company president Mykola  Okhmakevych's was strongly disputed. In the party leaders'  opinion, they are capable of choosing their opponents themselves  without waiting for journalists to do so. It was decided that  topics for the debates will be suggested by sociological surveys.    Chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz  suggested that conference participants refrain from commenting  on the election results in Crimea for the sake of national  concord.</p>

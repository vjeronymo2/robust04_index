			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of </F> the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday prayers  leader, in Tehran on 8 April--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I would like to make a  friendly reference, on this occasion, to the issue of the Voice  and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran. During the New Year  holidays some programs were broadcast and you watched them. A  number of newspapers wrote about those programs and some of the  papers, to be fair, were quite honest, God bless them. They  wrote about the weaknesses of those programs in detail.    The Vision [television] should think of ways to perform its  duty. What is that duty? I have to only refer to it, as time  is short and I have no other choice. The duty of that  organization and other publicity organizations is to attract  people, particularly the young generation, to sense right,  justice, human qualities, and moral and spiritual issues. That  is their duty. They should also stop people turning to indecent  and inhuman acts -- wrong, oppression, treachery, and other  filthy qualities. What can be done about that? People should  sit down and think about that, and that is not easy. The nature  of any person, particularly people who have not been properly  educated, is toward pleasure. That is very clear. Those people  follow anyone who better provides that pleasure. That is the  initial nature of human beings.    The duty of those publicity organs is to see which of those  pleasures are harmful and which are useful. They should sweeten  the things that, in the first instance, appear to be bitter but  are, in fact, useful -- just like a mother or a doctor does who  covers a bitter medicine with sugar so that the child takes it.  If it is not covered, then the child does not take the  medicine. When it is covered, the child takes the medicine and  gets better. That is the way programs should be presented --  sugar-coated -- so that what people initially reject, but is  useful to them, seems appetizing. The same way, they should  make the things that are harmful to the people taste bitter.  [passage omitted]    It is easy to say these things, but their implementation  brings a great deal of problems.    Now, the dear people who have accepted the new  responsibilities at the Voice and Vision should work on those  issues. Spiritual leaders, seminaries, believers, university  lecturers, and everyone who can help them should offer their  help so that that valuable service is rendered properly.    Another topic of discussion concerns the anniversary of the  martyrdom of the Martyr Ayatollah Musa Sadr and his esteemed  sister on 19 Farvardin [8 April]. These two dear ones were  martyred after enduring torture in the prisons of Baathist Iraq.  [passage omitted].    Another issue concerns our problems in the political realm.  A great deal of effort is being taken to force the Islamic  Republic of Iran to surrender, and there is a plan by the United  States, which is being clearly displayed in practice, to  impoverish us financially. This is to say that the United  States is trying to limit our oil income, which constitutes one  of our country's sources of income, and, obviously, the more we  earn from this source, the more developed our country will  become, and the less we earn the greater the number of problems  we will face. They are exerting pressures to reduce this income.    Their scheme is a dastardly one. In an OPEC meeting,  everyone, except one member, agrees that oil production should  be reduced so as to increase the prices. That certain member  says: No, the production levels should stay unchanged for a  while. This is despite the fact that the said member country,  which itself earns its revenues from producing and exporting  oil, fully understands that it will be harmed by such a policy.  It also understands that losses will be incurred by other Arab  countries and in fact all OPEC members. But they still say: Let  everyone burn with us. This is what the situation is like. The  said country is prepared to suffer losses, and also let the  others -- which are after all its allies -- to lose as well.    This is how it is. They [not further identified] have  played, wherever possible, a role similar to the one described  above. However, we want to tell them something, which we want  them to hear carefully, with all earplugs removed. We want to  say that no matter what happens to us, we will never -- never --  surrender to America and Israel. This, in effect, means that we  will never surrender to oppression, injustice, and coercion.  [crowd chants in support]    We have Imam 'Ali in our history; we have Fatimah Zahra in  our history; we have Ja'far Sadeq in our history; we have the  martyrs of Karbala in our history. When we have these models,  surrender does not mean anything to us. What are you going to  do about it? Okay, you will exert more pressure on us; the  implementation of our development plans might be delayed for a  few years, but so what? Our people might be under a bit of  pressure, that is right; but our people are ready to accept this.    If you see once in a while someone saying something, this is  not the reason--a certain amount of discrimination does take  place; some injustices take place; a certain amount of desire  for the high life exists; people see a certain amount of  wrong-doing from certain people. When the people see these,  they complain, and they have a right to complain, and their  complaints should be investigated. However, the fundamental  issue remains the same. If the Islamic Republic and the  revolution were to be destroyed under pressure who would accept  this? Our models in our history have shown us the way. We  shall eat hunger! We shall protect our faith! [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan excited by L2,000bn Romagnolo bid Unchanged interest rates at yesterday's Bundesbank meeting were no surprise; and they were in character with a day which, for once, let individual corporate stories make their mark on share prices, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was excited by the L2,000bn bid launched by Credito Italiano for the Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo. The Comit index improved 2.32 to 612.73. Credito Italiano said that it would pay L19,000 a share for a 48.2 per cent stake in Romagnolo, which would take its stake above 50 per cent. Analysts at James Capel commented that while it was a hefty price to pay, and would be earnings dilutive, strategically the move made sense. Credito Italiano, the broker said, was historically exposed to the large corporate business sector, and lacked a customer base in which it could cross-sell its products. This would be provided by Romagnolo which had a very rich customer base, managing a lot of assets off-balance sheet. The takeover could make Credito Italiano the country's largest retail operation, adding Romagnolo's 400 branches to its 850 outlets. The takeover offer would be conditional on securing the agreement of other minority shareholders, which included a 4.9 per cent stake held by Cofide, controlled by the De Benedetti group, and BNP, the French bank, which holds 6.8 per cent. Credito Italiano fell sharply on the news, losing 1.5 per cent to L1,592, but off a session low of L1,540. Credito Romagnolo rose sharply, up L2,390 to L16,100. The news affected other banks. Ambroveneto soared 11.4 per cent to L4,332 on suggestions that it could be the next takeover target, while BCI lost 2.3 per cent to L3,390. FRANKFURT eased a little after the Buba meeting and the Dax index closed the official trading session 7.30 lower at 2,013.20, but the real measure of the day's trading was in the post-bourse where the Ibis indicated Dax eventually ended 16.92 higher, or 0.8 per cent, at 2,026.37. Turnover eased from DM5.5bn to DM5.2bn. Nine-month turnover figures from Daimler and Linde helped the carmaker and engineer advance by DM11.50 to DM753.50, and the forklift specialist by DM23 to DM886. Mr Adrian Phillips at Kleinwort Benson said that Daimler's figures were much as expected but that the slightly better dollar might have given it some encouragement. Linde, he noted, had produced good figures on Wednesday afternoon but the stock tended to move little in Ibis trading, generally reserving its reactions for the official session. Major session moves included a DM24 rise to DM800 in Philipp Holzmann, the construction group, after Deutsche Bank said that it might sell its 25.8 per cent holding; Hochtief, Holzmann's fellow construction group, has takeover ambitions. Meanwhile Weru, the window frame manufacturer, had another setback yesterday; its shares, hit severely by broker downgrades last week, fell DM21 to DM820; brokers said that an analysts' meeting had been cancelled. PARIS rallied on stability in the currency markets, although turnover was low as some investors began to wind down ahead of the long weekend holiday. The French financial markets will be closed on Monday and Tuesday. The CAC-40 index rose 26.57 or 1.4 per cent to 1,858.11 in turnover estimated at under FFr3bn. L'Oreal, which reported a 6.5 per cent rise in first-half consolidated pretax profit to FFr2.6bn, slightly below expectations, rose FFr33 or 3 per cent to FFr1,064. Eurotunnel showed an improvement in performance following recent bad publicity surrounding the start of its Eurostar service as it announced that it had won approval from the authorities to extend operations to the weekend. The shares improved 3 per cent to FFr19. AMSTERDAM saw Nedlloyd shares make further progress following the recent wave of selling and ahead of expectations for strong third-quarter results next week. The transport group's shares rose Fl 2.60 to Fl 54.80 while the AEX index rose 4.72 to 403.87. Nedlloyd said yesterday that its shipping division, together with Malaysian International Shipping was to take over the French Compagnie Generale Maritime's share of Europe to Far East shipping traffic from next month. Philips was the day's most active issue, gaining 80 cents to Fl 52.50, with third-quarter results due next week. ZURICH's SMI index fell another 18.6 to 2,458.6. Mr Michael Clark of Robert Fleming Securities said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the dollar threatened painful currency translation effects on corporate earnings; many of the country's multinationals had large portions of their sales in the US currency, Switzerland itself offering a small domestic base. In pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates tumbled SFr110 to SFr5,380. In banks, the reduction in the UBS registered premium continued: this class fell SFr7 to SFr275 while the bearers fell SFr18 to SFr1,212. One bright spot was the insurance sector, where Winterthur Insurance rose SFr6 to SFr615 on bargain hunting; another was the watchmaker, SMH, which recovered SFr6.50 to SFr157 after Goldman Sachs upgraded it to a trading buy from market performer status.

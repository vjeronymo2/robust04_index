The bureau notes that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  thanks President Clinton for his contribution to the promotion  of the peace process.    Minister Shulamit Aloni says a summit meeting should be  planned soon between the Syrian president and Prime Minister  Rabin.    Minister Yosi Sarid is encouraged by the results of the  meeting in Geneva, and says that Clinton's remarks about  al-Asad's willingness to establish normal relations with Israel  are very important and commit the Syrian president.    Tzomet says that Prime Minister Rabin has scored a failure  in  the management of the peace process, and has now given President  Clinton the power to make decisions.    Demonstrations against the Geneva summit have begun in  various locations in the north. Residents of kibbutzim in the  Bet She'an Valley are holding a demonstration at the 'En Hanaziv  junction under the slogan: Clinton and al-Asad Will Not  Determine the Future of the Golan. Another demonstration was  held at the Tzemah junction, and some 200 people are  demonstrating in Qiryat Shemona. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv  reports that the Israel Police have reinforced their deployment  in anticipation of the reaction of the inhabitants of the north.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Learmonth jumps to Pounds 1.6m PROFITS before tax at Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems jumped from Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 1.61m over the year to April 30, helped by a rights issue in January which enabled the computing services group to eliminate bank debt. The City had been expecting slightly more, however, and the shares fell 17p to close at 288p on little volume. Turnover rose from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 23.6m, while development costs were trimmed to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3.22m). Earnings per share were 7p, against 0.7p, and the company has returned to the dividend list with a single payment of 0.75p. The company now has net cash balances of Pounds 2m and no debt.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT'S SKY  </P> <P> About the Aug. 27 Outtakes item on the dismantling of Paramount's "skywall"  backdrop:  </P> <P> I was new to Los Angeles when my agent set up my first meeting on the Paramount  lot. I tried to dismiss images of Gloria Swanson on her way to meet DeMille as  I approached the gate. But I was finally sure I was in Hollywood when I  received directions from the guard: "Drive straight down this road and park  under the sky."  </P> <P> I've never had plans to write an autobiography, but for years I've had a title  anyway . . . "Park Under the Sky."  </P> <P> Paramount, please prove Chicken Little wrong.  </P> <P> WILLIAM THUT  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

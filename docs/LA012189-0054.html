			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE OKS PLAN FOR HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> RULING CLEARS WAY FOR $922-MILLION OVERHAUL  </P> <P> A $922-million plan for new office buildings, hotels, shops and apartment  buildings in downtown Hollywood was adopted fairly and according to law,  despite charges that the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency acted  fraudulently and violated state guidelines in drafting it, a Superior Court  judge ruled Friday.  </P> <P> In the long-awaited ruling, Judge Barnet M. Cooperman removed the last major  hurdle blocking a major overhaul of the community's commercial sections.  Proponents of the plan, including Hollywood-area City Councilman Michael Woo,  hailed the decision as a milestone in the long, arduous effort to revive the  flagging movie capital.  </P> <P> "What we had was a resounding victory for those who want Hollywood to move  forward," Woo said of the ruling. "I think a cloud has been lifted from above  Hollywood. Now we're going to be able to move faster than ever before."  </P> <P> The 30-year redevelopment plan, adopted by the City Council in early 1986,  provides a basic development blueprint for an area of 35,000 residents -- the  most populous redevelopment zone ever established in Los Angeles. The plan  seeks to foster development in 1,100 acres encompassing the busy Hollywood and  Sunset boulevards. The plan, for example, envisions new buildings and modern  storefronts around such tourist attractions as Mann's Chinese Theatre and the  corner of Hollywood and Vine.  </P> <P> Residents and big-business interests have fought bitterly over the plan almost  since it was proposed in 1983. Residents, fearful of worsening traffic  congestion and possible condemnation of homes, battled to defeat the plan or to  substantially reduce the amount of development it allowed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Larger-Scale Development  </P> <P> Big-business interests -- including landowners such as Pantages Theatres,  Golden West Broadcasters and Sunset-Gower Studios -- favored a plan permitting  larger-scale development. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, representing most  of those landowners, was able to control more than half the seats on the  25-member citizens committee that helped to draft the plan under state  redevelopment guidelines.  </P> <P> Although the final plan contained significant compromises on zoning issues, it  was seen as favoring large-landowner interests. Residents filed suit soon after  the plan was adopted, alleging that the City Council and redevelopment agency  pushed for redevelopment against the interests of homeowners whose concerns  were not adequately considered. The suit charged that the CRA conspired with  the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to stack the citizens committee and thus  draft a plan favorable to big business.  </P> <P> The court, noting the seriousness of the charges, took months to review the  10,000 pages of records on which the lawsuit was based, Cooperman said. The  judge on Friday reported finding no evidence of wrongdoing during any part of  the plan's preparation.  </P> <P> "The case has been a complicated and time-consuming one," Cooperman said. "The  allegation of fraud is serious. The court very carefully considered the  evidence, and the plaintiffs, in the court's judgment, produced no credible  evidence."  </P> <P> Residents said they would consider appealing the decision.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at a press conference Friday, Woo and CRA Chairman Jim Wood  confidently predicted that the ruling would mean an end to a troublesome  roadblock. Because of the lawsuit, they said, the county had been withholding  property-tax revenues set aside each year for Hollywood's redevelopment.  </P> <P> Those frozen funds now total $1.6 million, CRA officials said.  </P> <P> "The end of the lawsuit . . . frees up that money," Woo said. "We (no longer)  have to operate on a shoestring."  </P> <P> Although the CRA has begun spending some money in Hollywood, the agency now  will be able to pour in substantially more to begin paying for improvements  such as parking structures, low- and moderate-income housing, and social  programs. The property taxes available for Hollywood are expected to increase  substantially each year as real estate values escalate. It is hoped that public  spending by the CRA will in turn draw increasing numbers of private developers  to Hollywood, spawning both commercial construction and new housing.  </P> <P> This spring, the area's first two major commercial projects are expected to  break ground near the busy corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 400-Room Hotel  </P> <P> The largest, the Hollywood Promenade, is expected to bring a 400-room high-rise  hotel, an entertainment museum and a multimillion-dollar office complex to  vacant land surrounding Mann's Chinese Theatre. That project -- unsuccessfully  challenged in a separate lawsuit -- is expected to be completed near the end of  1990.  </P> <P> A short distance away, on the site of a torn-down hotel, the Hollywood Galaxy  project is planned to include six movie theaters, outdoor restaurants and a  number of retail shops, plus an underground garage. That project may be  completed even earlier.  </P> <P> Bill Welsh, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said more is on the  way. Architects are rumored to be designing a new entertainment center on  Pantages Theatres property near Hollywood and Vine, he said, and plans are  under way for a remodeling of the old Paramount Theatre building.  </P> <P> Additional developers will likely move into Hollywood now that the legal  challenge to redevelopment is apparently over, Welsh predicted.  </P> <P> "I think this opens the gates," he said. "It was an exciting day for us in  Hollywood . . . who believe in the redevelopment of this world-famous area. I  realize that very probably the verdict will be appealed, but I'm very pleased  with the judge's extensive research before rendering his verdict. That  encourages me to think that the opinion will be sustained on appeal."  </P> <P> Residents, who deplored the prospect of significant new development, said they  hope to challenge the ruling.  </P> <P> Norton Halper, a member of the citizens group Save Hollywood Our Town, which  filed the suit, said large-scale commercial development would destroy the  community flavor that exists in much of the project area. "It's not all  run-down; it's a very nice area here," Halper said. "The community atmosphere .  . . will be destroyed to make Hollywood a big entertainment center."  </P> <P> SHOT member Brian Moore said: "This judge disagrees with the citizens of  Hollywood. We definitely expect to appeal. We always said it would be decided  in the appellate court."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uncertain on Appeal  </P> <P> But homeowners' attorney Christopher Sutton expressed uncertainty about an  appeal. Legal fees so far have totaled $300,000 to $400,000, he said, and  residents have raised less than $60,000 to offset them. His law office has  handled most of the case as a public service, he said.  </P> <P> Praising Cooperman as a fair and thorough judge, Sutton said his case was  hampered because testimony was limited to the 10,000-page administrative  record. Additional testimony that might have persuaded the judge of fraud was  not admitted during the months of trial because the scope of the trial was very  narrowly drawn, the attorney said.  </P> <P> "We had to rely on testimony from (the CRA's) own staff," Sutton said. "They  were free, I believe, to testify to suit themselves. In my opinion, I think  there was creative testimony and convenient memories" on the part of CRA staff  members.  </P> <P> CRA attorney Kay Reiman called the assertions "sour grapes." Reiman said the  voluminous public record and the dozens of witnesses gave Sutton more than  enough opportunity to present his case.  </P> <P> "He had his shot," she said. "That was it."  </P> <P> Woo said he now hopes to ease some of the bitterness that has divided the  community.  </P></p>

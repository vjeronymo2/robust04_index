			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: State companies slip in non-fuel mine output league THE SHARE OF western world non-fuels mineral production accounted for by state-owned mining companies is falling - not via privatisation but because of lack of investment. This is one of the main conclusions reached by the Raw Material Group of Sweden when compiling data for the latest edition of Who Owns Who in the Mining Industry. Although programmes to sell state-controlled mining companies have started in, among others, Argentina, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Peru, these had not seen any substantial capacity sold to the private sector by the end of 1992. RMG says the few privatisations included the Canadian asbestos producer, Societe Nationale de l'Amiante; Peru's Empresa Mineral del Hierro Peru and the Condestable mine in that country. 'But even if the privatisation programmes had not yet had their full impact, the state share of western world production fell in 1991. This was primarily because of diminishing production levels in some state controlled mining companies where there was a lack of replacement investments,' says RMG. It points to Zaire as an example. Gecamines and other Zaire state mining companies dropped from eighth to 15th place in the list of the western world's top 50 mining groups. Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is the world's most important mining company, according to RMG, which drew up its league table by reference to the value of non-fuels minerals production controlled by each company in 1991. By this measurement, Anglo is nearly twice as big as its closest rival, RTZ Corporation of the UK. RMG admits, however: 'RTZ can claim to be the world's largest mining company using many other criteria'. RMG's method of assessment naturally gives most weight to production of high-value metals and minerals such as gold and diamonds. Gold production controlled by Anglo rose by 2 per cent to 410 tonnes between 1990 and 1991 while RMG counts De Beers, one of the world's biggest diamond producers, as an integral part of the Anglo group, not a separate mining company even though it is quoted separately. Similarly, RTZ's 49-per-cent-owned associate in Australia, CRA, is considered by RMG as part of the UK group. RGM points out that the fastest-growing big mining companies between 1990 and 1991 were Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, MIM Holdings, another Australian group, and Freeport-McMoRan of the US. BHP increased its share of western world non-fuels minerals output from 1.5 per cent to 2.1 per cent, mainly because of the huge growth in copper production from its partly-owned Escondida mine in Chile. MIM moved from 13th to 8th in the league table after it doubled its shareholding in Cominco, the Canadian zinc producer and because of increased output from its joint-ventured Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. Freeport-McMoRan saw the value of its output rise by about one quarter because of increased production from its Indonesian copper-gold mine. If the proposed merger between Cyprus Minerals and Amax of the US goes through, the combined group would become one of the ten or 12 biggest western mining companies, depending on which of their core assets are included in the deal.

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Personal View: An offer the unemployed cannot refuse Next weekend European leaders will again discuss Mr Jacques Delors' unemployment proposals. Last time around work-sharing proposals were rejected as too pessimistic. So the search has been on for something more positive. Unemployment can be understood only by looking at how the labour market is functioning. Above all, unemployment is profoundly affected by how people are treated. If benefits are available indefinitely, unemployment is likely to be high. In most of the European Union benefits are available for many years, whereas in the US and Japan they end after six months. So it is not surprising that in the past 10 years long-term unemployment (of more than one year) has averaged 5 per cent of the workforce in the European Union compared with 1 per cent in the US and  1/2 per cent in Japan (see chart). So one option is to cut off benefits after some interval and leave the unemployed to sink or swim. This is the American way, but it has helped to make wages in the US twice as unequal as European wages. The way of the underclass is not for Europe. Instead we should treat people as our chief resource and make them employable at a decent wage. This can only be done by a new approach that helps them to earn a proper standard of living. Europe's central aim should be to prevent long-term unemployment. If employees are out of work for longer than a year, they lose skills and work habits and cease to be attractive to employers. So their unemployment does nothing to restrain inflation. Unemployment can only be eliminated by a concerted effort over a run of years, but Europe's leaders should now commit their countries to preventing long-term unemployment by the end of the century. How? Here is one way. The state would guarantee temporary work (say of six months) to everybody who is still unemployed after a year. Companies and public organisations would be invited to employ such people at no cost. The state would continue paying what it would have paid to the unemployed anyway, plus some top-up. In return unemployed people would have to accept any reasonable offer. After the first year they could no longer draw benefits for doing nothing. The advantages of this approach would be huge. Those in temporary work would be producing something and they would gain valuable experience. By preventing long-term unemployment Europe would be able to increase employment by at least 4 per cent. Output would go up by at least 2 per cent, and this gain would far outweigh the cost of organising the extra work. Even governments would gain. They would collect more taxes and save substantially on benefits, at the cost of some extra administration. One objection to this strategy is that improving the job chances of some people would worsen those of others. But over a 10-year period employment is determined not by demand but by the number of employable people. If more people are employable, more jobs will be created. This should be the starting point for Mr Delors' proposals. As usual, the guide to good policy is to spot the market failure and to correct it. Unemployment benefits are justified on equity grounds, but it is absurd to go on paying people to do nothing when employers would be willing to give them jobs at little extra cost to the state. When our leaders meet at the European summit, they should concentrate on removing these absurdities. The author is professor of economics at the London School of Eco-nomics</p>

Tests shall be performed by the manufacturer or shall be certified by an agency accredited for the purpose under part 1919 of this chapter. Test certificates shall be available for inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) (i) Wrought iron chains in constant use shall be annealed or normalized at intervals not exceeding six months.

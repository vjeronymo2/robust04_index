			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / In sickness and in health: Recession has put Brussels' hands-off approach to EC industry to the test European industry is in the grip of recession and wants government to do something about it. There are cries for help from makers of Spanish steel, Dutch trucks and Portuguese textiles. The EC's formal answer is clear: the old days of helping lame ducks and picking winners have passed. The best future for Europe's manufacturing lies in competition and the single market. But that policy was agreed in the prosperous late 1980s. Now that times are tough again, can Brussels hold the line? 'The next few months,' says a senior EC official, 'are decisive for the credibility of our policy.' The official line is enshrined in a document produced by the European Commission in 1990. The document has all the hallmarks of close co-operation between the EC industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, and Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner and a staunch opponent of interventionist industrial policy. It backed a 'hands-off' approach, based on firm rules and the creation of a stable environment for Community industry. Companies themselves would have to do most of the work to remain globally competitive. The Community would do its best to provide, in the jargon of the paper, the 'prerequisites, catalysts and accelerators' for growth. 'The aim is to make European industry effective,' says Mr Bangemann. 'To be there if there's a problem and to help industry to overcome the problem.' The argument is expanded by Mr Riccardo Perissich, director general for industry at the Commission. 'The only conviction I have is that there should be a large manufacturing base in Europe. That still is the main source of prosperity in our society. The fashionable ideas of the 1980s that we are going towards a post-industrial society are rubbish. 'But from that point onwards, I've never believed in sunset industries and advanced industries - things we should have and shouldn't have,' he says. 'It could be madness to invest too much in computer chips where one cannot be competitive. Textiles can be a fantastic industrial base, provided they are competitive. In the world we're living in, sectoral priorities are very dangerous.' But senior Commission officials concede that times are now harder. 'When the sun shines and we all feel warm, it's easy to renounce the policy of preferring one sector against another,' says one. Mr Perissich adds: 'The pressure to be defensive is increasing, there's no doubt about that. The 1990 document was written at a time when European economies were converging and there was good growth, and now we have neither.' In addition, threats by the new US administration to act tough in existing trade disputes - public procurement, steel and civil aircraft  - and suggestions that President Clinton may intervene to assist important strategic US industries are tempting EC member states, if not the Commission itself, to respond with a European brand of protectionism and interventionism. A separate danger is pointed out by Mr Karel Van Miert, who succeeded Sir Leon Brittan as competition commissioner in January. In the 1980s, he says, national industrial interests were increasingly subsumed in EC-wide policy. 'The tendency now, with the depressed economic situation and public opinion, is in the opposite direction. That means that more and more, regions or member states will themselves be under pressure. Enterprises are going broke, and state aids are being given in cases where it doesn't make any sense.' At the moment, Mr Bangemann and Mr Van Miert are preoccupied with the plight of the EC steel industry - hit by recession, cheap imports from non-EC countries and overcapacity. If an EC-wide plan to support the industry is to succeed, they must dissuade countries such as Spain, Italy and Germany from unilaterally subsidising Europe's least efficient steel producers without regard to the effect on the rest of the EC industry. Mr Van Miert has warned of a damaging 'state aids race' in the steel industry, which could be mimicked in other politically sensitive sectors such as cars and electronics. However, as another Brussels official says, there is a simple pressure the other way. 'The money isn't there,' he says. '(Funding for) industrial policy is being crowded out by the cost of servicing debt.' But if the picture looks like one of straightforward competition uncluttered by subsidy, it becomes less clear on inspection. As another senior official says: 'In Brussels you find little ideology, but you find a lot of interests.' Commissioner Van Miert says: 'If it were all left to competition inside and outside the Community, what would be left of agricultural policy? What would be left of shipbuilding? Nothing. What would be left of steel? Not very much. Of textiles? Not very much.' From a free market viewpoint, the obvious question is whether that matters. 'Of course it does,' the commissioner says brusquely. 'Do you really believe our competitors take that kind of view? Do the Japanese? Do the Americans? You should not be naive about it. I very much believe in competition, but not as a religion. You must observe a proper balance.' This raises a separate question. In Japan and increasingly in the US, it is taken for granted that certain strategic industries - the so-called technologies of the future - should receive special treatment. In the widest sense, this constitutes picking winners. Where does the Commission stand? Mr Perissich is carefully ambiguous. Take, for instance, electronics and telecommunications. 'It's difficult to have a very clear strategy of what Europe should do there. On the one hand, it would be madness for us to concentrate the enormous resources it would take to make sure that European industry becomes a player at the same level as the big American and Japanese competitors. It could be done, but the cost-effectiveness of the operation would be impossible to prove. At the same time, I am also open to the argument that in some elements of these technologies, there is a danger of dominance by oligopolies based elsewhere. They can then play a number of games - technological protection, predatory pricing - which distort the situation.' The same ambiguity informs his view of possible lame ducks. The European car industry, he says, has every chance of survival. But what if it did not? 'In political and social terms it's an enormously important industry. Psychologically too. If you told public opinion tomorrow that the car industry was going to disappear, they would look on that as a tremendous loss.' But, he adds: 'We gradually have to bring people to accept that if they stick to the narrow concept that there must be an Italian or a French or a German or a British car industry, then they are doomed. But that can only happen if we are both pragmatic and cautious.' All the same, it is hard to find a voice raised in Brussels these days in favour of old-style dirigisme. There seems to be universal commitment to the principle of the internal market, which officially opened for business on January 1 and is described by one official as 'the largest industrial policy move we've made for years'. There has been no attempt by member states to restore internal barriers to goods, services and capital, despite the fact that the pressures resulting from the single market have worsened the effects of recession. The shortage of cash is also a reality. According to Commission figures, subsidies to manufacturing in the Community have been gradually declining since 1986. Aid by individual states totalled Ecu36bn (Pounds 29bn) between 1988 and 1990, 9 per cent down on the preceding two years. 'Not only do we have more rules, not only do we operate those rules more transparently, there's also less money available,' says a senior competition official. That observation applies to both national and central policies. EC leaders agreed at the Edinburgh summit that the overall EC budget would rise to Ecu84.1bn by 1999, in 1992 prices. Of the total, the EC's common agricultural policy - the archetype of a flawed sectoral strategy - will receive Ecu38.4bn in 1999. Structural funds, spent on the poorest parts of the Community, will reach Ecu30bn. By contrast, the budget for 'internal actions' - including the funds earmarked for industry through R&amp;D, transport and infrastructure spending - will rise from Ecu3.94bn in 1993 to only Ecu5.1bn in 1999. Mr Bangemann, who has held the industry portfolio since 1989, claims a lack of funding has never hamstrung his strategy: 'My policy isn't based on money, it's based on policy,' he says. The December reshuffle of Commission portfolios gave him control over telecommunications and a substantial part of the Community's R&amp;D funding. In principle, Mr Bangemann wants telecommunications - including information technology - to spearhead EC industry policy in the next two years. The practical reality, however, is that his policy is only one of many competing for a dwindling pot of cash.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PRICE OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- State aid to                  ECU per person         ECU millions manufacturing sector             employed                            1986-88    1988-90     1986-80   1988-90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                      1,606      1,655       1,175     1,211 Denmark                        593        634         316       333 Germany                        994        984       7,869     7,865 Greece                       2,983      1,502       2,074     1,072 Spain                        1,749        936       4,491     2,499 France                       1,437      1,380       6,479     6,106 Ireland                      2,114      1,734         447       368 Italy                        2,139      2,175      10,760    11,027 Luxembourg                     988      1,270          37        48 Netherlands                  1,215      1,327       1,101     1,225 Portugal                       302        758         245       616 United Kingdom                 770        582       4,101     3,133 Total                        1,325      1,203      38,835    35,503  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission       * Annual averages 1988-90 and 1986-88  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

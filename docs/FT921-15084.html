			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (16): United European front looks doubtful - Electronics / The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners THE options for Europe's struggling electronics companies are closing fast. Collaboration on a grand scale to share research, development and marketing costs and present a united front against US and Far Eastern competition is looking increasingly doubtful either in semiconductors or computers. Siemens of Germany, for example, announced in mid-year that it intended to collaborate with International Business Machines of the US in the design and fabrication of the next generation of semiconductor memories. The deal effectively put paid to hopes that Europe's three large semiconductor makers - Siemens, Philips of The Netherlands and the French-Italian combination SGS-Thomson - could be persuaded to join forces to create a company with the resources to compete on a world scale. With the loss of the UK computer manufacturer ICL to Fujitsu of Japan last year and the sale by Philips of its minicomputer interests to Digital Equipment hopes finally died that a European-owned computer giant could be formed from the indigenous suppliers, Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France. The commercial logic behind such a merging of computer interests has always been doubtful. None of the European suppliers - with the possible exception of Siemens - has ever been strong enough to have a guaranteed future unaided. Now all are losing money heavily. Siemens, which fell two places in the FT500 to ninth, has seen a renaissance in computers in recent years. Two years ago it was making small but consistent profits. Its agreement to merge its computer interests with those of the loss-making Nixdorf Information Systems, however, resulted in a company awash with red ink. Returning the company to profit is likely to take much longer than chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig anticipated at the time of the merger. Groupe Bull lost more than FFr6bn (Dollars 1.11bn) last year and is not expected to return to the black for at least a further 12 months after drastic cost cutting and reorganisation - the 'Transformation Plan' put in place by chief executive Mr Francis Lorenz. Olivetti (dropped in ranking from 178th to 375th) slipped into loss this year after some years of steadily declining profitability. The company has been struggling, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Italian government to modify its employment laws to accelerate the rate at which it can cut staff. In the past few months Olivetti chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti, credited with having turned the moribund typewriter manufacturer into the leading European office systems company in the 1980s, has announced he is returning to take day-to-day control of the company in an effort to turn its fortunes. A conclusion must be that merging the interests of weak companies will only accelerate their decline. The wind has changed in Brussels, moreover. The European-owned group can expect little financial help from the Community. Industry ministers meeting in Brussels late last year promised support for Europe's electronics companies but shied away from endorsing direct subsidies. The Commission is looking hard at French proposals to provide FFr6bn to help Groupe Bull carry out its Transformation Plan and update its technology. ICL of the UK and Siemens of Germany are particularly critical of such subsidies which, they believe, distort competition. What the Commission is essentially promising is to create fair conditions in which European companies can compete at home and abroad. Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for the informatics industries, told a conference last year: 'We consider it essential that European companies have equitable conditions of competition and market access for products, investments and technologies. We strongly favour an open, multilateral international trade system . . . where necessary, however, the Community will have recourse to bilateral measures and will fall back on its custom regulations and trade policy instrument if equitable conditions are not achieved.' The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners. The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners. The merger between Fujitsu of Japan and the UK's ICL is one model. Its purchase by Fujitsu left it a European-based company, managed autonomously and with its research and development facilities intact. It has been consistently profitable over the past few years. The reason it seems not to have suffered the same fate as its European competitors is that its well-publicised problems in the 1970s forced it to slim down earlier and look for market niches where it could grow and prosper. It is now a world leader, for example, in retail systems. More than half its revenues come from software and computing services rather than hardware. Another model is Siemens's collaboration with IBM in semiconductors; the aim is to produce the next generation of silicon memory chips, each capable of storing 16m individual bits of information. Memory chips are a fundamental component of most electronic systems; furthermore, the discipline of manufacturing high capacity memory gives a company the skill to innovate in other kinds of semiconductors. SGS-Thomson, which is state-controlled, is still seeking a partner; this year it concluded a chip development agreement with GEC Plessey Semiconductors of the UK and another agreement with Philips, but there is now, seemingly, no hope of a merger with either the Dutch company or with Siemens. One possibility is a strategic alliance with a US company such as Hewlett-Packard, the electronics giant. Groupe Bull is talking to a number of potential US partners including IBM, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. The problems of the hardware sector, however, tend to distract attention from software and services where Europe is comparatively strong. Most companies in this sector are small. The only computing services company large enough to feature in the FT500 is Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France which, with revenues of more than Dollars 1.5bn, towers over its competitors. Computing services companies are moving towards systems integration, taking prime contractor role in large hardware and software projects. It is a role which requires size and capital. Mergers between Europe's computing services companies to achieve the critical mass for systems integration should ensure that CGS will not be alone in the ranking for long.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fresh optimism takes FT-SE to peak ANY expectations of a quiet move towards the end of the trading year in the London stock market seemed unfounded yesterday when the FT-SE Index rose to a new peak. The stock market was encouraged by fresh signs of economic optimism on both sides of the Atlantic. Although equity turnover was thin and share prices often led from the stock index futures sector, the UK market responded vigorously to reports of successful post-Christmas trading at the London stores and then to a sharp rise in the US Consumer Confidence Index. The FT-SE Index closed at a new high of 2,847.8, a shade below the day's best but showing a gain of 20.3 on the session. The advance came in two parts. Early trading saw the Index jump 15.4 to a whisker above the previous closing high of 2,842; this gain was quickly lost but the advance was resumed when the Dow Average gained 12 points in UK trading hours, reversing its fall of 6 as it took aboard the unexpected rise in the US Consumer Index. Once again, there was demand for the second line issues, which brought a gain of a further 12.4 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index for a close of 2,861.3, also at a new high, as was the FT-SE-A 350 at 1,388.9. However, traders warned that, with institutional activity at a low ebb until January 4 when the City returns to full activity, yesterday's gains often reflected thin turnover. Seaq volume of 287m shares, although finally a respectable total for what is effectively a holiday week in the stock market, rated well below an average session, and even more so by comparison with the volume levels of the past three months. Seaq volume for the half session on Christmas Eve was a mere 173.6m shares, worth only Pounds 422.1m in retail business, compared with daily retail totals of more than Pounds 1bn since sterling quit the ERM network. Reports of the busy opening to the winter sales season at the big UK store groups brought widespread gains in leading names in the sector. The final upswing, however, owed more to the recovery in selected blue chip internationals, as the dollar and Wall Street gained ground.</p>

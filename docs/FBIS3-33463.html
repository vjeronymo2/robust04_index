Cardinal Miguel Obando was viewed favorably by 71 percent of  the respondents, followed closely by Sandinist leader Dr. Sergio  Ramirez Mercado with 66.4 percent.    Sixty-five percent of the 697 persons polled by M&amp;R  Consultores had a favorable opinion of the president of the  republic, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.    "What do you think of these well-known figures?" the  pollsters asked, going down a list of political, religious, and  business leaders.    In the political sphere, 47.7 percent of the respondents had  a favorable view of the secretary general of the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front], Daniel Ortega, while 48.7 percent  had an unfavorable opinion of him.    General Humberto Ortega, the chief of the EPS [Sandinist  People's Army], was regarded favorably by 44.5 percent of the  697 respondents and unfavorably by 50.4 percent.    In addition, 54.3 percent described the standing of  Managua's  mayor, Arnoldo Aleman, as "very good" or "good," while 40.8  percent said it was "poor" or "very poor."    According to M&amp;R experts, the margin of error of this  poll is  just 4 percent, which is acceptable for this kind of survey.  <H5>  Ranking of Politicians and Deputies </H5>   "Who was the best politician?" was another question, and  27.3  percent replied "no one." Some 14.3 percent chose Daniel Ortega;  11.5 percent Arnoldo Aleman; 6.6 percent Antonio Lacayo; and 5.5  percent Sergio Ramirez.    Just 1.4 percent leaned towards Alfredo Cesar; 0.6 percent  chose Ramiro Gurdian; 0.3 percent Moises Hassan; 0.3 percent  Francisco Mayorga, and 0.1 percent Luis Sanchez.    In answer to the question "Who was the best deputy in 1993?"  a significant 22.5 percent said "no one," while 35.7 percent  said they were "not sure."    In any case, Sergio Ramirez, the deputy who heads the  Sandinist bloc, did the best in this regard, being so regarded  by 13.8 percent of the respondents. He was followed by Alfredo  Cesar with 5 percent, Miriam Arguello with 2.9 percent, and  William Ramirez with 1.6 percent.    Another question was "Who was the outstanding woman of  1993?"

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (20): Golden combination shines - Profile: CMB Toyo Glass MR DAVID LONG has little patience for those who have given up on Nigeria. 'This place,' he says, 'will go on forever, because it's got a massive population, and it's got oil. Nigeria will always have problems, but it will never go bust.' His confidence is not without foundation. As chief executive of CMB Toyo Glass, he heads a company that dominates the local glass packaging market and recorded pre-tax profits in the year to March 1992 of N120m. There are, Mr Long points out, more than 100m Nigerians, many of whom buy soft drinks or beer, most of whom need glasses for their homes and bottles for their medicines. It is a huge market of which CMB has a 65 per cent share, supplying bottles to, among others, Guinness, Pepsi, Seven-Up, Limca, Glaxo, PZ Industries and Beecham. Furthermore, there is growing regional potential. In three years, exports to 15 countries - including Ghana, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon - have risen from 3 per cent of turnover to 12 per cent. The export drive has been helped by the depreciation of the naira, the uncompetitive level of the CFA franc and the collapse of production in such countries as Liberia and Zaire. Although the company pays well by Nigerian standards, labour costs - at 4 per cent of turnover - remain low in comparison with European, and even African, competitors. CMB benefits from what one Lagos banker calls the 'golden combination' of powerful Nigerian shareholders, who hold a 40 per cent stake, and a multinational backer, CarnaudMetalbox - Europe's largest packaging group and a 53.48 per cent shareholder. The remaining 6.52 per cent is held by Toyo Glass Company of Japan, CMB's technical adviser until 1991 when Rockware of the UK took over. Although Toyo has pulled out, Japanese influence remains - most notably in the blue overalls worn by all members of staff, including the managing director. The company invests heavily in training, which has raised productivity fivefold over three years. An indication of its confidence came with last year's acquisition of two furnaces, bringing its total to five. The deal, financed through a N150m syndicated loan organised by First City Merchant Bank, will enable CMB to increase output by 50 per cent. Production of smaller bottles will move to the new furnaces, further improving efficiency at Agbara. Greater capacity will allow CMB to expand exports without neglecting the local market. In 1990, it set up a separate export department, largely in response to the need for scarce foreign exchange required to meet the Dollars 750,000 monthly spare parts bill. Naira devaluation has been a two-edged sword, raising the cost of imported machinery and inputs, but sharpening the potential to earn hard currency through exports. Not all is rosy. Agbara, where CMB occupies a 45-acre site, is the best industrial estate in the country. Yet it has no telephone links and CMB has had to develop its own 'massive' infrastructure from scratch, installing generators, transformers and even a water treatment plant. Uncertainty over the price of foreign exchange makes planning difficult, particularly in a capital intensive industry where furnaces have to be regularly rebuilt. But Mr Long remains undaunted. His philosophy is to 'call the problems opportunities, look ahead and be quick to react'. The company is already aiming to raise turnover in the coming year by 67 per cent, with target sales of at least N2bn by 1997. Given CMB's track record, such ambitions are not beyond reach.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Quantum leap forward / Assessing the strategy behind Soros's move When markets move purely on the basis of one man's word and reputation, cui bono and caveat emptor are usually sound maxims for those looking on. The rise and fall of British investment guru Jim Slater in the 1970s, or the mood swings of Henry Kaufman's following on Wall Street in the 1980s, offer two obvious cautionary tales. Yet George Soros, founder of the offshore Quantum Fund, is no ordinary guru; and while news of his move to invest in UK commercial property set property shares abuzz yesterday, prices in the direct property market are less susceptible to exhortation than in the stock market. Nor is it in Soros's interest to whip up excitement in a market where he has yet to invest his fund's money. Soros's fame, or notoriety, stems in Britain from the vast profits that he made from speculating against sterling before its exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September. Latterly, his purchase of a stake in Newmont Mining from Sir James Goldsmith and others caused a stir in the hitherto depressed gold market. Yet the Quantum Fund has been making waves in global markets for very much longer. It made a big killing in currency after Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to assist the fall of the dollar at the Plaza meeting in 1985. It then lost a fortune in the crash of October 1987. The decision to link up with John Ritblat's British Land - unquestionably a coup for the British property entrepreneur - is not the first indication from the Quantum Fund of interest in real estate. In February Soros teamed up with Paul Reichmann, of the insolvent Olympia &amp; York property group, to invest in North American real estate. Taken together with the move into gold, this has given rise to speculation that Soros is worried about inflation. In view of the weakness of the global economy, and the total failure of both gold and property to provide a hedge against inflation over the past decade, this seems rather implausible. A simpler explanation might be that both markets have been heavily depressed, while many equity and bond markets have been run up to dizzy heights. The question this time is whether the judgment of Soros is vintage '85 or '87. Certainly the case for property in the US and UK looks compelling. Economic recovery in both countries, which holds the key to a reduction in the present oversupply of real estate, is taking place ahead of continental Europe and Japan. Yields - the income expressed as a percentage of the price  -are at historically high levels. While many British properties are let at rents well in excess of current market values, the structure of the old-style British institutional lease with upwards-only rent reviews provides protection where the tenant is of high quality. While such leases are unavailable on many new developments, they continue to provide what amounts to a financially engineered income stream on much of the existing stock of offices, shops and industrial premises. In fact, Soros already has some indirect experience of the British property market. He invested in a consortium that made a disastrous purchase of property group Imry at the peak of the market in 1989. But this was a small stake, and the big loser from the deal was the bank that provided the finance, Barclays. The chips in the present transaction are bigger and it remains to be seen how a hedge fund such as Quantum, whose modus operandi is based on a swift kill in liquid markets, adapts to the slower pace of the much less liquid property market and to the habits of its joint venture partners. But Soros is not a man to underestimate - witness his impressive capacity for recycling the British taxpayers' money to eastern Europe. No doubt the recent devaluation of the peseta will have yielded a similar bonus for the eastern Europeans. It will be harder to extract such profits from bricks and mortar. Indeed, property is notoriously difficult to acquire, except when no one else wants it. But that is invariably the best time to buy. The long neglect of real estate by British investment institutions is a strong indication that Soros, infallible or otherwise, has got his timing right.</p>

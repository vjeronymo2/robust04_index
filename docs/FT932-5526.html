			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: The Sun seems to have what it wants in Europe Sir, It is useful to have The Sun's black propaganda against the European Community ('Mass trick treaty', May 1) set out in concise form since it is much easier to answer: Under the Maastricht treaty, the elected European parliament has to vote for the president of the European Commission and for the commissioners so that they are as accountable to an elected body as our national governments. The elected British parliament has had no sovereignty over the key factors in the British economy for years now. When was it last consulted about the exchange rate change? The Sun's readers want a note with the Queen's head on it called a pound - don't we all? But the question is, what is it worth? Between the time it was tied to the dollar (1972) and the time it was tied again to the European Monetary System (1992), it has lost nearly nine-tenths of its value. Was the House of Commons responsible for that? In the brief time we were linked, interest rates have come down by a third and inflation by half. The Maastricht treaty removes the dependence of the EMS on the D-Mark by giving all countries equal power - exactly what The Sun seems to want. Among our partners in the Community, we have fought our last three European wars in alliance with the French, who were in from the beginning, unlike the US which arrived a bit late the last two times. We have at least this in common with the Greeks: our Queen married a Greek prince. We are both victims of sailors and in the last century and the last war we did our best to restore and to protect the democracy to which we are both dedicated. It is not possible to have a free trade area without the political clout to protect it - to reform agriculture, to protect the passage of exports and put right all the wrongs about which The Sun complains. Finally, if we can stand shoulder to shoulder in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with foreign commanders, what is the problem? Or is it that Nato is OK because the commander in chief is an American - and so is the owner of The Sun? Fred Catherwood, Shire Hall, Castle Hill, Cambridge CB3 0AW</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WSP to merge with AB Consulting WSP HOLDINGS and AB Consulting, two consulting engineering companies, are to merge to form an enlarged group worth about Pounds 9.8m. The renamed WSP Group will have a combined turnover of more than Pounds 20m. Mr Malcolm Paul, finance director on the new board, said that some 80 per cent of its business would come from buildings-oriented consulting and the balance from science and environmental services, the non-buildings side which the combined group would be keen to expand. The merger is to be effected through the recommended offer by WSP for all the issued share capital of ABC, on the basis of six new WSP shares for every five ABC shares. This values ABC at about Pounds 5.3m. The WSP board, advised by Rea Brothers, is unanimously recommending its shareholders to approve the merger and the ABC board, advised by Albert E Sharp, unanimously recommends acceptance. Both have irrevocably undertaken to do so in respect of their own shareholdings. In ABC's case this represents about 11.2 per cent of the equity. Mr Paul said that the combined group would be in 'the top one or two consulting engineers in building structures', but that it would not be big on the civil engineering side. However, the new board 'envisaged moves' in that direction. He said WSP felt the industry was 'right at the bottom of the recession' and the merger 'was sensible in view of the current market place'. The merger would result in a substantial and immediate reduction in overheads. No technical or engineering jobs would be lost, but between 10 and 15 administrative posts would go. Duplicated offices would be closed and the group's buying powers would increase. In 1992 WSP made pre-tax profits of Pounds 560,000 on turnover of Pounds 10m. For the year to April 30, ABC reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.15m on turnover of Pounds 11m.</p>

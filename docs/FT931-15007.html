			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Peru to sign IMF letter of intent PERU, apparently abandoning plans to extract significant concessions from the International Monetary Fund, is expected to sign today in Washington an IMF letter of intent to frame economic policy until 1995. This, and the subsequent formation of a 'support group' of friendly governments to bridge debt repayments to the multilateral lending organisations, will mean that 'the reinsertion of Peru into the international financial community is definitive,' according to President Alberto Fujimori. Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, who succeeded Mr Carlos Bolona last week, is not expected to announce any significant concessions in the programme negotiated by his predecessor last year. This is despite domestic demands for increased spending, and a personal plea in mid-December from Mr Fujimori to Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, that Peru should be allowed greater economic flexibility this year. The realisation that the imminent US administration handover may not improve Peru's negotiating position seems to have lent urgency to the new team's willingness to sign. Agreement with the IMF is a prerequisite for looming Peruvian negotiations with the Paris Club, and for rescheduling arrears with the World Bank and private banks. It is hoped to resolve Peru's immediate but complex arrears position by paying off Dollars 970m owing to the World Bank through a one-day bridging loan from Citibank. Peru would then use Dollars 1bn in fresh funds from the World Bank to repay Citibank. Signature of the letter of intent will also allow the IMF's extended fund facility to come into operation. Short-term finance from friendly governments will permit the clearing of Dollars 900m in IMF arrears.</p>

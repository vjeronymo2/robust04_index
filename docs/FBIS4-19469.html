			<p>BFN     [Text] Late last night vandals broke the windows of an  all-girls school close to the Greek school in Istanbul and the  Ecumenical Patriarch's quarters at Fanari. This incident is one  of a series of others that have occurred recently against the  Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul.    Threatening slogans were written on the walls of the  Patriarchate and there were repeated attempts to set fires.  Replying to a question on whether the government made any  representations on the attack against the all-girl school at  Fanari, Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the  government always makes the necessary diplomatic  representations. We do not know to what extent official Turkish  policy is reflected in these recent events. Venizelos repeated  that Turkey should prove that it has some kind of relation to  what is called European civilization.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Minister warns about navy order MR JONATHAN Aitken, the defence procurement minister, was warned yesterday about the future of Swan Hunter. The Tyneside shipbuilder, which has a blank order book after next year, is dependent on its bid for a Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier - a Pounds 170m order which may be shelved because of financial pressures on the defence budget. Mr Aitken, who was visiting Swan Hunter to see work in progress, said that the government, now studying bids for the Landing Platform Helicopter vessel, had taken the carrier into account in drawing up its future defence budget. However, he he warned that a final decision depended on available resources. He added: 'No minister can give a guarantee but we are proceeding in good faith.' A decision will be made by the autumn. Without the order Swan Hunter, now reducing its workforce by 1,400 to 2,200, looks set to close. Campaigning by management, unions and Tyneside MPs has left ministers well aware of the impact that the closure of Swan Hunter would have on Tyneside's economy and morale. Britain has made preliminary contacts with Canada on the possible transfer of the Royal Navy's latest diesel-powered patrol submarines, David White writes. The move would be part of a plan to find equipment savings to match the Pounds 1bn cut decided last November in the UK defence budget over the next two financial years. The four new Upholder class submarines have cost the MoD about Pounds 800m. The defence ministry said yesterday no decision had been taken on whether to dispose of them. According to the magazine Jane's Defence Weekly, Canada would favour a leasing arrangement while the UK would prefer an outright sale. The last of the submarines, HMS Unicorn, built at the VSEL group's Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, is undergoing trials. Under its Options for Change programme, the MoD decided against building any more of the boats.</p>

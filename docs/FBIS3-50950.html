			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Fight for Equality and Against </F> Egalitarianism"]    [Text] The major achievement of our Socialist revolution is  equality of opportunity, rights, and duties for all citizens.  This has wiped out a past in which a person came into the world  with his destiny already laid out for him. A person was born  either as a have or have-not, black or white, man or woman, and  from that moment on, each individual was condemned to patterns  of inequality from which only a few managed to escape with great  difficulty. The revolution, after socializing the basic means of  production, established the right to be born in a society that  ensures access to education and health care services to all  people. These are vital features enabling each individual to  have the same opportunities to develop his physical and mental  capabilities. Equality is not a gift from heaven, it is not a  gift of nature; it is the result of a just distribution of the  resources society produces through labor.    Viewed in this way, equality is not sustainable if it does  not become a stimulus to increased and improved production. In  other words, equality is not only a fine ideal of humanism; it  must also be a condition for economic development.    If, today, Cuba can successfully meet the challenge of  moving  its economy into the changed world we are living in, this will  largely be due to the fact that equality of access to education,  health care, and work have, during all these years, created  invaluable human resources. This is made up not only of a strong  work force with a high educational level, but it is also  composed of a pool of educated people unmatched in any other  country with a similar level of development. One of the most  valuable treasures of the revolution is the love for the ideals  of justice and equality that the revolution planted in the  people, especially in the young people who today constitute the  majority of the nation.    But during all these years, we must admit, our national  consciousness has not always discerned with proper clarity the  limits between equality and egalitarianism.    We have frequently created rights of equality exceeding the  nation's real economic possibilities; often practice has  converted into egalitarianism an idea originally intended to  stimulate production and efficiency based on differences in  earnings. This lack of precise and realistic limits between  equality and egalitarianism may be considered one of the  deep-seated causes of our imperfect application of the socialist  principle of distribution to each, in terms of both quantity and  quality, according to his contribution. The full application of  that principle, the foundation not only of the economy but of  all true ethics and justice in socialist society, is a historic  goal of the workers and their union movement.    Labor must be the leveling force for measuring each  citizen's  merit, prestige, and standard of living in a society of workers.  In expressing these aspirations, we do not forget that at the  present time when, for reasons we all know too well, the  nation's economy is experiencing a critical situation, the most  just and rational thing to do is to share these difficulties  among all the Cuban people, thus in fact reducing the margin of  differentiation based on each person's contribution to society.    Controlled, equitable, and rationed distribution, maximum  support for employment, and the ample use of price subsidies  have helped to save hundreds of thousands of Cubans from  distress, bolstering our capacity for resistance and  strengthening our national unity.    We Cuban workers fully support this profoundly human and  revolutionary policy, but at the same time we must create an  awareness that each step toward economic recovery the country  takes must be accompanied by a revitalization of the role of  salaries and their influence on individual consumption. We  support the idea that as internal financial order and  equilibrium are restored, we must intensify the use of salary  and monetary gradations, as well as other material and moral  incentives. This does not contradict, but reaffirms, socialist  ideology. We believe payment for work must take into account the  importance of the particular economic activity in order to  stimulate areas and sectors that contribute most to the nation  at a given moment. We believe that salary decisions to be made  in the future should be based on the particular features of each  geographic area and provide the greatest incentives for the  least attractive but most essential jobs for the needs of  specific goods or services.    We feel that in the future, decisions on the best rates,  forms, and systems of payment should be more flexible and, as a  rule, should be made in each entity. This must be accompanied  with strict control of the use of the base salary and its  relation to the goods or services made in terms of quantity,  selection, and quality.    Finally, we maintain that wherever a rigorous managerial  climate and labor and technological discipline exist and achieve  improved economic results, the workers should be appropriately  rewarded. In this way, we will work to establish the principle  deeply held by our workers that the inequality to be rejected is  not that which differentiates well earned incomes, but equality  based on equal treatment for persons of different behavior and  ability in their work.</p>

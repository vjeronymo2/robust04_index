			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / EU close to energy deal EU energy ministers edged closer to an agreement on opening Europe's energy networks to competition yesterday, but there will be no final decision on how to proceed until at least the middle of next year. At a meeting in Brussels, ministers agreed to investigate whether a French proposal for liberalising energy markets would bring the same benefits to consumers and industry as the Commission's plans for allowing power companies access to other countries' transmission systems, so-called negotiated third party access. Although the idea of a study looks like yet another stalling tactic, it at least breaks the deadlock that has prevailed on energy liberalisation for two years. Under the French proposal for liberalisation - known as the 'single buyer' proposal - power companies would negotiate access to transmission systems in other member states via an operator in the buyer's country. The operator would be responsible for running the system and meeting new demand for electricity. The idea was criticised earlier this week by Mr Karel Van Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition policy, who argued that it would allow power companies in certain member states to preserve a monopoly on imports and exports.</p>

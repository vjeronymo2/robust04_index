			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PRICE COBB AWARDED 97-LAP VICTORY  </P> <P> The International Motor Sports Assn. ruled today that Price Cobb of Evergreen,  Colo., won Sunday's G. I. Joe's Camel Gran Prix because he was leading when the  starter mistakenly waved the checkered flag three laps too soon.  </P> <P> "While the starter could give no reason for doing it and it was definitely  erroneous, it still was a checkered flag," association spokesman Adam Saal  said.  </P> <P> Starter David Long waved the flag at the end of the 94th lap of what was  supposed to be a 97-lap race at Portland International Raceway.  </P> <P> Cobb said he backed off slightly after he saw the flag, then started racing  again. Australian Geoff Brabham took the lead from Cobb on the final turn of  lap 96, finished first and was declared the provisional winner.  </P> <P> Cobb filed a protest, and it was upheld by acting race director Cameron  Argetsinger.  </P></p>

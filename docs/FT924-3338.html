			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Indian forces rout militants at mosque INDIAN police early today stormed a disputed site in Ayodhya where thousands of Hindu militants destroyed an ancient mosque on Sunday. Four battalions, numbering 5,000 police, and a rapid action commando force used tear gas and rubber bullets but there were no casualties. They met little resistance although militants stoned them as they approached. Delhi decided on a resolute show of force after the destruction of the mosque, in northern India, provoked communal violence throughout the country in which at least 220 people were killed. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, was due to make a statement in parliament this morning. He yesterday faced intense criticism for his failure to protect the mosque at a weekend rally called by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the main opposition party. At dawn today the government arrested the leader of the BJP, Mr LK Advani, who yesterday took responsibility for the assault and resigned as parliamentary opposition leader. The officer in charge of the Ayodhya operation, Mr PN Ramakrishnan, said: 'The boys have been very fast and very smart. We simply scared them.' The police then secured control of the town itself and despatched the militants on buses and trucks to the nearby city of Lucknow. There had been fears of a bloody confrontation with the estimated 50,000 extremists who had seized the sacred Hindu site, where a mosque was built in the 16th century. The government was urged yesterday to ban militant religious organisations, including the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the extremist groups which support the BJP. Despite demands from MPs from other opposition parties for Mr Rao's resignation, it seemed that the ruling Congress (I) party would rally around the prime minister for the sake of stability. Congress blamed the BJP for the assault and condemned it as 'the greatest political tragedy which has overtaken the nation since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi'. Protests from abroad included condemnation from Pakistan, where the government called a nationwide strike for today. Moslem MPs urged the government to rebuild the mosque as a shrine to national reconciliation. They were supported by many Congress MPs. However, it was difficult to see how it could be rebuilt in the face of intense Hindu opposition. Across India, the army was deployed and curfews imposed in several areas as communal riots swept through almost every state, and the toll of victims - mainly Moslems - mounted rapidly. In Bombay more than 40 people died in clashes involving 10,000 protesters. There was also violence in Ahmedabad, New Delhi and the walled city of Jaipur. Calcutta was paralysed by a strike called by trade unionists. Tensions spilled over during the day to India's predominantly Moslem neighbours, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

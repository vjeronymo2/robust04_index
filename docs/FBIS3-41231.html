Reports sent to the Federal Judicial Police Directorate,  headed by Commander Adrian Carrera, and to the force's  operational directorate, under Victor Patino Esquivel, indicate  that the operations took place in nine of the federation's  states. A total of 20 presumed drug traffickers were captured,  and nine automotive vehicles used to transport the drugs were  seized as well.    The federal detectives foiled the purchase and sale  transaction involving 104 kg and 150 grams of pure cocaine, in  Tamaulipas State, following the arrest of Daniel Salinas  Villarreal, who was driving a sedan type car with state of Texas  plates. [passage omitted]    The department's agency in Michoacan State reported the  largest confiscation of cannabis indica, after the capture of  five presumed drug dealers in the town of Tepaltepec, with one  ton and 175 kg of that drug in their possession. The marijuana  was located in what is known as a collection center, on Jalisco  and Felipe Carrillo Puerto Streets. Confiscated on that site  were seven hydraulic jacks, presses, roles of plastic adhesive,  and automotive vehicles used to transport drugs. Manuel Ramirez  Cortes, Manuel Ramirez Barajas, Arnoldo Cortes Magana, Arturo  Cravez Garcia, and Carlos Cruz Ruelas, found engaged in  compacting marijuana, were arrested. [passage omitted]</p>

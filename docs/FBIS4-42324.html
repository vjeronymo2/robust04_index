			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennaro Schettino: "Under 61? Lower Pension"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- You are under 61 and nonetheless want to  quit work because you have contributed for the necessary number  of years. OK, go ahead, but know that you will have a reduced  pension. And the earlier you retire before pensionable age, the  greater the cut. This is one proposal in the anti-deficit  package which the Treasury technicians are studying with a view  to the 1995 budget.    Other measures under study, largely concentrated on social  security, include postponing the revaluation of pensions from  November to January and a one percentage point increase in  employees' and self-employed persons' contributions. But the  package also contains a ceiling on redundancy fund payments and  a cut in disability compensation payments to people above a  minimum income.    With these measures the government wants to run for cover in  the fight against the deficit. Even now, next year's deficit,  according to the Public Accounting Office's latest estimates,  could be pointing toward 180 trillion lire, if we include the 13  trillion for financing the renewal of public contracts and all  the unexpected expenditures, not the least of which is the 800  billion in medical taxes to be paid back to taxpayers. Only  yesterday National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini stated  that the 85,000 lire decree [which recently imposed a 85,000  lire health tax across the board] would have to be allowed to  lapse.    Overall, the maneuver which the Treasury technicians intend  proposing involves at least 35 trillion lire. The aim is to  block the 1995 need to 145 trillion. And here the first problem  arises, because the initial objective was not 145 but 128  trillion, and it is not clear what the government will do to  achieve its target of halting the growth of indebtedness as a  proportion of gross domestic product.    The second question is how it will succeed in finding these  35 trillion lire. The menu of proposals is still under study,  but the Accounting Office has already prepared a list of  measures. The heart of the proposals involves drastic surgery  of the social security system. The starting point is the INPS'  [National Agency for Social Security] need for up to an  estimated 84-85 trillion lire next year, not taking into account  the Constitutional Court ruling on reversibility pensions for  surviving dependents, which could cost the state as much as 8  trillion.    In its document, the Accounting Office warns in peremptory  tones that "a reform of the pensions system which will achieve a  containment of expenses immediately or in the short term and  which can safeguard the existing level of benefits is  practically impossible." What should be done then? The  Treasury technicians are moving along two lines.    The first aims at obtaining immediate reductions in  expenditures. The suggested measures are essentially three:  First, the Accounting Office is suggesting a "ceiling" on  ordinary redundancy fund payments in the amount "currently  provided for by the extraordinary interventions." It then goes  on to propose "unifying contribution rates for the Employees'  Pension Fund at 35.50 percent." And finally, it proposes  increasing employees' and self-employed persons' contributions  by one percentage point. This final point is expected to bring  in 3,600 billion lire of additional income.    The second line of anti-deficit measures provides for  "suitable interventions to confront, structurally and at the  financial level, the greater demands of the pensioner sector."  As shown earlier, the Treasury technicians are considering  postponing "the coming into effect of the pension revaluation  from 1 November to 1 January of each year." This would produce  cost savings of 1,500 billion lire. The second point of attack  consists of retirement pensions in the private sector. The idea  is to "reduce the pension amount in proportion to the number of  years in which the person takes retirement prior to old age  pension age." This measure, if approved, would produce savings  of some 600-700 billion a year in the coming year. How would  this cut work? Let us take a worker aged 56. Even if he has  paid 35 years of contributions, his pension would be cut by 10  percent, by two percentage points for every year he falls short  of the present pension age (61 for men).</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Australian budget deficit down Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, said yesterday that the government's budget deficit for the 1994-95 financial year could turn out to be lower than the ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) forecast. He also said Australia's economy was growing at an underlying rate of about 5 per cent, although drought was depressing the final result. The government has been criticised for running too loose a fiscal policy, and using higher tax receipts from the faster-than-expected economic recovery to tackle issues such as long-term unemployment at the expense of pruning the government deficit. Government forecasts have suggested that the country will not be in surplus until the late 1990s. Financial markets have also been sceptical about the country's inflation outlook, particularly in the light of some large wage claims recently.</p>

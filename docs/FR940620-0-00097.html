			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.31.9(3) includes a provision for equivalent facilitation which permits the use of portable devices, in lieu of permanently installed public TTYs, if the portable device is readily available to users. This provision ensures equal access, and allows the entity greater flexibility in selecting a secure and cost effective method of providing access. The exemption for secured areas from the requirement of shelves and outlets has been retained since a detached shelf and an electrical outlet may be security hazards in detention and correctional facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM asked whether the existing scoping requirements for TTYs in ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(ii) which covers stadiums, arenas, convention centers, hotels with a convention center and covered malls, and ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iii) which covers emergency, recovery and waiting rooms in hospitals, are sufficient with respect to TTYs in State and local government facilities. Commenters generally supported the existing ADAAG requirements for State and local government facilities. Other commenters stated that the requirement would be sufficient if a TTY is also required on each floor level that has public pay telephones. A few commenters stated that ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c) (ii) and (iii) are too restrictive for State and local government facilities. Commenters did not suggest any alternative scoping requirements or provide justification data for alternative scoping. A few commenters asked that the rule clarify whether stadiums, arenas, convention centers, hotels with a convention center, covered malls, areas serving a hospital emergency room, a hospital recovery room or a hospital waiting room which are owned or operated by State or local government entities are subject to the same requirements as the facilities of private entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(ii) provides that stadiums, arenas, convention centers, covered malls and hotels with a convention center subject to title III of the ADA shall provide at least one public TTY in the facility if a public pay telephone is provided. Where stadiums, arenas, and convention centers are subject to title II of the ADA, at least one public TTY on each floor level having a public pay telephone shall be provided. ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(c)(iii) requires that if a public pay telephone is provided at areas serving hospital emergency, recovery or waiting rooms, then at least one public TTY shall be provided at each such location. This requirement includes those facilities which are subject to titles II or III of the ADA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM asked whether there are other specific State and local government buildings which should be required to have a public TTY. The NPRM also asked whether all State and local government facilities should be required to provide a public TTY if an interior public pay telephone is available. Over half of the commenters requested that public facilities be equipped with a public TTY whenever a public pay telephone is available. Several commenters recommended that each floor and/or pay phone location be equipped with a public TTY. A few commenters requested that a public TTY be required in schools, dormitories, student unions, libraries and State archives. Many of these commenters expressed concern that there is a greater need for telecommunication access in the public sector than in the private sector because public entities are frequented on a daily basis by the general public. Some of the commenters noted that public TTY technology has recently improved and is now available at a much lower cost. Commenters reported similar improvements for portable TTYs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over half of the commenters requested that public TTYs be provided in all State and local government facilities. Without a public TTY, an individual with a hearing impairment or speech impairment, would not be able to make the important calls others make from public telephones in State and local government facilities. The intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act is to provide the accessibility necessary to enable every individual to be independent. For these reasons, a requirement has been added to ADAAG at 4.1.3(17)(c)(iv) that at least one interior public TTY be provided in a public use area of a State or local government facility when an interior public telephone is provided in a public use area of that facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM asked whether the scoping for public TTYs should take into account the size of buildings or facilities. Some commenters suggested that scoping be based on the size of the facility, but others stated that scoping should take building occupancy, quantity and dispersion of public telephones, or program accessibility into account. The various suggestions included providing public TTYs at a ratio of 1 per 4 telephones, or one per each 1,000 building occupants, whichever is greater; providing public TTYs at a ratio of 1 per 3 telephones; and requiring at least 10 percent of all public telephones, but not less than one to be equipped with a TTY. A number of commenters requested that directional signage for public TTYs be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters' recommendations varied as to which factors should be taken into account to determine scoping. Therefore, no provisions based on building or facility size have been included. Directional signage is required by ADAAG 4.30.7(3). Although commenters recommended that scoping provisions be based on program access, the guidelines do not address program access, but only new construction and alterations of buildings and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Engineering warms to minimum wage Four out of 10 UK engineering companies support the introduction of a statutory minimum wage, says a survey from the Engineering Employers Federation. Although just over half those polled opposed the idea, the level of support among 100 engineering business leaders is surprisingly high. A similar number believed a minimum wage would have no effect on unemployment levels, while 51 per cent said the jobless total would rise. More predictably, two-thirds of companies said that accepting the provisions of the European Union's social chapter would lead to substantial job losses in the UK. The results are contained in the EEF Manufacturing Matters Survey, conducted in the approach to today's Manufacturing Matters conference in London. More than half of those polled said short-termism by the government had con-tributed to the decline in British industry in the past decade. Government attitudes were blamed by 58 per cent of companies in the survey, a slightly higher proportion than those blaming short-termism among management or in the City, or the 'roller-coaster economy' and high interest rates. Mr Graham Mackenzie, the EEF's director-general, said: 'This survey reinforces concern among engineering businesses that a longer-term strategic outlook is needed from government, industry and the City if UK manufacturing is to be competitive.' The poll was sponsored by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, and Lloyds Bank Commercial Service. Employers who recruit permanent staff from the unemployed register should be exempt for a period from paying national insurance contributions as a stimulus to help the long-term jobless back into work, Robert Taylor writes. This is the key proposal published today by the EEF in its response to the white paper on competitiveness. Mr Mackenzie said: 'I believe this kind of incentive would spur on the movement of people back to work.' The response is critical of the white paper. 'It does not provide the strategic vision which the EEF had been hoping for,' it says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Long lines of tanker trucks carrying fuel have  formed at the Kakavyia border checkpoint with Albania following  the recent Finance Ministry decision to allow only five tanker  trucks from Kakavyia and one from the checkpoint at  Kristallopiyi to enter Albania. The Finance Ministry made its  decision after the number of tanker trucks crossing the border  to Albania increased following the adoption of the measures  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM]. There are many signs that these trucks used  Albanian territory as a route to Skopje. According to the  Finance Ministry decision, Albania's daily fuel needs are fully  covered by the six tanker trucks that go through every day.</p>

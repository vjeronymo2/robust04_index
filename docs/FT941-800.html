			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / France wins new EU parliament France is set to win its battle to build a new chamber for the European parliament in Strasbourg. An agreement is expected to be endorsed this week by the Strasbourg city council and the parliament's bureau, ending a dispute which threatened to disrupt the Euro-elections in June. The French government had blocked an agreed increase in the number of MEPs from 518 to 567, mainly to take account of German unification, until the parliament signed a lease on a new building in Strasbourg. The tactic upset the Bonn government, but Paris was worried that the parliament, the only European Union institution on French soil, was gradually drifting away to Brussels, the site for the European Commission and the council of ministers. Critics argue that the proposed building, which could cost up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 342.4m), is redundant. MEPs have only just moved into an expensive new home in Brussels, and most would prefer to work in the Belgian capital rather than commute once a month to Strasbourg. The new building will be financed by state and city-backed loans, with the parliament reimbursing the bulk of the money in rent over 20 years.</p>

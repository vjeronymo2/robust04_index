			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich and </F> Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- "The Partnership for  Peace" plan approved by NATO leaders at the recent meeting in  Brussels will be "attentively studied" in Russia with the focus  laid on boosting relations with NATO, Russian Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Grigory Karasin told a briefing on Wednesday.    He added that the plan is an alternative to the expansion of  NATO which East European nations want to join. "An approach has  been selected which is oriented towards the development of  partnership relations and practical cooperation with all  European CSCE member-states, including in the East of the  continent, and which provides equal possibilities for all  potential partners," Karasin said.    Russia plans to hold a detailed exchange of opinions with  all  European states on the results of the NATO meeting in Brussels  in order "to determine the optimal ways of maintaining a truly  pan-European cooperation in the field of stability and  security," according to the spokesman who added that prospects  of such cooperation will be discused during the Russian-U.S.  summit.    Karasin however explained that "the Russian-U.S. dialogue on  the issue has nothing in common with any separate agreements  between the two powers." This is only a search for such  instruments of strengthening the European stability which would  reliably guarantee the interests of all European states without  exclusions, regardless of their size, georgraphic situation,  economic or military potential."</p>

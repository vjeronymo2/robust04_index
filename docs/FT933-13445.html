			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Business Technology Business Technology Group, which sells and services photocopier and facsimile machines, vending and communication equipment, is raising Pounds 2.2m net through a 5-for-4 rights issue at 10p per share. On Friday the shares gained 1p to 16p. The proceeds will significantly strengthen the financial position, reduce further the indebtedness, and help the group make acquisitions to expand the machine base and geographical coverage. The capital will be reorganised into 5p shares, and up to 26.2m will be on offer. Apartglobal and Mr Stephen Evans have agreed to underwrite 11m and 15.17m shares respectively. The underwriting arrangements provide that minimum proceeds will be Pounds 1.1m net. Despite competitive market conditions and lower photocopier and facsimile machine sales, the group had traded profitably in 1993. Further cuts in indebtedness had been achieved.</p>

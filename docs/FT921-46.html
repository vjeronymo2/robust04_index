			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Observer: Exit scapegoat There is something rather unsettling about the speed with which Dudley Eustace, British Aerospace's finance director, has found a new job while his old employer is still searching for his replacement. If he was not a great hit at British Aerospace, how come Philips Electronics has made him point man for its relations with the international financial community? Admittedly, Philips has more than its fair share or problems, like BAe. But Philips' workforce of 270,000 is more than twice as big as BAe's, and in terms of turnover Philips is Europe's 13th biggest company, whereas BAe is number 34. As an old Alcan hand, Eustace has worked in North and South America as well as Spain, and has plenty of the right kind of international experience. Even so it is highly unusual for a conservative multinational to pick its top finance man from outside its own country and reward him with a seat on the management board. Eustace must carry some of the blame for the City's loss of confidence in BAe. However, until the pedigree of his replacement is revealed, it is beginning to look as if BAe has sacrificed the wrong man.</p>

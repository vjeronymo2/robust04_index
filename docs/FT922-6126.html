			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Tobishima in the red despite sales gain TOBISHIMA, the Japanese general contractor which has appealed to banks for interest rate cuts on its debts of Y1,000bn (Dollars 7.75bn), blamed an after-tax loss of Y44.3bn on charges related to the company's restructuring. Sales during the year rose 9.8 per cent to Y460.6bn. However, the company said the general awareness of its financial problems may unnerve potential clients and, as a result, orders for the current year were expected to fall by 14.5 per cent to Y420bn. Tobishima is shifting back to its core business of contracting and away from hotel and resort development, which led the company into financial difficulty during the late 1980s. Officials from Fuji Bank, its main bank, are overseeing the restructuring plan. For the current year, Tobishima's pre-tax profit is expected to double to Y3bn, while the company is aiming for an after-tax profit of Y500m. Kumagai Gumi, the general contractor, reported a 24.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y38bn on a 4.7 per cent decline in sales to Y1,145bn which followed a decision to cut its exposure in the international market. The construction industry is hoping the government's plan to accelerate budget spending, and perhaps to announce a supplementary budget later this week, will bolster earnings. Kumagai is expecting sales this year to remain at around Y1,150bn, while pre-tax profits are forecast to fall a further 21 per cent to Y30bn.</p>

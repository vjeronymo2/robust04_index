			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLDING PARENTS RESPONSIBLE  </P> <P> Pillsbury opens his column by saying, "It is a typically American response to a  serious social problem: Make it a crime."  </P> <P> I feel that most Americans would agree with the reverse of this -- that the  typical response to a crime is to make it into a social problem and thus  absolve the criminal of guilt and not punish, but rather rehabilitate him.  </P> <P> Crimes are committed by criminals and criminals must not be absolved of  responsibility for them. It isn't society that kills bystanders from moving  cars or mugs grandfathers for a few dollars, it isn't society that holds up  liquor stores or bilks investors -- it is the criminal!  </P> <P> It has become fashionable, for the last several decades, to make society the  culprit. We are told that criminals are simply expressing their anger, that  their behavior is a logical consequence of being oppressed and discriminated  against. If this is so, then an overwhelming majority of Holocaust survivors or  Vietnamese refugees should have been criminals. The fact is that there is  comparatively little crime among them.  </P> <P> The time has come to reject the guilt trip laid on us by the sociologists and  shrinks, and other well-meaning but unrealistic people. Our society is being  threatened by the barbarians among us, those who do not accept or even know of  the values we share -- sanctity of human life, personal responsibility,  obligation and consideration towards others. These barbarians have forfeited  their right to live among civilized people; like animals they should be locked  and kept in cages.  </P> <P> SI FRUMKIN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

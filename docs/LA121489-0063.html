			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Ailey Recalled: Dancer-choreographer Alvin Ailey was remembered for his  innovations and artistic passion as a modern dance pioneer Tuesday night by  about 100 friends and relatives during a 1 1/2-hour funeral service at the  First Baptist Church of Artesia. The modest ceremony followed a memorial in New  York last Friday attended by 5,000. Mourners included Jasmine Guy, co-star of  NBC's "A Different World," who sang the hymn "His Eye Is on the Sparrow." "He  believed that dance could and should reach everyone. Not through the eyes, ears  and intellect alone but through the heart and gut as well," wrote Jennifer  Dunning in the memorial notes. Ailey, 58, died Dec. 1 of a blood disorder. He  was buried Wednesday morning at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The  Associated Press said there were reports that Ailey had been treated for  complications related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the last  year. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

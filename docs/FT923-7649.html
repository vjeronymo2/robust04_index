			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Talks on Japanese economy A WEEKEND meeting between Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation, produced no new proposals to stem economic slowdown. Mr Miyazawa reiterated that an autumn package aimed at stimulating the economy would lay stress on reviving demand for property and equities. He promised to study ways to reduce the tax burden on such investments. At their talks on Saturday Mr Hiraiwa urged a government commitment to some Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn (Pounds 24.8bn-Pounds 29bn) in additional public works in the current fiscal year which ends next March - sums around the average of expectations. The outlay would encompass government purchases of land needed for state projects. Mr Hiraiwa said such lots should be bought in part from financial institutions, which would be able to reduce bad loans by selling land they had been holding as collateral. Mr Hiraiwa called for the stock market to be made more attractive to small investors through expansion in employee stock ownership and a cut in the minimum trading unit on the Tokyo stock exchange.</p>

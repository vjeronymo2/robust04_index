			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GAUGUIN, 4 OTHER WORKS, BRING GETTY $17 MILLION AT AUCTION  </P> <P> Aksa International, a Japanese conglomerate, paid $6.8 million for Paul  Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy in a landscape at an auction at  Sotheby's Tuesday night of impressionist and modern paintings.  </P> <P> The Gauguin was one of five works that together brought nearly $17 million for  the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The museum recently sent 15 works to  Sotheby's for auction, saying they represented the private taste of the oil  billionaire, who died in 1976. The museum said it will use the proceeds to  acquire other works better suited to its collection and public display.  </P> <P> The top price at the London auction was $8.9 million, phoned in by an anonymous  bidder for one of Claude Monet's water lily paintings.  </P></p>

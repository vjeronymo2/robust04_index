			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The POSTFACTUM Agency reports that Yuriy Meshkov,  the recently elected president of the Republic of Crimea,  arrived in Moscow last night. The president of Crimea is being  accompanied on his trip by a very small group of his closest  aides and advisers.    The program for his visit includes meetings and talks with  deputies in Russia's State Duma and with individual members of  the Russian Government. The president of Crimea's visit to  Moscow is not an official one: In the words of one of Yuriy  Meshkov's closest aides, this is not really a visit, rather a  trip to Moscow by the president of Crimea to build bridges  toward economic cooperation between Russia and Crimea. How long  Yuriy Meshkov spends in Moscow will be determined by how the  talks and meetings with Russia's leaders go.</p>

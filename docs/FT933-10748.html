			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Microsoft faces new investigation THE anti-trust division of the US Justice Department is to review documents relating to the business practices of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, following the failure of the Federal Trade Commission to agree on the case after a three-and-a-half year investigation. The move represents a setback for Microsoft because it had appeared that the FTC was hopelessly deadlocked on the issue and that the investigation might soon end. The company declined to comment, saying that it has not been officially notified of the review. The review also moves the issue into the political arena and could test the Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust enforcement. If the Justice Department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity, it will have to decide whether the public interest is served by taking action against one of the most successful high-technology companies in the US. The Justice Department will review the thousands of documents amassed by the FTC. The commission has reached deadlock twice this year on whether to proceed against the software company, with the latest vote taken last month. Two commissioners voted in favour and two against issuing a complaint. A fifth commissioner excused himself from the case, claiming a conflict of interests. Microsoft's competitors allege that the company has attempted to raise false concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly with operating system programs sold by competitors. There are also complaints that Microsoft's program-licensing methods are designed to exclude competitors. Microsoft, which has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, last week accused rival Novell, a leading supplier of software for PC networks, of attempting to stir up trouble for its own benefit. Throughout the FTC investigation 'nothing has come up that causes us the slightest concern,' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. 'The only issues that seem to be active . . . have been promoted very heavily by Novell,' he said. 'We're disappointed by the way that Novell is pursuing this.' Novell's goal, he charged 'is to get us to raise our prices . . . so that they can compete more effectively.' Novell, which has actively lobbied for anti-trust action against Microsoft, said that it had been contacted by the FTC and co-operated with the investigation.</p>

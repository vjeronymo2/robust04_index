			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Elliott learns soon if he faces charges Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former head of the Elders IXL brewing and agribusiness group, will not know until tomorrow at the earliest, if he is to be charged in connection with ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 30.2m)-worth of allegedly illegal foreign exchange dealings. Mr Elliott is seeking special leave to appeal against the lifting of injunctions which, for several months, have barred the authorities from charging him and four other individuals over the alleged theft. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed by a full Federal Court last week and moved on to the High Court yesterday. However, after a day of submissions, Justice Gaudron said she would give a written judgment tomorrow or Thursday.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG SIDE OF STREET  </P> <P> On a lovely July afternoon, en route to a Gaslamp Quarter restaurant, I was  panhandled seven times in six blocks. Just as I reached the corner of 5th  Avenue and E Street, I was accosted by a drunk lying in the middle of the  sidewalk who, when I ignored his demands, rolled his bottle toward me in an  attempt to trip me. I quickly glanced up 5th Avenue and noting that there was  no traffic, I crossed the street against the light.  </P> <P> I confess. I am guilty of jaywalking.  </P> <P> Heading south on 5th Avenue, I heard someone saying, several times, "Excuse me,  miss." Not even considering stopping, I hurried toward my destination until I  felt a hand on my shoulder. With more than a little relief, I turned to face  two San Diego police officers. Thinking they had seen the incident and had come  to help, I became incensed when I realized that they had stopped me for  jaywalking.  </P> <P> I was not pleased and I was not polite. I told them of my plight and all they  could say was that they had not seen the incident, but had seen me cross  against the light.  </P> <P> I also plead guilty to being angry and verbal with the two officers. I pointed  out my difficulty in walking the six blocks from my rented condo and asked if  they didn't have anything better to do.  </P> <P> I questioned the need for two young, strong and armed officers to stop one  128-pound middle-aged woman for what I felt was a justifiable incident of  jaywalking. I expressed relief that I wasn't carrying a screwdriver, as I might  have risked being shot.  </P> <P> I do not regret one second of my diatribe. I was and am very angry at a policy  that penalizes citizens, visitors and businesses for a trivial infraction,  while public drunkenness, vagrancy and drug peddling are allowed to flourish.  </P> <P> I am not without compassion for the homeless; it is a dreadful problem and  certainly not unique to San Diego. But I have yet to be panhandled by someone  sober. I have also yet to be protected from them by any officer of the San  Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> The young officer who cited me suggested that if I didn't like the way things  were run in San Diego, perhaps I might be happier elsewhere. He has a point.  </P> <P> DOROTHY A. STARR  </P> <P> San Antonio, TX  </P></p>

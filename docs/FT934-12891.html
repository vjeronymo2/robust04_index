			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / GM agrees three-year labour deal GENERAL MOTORS backed away from confrontation with the United Auto Workers union over the weekend as it agreed to a new three-year labour deal closely echoingthose reached by its Detroit rivals Ford and Chrysler. The deal, subject to approval of 241,000 UAW workers, heads off the strike threat at the world's biggest carmaker. But it could also hit the share price of GM, which faces higher pension costs as a result of the agreement. The deal was reached at 1 am on Sunday morning, after 16 hours of talks, and more than a month after the company's last labour agreement expired. The UAW said it closely resembled the deal struck between the union and Ford last month, which had set the pattern for the Chrysler agreement, though GM refused to comment. Pensions and job security clauses were the main sticking points over which an agreement almost foundered. Under the Ford agreement, workers with more than 30 years' service will get a 13 per cent rise in their monthly income, to Dollars 2,030 (Pounds 1,365). GM, which already faces an unfunded pension liability of Dollars 19bn and would be harmed more than its rivals by higher pension costs, resisted a similar rise. Mr Gerald Knechtel, vice president in charge of personnel for GM's north American operations, said the deal would allow the carmaker to maintain its 'momentum in improving its operating performance in the US'.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HE KEEPS PACE DESPITE 1985 HEART ATTACK  </P> <P> Dr. Elvin Pam ran with his son, Aaron, for a while Sunday in the Los Angeles  Marathon and then they walked to the finish line.  </P> <P> It was Aaron's first marathon and, when he tired at the 21-mile mark, he told  his father to go on ahead of him.  </P> <P> However, Pam insisted that they finish together and they did, in about 5 hours  and 33 minutes.  </P> <P> The fact that Pam, the supervisor of the psychology department at the Bronx,  N.Y., Psychiatric Center, is running at all is somewhat amazing.  </P> <P> He received a rate-responsive pacemaker in November of 1985 at 50. He had  suffered a heart attack that damaged the sinal node of his heart, which  regulates the beat.  </P> <P> The pacemaker he received was somewhat in the experimental stage. The standard  fixed rate pacemaker is programmed for 70 beats to a minute, Pam said.  </P> <P> "With that type of pacemaker, I wouldn't have been able run, or do any heavy  exercise," Pam said. "I would have to lead a sedentary life."  </P> <P> His personal physician, Dr. Dennis Miura, advised him to accept the variable  rate pacemaker and encouraged him to run again.  </P> <P> "The pacemaker I have changes the heart beat according to muscle tension in the  chest," Pam said. "It has a low of 60 beats on up to 150."  </P> <P> Pam decided to run in the New York Marathon in 1988, much to the dismay of his  family and friends.  </P> <P> "I tried to keep it a secret, but they found out and thought I was going to  kill myself," Pam said, adding that he didn't want to be treated like an  invalid.  </P> <P> Not only did Pam run, but he finished in 5 hours 29 minutes.  </P> <P> His family was waiting for him at the 21-mile mark, but they got there too  late. Pam had passed that point earlier.  </P> <P> Pam said that the pacemaker he has is more sensitive to a runner's needs and he  plans to keep on running.  </P> <P> Aaron, his 23-year-old son, isn't sure that he wants to run with with his  father again. As a pacemaker, he is too fast.  </P> <P> Horacio Pino, 23, and Valerie French, 27, ran together Sunday.  </P> <P> They finished in about 4 hours 23 minutes and Pino, a sergeant in the Marine  Corp, had a surprise waiting for French at the finish line.  </P> <P> He proposed to her. She accepted.  </P> <P> It was French's first marathon and Pino was concerned that his plans might have  been spoiled if she had dropped out.  </P> <P> They met last summer in Okinawa, where Pino was stationed and French, from  England, was teaching English to Japanese students.  </P> <P> "I liked running and she liked running and that's how we got to know each  other," Pino said.  </P> <P> The Orthopedic Medical Center near the finish line of the marathon looked  something like a M*A*S*H unit Sunday.  </P> <P> Some runners were totally exhausted, other could hardly walk because their legs  were cramped and many suffered from dehydration.  </P> <P> It was a similar scene inside the Sports Arena, where runners leaned against  walls, or were lying on the floor. The odor of lineament was stifling.  </P> <P> Dr. Sonny Cobble, the medical commissioner for the marathon, said that some  runners don't drink enough water on the 26-mile run, leading to dehydration and  sometimes hypothermia.  </P> <P> Some runners were competing in their first marathon, such as Ken Ernst, 28, a  former long-distance runner for UCLA.  </P> <P> Ernst said he has four brothers, all of whom have run in marathons, and they  goaded him into competing.  </P> <P> "It's my first and last marathon," said Ernst, who limped down some stairs at  the Sports Arena, his legs cramping and his feet blistered. "It was like  someone took a sledge hammer to the bottoms of my feet.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be easier than it was and I was actually delirious at about  14 miles, but I was determined to finish."  </P> <P> He finished in about 2 hours 51 minutes.  </P> <P> Art Boileau and Peter Fonseca, both Canadians, train together in Eugene, Ore.  Boileau is a two-winner of the L.A. marathon and he urged Fonseca to compete  here.  </P> <P> Fonseca, who runs for the University of Oregon, agreed to accommodate his  friend, even though the marathon was a new experience for him.  </P> <P> Fonseca surprised himself by finishing third.  </P> <P> Boileau, who finished fifth, said that he and Fonseca had an interesting week  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We saw the Edmonton-Kings game Wednesday night, got to see Wayne Gretzky, we  had an earthquake and we got to run in a marathon," Boileau said.  </P></p>

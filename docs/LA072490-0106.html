			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> While acknowledging major rules violations in its football and basketball  programs, the University of Florida insists that a compliance program in effect  since 1984 is working.  </P> <P> "It's like the IRS (Internal Revenue Service)," school president John V.  Lombardi said. "You can't prevent people from doing the wrong thing."  </P> <P> Florida acknowledged in a 1,100-page response to an official letter of inquiry  from the NCAA that former coaches Galen Hall and Norm Sloan ran afoul of the  rules. It denied, however, that infractions occurring from 1985 to 1988  demonstrated a lack of institutional control over the football and basketball  programs run by the coaches.  </P></p>

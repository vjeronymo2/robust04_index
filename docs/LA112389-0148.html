			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW GAINS 17.49 ON GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS  </P> <P> The stock market staged a pre-Thanksgiving rally in moderate trading Wednesday,  bolstered by stronger-than-expected economic news and talk that interest rates  might be headed lower.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 17.49 points to 2,656.78.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 888 up, 565 down and 533 unchanged.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods showed a  0.6% decline in October.  </P> <P> Excluding military items, which are subject to wide swings month to month, the  department said orders for goods with usable lives of several years or more  increased 0.5% from the month before.  </P> <P> Analysts said the news came as a positive surprise for traders who have grown  increasingly worried lately about the slowing pace of the economy.  </P> <P> The market's advance also got a boost at mid-session from signs that the  Federal Reserve might have taken further steps to relax its credit policy.  </P> <P> The markets will be closed today for Thanksgiving and will be open Friday for  what traditionally is one of the Street's slowest days of the year.  </P> <P> Texas Instruments climbed 4 3/4 to 36 1/2 in active trading. On Tuesday the  news surfaced that the company had been granted a patent in Japan for the basic  integrated circuit.  </P> <P> Other gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1/2 at 60 1/8;  McDonald's, up 3/8 at 32 3/4; Philip Morris, up 5/8 at 41 3/8; Coca-Cola, up  5/8 at 77 5/8, and International Business Machines, up 5/8 at 100 1/8.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 145.73 million shares, against 147.90 million in the  previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues,  including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the  over-the-counter market, totaled 178.67 million shares.  </P> <P> In London, share prices closed higher Wednesday, boosted by moderate gains in  early Wall Street dealings.  </P> <P> The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 7.2 points, or  0.3%, higher at 2,192.3, but down from an early peak of 2,197.4.  </P> <P> Tokyo share prices surged to a second straight record high close buoyed by new  investment trust funds and scattered buying by other institutional investors.  </P> <P> The key 225-share Nikkei index soared 227.05 points, or 0.63%, to a record  close of 36,286.92 after rising 166.29 on Tuesday.

Its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.90% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said bonds  got a lift at midday when the Fed injected reserves into the financial system  by making short-term purchases of securities from dealers.  </P> <P> By making funds available to the financial system, he said the central bank  takes pressure off interest rates. Falling interest rates boost bond prices.  </P> <P> The injection of reserves was reflected in a decline in the federal funds rate,  the interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate dropped to 8.125% from  8.5%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Meat Futures Rise, Cocoa Prices Slump  </P> <P> Livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line  with stronger cash markets. Cocoa futures sank to new 14-year lows.  </P> <P> After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly cold-storage  report showing 40.2 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in warehouses as of  Oct. 31. The number was slightly higher than expected and could prompt some  selling of pork belly futures when trading resumes Friday.  </P> <P> Live cattle futures settled 0.10 to 0.42 cent higher, with December at 76 cents  a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 to 0.30 cent higher, with November at 83.45  cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.28 cent higher, with December at 51.25  cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.20 to 0.60 cent higher, with  February at 63.25 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Cocoa futures prices sank to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;  Cocoa Exchange, reflecting the burdensome supplies of cocoa on the market.  </P> <P> Cocoa settled $19 to $23 lower, with December at $918 per metric ton.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D6  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Military Council, which met in Ankara  the day before yesterday, said it had insufficient mandates and  asked for more. The Council decided to issue new instructions  to the government and press.    An agreement was reached at the meeting "to meet the  hardware  and economic needs of the Turkish Armed Forces [TAF], prevent  the destructive campaign against the Armed Forces, and ensure  the publication of positive reports in the press."    Ciller "blamed the SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] in  connection with the subjects discussed, and promised to do  everything she could."    According to information obtained from sources close to TAF,  during its extraordinary session in Ankara the day before  yesterday, the Supreme Military Council discussed numerous  problems, primarily the war and Kurds. The meeting demanded an  end to the destructive propaganda against the TAF and an  assurance on "the broadcasting and publication of appropriate  programs and items on TAF in the media."    Complete consensus was said to be reached on the following:    "The urgent procurement of hardware needed by TAF, the  introduction of the necessary amendments to the military  personnel laws as specified by relevant military commanders and  in line with requirements and demands, the determination of  premium payments during states of emergency and similar  situations in accordance with the importance of the situation,  the adoption of necessary measures by the government to prevent  destructive speculation and campaigns against TAF and Army  commanders, and the need not to inform the public about tasks  given to TAF, leaving TAF officials to make statements if  needed."  <H5>  "Continue Pressure on DEP" </H5>   The meeting also called for sending reinforcements to the  region [southeast] to increase the deterrent power of the  troops. In a clear reference to the DEP [Democracy Party], the  meeting demanded that "activities by separatist parties should  not be allowed and sanctions against them should continue inside  and outside the Turkish Grand National Assembly."  <H5>  New Demands From Syria and Iraq </H5>   The Supreme Military Council, which called "for presenting  new demands to Syria and Iraq and formulating a new policy  toward them," also discussed issues relating to Greece and  Armenia. The meeting decided "to conduct a deterrent campaign  on international forums and prepare to impose every type of  sanction on these states and to increase every assistance to  Azerbaijan to deter Armenia."  <H5>  Ciller "Promised" </H5>   It was learned that Prime Minister Ciller, who participated  in the meeting even though she was not initially listed as a  participant, "promised to do all she could" to fulfill the  demands. Ciller left the meeting after hearing the main outline  of the subjects to be discussed. It was learned that before  leaving the meeting, Ciller again accused her partner, the SHP,  and said: "We will give the necessary support to your demands."  <H5>  "The Meeting Was Postponed Due to the DEP" </H5>   It was learned that the Supreme Military Council, which was  scheduled to meet in February, met instead on 18 March "because  of developments relating to the DEP." It is being said that in  view of public debate over the recent frequent joint meetings  between the General Staff and National Security Council, this  meeting was held to coincide with the celebrations of the  Canakkale victory so as to deflect public attention.</p>

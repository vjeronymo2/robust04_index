			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Intercare trebles to more than Pounds 1.5m Intercare Group, a supplier of healthcare products, more than doubled turnover and trebled pre-tax profit in the year to end-October. There was strong organic growth and all divisions - including dental, optical, mobility and specialist pharmaceutical - continued to trade profitably. The result included a six months' contribution from Booster Electric Vehicles and two months' from Montis Medical. Turnover rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 6.78m) and profit to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 504,000). Earnings per share worked through at 7.5p on significantly higher capital (4.1p) and a final divided of 1.5p makes the total of 2p (1.25p). Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the most significant event of the year was the acquisition of Booster and 75 per cent of Montis, which distributes healthcare products - including the electric vehicles assembled by Booster - primarily in the Netherlands. 'We have been very pleased with their performance since joining the group', Mr Cowan told shareholders. The group had entered the current year in 'a very positive manner'. The UK side was showing good organic growth and there were 'exciting' European operations through Montis. Net cash at October 31 was Pounds 2.23m, against an overdraft of Pounds 750,000 the year before.</p>

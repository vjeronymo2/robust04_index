			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Canal crossing project AMEC CIVIL ENGINEERING, a member of the AMEC Group, has been awarded a Pounds 6m contract by Trafford Park Development Corporation to design and construct a vertical lift bridge over the Manchester Ship Canal. The bridge, which is believed to be only the third of its kind to be built in the UK, will be the first low level crossing of the Manchester Ship Canal to be constructed since the canal was opened over 100 years ago. It will form a new entrance into Trafford Park, Manchester and will provide a new road crossing at a point approximately mid-way between the swing bridges at Barton and Trafford Road. Forming the first stage of the link between the Parkway Roundabout in Trafford Park and the M602 motorway, the single span vertical lift bridge will consist of reinforced concrete abutments, cellular towers and an all steel deck spanning 4I metres across the canal. The lift bridge will facilitate the passage of tall ships along the canal by the raising of the bridge deck to a height of 23 metres above water level. Design work has already commenced with construction due to begin in November and contract completion scheduled for 1994.</p>

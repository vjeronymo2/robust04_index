			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> LIVING AT THE LOW END OF THE UPPER CRUST;  </P> <P> GENTLEMAN REBEL THE MEMOIRS OF H. STUART HUGHES. TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS, $24.95,  328 PAGES  </P> <P> When he was an adolescent, H. Stuart Hughes tells us, he spent time  depressively trying to figure out his social status. He lived in the upper  middle-class neighborhood of Riverdale, on the northern end of the Bronx; but  certainly, his family was not middle class.  </P> <P> The Hugheses were prosperous, yet nowhere in the range of the great American  families and fortunes. Grandfather, on the other hand -- Charles Evans Hughes  -- was secretary of state and then chief justice of the United States, and  perhaps the most respected Republican of his time.  </P> <P> Surely, that baked Henry Stuart into the upper crust. Perhaps, the bottom of  the upper crust, he muses. But then there were the Kennedys; much richer, and  beginning to be more powerful. When Joseph P. Kennedy moved from Riverdale to  greater things, the Hugheses thriftily bought his house. Yet they -- the  Hugheses -- were received by Hudson River Society; the Kennedys were not.  </P> <P> Go figure.  </P> <P> The figuring begins in the title -- "Gentleman Rebel" -- and continues, openly  or by suggestion, through much of the rest of this memoir. Class is not so much  the subject as the pathology.  </P> <P> Hughes was a history professor at Harvard, Stanford and UC San Diego. He was a  man of finely -- some might say fussily -- calibrated political compass points;  not Center, nor Left, but oscillating variously between Left Left Center and  Center Center Left. He was a premature skeptic of the Cold War, briefly for  Henry Wallace, briefly a quixotic Senate candidate against Teddy Kennedy, and a  lifelong pacifist. He was something of a failure by his own lights, and  something of a success by most anyone else's.  </P> <P> To read his reflections is to read the handwriting of somebody whose fingers  were crippled by a birth defect, yet who has taught himself legibility, if not  gracefulness. Hughes writes about childhood privilege as a West Virginia coal  miner's son might write about childhood malnutrition.  </P> <P> His book is rickety, accordingly. There are moments of sense and sensibility,  and moments of a drifting silliness. Hughes is aware that the upper-class state  he writes of with such insistence is dotted with eccentricity. He is partly  rueful and partly rather proud.  </P> <P> He writes, for example, that his father, a successful corporate lawyer, was so  sheltered -- not to mention strait-laced -- that he had to be instructed about  condoms after his wife gave birth to two children in rapid succession. It was  the Chief Justice -- a worldly Welshman under a patrician and Anglophile  demeanor -- who did the instructing.  </P> <P> Some of these things may be worth talking about; certainly, his linkage of the  family's code of high-minded duty and his childhood sense of depression is  interesting. But there is an involuntary priggishness in the language he uses;  as if recollection were not discovery so much as one more high-minded duty.  </P> <P> Yet under the altruism of privilege there is also privilege's  inconsequentiality and easy acceptance of what it thinks due to it. He  volunteered for an artillery battalion, although he hated noise. He writes of  what an encouragement and revelation it was to associate with the other  enlisted men. After a while, though, he'd had enough equality. He secured a  commission, bought himself a tailored second lieutenant's uniform, and joined  the posh Washington nucleus of what was to become the OSS. "I had done my stint  as an enlisted man," he writes without apparent irony.  </P> <P> He had a pleasant war, serving in the intelligence unit in North Africa, and  later touring liberated France with a jeep and a driver to report on the  political network set up by the Resistance. There, and in his subsequent  political intelligence work in postwar Europe, he developed a sympathy for the  Democratic Left. He deplored the postwar purge of leftists from the American  intelligence community. One of his subordinates, for example, was Herbert  Marcuse. "How can I be expected to run a balanced intelligence show when I take  away my Communists," he protested at one point.  </P> <P> That was "reckless beyond belief," he now recalls. In today's perspective, his  belief that the extreme polarization of the Cold War could have been avoided  seems appealing; particularly since he admits that he is not certain that he  was right. At the time, no doubt, he must have seemed considerably more  certain; and his academic career suffered for a while under the attacks of the  Cold Warriors.  </P> <P> Silly, high-minded, blinkered and sometimes courageously prescient, Hughes  comes through in his memoirs with genuine, if frail, charm; at least until the  later chapters, which turn into a kind of family Christmas newsletter. He  belonged not to an endangered species but to one that is all but extinct; and  if the world would be poorer for lack of snail darters, it loses a bit of  buoyancy and originality with the passing of its Hugheses.  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "Rumpole a la Carte" by John Mortimer (Viking).  </P> <P> </P></p>

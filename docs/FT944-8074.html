			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Growth 'puts pressure on capacity' The recent growth of UK manufacturing is putting even greater pressure on capacity, particularly in sectors such as clothing, paper and printing, a survey suggests. The survey, by Trade Indemnity, the credit management group, found that 48 per cent of clothing manufacturers were operating at or above optimum capacity. Among paper and printing companies the ratio was 45 per cent, the second highest of any industry sector. In all, 42 per cent of the 687 companies surveyed in the third quarter said they were operating near their optimum capacity, with 7 per cent claiming to be 'overstretched.' Meanwhile, only 3 per cent of companies report that they are operating below 50 per cent of their optimum capacity, compared with 26 per cent in the same period last year. Trade Indemnity suggests this trend is 'the twin result of capacity reductions and increasing demand.' The survey shows that demand is picking up across most sectors, although companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 20m are experiencing the biggest increase. Business services and food distribution groups are the most optimistic sector, with 62 per cent and 60 per cent respectively expecting activity to pick up soon. The survey notes that one problem that continues to dog businesses is late payment of bills. Only 2 per cent of companies said they were being paid on time, showing no improvement since last year. The average late payment time was 22 days, with paper and printing companies reporting the highest late payment level of 27 days. Meanwhile, the average value of long overdue debt rose in the past quarter to Pounds 157,000, compared to Pounds 118,000 in the third quarter of last year. The survey found rising raw material costs were creating greater pressure on margins and undermining profitability, particularly in the paper, printing, timber, furniture and textiles sectors. Ms Barbara Bennet of Trade Indemnity said: 'The upward pressure on raw materials prices and an increase in the average value of long-term debts are both significant negative trends . . . they mean that credit risk will be more difficult to predict and the paper and printing sector is already showing itself to be under considerable pressure.'

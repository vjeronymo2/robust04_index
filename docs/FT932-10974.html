			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / BAT ahead 40% but warns of cigarette wars BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, increased pre-tax profits by 40 per cent in the first quarter, but gave warning that the US cigarette price war would have an impact on its business. BAT's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 258m to Pounds 360m in the three months to March 31, the period just before the US tobacco group Philip Morris slashed its prices. Strong insurance premium growth and financial services profits more than compensated for a slight downturn in tobacco. The weaker pound boosted the pre-tax profits figure by Pounds 46m. Group sales grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 6.03bn during the quarter, and earnings per share were 56 per cent higher at 13.7p. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said: 'The price war is clearly set for a period of significant aggravation but it remains to be seen how intensive and how persistent our competitors' activity will be.' He added: 'Shareholders should keep a sense of perspective: US domestic tobacco profit accounted for about 20 per cent of the the group's total trading profit in 1992, down from about 30 per cent in 1991. This trend illustrates the reduced importance of the US domestic market to the group as a whole.' BAT's shares yesterday closed 24p lower at 850p. They have fallen 15 per cent since Philip Morris's price cut announcement in April. The group said tobacco trading profit of Pounds 220m was slightly below last year's strong first quarter, influenced by a number of short-term factors, which also cut volumes. It blamed a reduced level of anticipatory buying in the US, a relocation provision at Brown &amp; Williamson, the US cigarette subsidiary, and a sharp downturn in Germany. Financial services increased trading profits from continuing operations by 48 per cent, to Pounds 169m. In the general business Farmers, the US insurance subsidiary, continued to progress and the ongoing recovery at Eagle Star contributed to a profit of Pounds 93m (up from Pounds 43m). In the life business, Allied Dunbar, Eagle Star and Farmers all recorded growth and profits were 7 per cent up at Pounds 76m. Sir Patrick said: 'The most dramatic part of the improvement came, as expected, from Eagle Star's general business, where the core business operations moved back into profit.' There was a loss of Pounds 29m on domestic mortgage indemnity policies. BAT said it was encouraged by the recent fall in the number of people in serious arrears and higher levels of activity in the housing market. Lex, Page 18</p>

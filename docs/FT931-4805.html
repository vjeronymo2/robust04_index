			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / De Larosiere optimistic MR Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said yesterday the outlook for inflation in the global economy was positive, Reuter reports from Basle. 'There is no expectation of a rekindling of inflation, so that bodes well for the world economy,' he told reporters at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). He added that interest rates for long-term financial instruments had fallen dramatically over the last month. 'If you look at US interest rates for 10-year instruments, you've got a 60 basis points fall,' he said after the regular monthly meeting of Group of Ten central bank governors.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sluggish trading ahead of the holiday A VIRTUALLY unchanged reading on the FT-SE 100 Index provided a suitable verdict on the trading session in the UK stock market on Thursday as London-based securities houses balanced their dealing books ahead of the extended Easter weekend. Although still nervous, equities were helped by technical rallies in Wellcome and BAT Industries, the two blue chips whose misfortunes have undermined the market this week, and the Footsie remained comfortably above the 2,800 mark. The final reading ahead of the Easter weekend showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,821.8, only 0.3 off from the previous day. But at worst, the Footsie dipped 6.0 to 2,816.1 after failing to hold an early gain which reflected a firm overnight performance on Wall Street. The new Wall Street session, however, made a less promising start and was giving ground as the London session died away after midday. The London market lost nearly 50 points on the Footsie scale last week, with leading indices hurt by setbacks in Wellcome, following adverse medical review of its anti-Aids product, and in BAT Industries, hit by price-cutting plans by Philip Morris, the US cigarette group. There has been less pressure on the second line issues, however, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index steadied from early trading on Thursday to close 0.6 firmer at 3,084.3; over the week, the Mid 250 has shed only 24.2. Private investors have been buyers of the Mid 250 stocks. Equities made a cautious response to the report that Norwich Union, the mutual insurance group, is considering reversing recent policy to switch back from gilts to equities. Bonds, dull at first, ended  1/8 higher at the short end and nearly  1/2 up at the long end. Seaq volume in equities slipped to 451.5m shares from the 508.1m of the previous session. Retail volume, which has continued to turn in high daily totals since mid-September when sterling departed from the ERM network, was worth Pounds 1.14bn on Wednesday. The high level of retail, or customer, business has proved one of the more positive signs in an increasingly lacklustre stock market. Pharmaceuticals stocks put on a dull performance, with the rally in Wellcome shares making little difference by the end of the session. Glaxo, which had appeared to be attracting some switching out of Wellcome, failed to sustain its recovery. The improvement in BAT Industries, a welcome rally after the selling earlier in the week, had no implications for the rest of the market.</p>

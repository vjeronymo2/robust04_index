			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule also implements the 1992 amendments to Section 202. These amendments limited a suspension issued by the Board to not more than one year, unless extended for not more than six additional months, to protect the public interest, or unless extended with the mortgagee's agreement. The amendments also clarified that the term ``mortgagee'' included lenders or loan correspondents approved under the National Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also would make conforming changes to HUD's regulations governing hearing officers, consistent with the proposed revisions both to the Board's regulations and to 24 CFR part 24, published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule.

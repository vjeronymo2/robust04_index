			<p>BFN     [Text] Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima Pref., June 4 KYODO --  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed Saturday to bolster Japan's  preparedness to deal with any contingency that may derive from a  standoff over the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program.    "Generally speaking, it is proper for a nation to arrange  preparedness that would enable it to cope with any development,"  Hata said at a news conference.    Hata was speaking about Japan's response to a possible  contingency on the Korean peninsula amid heightened tension from  the announcement Friday by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) that it can no longer verify if Pyongyang diverted  plutonium for nuclear arms production.    Hata earlier said Japan would join U.N.-led sanctions  against  North Korea if the Security Council voted to approve punitive  steps, while making it clear that Japan would keep open the  option of acting with the United States and South Korea in  slapping sanctions even without such a U.N. decision.    The U.N. nuclear watchdog said Friday the North Korean  discharge of spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor has made it  impossible to ascertain whether North Korea diverted plutonium  from the reactor in the past.    "I am monitoring how North Korea would respond to a  statement  by the president of U.N. Security Council that urged it to  comply with the safeguards measures demanded by the IAEA," Hata  said.    "I want North Korea to accept international public opinion  and open up their heart (to the inspection demand)," he said.</p>

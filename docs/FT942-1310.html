			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rio Algom reorganises in North America Rio Algom, the Canadian mining group which brought the Cerro Colorado copper property in northern Chile on stream last February, is reorganising its north American metals distribution business. The Atlas Alloys operation with 12 service centres in Canada, Vincent Metals with 15 locations in the US, and Aceromex in Mexico, together with annual sales of nearly CDollars 600m (USDollars 433m), are being put into a new division called North American Metals Distribution, headed by Mr Norman Smith, now president of Vincent. During the recession, Rio Algom considered selling its metals distribution business because of poor prices and low margins, but it has now decided to develop it further in Canada and US. 'Margins are better in the US where we are likely to expand by acquisition,' said Mr Forbes West, vice-president. 'But strong Canadian capital spending could justify growth in Canada as well.' Rio Algom has invested USDollars 280m in 100 per cent-owned Cerro Colorado. The mine uses the solvent extraction process and has annual capacity of 40,000 tonnes. This will be increased by 50 per cent in the next few years. Rio Algom is also exploring other Latin American based metals properties. RTZ sold its 51.5 per cent interest in Rio Algom in 1992 for CDollars 362m. Since then the company has pushed ahead in Chile, plans to develop a USDollars 250m zinc-copper property in Wisconsin jointly with Exxon, and is buying a 25 per cent royalty interest in the pre-tax profits of the rich Polaris zinc mine in the Canadian arctic. Rio Algom also gets a 25 per cent interest in any expansion of reserves. The Wisconsin mine and the CDollars 57m investment in Polaris will provide Rio Algom with a strong base in zinc.</p>

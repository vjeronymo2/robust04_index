			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: The Boy Friend is back - Musical theatre It survived Ken Russell, complete with fantasy sequences and orchestrations by Peter Maxwell Davies. Now at an age when demure discretion is expected, Sandy Wilson's ersatz 1920s frivolity taps, charlestons and high-kicks its enchanting way through a fortieth birthday season at the little theatre under the Charing Cross arches where it first saw the light of post-austerity day. Forty-first, to be precise, but who would be so ungallant as to point out that the first, short version of this flapper-age pastiche appeared in 1953, while the full-length edition for the West End dates from January 1954? In a time of sexual equality, boyfriends, like girlfriends, are presumably entitled to arithmetical discretion. In fact the new production by Maria Charles, the first Dulcie, has wrought a certain old D'Oyly Cartery on the piece, apparently recreating the original down to the last squeal and flounce. Not that there is much else you can do with the show, a perfect crystallisation of sweet, silly 1920s musicals perceived from a viewpoint part nostalgic, part amused, wholly affectionate. The songs ('I could be happy with you', 'A room in Bloomsbury', 'It's never too late to fall in love') could be taken for the authentic period product. Disley Jones's bright designs are framed by a rose-clustered trellis. The Villa Caprice Finishing School is rightly dominated by Judith Bruce's Madame Dubonnet, her fractured Anglo-Gallic diphthongs indicating kinship with Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. She strikes the right blend of involvement and ironic detachment - for all its resilience, the piece needs a delicate stylistic balance. I remember a Bristol Old Vic production somewhat overwhelmed by Eleanor Bron's conviction that she was the funniest thing on stage. As the millionaire's lovelorn daughter Polly Browne, Gemma Page has the right whitish, genteel English light soprano, very authentic. Unlike Twiggy in the film, she refrains from tap-dancing, but Oliver Hickey as Tony (messenger-boy-cum-fugitive-from-the-peerage) dashingly makes up for it. Occasionally one guiltily yearns for Ken Russell's forbidden, and over-ripe, fruit: Jane Stoggles' jolly French maid is in the Hattie Jacques rather than the Barbara Windsor tradition. State education has left us with enunciation less Coward of Mayfair than Heath of Broadstairs ('If Mme Dubonnet feound eout I'd be asked to leave under a cleoud') but for the most part the shrill cut-glass accents pass for diamonds. Wilson's rhymes strike one yet again with their insouciant ingenuity, well up to Cole Porter standard ('I don't claim that I am psychic/But one look at you and I kick/Away every scruple/I learnt as a pupil/In school, my dear'). The band (piano, percussion, bass) is under the direction of Geoffrey Brawn, almost as much an institution as The Boy Friend itself. The Boy Friend, Players' Theatre, London.

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Other economic news Wednesday: The purchasing managers' index for the UK in August will be published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. While the overall level of the index is likely to indicate continuing economic strength, analysts will be most closely watching the prices component for further signs of inflationary pressures. Thursday: The Nationwide and Halifax house price indices have often diverged in recent months, but neither shows much indication of a housing boom. Today's Nationwide index for August is likely to show still subdued price increases, after July's 2.1 per cent annual rise. Friday: In the US, the non-farm payroll numbers are likely to be the key economic statistic of the week. After strong consumer confidence and low initial claims figures, Morgan Grenfell is expecting a 250,000 rise in employment in August, compared with 259,000 in July. In the UK, official reserves in August are expected to have declined by around Dollars 25m, but this statistic has lost much of its significance following Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism.</p>

The  treaty comprises 35 articles in which the contracting parties  pledge to cooperate in the political, military and economic  spheres. Experts are focusing most attention on those articles  which acknowledge the inalienable rights of Russia and Georgia  to adopt the necessary measures to protect their state borders.  The sides will independently confront the questions of ensuring  national security and defense construction, and in this regard  will conduct close cooperation and practical interaction.    The sides will adopt measures to ensure the effective  implementation of the agreement on the temporary sojourn of  Russian troop formations on the territory of the Georgian  Republic.    According to Article four, Russia and Georgia pledge not to  take part in any alliances or blocs aimed against each other,  nor will they render assistance to third states in the event of  an outbreak of armed conflicts between these states and another  party.    The current treaty covers a period of 10 years.</p>

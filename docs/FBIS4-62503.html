			<p>BFN     [Text] The next round of talks between the Tajik leadership  and the opposition is planned for 4 June in Tehran, one of the  leaders of the Tajik opposition, former Muslim leader of the  Republic and now Deputy Chairman of the Tajik Islamic Revival  Movement, Akbar Turandzhonzoda, told INTERFAX on Monday [16 May].    He said that the terms of the talks were agreed with the UN  General Secretary's special envoy for Tajikistan Ramiro Prisi  Bolion and Deputy UN General Secretary for political issues  Marek Goulding.    Turadzhonzoda confirmed the opposition's readiness to sign  an  agreement on a temporary cease-fire. "I am surprised Dushanbe  did not agree to sign this agreement during the first round of  talks in Moscow on 5-19 April," he pointed out.    In the meantime, Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov did  not  confirm to INTERFAX that the talks with the opposition would  continue in Tehran on 4 June. "In this issue we are oriented by  UN representatives, but not Taradzhonzoda," he noted.    According to Alimov, a visit by UN representatives Bolion  and  Goulding to Dushanbe is planned for 25-27 May.</p>

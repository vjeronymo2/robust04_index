			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH REPORT LINKS JOBS, HOUSING  </P> <P> A city consultant's report paints a rosy picture of how the massive Porter  Ranch development would provide jobs, shopping and housing that would reduce  the need for long commutes by thousands of residents of the San Fernando Valley  area and eastern Ventura County.  </P> <P> But the report, the latest chapter in a continuing debate over the 20-year  project, also noted that tailoring a development to improve a regional  jobs-housing balance has never been tried. It says that projecting the  affordability of homes or income levels of workers is too speculative to  attempt.  </P> <P> The report, prepared for the Los Angeles city Planning Department, is expected  to be released later this month. A copy was obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> In general, the firm's report concluded that the Porter Ranch development would  draw workers and shoppers from predominantly residential areas of eastern  Ventura County, such as Simi Valley and Moorpark, contributing to a better  balance of jobs and houses in a region extending from eastern Ventura County to  the Ventura Freeway Corridor and Burbank.  </P> <P> The report defined that region as everything within a 30-minute commuting  radius of the Porter Ranch site in Chatsworth. Last year, the Porter Ranch  project came under criticism from the Southern California Assn. of Governments  for creating too many jobs in an area that it said already has a balance of  jobs and houses. That would run counter to SCAG's goal of reducing commuter  traffic.  </P> <P> The Porter Ranch Development Co., which wants to build nearly 6 million square  feet of commercial space and 3,395 residences on a scenic mountain slope north  of the Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth, has maintained all along that the  1,300-acre project will shorten regional commuting times by creating jobs and  shopping opportunities.  </P> <P> PRIDE, a Porter Ranch residents' group, has disagreed, saying the proposed  commercial complex is simply too big for the area.  </P> <P> The proposal is awaiting action by the Los Angeles City Council. Earlier this  year, a council committee ordered that a supplemental environmental impact  study analyze several key issues in detail, such as how the proposal would  affect the balance of jobs and housing in the San Fernando Valley area.  </P> <P> As a part of that environmental study, a Los Angeles consulting firm, Hamilton,  Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler, delved into the jobs-housing question for the city  Planning Department.  </P> <P> The 30-minute commuting radius the study employs -- which reaches into Ventura  County areas that SCAG did not consider -- "makes far more sense to us than the  one-sided type of analysis that SCAG was doing," said Frank Fielding, senior  city planner for the San Fernando Valley. He added, however, that city planners  still are evaluating the consultant's conclusion that Porter Ranch would  improve the jobs-housing balance.  </P> <P> "The figures seem to show that at this point in time, but we're still working  on it," Fielding said.  </P> <P> Paul Chipello, executive director of PRIDE, said he continues to believe Porter  Ranch will not promote a jobs-housing balance.  </P> <P> "The whole goal of jobs-housing balance is not to create larger commercial  centers that create longer commuter distances," Chipello said. "It's a  dinosaur. It's an idea we need to get away from."  </P> <P> The consultant's report also noted that planning a development to improve a  region's jobs-housing balance is a new and untested endeavor. No national,  state or regional standards exist for such a policy, which "requires a period  of testing and experimentation," the report said.  </P> <P> Moreover, achieving an "optimal" jobs-housing balance requires balancing  workers' wages with their ability to afford housing in the same area, the  report said. The report estimated the number of jobs the project would create  at 21,358.  </P> <P> But the report declined to project wage levels and housing prices, saying such  an exercise would be too speculative. Instead, the report referred to the  developer's examination of those factors at today's levels, which showed Porter  Ranch workers would be able to afford housing nearby.  </P> <P> Phillip Fernando, a SCAG senior planner, said that although his agency has not  yet seen the report or officially commented on it, he believed some projections  of housing prices and wage levels should be attempted.  </P> <P> "What they are saying is it's hard to do that, but I don't think that's a valid  way of settling it," Fernando said.  </P></p>

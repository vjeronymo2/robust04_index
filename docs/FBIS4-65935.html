			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm"-initialed report: "Rexrodt Reiterates Demand for </F> Cutting Top Tax Rate"]    [Text] Bonn -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt,  of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], has called for  cutting the top income tax rate and the early elimination of the  solidarity surcharge. By the summer of this year, the Federal  Government will present the framework of its concept for tax  policy for the next electoral term, the minister said at the  annual meeting of the Association of Self-Employed Professionals  in Berlin.    According to the FDP official, the following points have to  be included in the tax concept:    -- The elimination of the split top income tax rate. Rexrodt  emphasized that it was necessary to return to a single income  tax rate at a low level, "that is to say clearly beneath 50  percent."    -- The splitting of the top income tax rate should only  temporarily offset the extra burden on the trade tax until it is  reformed. Within the framework of the trade tax reform the  trade capital tax has to be abolished and the trade income tax  to be reduced.    -- The solidarity surcharge, which, according to the plans  of  the coalition, will be introduced on 1 January 1995, has to be  eliminated again at the earliest possible time. Rexrodt  conceded that as long as it existed, no comprehensive reduction  of the income and corporate tax were possible under the  constitutional law. Therefore, he was in favor of putting a  clear time limit on the surcharge even today. Otherwise this  surcharge threatens to become a permanent instrument for  refinancing the state without people remembering in the future  what its original purpose was. Yet, "this cannot be had with  the FDP," Rexrodt said.    -- Additional tax revenues in the wake of economic growth  must not serve as extra room for new state spending, but must be  used for continuing the policy of cutting taxes.    The economics minister drew up an optimistic picture of  economic developments in Germany. From the current point of  view a growth rate of 1.5 percent is possible for all of  Germany. "This development might even turn out slightly  better," the federal economics minister said, the reason for it  lying in increasing orders from abroad and in a rise in orders  for the producing industries in eastern Germany.</p>

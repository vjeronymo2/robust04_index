			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhu Liang, chairman of the National People's  Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, and his delegation arrived  on 15 April on a visit to Thailand as guests of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Zhu Liang and his delegation paid a courtesy call on  Parliament President Marut Bunnak yesterday morning. The two  sides exchanged views on ways to strengthen contacts between the  parliaments of the two countries and develop bilateral relations.    On 19 April, Zhu Liang and his delegation paid courtesy  calls  on Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan and Deputy Foreign  Minister Surin Phitsuwan. During the meetings, Amnuai and Surin  said that Thailand has attached great importance to friendly  relations with China over the past 19 years. They expressed  their hope that the two countries will expand bilateral  cooperation in politics, trade, and other fields. They  expressed the opinion that on the occasion of next year's 20th  anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the  two countries should hold grand celebrations throughout the year  to promote bilateral relations further. Deputy Foreign Minister  Surin also suggested that a Chinese museum be built in Bangkok.  Such a museum would highlight the origins and migrations of the  Chinese people, important historical figures, and the  development of Thailand-China relations in order to deepen the  Thai people's understanding of the Chinese people.    Zhu Liang and his delegation visited Khon Kaen and Chiang  Rai  Provinces on 16 and 17 April to exchange views with officials  concerned with the Quadrangle economic development project.    Zhu Liang and his delegation also attend a party hosted by  Bangkok Bank President Chen Youhan [Chatri Sophonphanit] last  night. The delegation will leave Bangkok for the Philippines  today.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Cash row may hit HK port extension Expansion of Hong Kong's port, already hostage to approval from the Chinese, faces further delay as the colony's government and private consortiums building the new Container Terminal Nine (CT9) thrash out agreement on funding and land availability. Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), a subsidiary of Hutchison, and the other Kwai Chung container terminal operators yesterday urged the government to tackle outstanding problems, or risk capacity shortfalls of 1m TEUs (20-ft equivalent units) by 1997. Mr John Meredith, managing director of HIT, said the government should allocate an additional 34 hectares of back-up land, which would let HIT boost its capacity by 1m TEUs a year from its existing quay waterfront. Mr Mark Leese, managing director of Modern Terminals, one of the three contractors to the CT9 project, claimed the government was short-changing operators on attached infrastructural work. Operators agreed to undertake certain infrastructural work - for which the government is to reimburse them  -in exchange for the development rights. He claimed the actual cost of this work was HKDollars 3bn (Pounds 263m) higher than government estimates, and said the discrepancy would be a hurdle to reaching agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, June 21 (AFP) -- A Palestinian was  cleared here of murdering a Libyan dissident in Germany but is  still being detained for questioning about an anti-US bombing in  Berlin eight years ago, his lawyer said.    The Lebanese criminal court pronounced Yasir Shuraydah, 34,  not guilty in the 1984 murder of Mustafa al-'Ashiq in Germany.  Another Palestinian, Ghassan Ayyub, was also cleared in the  case.    Germany has demanded Shuraydah's extradition from Lebanon as  part of investigations into the April 5, 1986 bombing of the La  Belle discotheque in west Berlin frequented by US troops. There  is no extradition treaty between Beirut and Bonn.    Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be  tried  for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any  extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a  verdict is pronounced.    The Lebanese authorities have not charged Shuraydah in  connection with the La Belle attack and he has denied any  involvement in the bombing that killed three people and wounded  230 others.    Washington blamed the attack on Libya. Ten days later US  bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli.    Shuraydah's lawyer, Muna al-Samrah, said that he was still  being held at the Rumiyah prison, east of Beirut, where Ayyub is  also detained. She said the pair were cleared of al-'Ashiq's  murder "because there is no proof that they were guilty."    Shuraydah, who along with Ayyub comes from the 'Ayn  al-Hulwah  Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port  city of Sidon, was arrested here in 1991 in connection with a  string of murders, attempted murder and burglaries.</p>

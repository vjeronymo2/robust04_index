			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Ailing EU film industry awaits policy script: A Brussels audio-visual paper has posed more questions than answers In Brussels-speak it is democratic debate. For the rest of the world it may seem more like waffle. As the television and film industry digests the European Commission's audio-visual green paper unveiled last week, suspicions about the problems of doing business with Brussels bureaucracy are unlikely to have been dispelled. Although the Commission and the industry fully agree that 'urgent' action is needed to boost Europe's ailing audio-visual sector, many might wonder why it has taken a year to draw up a document that does not provide policy answers - but simply poses more questions. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, European Union audio-visual commissioner, suggested some reasons last week. The Commission, he said, had been unwilling to act during the long-running row over audio-visual policy during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations last year. And, as a sign of the delicacies of Brussels protocol, he had also been forced to wait until Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had issued his own white paper on competitivity in December. Meanwhile, the new spirit of post-Maastricht democracy required the Commission to promote a full discussion with green papers, before it could proceed to draw up policies, he added. But privately, Commission officials admit that the delays in last week's discussion paper serve as a sorry illustration of the difficulties of even drawing up policy questions when the political devil almost always lies in the detail. After wrangling their way through three 'official' drafts of the paper - and scores of 'private' compromises - the real problem, they suggest, has been the linguistic sensibilities of the French and English language lobbies. The French word faut created a long delay, after English speakers objected to the way the Commission was posing its questions. Asking the industry if it 'must' reform - the most literal translation of Faut-il? - was, they argued simply too dictatorial. 'A word like faut-il might seem like a small detail, but people are very sensitive,' admitted one embattled official. He insisted that by Brussels standards, the paper had been written 'quite fast'. An early reference to the possible introduction of a European-wide tax on cinema tickets along the lines of the French system, for example, provoked an uproar from some of non-French Commission quarters. Although the concept survived into the final document, it has been tactfully buried at the back of the paper, with a diplomatic disclaimer stating 'the Commission is fully aware of the political sensitivity. . .of any such scheme'. In the event, the rhetorical questions that the document finally resorted to  -such as 'what should be the priority themes?' - are largely too vague to provoke much controversy. And though the final French version still reads slightly more aggressively than its English equivalent, this is unlikely to upset the French film industry which has long been pushing for a more authoritative - and interventionist - policy.</p>

And high on the list of official action the  traffickers are known to hate and fear is extradition to the United States for  trial.  </P> <P> In a dramatic declaration this week, the traffickers acknowledged the supremacy  of the Colombian government and announced a halt in their campaign of murders,  bombings and kidnapings.  </P> <P> Like many Colombians, President Bush expressed skepticism over the declaration,  in which the drug lords also promised to suspend cocaine shipments and turn  over weapons if they receive "constitutional and legal guarantees."  </P> <P> The document was delivered Wednesday with the release of a mother and daughter  who were kidnaped in mid-December. On Thursday, the traffickers released a  third hostage, businessman Roberto Toro, in the city of Medellin.  </P> <P> Toro, who was kidnaped Dec. 14, brought a verbal message from "the  Extraditables," as the traffickers call themselves in public statements.  </P> <P> According to Toro, they said they would free all of their hostages, believed to  number about 20. Toro also said they posed a question for the Bush  Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: "If you do not  believe the word of narcotraficantes, why do you negotiate with them, why do  you have them testify against other narcotraficantes?"  </P> <P> The example of plea-bargaining in U.S. drug cases has been used here to rebut  official Colombian policy against negotiating a peace settlement with drug  traffickers.  </P> <P> The Extraditables have been seeking negotiations with the government of  President Virgilio Barco Vargas since he signed an emergency decree Aug. 18  permitting extradition of accused drug traffickers to the United States.  </P> <P> In previous messages, the traffickers have made it clear that the main issue  they wish to negotiate is extradition. Barco has refused, and 13 Colombians  have been extradited under the August decree. In retaliation for the  extraditions and for raids on properties owned by traffickers, they launched a  terrorist bombing campaign.  </P> <P> In December, after security forces killed drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in  a shoot-out, the traffickers began a campaign of kidnapings. Rodriguez Gacha,  one of the three top chieftains of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, was  wanted by U.S. authorities.  </P> <P> Early this week, two former presidents and the archbishop of Bogota signed an  open letter proposing that the traffickers release their hostages and stop  dealing cocaine in hopes of "less rigorous treatment" under the law.  </P> <P> The army's commanding general in Medellin has said the traffickers were  consulted on the draft text of the letter through a lawyer. Former President  Misael Pastrana, who endorsed but did not sign the letter, said he was  consulted on the text by former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, who Pastrana  says called him from the presidential palace.  </P> <P> Those reports indicate to many analysts that some sort of agreement was being  brokered between the traffickers and the government.  </P> <P> Rodrigo Losada, a Colombian political analyst, said he fears that the  government may secretly have relented on extradition in exchange for peace with  the traffickers. Government officials deny that. Losada said such an agreement  could have disastrous consequences for Colombia.  </P> <P> It would be extremely hard to determine whether traffickers were keeping a  promise to quit the cocaine business. And even if they did, Losada said, others  would quickly move into the lucrative field, so trafficking most likely would  continue.  </P> <P> If accused traffickers were not extradited, they would be subject to Colombian  justice. But, Losada said, bribes, intimidation and the killing of judges have  rendered the court system in this country impotent in cases against important  drug traffickers.  </P> <P> The traffickers will not change their corrupt and brutal ways of dealing with  the courts, and the judges will continue to be cowed, Losada said. "What judge  will have the courage to convict them or even put them on trial?" he asked.  </P> <P> As a result, he said, the power of the traffickers would increase.  </P> <P> "The narcotraficantes would remain in Colombia with their capital," he said.  "Then what could keep them from investing in big companies, taking over banks,  buying politicians?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Barco may have a compelling personal reason to reach an agreement  with the traffickers. One of their hostages is the son of his friend and  closest adviser, German Montoya.  </P> <P> But Losada said any official concession could be politically costly for the  Barco administration, which now is claiming victory over the traffickers.  </P> <P> "If the government gives in and relinquishes extradition, people will  eventually realize that the Extraditables won," he said.  </P> <P> A U.S. official in Bogota said that because the government now has the upper  hand, it is an especially inopportune moment to give the harried traffickers a  chance to regroup their forces.  </P> <P> "I think they are under tremendous pressures," the official said. "Their  organization is deeply disrupted."  </P> <P> And, he said, Colombia should not stop extraditions until it can build "a legal  system that has a lot of force and authority, and that is going to take a lot  of time."  </P> <P> The U.S. official acknowledged that willingness to negotiate is a strong  Colombian cultural trait.  </P> <P> "There is a very strong perception in Colombian culture that gentlemen are open  to negotiations," he said. "Even with your worst enemy, you are open to  negotiations."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, while the latest peace proposal by the traffickers has raised  some hopes for a negotiated end to the plague of "narco-terrorism," many  Colombians remain skeptical and cautious.  </P> <P> The newspaper El Tiempo warned Thursday that "this could turn into a Trojan  horse."  </P></p>

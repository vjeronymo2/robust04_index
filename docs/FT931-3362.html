			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): Blaming Japan for the West's failures TRADE WARS: JAPAN vs. THE WEST by Phillip Oppenheim Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 17.99, 241 pages ASK WESTERNERS why the Japanese have succeeded so spectacularly since the Second World War and their answer would come back pat: they cheat. The West is the innocent victim of 'Japan Inc'. The explanation may be balm to the West's injured pride, but this splendid book from Phillip Oppenheim, a Conservative member of the British parliament, demonstrates that the defendant is not guilty as charged. The Japanese have not succeeded because they cheat, but because they are exceptionally good at what they do. And what should westerners do in response? They should do what the Japanese have done: learn from those more successful than they are. Mr Oppenheim's book relies heavily on the pioneering work of others, notably on James Bovard's The Fair Trade Fraud (St Martins Press, New York, 1991). This does not devalue the book, for it offers a powerful polemic both about western trade relationships with Japan and about the state of the trading system as a whole. Not only is it true, as the author argues, that 'underlying the bleats about unfair trade is an unholy mixture of greed, hypocrisy and the need for good, old-fashioned scapegoats', but this particular mixture is explosive. 'The world trading system is in crisis,' argues Oppenheim, 'its plight caused by short-term responses to deep-seated economic and industrial problems, exacerbated by self-serving assertions by industrialists and politicians that the Japanese have succeeded by unfair means and must be responded to in kind.' What then are the reasons for Japanese success? These people actually believe that 'the prime objective of education should be to equip its people with the ability to earn a living'; they save twice as much as do Americans; their taxation is low and their budget has normally been balanced; their firms compete fiercely; and 'each year Japanese industry spends nearly Pounds ,7000 in fixed capital investment per employee - twice as much as in France or Germany and nearly three times as much as in Britain.' The prowess of Japanese industry reflects 'an open-minded willingness to adopt the best technology and practices for a given situation; an eagerness to enter new fields and markets as a means of surviving in the face of unrelenting competition; the high quality and educational attainment at all levels of Japanese industry; and a preparedness to take pains to make employees feel part of their organisation. Above all, there is the seemingly infinite capacity of Japanese managers to take trouble and to ensure that the customer is their chief priority.' The more open-minded western critics of Japan will admit some of this. But they will also point to the role of government and of 'export targeting'. Mr Oppenheim notes, in response, that what is unique about Japanese government is not its interventionism. What is remarkable is that its cajolings have often worked, the reason being that Japanese intervention has 'generally been geared to run with the grain of market forces rather than against it'. Before the ten-foot-tall MITI official replaces the ten-foot-tall Russian as the chief Western bogeyman, remember that the Japanese government has been neither all-successful nor all-powerful. 'The list of industries in Japan which grew without the benefit of any specific or significant MITI support policy ' argues Mr Oppenheim, 'is extensive and includes sewing machines, cameras, bicycles, motorbikes, transistor radios, colour televisions, tape recorders, magnetic tape, audio equipment, watches, calculators, textile equipment, farm machinery, robots and photocopiers.' Furthermore, what the West calls export targeting the Japanese might, with better justice, call comparative advantage. 'The more complex the manufacturing process and the more it involves a high degree of organisational effectiveness, the more successful and productive Japanese industry is relative to the West.' The list of errors goes on and on. Do the Japanese live in 'rabbit hutches"? No: 'the average dwelling space for each Japanese - at 870 square feet - is not much smaller than the average Frenchman's 920 square feet,' in spite of the shortage of suitable land. Do Japanese firms spend more on research and development than their western rivals? No: 'In 1989 Siemens of Germany had the biggest R&amp;D budget of any electronics company bar IBM.' Is the Japanese market closed? No: plenty of high quality western firms have succeeded within it. The lies have both a cause and serious consequences. The cause is that 'the more industrialists can convince the public how disagreeable the Japanese are, the more likely they are to win hand-outs and protection from their governments.' Their call is for 'fair trade", a notion which, Mr Oppenheim robustly declares, 'is one of the great intellectual frauds of the twentieth century.' Virtually all the western legislation designed to achieve 'fairness' in trade is just protectionism in fancier bottles. What then are the consequences? One is that western economic effort will be misdirected at trying to make Japan more like the west rather than the other way round. Far more important, however, are the poisoning of peaceful international relations and the erosion of the liberal trading system. Western attitudes towards Japan have been worse than a crime. They have been a mistake, one that must be corrected before it is too late.</p>

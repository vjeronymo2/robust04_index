			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: It's back to basics - Fiction EMPIRE by Terry Coleman Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15.99, 390 pages THE MOUNTAIN OF IMMODERATE DESIRES by Leslie Wilson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 15.99, 373 pages There is a peculiar fascination in the Popular Novel when it is well done - see Du Maurier, Shute, Fowles, and a hundred others. A sub-category, I suggest, is what I call the Accessible Novel, by which I mean a work of fiction which is not necessarily exceptionally good, which need not be a Best Seller, which does not expect a long life, which has limited ambitions, but which nevertheless gives pleasure to thousands of us. Of course, some of the finest novels are also utterly Accessible - see Waugh, Greene, Bellow, etc. The point is that the Accessible Novel is unashamedly not difficult, not obscure, not highbrow, and is above all a Good Read. We have two examples this month. Terry Coleman is an excellent journalist who has taken to writing a superior sort of historical novel. (The Accessible Novel has a fondness for an historical setting, perhaps because contemporary society does not lend itself to adventure, challenge, initiation, the exploration of uncharted territory - see Paul Scott, Patrick White. JG Farrell, among many others). Empire tells the story of the annexation of Texas by the US, which almost didn't happen in 1844. That may not sound like a rollicking yarn, but Coleman is a gifted writer and he makes a compelling tale of the largely diplomatic manoeuvres. It is always evident that the story is firmly grounded in history at a time when the US was extending its frontiers with a speed which many thought ill-judged, in the generation before the European powers developed an interest in acquiring colonies - Britain turned down Mexico's offer of California and, if this account is correct, Texas was there for London's taking. The central character is Sam Houston, president of the sovereign Republic of Texas, and most of the rest of the cast have their place in history - Andrew Jackson, for example, and Captain Charles Elliot, who is better known for his earlier activities in Hong Kong than for his role as British charge d'affaires to Texas. Coleman takes a risk with Houston because the man was larger than life, a great, even mythical popular hero, but he manages to pull it off, which is to say that Sam Houston rises convincingly from the page. The novelist invents a certain Lucy Moncrieffe, niece of the British foreign secretary of the time, Lord Aberdeen, but no harm is done and she makes a surprisingly uninhibited Victorian heroine. The test of an historical novel must always be whether or not it helps our imaginative understanding of an obscure and distant time. Yes, it does. Leslie Wilson also turns to the 19th century for her tale of an English youth and a Chinese girl in Hong Kong. The Mountain of Immoderate Desires is a bit more complicated than that: the man is convinced that he is the illegitimate son of Queen Victoria (by John Brown) and the girl is a Suchow foundling adopted by an elderly English scholar to help him achieve immortality with the help of Taoist sexual exercises. That sounds a pretty rich brew, but Wilson has a vigorous imagination and her novel, with its detailed canvas of Hong Kong a hundred years ago, is unfailingly fascinating. Unlike Coleman, Wilson uses fictional characters and they make a vivid gallery of the late-Victorian empire. It is a lively book, and a successfully one, even if the prose is sometimes clumsy. To resort to the simplest critical comment - I liked it.</p>

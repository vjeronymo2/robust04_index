Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, who had just completed investigation and study tours  in Hulun Buir, Hinggan, and Jirem Leagues, gave a report on his  investigation and study activities to the responsible comrades  of the autonomous regional party committee, people's congress,  government, committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and pertinent departments, and  gave opinions on the next step of efforts to deepen reform and  accelerate development. In view of the reality in Inner  Mongolia's reform and development, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized  that all localities and departments should further emancipate  the mind, seize the opportunity to increase dynamics of reform,  and promote development through reform to realize a big leap in  our economic construction in the new year.    Comrade Wang Qun summarized his impression gained after the  investigation as an excellent situation, but heavy tasks on a  long journey. He pointed out: This year will be a crucial year  for Inner Mongolia's reform and development. Guided by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, we should  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th national  party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist  market economy system, and correctly handle the relationship  between reform and development on the one hand and unity and  stability on the other. He said: No work can be placed on a  par with reform and development. Leaders at all levels should  enhance the sense of reform and fully understand that only  through reform can we have a way out. He pointed out: In Inner  Mongolia's reform this year, new breakthroughs should be made 1)  in deepening rural and pastoral reform, with the focus on  establishing and improving rural and pastoral socialized overall  service systems; 2) in the reform of industrial, commercial,  grain, and foreign trade enterprises; 3) in the reform of  financial and tax systems; 4) in the reform of banking,  investment, and price systems; and 5) in institutional reform.    Wang Qun pointed out: The key for state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises to transform the operating mechanism  lies in strengthening leadership. Leaders at all levels should  raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, refrain from  procrastination and reliance on and waiting for the assistance  of higher levels, and pursue development in the process of  deepening reform. If leaders fail to update their concepts and  if the operating mechanism and functions are not changed,  enterprises' endeavor to get rid of difficulties will be merely  idle theorizing. Comrade Wang Qun proposed that a leading group  composed of leaders of the autonomous regional party committee  and government be organized to strengthen the leadership over  the reform of industrial and commercial enterprises and  concentrate efforts on improving efficiency. The gap between  Inner Mongolia and advanced areas should be narrowed as soon as  possible through reform and development.    Speaking on Hinggan League's establishment of a green food  production base ahead of others, Comrade Wang Qun urged: To  conform to the market economy system, the rural economy should  undergo the transition from the past small-scale peasant economy  and small-scale production economy to large-scale agriculture  and the market economy. Based on market demands, cadres at all  levels should provide favorable conditions for peasants and  herdsmen to march toward the market, use market information to  lead peasants and herdsmen to the market, and take the road of  developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture and commercializing production. We should exercise  integrated management of foreign trade, industry, and  agriculture; make planting, breeding, and processing a  coordinated process; adopt the farming and livestock breeding  structure that coordinates agriculture, industry, commerce,  technology, and foreign trade, which encourages enterprises to  operation on as large a scale as possible and which suits market  demands; and make use of local resources to develop the economy  to turn advantages in resources into economic advantage.  Leagues and cities should accelerate establishment of rural and  pastoral socialized overall service systems, with the focus on  towns, townships, and sumu. Township enterprises should  diversify their structure and develop whatever conducive to  economic development.    After affirming the experiences in the reform of the three  leagues in eastern Inner Mongolia, Comrade Wang Qun emphasized:  Leaders at all levels should combine the endeavor of  emancipating the mind with the scientific approach of seeking  truth from facts and make an important step this year in the  reform designed to establish the socialist market economy  system. Enterprise reform should help invigorate state-owned  enterprises, and agriculture and animal husbandry, foreign  economic relations and trade, township enterprises, and  nonpublic sectors of the economy should be promoted. We should  select and send younger cadres of party and government organs  who are competent and know management to the forefront of  production and construction to help with the work or to assume  posts in order to promote the economic development of all  localities. Leagues and cities should coordinate improvement of  grass-roots units with institutional reform, transfer and divert  the personnel of administrative units and institutions to the  fields of production and distribution in a well-organized  manner, and raise office work efficiency. We should further  strengthen party leadership and persistently attend to two tasks  simultaneously and be competent in both to create a good and  stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic  construction. In accelerating banking, financial, and tax  reform and stabilizing prices, we should follow the arrangements  of the party Central Committee and the State Council, explore  bravely, and adopt new ideas, new measures, and new methods. We  should intensify research of policies to counter the new  conditions and new issues in Inner Mongolia's reform and  development, especially the issues closely related to people's  life. We should implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth  (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth autonomous regional  party committee.    Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the autonomous region, gave a  report on the investigation activities.    Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee and chairman of the regional government, and Qian  Fenyong, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee and chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, also  spoke.</p>

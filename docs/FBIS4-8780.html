			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- British UN forces  launched mortars against Bosnian Serb positions for the first  time Sunday, a UN spokesman said here, hours after a British  officer was shot dead in Sarajevo in what was believed to be an  accident.    The British troops fired four mortars from a Warrior tank  and  three flares after coming under attack at around 4:50 a.m. (0250  GMT) Sunday, said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  spokesman Major Rob Annink.    The UN peacekeepers' position near Kobilja Glava, around 10  kilometres (six miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital, was  targeted by Bosnian Serb machinegun fire and four grenades,  Annink said.    The UN troops had been "very, very vulnerable," caught in a  "position lower than the position from where they were  attacked," and hence had fired back, Annink said.    The resulting exchange was "very heavy," he said, but added  that no casualties were reported.    Earlier Sunday UNPROFOR reported that a British UN officer  died of a gunshot to the head late Saturday night while walking  through Sarajevo in civilian clothes.    He was killed after the city's 10:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) curfew  came into effect as local police checked his identity while he  was leaving a Sarajevo cafe, UNPROFOR officials said.    They identified the officer's body at the city's Kosevo  hospital.    The officials said they believed the death of the officer  was  accidental.</p>

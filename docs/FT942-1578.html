			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Zambia Consolidated Copper falls into red Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the world's fourth-largest copper producer, yesterday revealed a net loss of K72.6bn (Dollars 99m) for the year ended March. It had previously warned of a poor result. In the previous 12 months there was a net profit of K41.6bn. However, Mr Edward Shamutete, chief executive, said last month that although production difficulties caused a loss in 1993-94, ZCCM expected to break even in the current year and to be profitable in 1995-96. ZCCM, which is listed in London, is being prepared for full privatisation by the Zambian government which owns 60 per cent, but the timing is far from clear. Anglo American Corporation of South Africa owns 27 per cent of ZCCM via Zambia Copper Investments. At the operating level, ZCCM made a profit of K4.9bn last year down from K108bn. Copper production fell from 432,000 tonnes to 392,000 tonnes.</p>

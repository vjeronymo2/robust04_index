			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Monetary Fund has given Lithuania  the second part of a systemic credit worth $36 million on 5-6  percent annual interest to fund the government's economic  stabilization program. The first equal share of the credit was  provided last October.    The Head of the State Credits Department at Lithuania's  Finance Ministry, Ruta Skyriene, has reported to INTERFAX that  the money was given for 10 years with a five-year moratorium.  The 5 percent annual credit rate will be corrected quarterly,  however, it will remain under six percent. The loan will be  returned only in hard currency, she stressed.    In her words, although Lithuania's State Bank has been  negotiating with republican commercial banks on how the second  part of the credit should best be used, they have not come up  with anything of substance.    An IMF envoy to Lithuania Peter Cornelius has told INTERFAX  that the second part of the credit may go "to put the Lithuanian  commercial banks balance of payment in order."</p>

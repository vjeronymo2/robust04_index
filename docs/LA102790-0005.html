			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FARRELL'S VOTE ON SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> With their vote against a smoking ban, members of the Los Angeles City Council  place restaurateurs' wealth concerns above their constituents' health concerns  (Part A, Oct. 17). If the restaurant owners said the only way they could make  money was to use plates made from cheap uranium waste that would keep food warm  without using expensive energy, or perhaps asbestos napkins that would last a  long time and survive careless flambeau chefs, would the council still side  with the owners? The risks are probably no worse than tobacco smoke.  </P> <P> The argument that people will dine somewhere else might have had some  legitimacy in Beverly Hills where it's hard to be more than two miles from the  border, but that is not the case in Los Angeles. Our city should set the  example which would allow smaller cities the freedom to follow suit.  </P> <P> BRUCE CARROLL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Banks clash on role of managers The future of Britain's bank managers became an issue between two of the largest high street banks last night, as Sir Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, underlined their continuing importance. His remarks came just two days after Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays chief executive, signalled the increasing role of technology in providing customer services, such as loan decisions. In a speech as president of the Institute of Bankers, Sir Brian said he disagreed with the feeling that lay behind the suggestion that most credit decisions could be handled by computers. He said: 'Everywhere I go, customers, professional advisers and the media bewail the fact that good experienced people are no longer available locally to discuss problems and seek solutions.' Sir Brian used the role of the bank manager as an example in his argument that the main clearing banks were very different in their outlooks. Mr Taylor had suggested that while people wanted to spend a lot of time with the 'old-fashioned bank manager of myth' they did not want to pay for doing so, and that there were not enough skilled staff to go through applications in the way they used to do. During the course of last year, Midland put more than 200 senior managers back into the field. Sir Brian, who is about to retire as Midland chief executive, said there had been 'a substantial increase' in new business approaches. In response to reports of Mr Taylor's comments, Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds bank, said there was a large task in re-skilling bank staff, but suggestions of the 'death of the bank manager' sounded slightly premature. A one-day strike at Girobank planned for today has been called off after an improved pay offer to staff. The National Communications Union, with 2,500 members at the main Girobank office in Bootle, Merseyside, and a further 1,000 members at other offices across the country, is to ballot on the new offer.</p>

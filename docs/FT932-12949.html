			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Observer: Floater Could peace be near in the Beer War at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry? As Observer reported last Tuesday, Edward Leigh and Neil Hamilton, both of them Thatcherite ministers at the department, are at loggerheads over regulations that a pint must consist fully of liquid - the frothy head cannot be included. Hamilton wants to get rid of the rule as part of the government's deregulation initiative. Leigh is sympathetic, but as he introduced the regulation in the first place, he wants it saved. A compromise plan being floated is that pubs should become total regulation-free zones, able to serve beer in whatever measures they liked. There would be no need to check that a pint was a pint, and disgruntled customers could take their custom elsewhere. Such radicalism has obvious appeal to right-wingers such as Hamilton and Leigh. But it seems unlikely to win approval higher up in the government. Indeed, the plan has the look of being brewed up over a pint or two.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: New York's strength again inspires rest of the world WALL STREET'S strength inspired those markets open on Tuesday. All leading markets were shut yesterday. PARIS gained further ground, but the CAC 40 index closed below the day's high of 1,787.70 at 1,765.11, up 23.80 on the day and 16 per cent on the year. Turnover was about FFr3bn, swelled by end-of-year window dressing and arbitrage as index futures expired. MADRID also firmed. The general index added 4.13 at 246.24, for a gain of 10 per cent during 1991. Turnover was moderate at about Pta15bn, down from Pta27bn. MILAN encountered some profit-taking, but the Comit index still closed 3.21 higher at 507.76 - a fall on the year of 2 per cent. Generali dampened enthusiasm by falling L80 to an official close of L28,220, but it recovered later to L28,350. HONG KONG closed the year at a record. The Hang Seng index gained 22.13 to 4,297.33, up 42 per cent during 1991. Other Asia Pacific markets also rose, with AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index and SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial both ending the year up 29 per cent, NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 up 25 per cent, and KUALA LUMPUR's composite up 10 per cent, as KARACHI's index hit a record high of 1,672, up 33 on the day. JOHANNESBURG was mixed, as the all-share index gained 20 to 3,440, for a rise on the year of 26 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - DEC 31??  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        Hourly changes  --------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    10.30   11 am     11.30    12 pm   12.30     - 1076.53  1076.91  1078.22  1078.16  1078.72  1078.73  1079.41    -  --------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High   1080.24     Day's Low   1124.16  --------------------------------------------------------------------  Dec 30      Dec 27      Dec 24     Dec 23      Dec 20 1065.54     1055.30     1042.60    1026.29     1032.92 Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ??

Never Pay Cash  in America"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The FBI has investigated the  Ames case for two years. He was finally tracked down last  October when Ames took time off to visit his mother-in-law in  Bogota. It transpired, however, that Ames' mother-in-law lives  in the United States, while instead of Bogota her son-in-law  went to Caracas to meet a contact. It was also known that in  buying a house in Arlington, Virginia, Ames paid cash. [passage  omitted]    The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] refused to comment on  the incident. In his time, responding to a question from  General Volkogonov, who sought to justify the famous spy Alger  Hiss, FIS director Yevgeniy Primakov said: "The Foreign  Intelligence Service gives no information about who is or is not  a spy." This time it has done exactly the same. According to  an FIS press service official, all special services of the world  act like this in such circumstances. Meanwhile, FIS press  service chief Yuriy Kobaladze in an interview with INTERFAX made  a statement which can be seen as indirect confirmation.  Intelligence, he said, even in a changing world, remains  intelligence, with its own specific means and interests.  Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry Information  and Press Department director, said in a telephone conversation  that concerning the report on the Ames case provided by the  State Department, Moscow has some questions that should be  clarified through direct contacts between the special services.  "We believe," Karasin said, "that special services can  straighten things out especially since their cooperation has  been developing successfully."    U.S. and Russian special services are, indeed, cooperating.  One such sphere of cooperation is fighting drug trafficking.  Lately Ames' responsibility in the CIA has been precisely in  this area. Apparently the contact whom Ames met in Caracas used  the same "cover."</p>

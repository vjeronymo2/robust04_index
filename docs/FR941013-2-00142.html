			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Mass Media Development <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The focus of the proposals should be directed toward the development of a free and independent media. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs in this general topic fall under two training subcategories: working reporters and media business management. Preference will be given to mass media training programs which contain a U.S. internship component. For training programs in CEE, preference will be given to those of at least two weeks duration; they could focus on either basic journalism or business management techniques. Training, especially for journalists outside of the CEE capital cities, should emphasize skills such as effective writing, investigative reporting, objectivity, evaluation of sources, clear labelling of editorials and opinion pieces, conformance to copyright laws, and ethics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Media management training (both print and broadcast) should focus on management of media as a profitable business. Topics to be addressed might include management techniques, desk top publishing, advertising, marketing, distribution, public relations, staff development, accountability, and the pitfalls of journalistic advocacy, among others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Business Administration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While this topic is broad, proposals should focus primarily on management training, small business development (including incubators and Small Business Centers), agri-business, banking, credit practices, financial management, marketing management, industrial relations, and/or privatization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program design should clearly differentiate CEE target audiences, such as professors and instructors of economics, senior business leaders, government officials, or promising practitioners, and demonstrate how the proposed agenda addresses the selected audience(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USIA has a strong interest in programs on the development of business structures and the creating of jobs in non-urban areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should limit their focus to one of the CEE countries and to one of the three major topics: local governance, independent media development, or business administration. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible, but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA will consider geographic distribution in selecting grantee institutions to ensure a wide distribution of this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USIA encourages proposals which feature ``train-the-trainers'' models' the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines: Selection of Participants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process by which participants will be selected. Programs that include internships in the U.S. should provide letters tentatively committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to approve or reject participants recommended by the program institution. Programs must also comply with J&hyph;1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in the Application Package for further details. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON POST IN POCKET PHONE VENTURE  </P> <P> Washington Post Co. said Wednesday that it has joined with American Personal  Communications Inc. to develop a new pocket-sized, wireless telephone service  for the Washington area.  </P> <P> Maryland-based AMC is the general partner in the limited partnership, which  expects to begin testing an experimental phone system by year-end and be fully  operational by the end of 1991, the companies said.  </P> <P> Initially, the system would allow only one-way, outbound calling in Washington  and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs, much like pay phones. Such a service is  in use in Great Britain.  </P> <P> The companies could jointly invest up to $6 million in the testing phase, Post  spokesman Guyon Knight said. He would not speculate on what the overall  development cost would be.  </P> <P> The system is one of a number of Federal Communications Commission-sanctioned  experiments in "personal communications networks" that proponents hope  eventually will replace existing cellular and wired phone systems, particularly  in office buildings.  </P> <P> These proponents envision that someday all calls will be made not to locations,  but to people, wherever they are, who would carry tiny phones with them.  </P> <P> Wayne N. Schelle, AMC's chairman, said these new types of wireless phones are  expected to be smaller, lighter and cheaper than today's portable cellular  phones.  </P> <P> "Every member of a family or employee of a business will be able to carry a  phone in their pocket in the same way they currently carry their keys or  wallet," Schelle said in a statement.  </P> <P> The folding phones, which will resemble a travel alarm clock, may be sold for  as little as $75, AMC says.  </P> <P> Customers would be able to make calls whenever they are in range of  refrigerator-sized transmitting stations that would link callers with the  public phone network or to other users of the wireless system.  </P> <P> The system will use digital "spread spectrum" technology that allows a single  call to switch back and forth continually to whatever frequency is available.  The low-power radio signals will have ranges of only a few hundred feet, which  means they will have less tendency to interfere with each other.  </P> <P> This approach should dramatically increase the capacity -- and thus lower the  costs -- for a personal communications network, compared to today's cellular  systems, which use more power to operate over longer distances on a relatively  restricted number of channels. However, the low-power devices do not work well  in moving automobiles.  </P> <P> AMC got permission from the FCC earlier this year to test the new phone service  for up to 2,000 users, but the FCC hasn't decided whether to allot precious  radio airspace to these new services.  </P> <P> The companies said that if the FCC approves full development of the new  service, it will consider expanding to other U.S. cities.  </P> <P> Washington Post Co., whose holdings include the Washington Post newspaper, in  1983 won a cellular phone franchise with AMC for the Washington-Baltimore area.  The Post no longer is in that partnership, Knight said.  </P></p>

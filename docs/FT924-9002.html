			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Sport: Confessions of an Arsenal supporter - Soccer NICK HORNBY and I have a lot in common. We are nearly the same age. We both grew up in the 1960s in the middle class purlieus of London. As children we both found the idea of watching soccer incomprehensible. For both of us that changed not slowly but in a matter of minutes. My epiphany occured one dull Sunday afternoon in 1965. I switched on the television. A team in shining white was playing a team in grey. Before I could switch off, one of the white shirts flitted half the length of the field and popped the ball past the grey goalkeeper. Then he did it again, won a penalty, scored and opened my eyes to the beauty and excitement of soccer. He was Jimmy Greaves and I was a Spurs fan. A month later I sat on my father's shoulders in a crowd of 56,000 and watched Spurs beat Arsenal 3-1. It was my first game at White Hart Lane. I have been going ever since. Nick was a later convert. His parents separated and his father would take him out on Saturdays. In 1968 his father offered to take Nick to the FA Cup final but he refused. That autumn he relented and saw Arsenal beat Stoke City 1-0. In his book Fever Pitch, Nick writes: 'I fell in love with football as I was later to fall in love with women: suddenly, inexplicably, uncritically, giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring.' Fever Pitch is Nick's account of his life as a soccer fan and as an Arsenal fan, which he does not believe are the same thing. There are chapters on the England team, an account of his student fling with Cambridge United, but Arsenal is his abiding, dominating passion. He writes entertainingly and sensibly about watching the game, about the players, about the fans, about hooliganism and about the fans' relationships with the clubs. The book is also an autobiography: the tale of a life in which soccer has seeped into every waking moment. It is the story of his relations with his father and his struggle with depression which dominated his 20s, a period which coincided with barren, directionless years at Arsenal. Nick is now a book and television reviewer and, with Fever Pitch, a successful author. He and Arsenal emerged from the dark years together in 1987 when Arsenal won the Littlewoods (now Coca Cola) Cup. He says this was not coincidental: 'The symbolic value of beating Tottenham in the semi-finals and Liverpool in the final helped a great deal.' When I went to meet him I was looking forward to a chat about the game with an articulate, intelligent and - the book suggested - likeable fellow fan with whom I had so much in common. I was wrong. He is articulate, intelligible, likeable. But as soccer fans we have little in common. The book contained hints. My memory of my first game is of a sunny afternoon crowded happily together with friendly fans. Nick's is different: 'What impressed me most was just how much most of the men around me hated, really hated being there . . . nobody seemed to enjoy, in the way I understood the word, anything that happened during the entire afternoon. Within minutes of the kick-off there was real anger . . . as the game went on anger turned into outrage and then seemed to curdle into sullen, silent discontent.' He told me that he had only once missed an Arsenal home game while in London. He went with a girlfriend to queue for tickets for the Laker Skytrain. It took longer than expected and he spent the afternoon wrestling with a desire to leave her to queue while he went to Highbury. 'That would have been unforgiveable'. He stayed. 'Surely you felt virtuous?' 'No.' He refers constantly to the 'pathology' of his relationship with Arsenal. It is something 'unhealthy'. He has been in psychotherapy and is a highly-regarded writer, but he is still a season ticket-holder at Arsenal. 'I don't have as much invested in football as I did but is still provides some kind of backbone.' The book has struck a chord. Nick tells of two women who have written to him. Both have successful careers but Nick does not want to reveal their identities. One told him that only her parents knew why she did not attend her grandmother's funeral: she was watching her team. Another sends a fax every Monday to George Graham, the Arsenal manager, with her thoughts on the weekend's game. Nick says that when he looks around him on a cold, wet March evening when Arsenal are anchored in mid-table playing a purposeless match against dull opponents, he realises that everyone else has an unhealthy reason for being there. He says the intelligent way to consume soccer, the way he consumes films, is to select the best games and see them: 'Watch the big matches, stay away from the rubbish - surely the sensible way.' People mock when Wimbledon set a record low for a crowd in the top division. The wonder is that there are 3,500 people 'pathological' enough to cross south London in December to watch a club with little history or glamour play in rented accommodation against Oldham Athletic. There are hundreds of thousands like them; professional soccer in Britain could not survive without their support. Nick acknowledges his community with them, as he accepts that he has something in common with train spotters and others with socially-useless obsessions. But he also argues, as lovers do, that his relationship has unique characteristics which set it, and him, apart. He takes pride in the fact that the loved one is not seen as beautiful by others. 'We Arsenal fans know, deep down, that football at Highbury has not often been pretty, and that therefore our reputation as the most boring team in the entire history of the universe is not as mystifying as we pretend.' Nick insists that his love affair has shaped him. 'I can't have watched Arsenal for 25 years without it having some effect on my character.' I hope he was joking. Arsenal also offered Nick the illusion of community. He moved to Highbury and was disappointed. 'I thought it was going to be like those sitcom depictions of suburbia, with all the identical front doors opening at the same time. In my street it would be Arsenal supporters rather than commuters who emerged . . . and they would see me and wave, and I would immediately become a much loved and valued member of a happy, working-class Arsenal community. 'But no doors opened. Nobody supports Arsenal on my street.' A fan's life is one of disappointment. Arsenal are one of England's most successful clubs, yet that translates into three championships, two FA cups, one Littlewoods Cup and one Fairs Cup in Nick's 25 years with them. Eight moments of fulfilment to set against hundreds of failures. That is why the melodramatic climax to the 1989 season, when Arsenal won the League for the first time since 1971, was 'the greatest moment ever.' Nick struggles to find a metaphor. Even orgasm pales by comparison: 'Maybe if I hadn't made love for 18 years . . .' Last Saturday I saw Spurs play Liverpool, cherry-picking like Nick's sensible fan. It was another sunny November afternoon. White Hart Lane was packed - that now means 33,000. After 30 minutes neither team had managed a shot but I suddenly realised how much I was enjoying being there. I like watching soccer, especially my old friend Tottenham Hotspur, but I envy Nick Hornby the pain and disruption his love affair has brought him.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says  Cambodia's Khmer Rouge faction is a diminishing force that will  disappear like other Asian insurgencies unless it joins the  political mainstream. Evan Williams reports from Phnom Penh.  Senator Evans says the return of normality to Cambodia is  eroding what support that faction has left.    [Begin Williams recording] Ending his first visit since last  year's UN-sponsored elections, Senator Evans was unwilling to  say what impact he thought continuing support from some Thais  will have on the faction's future. But he said of [word  indistinct] a gradually shrinking force of just 8,000 armed men,  fewer even than last year. The Khmer Rouge is a diminishing  force, he says, with no credibility at all in a wider Cambodian  population. With the economy picking up that now seems true,  but observers warned supply routes into Thailand will allow the  guerrillas to survive at a low-level harassment for many years.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: RTZ shares fall on warning of Pounds 52m provision SHARES in RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, fell yesterday after it revealed that its 1992 results would include exceptional charges totalling Pounds 52m. The share price dropped 20p in early trading but later recovered to close at 651p, down 5p. RTZ said low metals prices were forcing it to curtail operations at its 54 per cent owned Greens Creek mine in Alaska, which produces zinc and lead and is the biggest silver producer in the US. About 230 employees are affected. The group said it hoped to resume operations at Greens Creek when economic conditions improved but meanwhile it would make a provision of Dollars 48m (Pounds 32m) after tax against the book value of its investment in the mine. Greens Creek cost Dollars 114m and started up as recently as 1989. Last year it produced 6.979m troy ounces of silver, 36,800 tonnes of zinc and 15,100 tonnes of lead - less than 1 per cent of the lead and zinc mined last year in the world outside the former eastern bloc countries. RTZ also revealed that Indal, its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary which is active in a broad range of North American construction-related markets, had been badly hit by the recession and, after exceptional restructuring costs of CDollars 38m (Pounds 20m), recorded an after-tax loss for 1992 of CDollars 58m. The group said it would be publishing 1992 results next month on the basis of the new financial reporting standards and would treat both charges as exceptional items. RTZ reported net attributable profits of Pounds 308m for 1991 after a Pounds 74m exceptional charge for replacing its copper smelter at Bingham Canyon, Utah.</p>

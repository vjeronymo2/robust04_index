Frightened residents stayed off the streets of Lome, which  was generally quiet after two days of shooting and artillery  fire that begun with an attempt Wednesday to assassinate  President Gnassingbe Eyadema.    The assassination bid and a subsequent attack on the Tokoin  military barracks where Eyadema has his official [residence]  left at least 40 people dead, according to government officials.    A military source told AFP that a police post on the border  with Ghana and several neighbouring houses had been destroyed  overnight by "mortar fire from inside Ghanaian territory."    "Armed groups" tried to cross into Togo during the night but  were driven back, the source added, refusing to comment on  whether the attackers were exiled Togolese or Ghanaians.    Reached by telephone, residents living close to the border  post separating Lome from its twin town of Aflao in Ghana said  that shots and explosions had shaken the area shortly before  1:00 A.M. (0100 GMT).    Early Friday, the Togolese foreign ministry announced that  it  had taken the Ghanaian charge d'affairs into detention and  called on the government in Accra to intervene against "armed  elements coming from Ghana." [passage omitted]    Lome was sealed off by soldiers, police and paramilitary  police, who stopped all vehicles at roadblocks as rumours of  "war with Ghana" spread through the city. [passage omitted]    Friday some fearful residents of this city of 600,000 people  said they planned to flee with their families to Benin, which  lies to the east of Togo, on the other side of the small West  African nation from Ghana.

Liu Jianjun, Wang Wenzhi, Li Wansen, Li Suanlao, Gao  Baguang,  and Yang Heping, who were guilty of stealing, are all peasants.  From August 1989 to April 1990, these persons committed crimes  alone or in a group on 54 occasions. They broke into the  warehouses of 47 residences, taking seven motorcycles, seven  bicycles, and a large quantity of articles for daily use,  including sheep, flour, rice, and clothes, totaling over 52,900  yuan. Of these cases, 45 cases were committed by Liu Jianjun  independently or jointly, and stolen money and property came to  a total of 51,100 yuan.    Cao Yukuan, who committed intentional murder, was a  temporary  worker at the Hohhot City Construction Engineering Corporation.  On the night of 19 July 1993, Cao Yukuan, in collusion with  another criminal, Guo Yongdong, attempted to seek revenge by  killing the manager of the corporation, named Shi. Carrying  military bayonets, these two criminals went to Manager Shi's  house. Seeing that Manager Shi was not at home, they broke into  the warehouse to stab the daughter to death, with over 10 stabs  to her chest, stomach, and legs. They also stabbed and wounded  Shi's wife named Guo and a neighbor by the name of Shi, who  rushed to the scene to save Shi's daughter after hearing her  cries for help.    Upon pronouncement of the court decision in the first ruling  of the Hohhot City Intermediate People's Court, the accused  refused to accept the referee's ruling and lodged an appeal. In  the second ruling by the regional higher people's court, the  appeal was rejected, and the first court's decision was upheld.    An additional 22 criminals were respectively sentenced on 26  January to death with a two-year reprieve or to life  imprisonment.</p>

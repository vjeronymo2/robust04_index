			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms aim to boost North Sea - Oil Resources This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. REFORM of the North Sea oil taxation regime was announced, with the objective of encouraging further development of oil and gas resources 'by allowing companies to keep more of the fruits of their efforts,' the chancellor said. The Treasury said the main proposals were: to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT), which is charged on UK oil and gas production, from 75 per cent to 50 per cent; to abolish PRT on oil and gas fields given development consent on or after Budget day; to abolish, subject to transitional arrangements, PRT rules that allow expenditure on new exploration and development to be set against profits of existing fields; to make other technical improvements to North Sea taxation. The rate of PRT on existing fields will be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for six-month chargeable periods ending after 30 June 1993. PRT is to be completely abolished for future 'non-taxable' fields. 'Non-taxable' fields are those given development consent by the Department of Trade and Industry on or after March 16 1993. The abolition applies to tariffing income from third-party use of assets and disposal receipts from asset sales as well as to oil and gas production income. Cross-field PRT relief for exploration and appraisal (E&amp;A) - setting the cost of E&amp;A for a new field against the PRT profits of an existing field - is to be abolished. This will apply to expenditure incurred on or after March 16 1993 except where the expenditure was both necessarily incurred under contracts signed before Budget day and incurred within two years after Budget day. Cross-field allowance (CFA) - setting up to 10 per cent of the cost of developing a new field against the PRT profits of an existing field - is to be unchanged for 'taxable fields', that is, fields with development consent before Budget day: and is to be abolished for 'non-taxable' fields outside PRT Tariff receipts allowance (TRA) is to be unchanged for tariffs paid by 'taxable' fields. Where a future, 'non-taxable', field pays a tariff, no TRA will be due in the service-providing field. Oil allowance is to be unchanged, as is 'ring fence' corporation tax (subject to Budget measures applying to all companies). Thus, for example, 100 per cent E&amp;A relief is effectively maintained at corporation tax rates. Measures will be introduced to ensure that future expenditure does not get relieved early, and thus at a higher PRT rate than justified. The rules on when expenditure is 'incurred' for PRT purposes, including in transactions between associates, will be clarified. Expenditure will be treated as 'incurred' only when the claimant has an unconditional obligation to pay another party the amount claimed. Rules will allow stage payments to be claimed, provided they are not disproportionate to the performance of the contract at that time. The rules on when expenditure may be allowed in a PRT assessment will also be clarified. Expenditure incurred after the end of a chargeable period will not be allowed (other than by carry-back of future losses) in a PRT assessment in respect of that period. Where losses are carried back against PRT paid in earlier chargeable periods, the PRT repayment plus interest is now 'capped' at 85 per cent of the part of the loss carried back to the earlier period. With the PRT rate reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, the 'cap' is similarly to be reduced from 85 per cent to 60 per cent. This will apply to repayments in respect of chargeable periods ending after June 30 1993, ie after the rate cut. Where losses are carried back to periods pre-dating the rate cut, the present 85 per cent cap will continue to apply to the repayments for those periods. Fields (or parts of fields) not within UK jurisdiction come into the PRT charge only in respect of tariff or disposal receipts. In line with the treatment of future UK-sector fields, future 'foreign fields' will be 'non-taxable' fields, ie outside PRT. Fields straddling an international boundary line will be treated as wholly 'non-taxable' fields where the UK part is 'non-taxable'.</p>

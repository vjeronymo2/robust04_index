			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Name of New Russian Ambassador </F> to United States Already Known"]    [Text] We have learned from informed diplomatic sources  that the appointment of the new Russian ambassador in Washington  has been virtually decided. The new ambassador will be  65-year-old Yuliy Vorontsov, currently Russia's permanent  representative at the United Nations.    It is expected that the presidential edict confirming him in  the position will be signed soon after Bill Clinton's Moscow  visit ends. The candidate for the new head of mission at the  United Nations has not yet been decided, but people on Smolensk  Square are convinced that it will be a career diplomat. Andrey  Kolosovskiy, who has been mentioned as the possible number two  contender for the embassy, will not be going to New York, since  he will soon be getting another assignment. The  minister-counsellor position will be taken by Vladimir  Chkhikvishvili, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North  America Department.    As is well known, another ambassadorial post -- London -- is  also vacant. The conviction is being expressed in diplomatic  circles that Britain should no longer be seen as a posting for  honorable exile (L. Zamyatin, B. Pankin). "The posting to the  British capital should go to a professional diplomat who is  dynamic and self-confident," a well-informed Foreign Ministry  source noted in this connection. "Candidates are being selected  at the ministry."    But, as our contact put it, it is still very likely that  London will go to a political appointee -- perhaps somebody  losing a ministerial portfolio.</p>

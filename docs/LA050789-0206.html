			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINGER BACKED FOR TOP CAR POST, TAKES SOME INSIDERS BY SURPRISE  </P> <P> In a move that surprised some realty insiders, a search committee formed by the  California Assn. of Realtors has recommended that the trade group's chief  economist, Joel Singer, be promoted to the CAR's top staff position.  </P> <P> Singer, 38, would replace Executive Vice President Donald Wiedmann, who  recently announced his plans to retire by the end of the year after more than a  decade at the head of the politically influential trade group.  </P> <P> CAR directors will vote on the committee's recommendation in July. Sources  familiar with the selection process say the board will likely rubber-stamp the  recommendation and that Singer would assume the job before the end of this  year.  </P> <P> The low-profile Wiedmann, a former San Diego real estate broker who was named  to head the trade group in 1978, led CAR through the booming real estate market  of the late-1970s and the tough early 1980s, when the number of dues-paying CAR  members dwindled and revenue declined.  </P> <P> Under Wiedmann, the realty group became more active in state and local politics  and enhanced efforts to improve realtors' public image.  </P> <P> Singer joined CAR as its manager of research and economics in 1978. He soon  began moving up the career ladder and is now the trade group's chief economist  and vice president of planning, research and economics.  </P> <P> The recommendation that Singer succeed Wiedmann surprised many of the trade  group's 125,000 members. CAR general counsel William Pfeiffer has been gaining  influence in the group for several years and was considered by some as the  front-runner for the job.  </P> <P> Some insiders saw the recommendation to elevate Singer as another sign that  realtors are acutely aware of the role politics and public opinion play in the  real estate industry.  </P> <P> Singer's staff provides assistance to members across the state on a number of  political fronts, including fighting slow-growth battles and other proposals  that the group feels would infringe on property rights.  </P> <P> Singer is also well-connected to many of the leaders of the National Assn. of  Realtors, CAR's parent trade group. The California association represents about  one-sixth of the national group's membership.  </P></p>

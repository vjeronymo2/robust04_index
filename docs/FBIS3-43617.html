Garcia Bires says there is solid evidence to  prove that South African rightwing groups are sending equipment  to UNITA, via Zaire. Bires says white mercenaries, believed to  be from South Africa, are fighting alongside UNITA in northeast  Angola. He refused to name the extremist groups involved in  aiding UNITA, but says it's a coordinated effort among the  rightwing groups. The ambassador's claims come as UNITA and the  Angolan Government are pursuing negotiations in the Zambian  capital Lusaka to end their civil war.</p>

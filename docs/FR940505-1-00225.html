			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requests comment on the feasibility of meeting an NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard of 1.5 g/bhp-hr for all engine applications, as well as on the need for the surcharge-based 2.5 g/bhp-hr standard. EPA also requests comment on the possibility of adopting an NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard of 2.5 g/bhp-hr for all California on-highway heavy-duty engines without a new vehicle emissions surcharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also notes that in the longer term, significant potential exists for low NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from different engine designs. Other possibilities include such engines as turbines and stirling engines, or fuel cell based designs. While such approaches may eventually offer attractive means of lowering NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, EPA requests comment on the possibility of commercialization of any of these designs by 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Hydrocarbon standard.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Heavy-duty vehicles contribute hydrocarbon emissions from both exhaust and evaporative sources. To deal with exhaust emissions, EPA is proposing an exhaust HC standard of between 0.2 and 0.6 g/bhp-hr NMHC. The 0.6 g/bhp-hr level represents what is currently being achieved by most diesel engines. Most 1993 model year diesel-fueled engines are certified at levels less than 0.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> g/bhp-hr total HC without aftertreatment. Also, two of the three natural gas engines certified by CARB emit no more than 0.6 g/bhp-hr NMHC. The 0.2 g/bhp-hr NMHC standard represents the current performance of methanol-fueled engines and diesel-fueled engines equipped with catalysts; for the 1994 model year, such engines have been certified at levels less than 0.2 g/bhp-hr total HC. On the other hand, most heavy-duty gasoline engines are certified in the 1 g/bhp-hr range. However, with the application of optimized three-way feedback controlled catalyst systems these engines should be able to reach levels in the proposed range. EPA requests comments on the appropriate level for this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to evaporative emissions, EPA is planning to extend the concept of inherently low-emitting vehicles (ILEVs) to the FIP enhanced heavy-duty vehicle control program. EPA's rulemaking for Clean Fuel Fleets established the ILEV concept of a vehicle that maintains low evaporative emissions without an active control system (58 FR 11888, March 1, 1993). EPA proposes to adopt an ``evaporative-free'' requirement for all heavy-duty vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVWR to avoid a trade-off of increased evaporative emissions for reduced NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions as would likely occur with the use of gasoline fueled engines in this vehicle class. Engines in vehicles under 14,000 lbs GVWR certified to the optional engine-based standards also would need to demonstrate evaporative-free performance. This assurance is needed because vehicles equipped with these engines would not be subject to any in-use I/M testing of the evaporative control systems. The in-use effectiveness of evaporative control systems consequently could not be assured as it would be for vehicles subject to enhanced I/M and associated standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualifying as an evaporative-free vehicle would require a demonstration that the vehicle does not have the potential for significant evaporative emissions when operating in high temperature conditions. The demonstration would have to show a maximum emission level of 5 grams for combined diurnal (adjusted to a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank volume), hot soak, running loss, and resting loss emissions, without an active evaporative control system. Diurnal emissions would be based on the engine and fuel system being exposed to ambient heating from 72 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; to 96  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F using 9 psi RVP fuel (or the parallel California requirements of 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; to 105  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F using 7 psi RVP fuel). Also, the evaporative-free requirement only supplements existing evaporative emissions testing procedures; vehicles currently subject to evaporative emission testing would still have to comply with all applicable requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For heavy-duty vehicles over 26,000 pounds GVWR, which already operate almost exclusively on diesel fuel, an evaporative-free requirement would prevent a potential market shift to fuels (such as gasoline) that may be able to meet the proposed NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards but have the potential of high evaporative emission levels. Further, the requirement would decrease the HC contribution from this class of engines as a whole by eliminating any current evaporative emissions. The heavy-duty vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, while relatively small in number, do consist of about two-thirds gasoline vehicles. EPA recognizes that the evaporative-free requirement may discourage the sale of these engines, however bladders and low volatility fuels could be explored as means of demonstrating evaporative-free performance. EPA requests comments on other options that could provide assurances that market shifts could not occur and that in-use evaporative systems for the gasoline vehicles in this class maintain their performance in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA specifically requests comment on an option that would establish a chassis-based certification option similar to that for heavy-duty vehicles less than 14,000 lbs. GVWR. Under this option, vehicles would be subject to enhanced I/M and other aspects of the enhanced light-duty vehicle program, including the fleets hydrocarbon standard (see the discussion of the fleet program under the enhanced light-duty vehicle portions of this appendix). Commenters supporting this alternative should comment on the appropriate numerical standards for certification, recall, and inspection-and-maintenance testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Test requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the proposed enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program, certification and enforcement testing of on-highway heavy-duty engines and vehicles subject to the new NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and hydrocarbon standards, including those medium-duty vehicles certified to engine-based standards, would be subject to EPA requirements. Exhaust emission testing would be conducted following standard Federal test procedures, with two exceptions. First, test fuels would be based on California specifications. Second, exhaust hydrocarbon measurements would be quantified as nonmethane hydrocarbons, or other fuel-specific equivalent. Assembly-line testing would be performed under EPA's Selective Enforcement Audit testing program as described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart K.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

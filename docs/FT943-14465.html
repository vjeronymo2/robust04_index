			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / France makes progress on the sale of Renault The French government yesterday took a step towards the privatisation of Renault, announcing that it was preparing to select banks to advise on the 'eventual opening of the capital' of the vehicle maker. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the decision was not an announcement of Renault's privatisation. But his statement suggests that the government is pressing ahead with plans to implement at least a partial privatisation of the flagship public-sector company, which is valued at about FFr40bn (Pounds 4.7bn). Last month, Mr Philippe Auberger, a senior member of the National Assembly's finance committee, said that the government was considering a partial privatisation, but no decision had been taken and such an operation would be unlikely before October or November. Mr Alphandery said the role of adviser would be open to both French and foreign banks. Competition for this mandate is expected to be fierce. Renault is one of the 21 public sector companies slated for sale by the centre-right government. But the timing has remained uncertain since the collapse of plans to merge Renault and Volvo, the Swedish vehicles group, at the end of last year. During negotiations with the Swedish company, the French government had committed itself to privatise Renault by the end of this year. The failure of the merger plan, however, and the dismantling of much of the existing alliance between the two companies, has complicated the privatisation timetable. Industry observers believe the government, which holds 80 per cent of Renault's shares - Volvo holds the rest - is now leaning towards gradual privatisation, which could start before next spring's presidential elections. 'It seems possible that they might want to sell a stake of up to 25 per cent as the first step,' said one industry analyst in Paris. But it seemed they had 'not yet made up their minds and might still go for a full-blown sale'. The sale is complicated by political sensitivities. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, has expressed opposition - Renault has been a symbol of state-ownership since the end of the second world war. Volvo's stake is also a factor, although a privatisation might provide it with an opportunity to reduce its holding. Renault in pole position, Page 30</p>

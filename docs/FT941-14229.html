			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Clarke says tax rises can be absorbed by recovery Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, defended his handling of the economy yesterday as the Inland Revenue sent notification to taxpayers of tax increases announced in the last two Budgets. Mr Clarke said the recovery would be 'checked' by the tax increases. But he insisted that the recovery was 'strong enough for those tax rises to be taken in its stride'. His defence of government economic policy was echoed in the Commons by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the face of renewed Labour claims that the government had broken its election promises on taxation. The government also threatened to expose further Labour 'smears', and widened its offensive against the Liberal Democrats. In a further indication of the government's determination to take the political offensive, the cabinet decided to mount a high-profile campaign for the European parliament elections in June. Mr Clarke told BBC radio that the tax increases would 'take a bit of the edge off consumer demand, which the figures show is much stronger now than it was 12 months ago'. However, he said, the impact of the tax rises would be offset by reductions in mortgage interest rates. He also gave his clearest indication yet that he is not considering a further cut in interest rates to ease tax rises or increase export competitiveness. Mr Clarke recalled that Lord Lawson, chancellor from 1983-89, was also urged by commentators and opposition MPs to stimulate demand by cutting interest rates. 'Nigel Lawson . . . would agree, looking back, that he had already reduced them too much,' he said. 'On that front you have to set yourself a clear idea of when you change interest rates and stick to it, not be influenced by what the papers say in the morning.' Mr Clarke said his judgment on interest rates would reflect 'what is right, not only to sustain the recovery, but also to make sure that over the medium term we take the opportunity of keeping inflation down'. Senior Conservatives said the improving economy would provide the background for a sustained offensive against the opposition parties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commonwealth delegation today met with the  Lesotho Government mediation group to discuss the current  situation in the country. The meeting follows an appeal by the  right honorable the prime minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, for both  parties to assist in resolving the crisis in the Lesotho armed  forces.    The Commonwealth delegation consisted of Mr. Max Gaylord and  Dr. Moses Anasu, who arrived in Maseru yesterday; and the  Lesotho Government group comprised, Bishop (Phillip Mukuku), the  president of the law society, Mr. (Tandiso Tlaudi), and Chief  (Masopha Seyiso). Further negotiations between the Commonwealth  group and the Lesotho military representatives were envisaged  today.    The meetings follow an uprising by some members of the armed  forces on Thursday this week which resulted in the fatal  shooting of the deputy prime minister, the honorable Mr.  Selometsi Baholo, and the arrest of four other ministers who  were set free later that day after negotiations between the  Lesotho Government mediation group and the military.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Gould raps leadership on employment and ERM LABOUR's failure to develop policies aimed at securing a return to full employment following the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism was condemned by Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow environment secretary. In speeches to fringe meetings, the Dagenham MP: 'I believe that the Labour party on this issue is to all intents and purposes brain-dead'. Mr Gould recalled that he resigned from the shadow cabinet a year ago in 'despair and disbelief' over its decision to back the monetarist strategy embodied in the Maastricht treaty, He complained that Labour's Treasury team had still failed to produce a statement on where the party stood in the wake of the ERM's collapse. Mr Gould called on the party leadership to end the long retreat in the face of Thatcherite policies by refusing to accept that Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement necessitated cuts in social security. He warned that ministers wanted to gain acceptance for the view that because benefits were 'too high' many of the unemployed did not take available jobs thereby exacerbating the deficit problem. Mr Gould claimed that the Tory objective was to drive down wages, by 'taking the floor out of the bottom of the labour market'. He insisted: 'On this issue we must stand and fight - we cannot afford to allow the Tories to soften up public opinion'. Mr Gould maintained that enabling people to return to work was the best way of reducing the PSBR. He also opposed ending the payment of child benefit to all mothers, irrespective of whether they needed the money or not. Ending universality would mean an extension of means testing, and inevitably a large number who needed help would not get it. Mr Gould said taxation should be used to get money back from those who did not need it. Meanwhile, Conservative party chairman Sir Norman Fowler last night claimed Labour was still a 'tax and spend' party. He said the 495 motions submitted for debate by constituency Labour parties showed 'at heart, Labour remains a party of more government intervention, higher taxes, vastly increased government spending and reduced choice'. Labour had failed to convince even its own supporters with its post-election attempts to 'ditch its image as a 'tax and spend' party and moderate its policies,' he said. He highlighted motions calling for renationalisation, the minimum wage, implementation of the Social Chapter and repeal of Tory trade union laws. 'The majority of motions on spending call for it to be increased and a large number argue that taxes should be raised for the 'rich',' he said.</p>

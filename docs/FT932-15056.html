			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land has 25.1% of Trafalgar HONGKONG LAND, the Jard-ine Matheson-controlled property company, has tightened its grip over Trafalgar House by taking its stake in the UK-based company above 25 per cent. It negotiated the early exercise by the Swiss Bank Corporation of its put option which may have required Hongkong Land taking its stake in Trafalgar above 27 per cent. Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land, said it had decided to 'end the uncertainty in the market' by winding up the option rather than waiting until it expired on May 3. 'We have now got to a level that we are happy with,' he added. It is to acquire 23.5m ordinary and 28.74m A shares, bringing its total to 25.1 per cent of Trafalgar's capital. Trafalgar's ordinary shares rose by  1/2 p to 79 1/2 p while the A shares gained 2p to 79p. Hongkong Land is expected to drift up, over several years, towards acquiring its stated intention of 29.9 per cent by taking scrip dividends. It is expected to press Trafalgar's board, when it meets on April 28, to appoint its chairman, Mr Simon Keswick, as head of the UK construction, engineering and property group. Mr Alan Clements, Trafalgar's non-executive chairman, took over the position last year as a temporary measure. Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'Hongkong Land's decision to negotiate an early end to the exercise creates useful headroom towards reaching its medium term objective by taking scrip dividends instead of cash.' This is expected to help Trafalgar's cash flow and its utilisation of excess advance corporation tax. Hongkong Land has undertaken not to lift its stake above 29.9 per cent or make a full bid until April 1 1994, unless a third party offer or tender is made or a third party acquires 15 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MAKING MOST OF BEING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE  </P> <P> Michelle Mauney prefers to be on the outside looking in. As it is, she's right  in the middle of things.  </P> <P> Mauney, a junior, is the middle blocker on the El Toro High School girls'  volleyball team. But she prefers playing outside hitter, as she has done on  club teams and in previous seasons at El Toro.  </P> <P> Because she is 6-foot-2, she will likely play outside hitter at the college  level. But because she is 6-2, she will likely remain a middle blocker in high  school.  </P> <P> "I'd rather be outside," she said. "It's kind of the glory position. But I  don't mind playing middle blocker, especially if it's against an attacking  offense."  </P> <P> Mauney, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is not consumed with fame and glory.  </P> <P> She is concerned, however, with getting enough attention from Division I  programs.  </P> <P> If Mauney continues to put up the numbers she did last week, she should have no  problem.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Mauney had 18 kills and five blocks to lead El Toro to a 15-5,  15-17, 15-9, 15-9 victory over Irvine. On Thursday, she had 16 kills and nine  blocks to lead El Toro past Dana Hills, 15-6, 15-11, 15-6.  </P> <P> Anyone would have trouble matching those numbers throughout a season. Mauney  was only averaging 4 1/2 kills per match before last week.  </P> <P> "She might have had even more blocks than that, but (Irvine and Dana Hills)  were both setting eight to 10 feet back from the net, virtually lobbing the  ball over her," El Toro Coach Mike Jagd said. "That may just be coincidence,  but Michelle is an excellent blocker."  </P> <P> Because Mauney is a junior, she can expect her numbers to improve next year.  Because El Toro has 10 juniors, two sophomores and only two seniors, she also  can expect the same thing from the rest of her teammates, which should only  help improve her numbers.  </P> <P> "We talked about (this season being a learning one) since we are so young," she  said, "but we've done so well, we're all focused on this year now."  </P> <P> Mauney has led El Toro to a 7-2 start and a 2-0 record in South Coast League  play.  </P> <P> "She's not what I would call a verbal leader," Jagd said. "But she definitely  sets the tone. When she's on, we're on.  </P> <P> "Her forte is blocking. She is a way-above-average athlete, but she is very  thoughtful -- real analytical on the court."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Page Bartelt swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead Capistrano Valley to a 14-4  South Coast League tennis victory over Mission Viejo Thursday.  </P> <P> Tracy Botha swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead El Dorado to a 10-8 Empire  League tennis victory over Esperanza Thursday.  </P> <P> Mandy Gomez swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead Rosary to a 14-4 tennis  victory over Westminster Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tara Kroesch had 15 kills and four blocks to lead Newport Harbor to a 15-1,  15-7, 15-8 Sea View League volleyball victory over Tustin Thursday.  </P> <P> Jenny Marques swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead Laguna Hills to a 17-1  Pacific Coast League tennis victory over Costa Mesa Tuesday.  </P> <P> Michelle Mauney  </P> <P> El Toro High School  </P> <P> Position: Middle blocker.  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 150, Junior.  </P> <P> Last Week: Mauney had 18 kills and six blocks to lead El Toro to a 15-5, 15-17,  15-9, 15-9 victory over Irvine, Tuesday and had 16 kills and nine blocks in a  15-6, 15-12, 15-6 victory over Dana Hills Thursday.  </P> <P> Season: Mauney is averaging 4 1/2 kills and eight blocks per match.  </P></p>

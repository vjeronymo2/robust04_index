			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Music in Tuscany NOT exactly a festival, the Incontri in terra di Siena (encounters in the Siena territory) nevertheless constitute one of the most enjoyable, musical enterprises of the Tuscan summer. Focused largely in the little-known Val d'Orcia, this series of chamber music recitals offers varied fare to the inhabitants of southern Tuscany (including many Anglo-American residents) and to visitors from other parts of Italy. After each concert, a fixed price supper - and the price is not excessive, considering the sumptuous and varied menus - is provided by the Fattoria dell'Amorosa, an elegant inn-restaurant, whose owner is one of the founders of the Incontri. These excellent meals in cool gardens have the atmosphere of a splendid, friendly party. And so, after an encounter with some fine music, the visitor can often encounter old friends or, in the relaxed cordiality, make new ones. The musical director is the cellist Antonio Lysy, grandson of the writer Iris Origo, who - with her husband Antonio - settled in this area some 70 years ago and then made it familiar to readers everywhere with her beautifully-told account of The War in Val d'Orcia and, later, her serene and moving memoirs, Images and Shadows. Lysy, who teaches at McGill University in Montreal for most of the year, assembles for these concerts an interesting, gifted and also homogeneous group of artists. Some - such as Jeffrey Swann and Jeremy Menuhin - are already internationally known. Others, perhaps less familiar to an Italian audience, are already well-launched on their careers. The opening concert, in the gently sloping, tranquil courtyard of l'Amorosa, was to have featured the European Community Chamber Orchestra, but they had to cancel their Italian tour on very short notice. Fortunately, the Soloists of Zagreb - who arrived from their war-torn country under difficult circumstances - were able to replace the defectors and performed with unruffled, admirable grace and precision. Particularly effective were Janacek's youthful Suite for strings and the Haydn C-major cello concerto no. 1 with Lysy as the stylish, understated soloist. Last year, the Incontri invited a contemporary composer - the Italian-Canadian John Rea - to spend a part of the summer in the Val d'Orcia and write a piece to be given its premiere in the course of this summer's concerts. And so, at La Chiarentana, in what was once the little square of a rustic hamlet, Rea's Canto di Beatrice for two sopranos and two cellos was heard for the first time. Based on Canto XXXI of Dante's Purgatorio, the work makes ingenious use of voices and instruments, sometimes blending them, sometimes setting them one against the other, contrasting long held notes for one of the sopranos with intricate vocalises for the other. Constance Novis and Isa Maria Turri were the sensitive sopranos (not always sufficiently audible in the dispersive open air). Lysy was joined by Eduardo Vassallo for the not-easy but intriguing instrumental part of the piece, which lasted about a quarter-hour. The seventh and last concert of the series was held in the medieval keep of the Castelluccio, whose once-stern walls enhanced spirited performances of the Mendelssohn octet and Tchaikovsky's string sextet Souvenirs de Florence. The loyal guests, after a final supper, left the broad green terrace above La Foce with warm souvenirs of a musically enriched summer.</p>

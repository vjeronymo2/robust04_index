			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley opens office in China Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday opened a representative office in Beijing as part of a widening involvement in China, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. The Morgan Stanley Group also convened a meeting in the Chinese capital of its 'inside board' to discuss business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. This followed an announcement on Monday that Morgan Stanley and the People's Construction Bank of China had formed China's first investment bank to facilitate capital raising for Chinese infrastructure. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, said the bank was devoting more resources to China because the country had become 'an extremely important component in Morgan Stanley's strategy for future growth'.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPRESS LINE: SORT OF LIKE CHICKEN, BUT BETTER  </P> <P> CORNISH HEN DINNER  </P> <P> Five-Spice Hen  </P> <P> Crispy Noodle Salad  </P> <P> Almond cookies or macaroons  </P> <P> Hot tea  </P> <P>  The little Cornish hen may not have the size of its chicken brethren, but it's  tasty and delicate, and it sits beautifully on any plate.  </P> <P> Until recently, the hens were available only in the frozen meat case and  consequently required long hours of thawing. But now you can buy them fresh.  This makes it all the easier to get away from the old roast-and-stuff-it  routine. Zapped in bubbling hot oil, the flesh is juicy and tender. Add the  sweetish flavorings of Chinese five-spice powder, plus a hint of minced ginger  and garlic.  </P> <P> If you have a great big wok or deep-fryer large enough hold the bird covered in  hot oil, cook the hens whole. Otherwise, cut the bird in half (or ask the  butcher to do this for you) and fry the two halves. A half bird seems to be an  ample serving for many people, particularly if you're worried about calories.  The cooked hens may be kept warm in a 300-degree oven until the remaining  pieces are done.  </P> <P> If deep-frying is too messy for you, bake the seasoned birds at 400 degrees for  10 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and roast for 40  minutes longer or until tender. We cannot guarantee the same results with this  method, however.  </P> <P> FIVE-SPICE HEN  </P> <P> WITH CRISPY NOODLE SALAD  </P> <P> Staples  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic  </P> <P> 1 small piece ginger root  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Oil for deep-frying  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon soy sauce  </P> <P> Shopping List  </P> <P> 2 Cornish hens  </P> <P> 1 small jar Chinese five-spice powder  </P> <P> 1 package rice sticks or mai-fun noodles  </P> <P> 1 small bottle Italian dressing  </P> <P> 1 small bottle sesame oil  </P> <P> 1 head iceberg lettuce, optional  </P> <P> 1. Rinse 2 Cornish hens and pat dry with paper towels. Cut in halves lengthwise  (or quarters if desired).  </P> <P> 2. Mince 2 cloves garlic. Peel 1 small piece ginger root and mince to 1  teaspoon measure.  </P> <P> 3. Rub hens with garlic, ginger and 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> 4. Heat oil in wok or deep-fryer to 375 degrees. Fry hens until golden brown,  about 15 minutes. Keep warm in 300-degree oven.  </P> <P> 5. Fry 1/2 package rice sticks, handful at time, in remaining hot oil just  until white and puffy. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Place in bowl and toss with 1/4 cup Italian dressing, 1 teaspoon soy sauce and  1 teaspoon sesame oil. Toss in 1 cup shredded crisp iceberg lettuce if desired.  </P> <P> 6. Serve fried Cornish hens with crispy noodle salad and garnish with cucumber  slices if desired. Makes 2 to 4 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (11): Banner ideas are brought to life - Developments in the US 1993 will be remembered as a banner year for mobile computing in North America. It was the year in which a whole range of technology trends turned into real products that users could hold in their hands. Technologies such as hand-writing recognition, pen-based control, radio-based data communications, cellular data and fax communications, remote PC and database access and fast, low-power computer processors made new mobile computing applications possible - and were at the heart of a number of new mobile personal computers. These included Apple's Newton - which makes heavy, although not always accurate, use of hand-writing recognition technology - and the Tandy/Casio Zoomer. This new category of pocket-sized mobile computer has been dubbed the personal digital assistant and has already achieved something of a cache as a 'must-have' for those few yuppies who survived the 1980s. Apple's biggest push on Newton recently has been with new functions. Although it has been on the market for several months - and sold more than 50,000 units - Newton has suffered from a lack of add-ons to connect it to desktop computers. The answer to this problem came at the autumn Comdex show in Las Vegas in the form of Apple's Newton Connection kit for Windows - which allows Newton to exchange information with Windows- equipped IBM-compatible personal computers. The kit was co-developed with Washington-based Travelling Software - makers of the popular LapLink software for linking laptop and desktop computers. In addition, Apple finally started shipping its long-awaited Dollars 220 Newton FaxModem card with 2400 baud communications speed and Group III fax compatibility. The company also co-developed this product - this time with communications specialists Megahertz - and offers it on a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association) Type II card. It is also clear that Apple - and arch-rivals Tandy and Casio - will not be the only companies in the PDA market for much longer. Canadian computer-maker Darius, one of the first third-party firms to use DEC's powerful Alpha chip in a desktop computer, has announced plans to develop a low-cost, high-powered PDA. Meanwhile, AST recently announced full details of a 1lb 'Zoomer-style' PDA, using technology it acquired from Tandy's Grid computer operations when it took over some of Tandy's computer business last year. Currently known as Model 2390, it will use the same processing chip and Geos operating system as the recently-released Tandy and Casio Zoomer products - while offering the Grid PenRight pen computer operating system as an option. Price is expected to be less than Dollars 1,000. California-based SunDisk has developed a 40 Mb 'flash' memory card that will fit in most PCMCIA II slots and interest all PDA and notebook computer users. While several hard disks in this size have been developed (including one from SunDisk), it is the first solid-state memory card with this capacity. It should start shipping by next spring at Dollars 1,995 - although that price is expected to drop as demand and volume increase. Newton and Zoomer both include personal productivity applications (such as diary, notepad and address book) and have spawned a number of add-on products that allow them to do everything from sending faxes remotely via a cellular telephone to acting as high-tech pagers. Even bigger developments are expected next year in this sector as Microsoft and a group of its hardware partners release handheld computer products based on a design standard known as 'WinPad'. Such products will use a cut-down version of Microsoft's popular Windows software, a proprietary set of low-power computer chips designed by leading chipmaker Intel and will offer pen-based control of the system. Like the Newton and Zoomer, WinPad systems will also provide limited hand-writing recognition and a standard set of personal productivity applications. Manufacturers currently committed to the development of these WinPad devices include Compaq, Toshiba, Motorola, NCR and Epson. Not all handheld computers have been designed for use with pen systems. In fact, one of the more popular digital assistants in the US is not even produced there - nor in Japan, for that matter. The Psion Series 3a handheld computer is produced in the UK by Psion, the handheld computer maker. Psion has been successful in developing distribution for the Series 3 range in the US since launching the original system three years ago - and the new Series 3a system is now available in fashionable US technology shops such as The Sharper Image. The Series 3a features its own built-in word-processor, spreadsheet, project management planner and speech recording features - and sells for less than Dollars 600. But not all US mobile computing development is in the handheld computing sector. There is still a great deal of activity in subnotebooks, notebooks and even luggable computers. At last autumn's Comdex, for example, one of the most notable new systems came from luggable computer manufacturer Dolch Computers Systems, which offers the world's first Pentium-based portable computer. It also happens to be the first computer of this size to use liquid-cooling to reduce the heat generated by the Pentium processor. A small fluorocarbon liquid pack is placed on top of the chip to absorb the much-publicised heat of the Pentium to a 'heat sink' system that evenly dissipates it throughout the system. It will be released in two versions - the PAC-586 and the A-PAC. The first is a straightforward, high-power, 20lb colour 'lunchbox', mains-powered portable, while the second will add a CD-ROM drive, sound card, a microphone and stereo speakers to enable it to handle multimedia software. Prices will start at around Dollars 6,000. Another unusual portable computing plan comes from DEC - which is talking about using a planned low-power version of its powerful Alpha chip in both a laptop computer as well as a PDA. The company says it is also talking to people in the personal digital assistant business - raising the possibility of handheld, Apple Newton-style Alpha-based devices probably running some form of the Microsoft At Work software architecture. DEC hopes that such a move would give Alpha the broad-based, high-volume sales it needs to make it competitive with other offerings.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Observer: Fine example The economics profession is out of touch with the real world and has failed dismally to predict the future. So said Paul Ormerod, chief economist at the Henley forecasting centre, at the British Association science meeting yesterday. Ormerod should know all about forecasting problems. In January last year Henley predicted the UK economy would expand 0.8 per cent in 1991. In fact it contracted 2.4 per cent. This January it projected 1.9 per cent growth for 1992. Output now looks like declining by around 0.5 per cent. Is this a case of self-flagellation, or is Ormerod offering himself as a suitable case for treatment?</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Jackson to quit Field Group Barry Jackson, 48, is quitting Field Group, the carton-maker which was floated on the stock market a year ago, following a management reorganisation which has brought in Chris Simpson, 44, to oversee part of the business Jackson had been running. The company says that Jackson, who has been with the group for five years and ran its Thatcham plant, is leaving 'to pursue a broader challenge elsewhere'. Simpson, an economist who has spent ten years in the packaging industry, will be responsible for the collective performance of the group's Newcastle and Thatcham factories. It is expected that he will be appointed to the board. He has been given the new title of director designate of the food and household division, Field's second biggest business. Keith Gilchrist, Field's chief executive, describes Simpson's appointment as an 'important step' in developing a 'market-led divisional structure which can also maximise benefits of scale'. Simpson's packaging industry experience includes stints with Elopak and Abbey Corrugated, part of the David S. Smith Group.</p>

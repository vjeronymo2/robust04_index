Sanit Worapanya, deputy permanent secretary of Commerce  Ministry, disclosed that the increase in the foreign  shareholding limit required amendment of the law to allow this  to be raised to 49 percent while the ministerial regulation must  be issued to fix the annual increase rate of the shareholding.  He said it is time to increase the number of insurance firms in  the country to pave the way for a major readjustment in line  with the new GATT agreement which is to become effective soon.  He said:    [Begin Sanit recording] The committee agreed during the  meeting that the law has to be amended to limit foreign shares  to 49 percent. Meanwhile, a ministerial regulation is needed to  fix the annual increase rate of the foreign share limit. For  example, the law will state that the limit during the first five  years is fixed at not more than 40 percent, and the limit will  be further expanded after that. Take this year for example, the  foreign shareholding limit will remain at 40 percent until 1999  and be raised to 49 percent in 2002. The annual increase will  be stipulated in the ministerial regualtion. All members agreed  that Thailand can no longer close its insurance market, and  therefore, it must allow more insurance companies to operate in  Thailand. The secretary of the committee has been assigned to  consult with the private sector, mass media, and the 20  representatives of consumers we invited to attend this meeting  to figure out the exact number of companies to be allowed to do  business.

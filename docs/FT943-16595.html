			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Fund managers warned on costs The profitability of the UK fund-management industry reached a six-year peak last year because of buoyant markets, but the industry's costs are also rising far faster than they should, a survey by Price Waterhouse concludes. In its sixth annual review of the fund-management industry the accountancy and management consultancy group says that pre-tax profits as a proportion of total revenues rose to 28.8 per cent last year, up from 18.1 per cent in 1992. None of the 41 organisations in the survey reported a pre-tax operating loss last year, compared with a third in 1992. The study found that costs rose on average by 4 per cent more than was needed to accommodate expenses associated with the rise in assets under management. The report concludes: 'While other industries have achieved productivity improvements over the last five years, it appears that the investment mangement industry has had a negative productivity improvement.'

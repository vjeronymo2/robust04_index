			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Small blow to the City - Tax on foreign interest A CHANGE to the way the Revenue collects tax on foreign interest and dividends paid to UK investors removes a small but in some cases important cashflow advantage for many stockbrokers and banks. Given the sharp rise in international investment over recent years, and consequently the greater flow of dividend and interest income across borders, yesterday's changes will affect large parts of the City - in all, 600 banks and brokers, according to the Revenue. In future, any financial institution handling foreign dividend or interest payments will have to deduct and hand overtax to the Revenue within two weeks of the end of the month when the remittance was made. That replaces a three-month gap, which had allowed brokers and banks effectively to support their cashflow out of taxpayers' money. Taking away the advantage echoes similar recent changes in the VAT collection system. And in another parallel to the VAT arrangements, the City is to take on the role of unpaid tax collector: the Pounds 1.6m that the Revenue has paid financial institutions to collect the tax until now is to be stopped. The changes caused some consternation yesterday among stockbrokers - particularly since the City is still awaiting the removal of stamp duty, promised in the Budget two years ago. and a move that would lift one of the biggest costs on investing in shares. The Chancellor yesterday remained silent on stamp duty, despite hopes in some quarters that he would abolish the tax immediately, rather than wait till the introduction of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's proposed paperless share dealing system. The government's own difficulties in introducing a legal framework for Taurus have contributed to the delays in the system, leading to calls from the City for immediate abolition. That plea fell on deaf ears.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTAGE INCREASES  </P> <P> An announcement by the postmaster general mentioned that he would seek another  increase in the cost of first-class mail -- from 25 cents to 30 cents.  </P> <P> What a hypocrisy on the general public.  </P> <P> For the past several years, an average of over 95% of the mail I have received  can be classified as "junk mail." I discussed this with my friends and  neighbors. It seems that they, too, suffer from the deluge of junk.  </P> <P> The postmaster general should treble the charges for this junk mail. It might  afford some relief to our increasing problem with finding enough landfills for  our waste.  </P> <P> OTTO KIESSIG  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

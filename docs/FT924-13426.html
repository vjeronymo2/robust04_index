			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ames to sue Wertheim Schroder AMES Department Stores, the US retail chain operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, yesterday launched a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Wertheim Schroder, the New York-based investment bank and its chairman, Mr James Harmon. Wertheim Schroder is 42.5 per cent-owned by London's Schroder Wagg. The retailer is seeking to recover damages in excess of Dollars 375m, plus investment banking fees of over Dollars 20m. It accuses Wertheim Schroder of breach of fiduciary duty, professional malpractice, unjust enrichment and other improper conduct, in connection with Ames' Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the discount stores division of Zayre Corporation in 1988. The suit also alleges Mr Harmon, who chaired the Ames board between January 1988 and June 1990 and headed Wertheim Schroder, breached his fiduciary duty during the deal. Ames bought the loss-making discount stores division in October 1988. It was a highly-leveraged transaction, financed partly by a Dollars 900m loan package. In the suit, Ames claims the 'enormous losses' from the Zayre stores and the inability to service the associated debt burden, 'substantially caused' Ames to file for bankruptcy protection 18 months later. Wertheim was a long-standing adviser to Ames, and Mr Harmon had been on the Ames board for over 20 years. Wertheim was also investment banker to Zayre and, the suit alleges, 'had been advising Zayre on various refinancing and restructuring options' since late-1987. The lawsuit alleges Wertheim was 'fully aware that Zayre privately had valued the (discount stores division) at far less than the purchase price that Zayre had proposed to Ames and that Zayre might be willing to accept a purchase price hundreds of millions of dollar below the price sought from Ames'. 'Nevertheless, Wertheim concealed these matters, or failed to fully disclose these matter to Ames,' claims the suit. Ames alleges Mr Harmon and the investment bank tried to protect themselves against claims of a conflict of interests 'through several transparently self-serving devices'. These, alleges the suit, included calling in Bear Stearns, another investment bank, to provide a fairness opinion, but giving the second adviser insufficient time and information to complete the task. Wertheim claimed the suit was totally without merit and would be contested. It said the discount stores acquisition was 'extensively reviewed by Ames and its board of directors' and its own role 'which was full disclosed and acknowledged by Ames in its written engagement of Wertheim Schroder, was entirely appropriate'. 'Furthermore, at our suggestion, each company retained separate investment banks to review the transaction and provide fairness opinions,' the bank said.</p>

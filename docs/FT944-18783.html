			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: IKEA remakes Swedish history For those of us accustomed to thinking of Ikea as that nice inexpensive Swedish operation that would sell us some bargain-priced household furniture and accessories if only we could find the place, it is something of a turn-up to discover that it is selling elegant copies of 18th century Swedish furniture. Ikea has traditionally been regarded as that paragon of Scandinavian contemporary chic, so democratic, so respectful of the taste of the the masses. The notion of it dealing in reproduction furniture is enough to send one scurrying to see what it is all about. What we find is an instructive example of how reproduction furniture has become entirely rehabilitated by the taste police. Not, of course, any old reproduction and certainly not what the late Sir Paul Reilly, the first director of the Design Council used to call 'ruptured repro', but reproduction furniture that comes with proper history and what in these circles is referred to in a hushed voice as 'authenticity'. Some of us have never minded too much about authenticity, preferring to rely on something much more primitive such as do we like it? Would it look good in our house? Can we afford it? It has to be said that Ikea's selection of 18th century furniture, a style known as Gustavian, passes almost all the tests. And it has 'authenticity' as well. The hallmarks of the style are a simplicity which tunes in beautifully with the 1990s mood in furnishings - floors are stripped wood, furniture often of painted wood, the colour scheme is restrained, relying on muted blues, whites, greys and yellow for light. Fabrics are simple, often blue and white checks, simple cottons and muslins. The overwhelming impression of the Gustavian interior is one of light, air and tranquil simplicity. The pieces Ikea has developed, in conjunction with the Swedish Central Board of National Antiquities, are the props that will bring this vision to life. Every piece was copied from one of the examples in a priceless collection of 18th century Swedish furniture in the old spa town of Medevi. Its future was under threat because of lack of funding until Ikea and the Swedish Board of National Antiquities struck a deal. Ikea would safeguard the future of the collection it it were allowed to produce faithful copies of the originals. Each piece has been made by following the methods used by Swedish craftsmen of two centuries ago and using materials that are almost identical. For instance, hand-painted blue and white china is made in the same province of China as the original pieces from the same sort of clay. Glassware is mouth-blown and the results are so close to the original that the reproduction glasses have had to be engraved to prevent them being confused with the originals. There is a wonderfully ornate and glittery chandelier, based on a 17th century version that hangs in an upstairs room at Sturehov Manor outside Stockholm. Then there are sofas, such as the one photographed above, side tables, bookshelves and chairs. Prices seem excellent for the quality on offer - the most expensive item is the Svenskund sofa which is Pounds 1,250, while the chandelier is Pounds 350, the ladies' writing table is Pounds 320, the four-poster bed Pounds 920 (excluding the mattress). Look out, too, for some hand-carved gilded mirrors, with or without sconces, at prices ranging from Pounds 59 to Pounds 295. It is only available at Ikea stores at Brent Park, Wembley and Purley Way, Croydon. A new book, The Swedish Room by Lars and Ursula Sjoberg (published by Frances Lincoln, Pounds 20), is a beautiful evocation of that way of life. Here are uncluttered rooms, peaceful, comfortable, frugal, yet elegant. Light suffuses the spaces, well-proportioned houses are surrounded by quiet woods, unpolished pale floors gleam in the soft northern sunshine. It is a visual feast for those who aspire to these gentle domestic interiors.</p>

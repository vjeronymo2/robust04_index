In this connection, the TRUD newspaper publishes opinions of  some Georgian parliament members. All of them point to the  importance of Yeltsin's arrival in Tbilisi. "Ruslan Beridze  hopes that the sides will find ways for mutually advantageous  relations during the visit," the newspaper stresses.    "In addition, Russia, provided there is a desire, can play a  decisive role in a just political settlement of the Abkhazian  issue." However, the legislator claims, Georgia's admission to  the rouble zone would mean for the republic the loss of a main  attribute of an independent state -- national currency.    In the opinion of Irina Starishvili, the solution of the  Abkhazian-Georgian conflict entirely depends on Russia after  Georgia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).    However, the legislator is against the rouble zone and  believes that, even if Georgia joins it, the state will be  unable to narrow the gap between prices and wages.    "The Russian president's visit to Tbilisi may become one of  the most difficult trips in Yeltsin's diplomatic career," the  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes. "The rouble threatens to  turn from a 'semi-currency' into a mixture of the Belarusian  `hare' (Eds: the image of a hare is depicted on Belarusian  currency) and the Ukrainian coupon.    "Geopolitical successes turn to be futile as soon as  attention is focussed on the domestic situation in Russia.  Boris Yeltsin goes to the deadend of the Russian policy in the  caucasus," the newspaper writes.    "The signing of an agreement on the status of Russian border  troops in Georgia will be an important element of the visit,"  the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes. "Let us hope that the  agreement will put an end to numerous `misunderstandings' with  respect to Russian servicemen."    The newspaper calls attention to the fact that "short before  the arrival of the Russian president, Eduard Shevardnadze issued  personal orders to return immediately all flats to Russian Army  officers, illegally seized by various armed detachments during  the recent strife".    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev stressed in an  exclusive interview with the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper on the  eve of the Russian president's official visit to Georgia that  "the military delegation will raise the question at the talks on  the responsibility of nationalist extremist forces whose actions  resulted in the death of Russian servicemen".    The presidential elections in the Crimea is another  important  topic discussed by Russian newspapers. In the opinion of the  IZVESTIYA newspaper, "Crimeans saw the way out of the crisis in  unification with Russia" by electing Yuriy Meshkov as president.    "The implementaton of Meshkov's election platform --  accession to the rouble zone, payment of pensions and wages in  roubles, a referendum on the status of the Crimea, solution of  the problem of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol and  establishment of a new union state -- will depend on the extent  to which the new president will find a common language with  statesmen from Kiev and Moscow and the extent to which his  proposals will be economically feasible."    The newspaper stresses that "two issues -- the problem of  Crimean Tatars and the status of the Crimea -- will be sources  of tension which the new president will find impossible to avoid  or put off".    Touching on the coming meeting between Crimean President  Meshkov and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA expresses opinion that "Meshkov ducks the question on the  need for holding a Crimean referendum on independence.    "He also avoids the question of concluding a treaty with  Russia on duel citizenship. Local analysts believe that the  Crimean president will not change anything in relations with  Ukraine in order to avoid unnecessary confrontation," the  newspaper writes. "It becomes evident that it will be difficult  for Meshkov to implement his election promises."    Writing on the same topic, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that  "there is no need for dramatising the departure of Bagrov (Eds:  Bagrov was a presidential candidate and former speaker of the  Crimean parliament before presidential elections) from the  political scene.    "Meshkov clearly intimated to journalists and voters the  next  day after his election as president that his position on the key  political and economic problems of the Crimea would not differ  much from that of his former rival.    "He does not intend to make a drastic reshuffling of the  government and administrative structures as well as to  exacerbate relations with Kiev and hence "to join" the Crimea to  Russia."    "What is the explanation for the present wave of crime?"  This  question was addressed to St. Petersburg citizens by the  sociological research centre in the city.    As many as 40 per cent of respondents attributed rampant  crime to dropping living standards, the same number -- to  passivity of authorities, 36 per cent -- to the loss of ideals  and morals and 30 per cent -- lack of discipline as well as law  and order.    Publishing the results of the poll, the SANKT PETERBURGSKIE  VEDOMOSTI newspaper notes that, although citizens did not single  out specially one of the reasons, growing numbers of respondents  point to the loss of moral ideals with every passing year.    The VECHERNIY PETERBURG newspaper reports that the St.  petersburg procurator's office issued a charge against Viktor  Kharchenko, the former president of the Baltic shipping line  joint stock society.    Despite expectations of his numerous supporters, the  ex-president of the joint stock society faces "an array" of  articles from the criminal code, providing criminal  responsibility for abuse of power and office, negligence,  forgery, evasion of tax payments in large sums and, last but not  least, embezzlement of state and public property on a large  scale.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gascoigne sale helps to quadruple Spurs' profits TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the north London football club, made the bulk of its first-half profits from selling players. The pre-tax figure multiplied fourfold to Pounds 3.28m (Pounds 810,000) in the six months to November 30. More than half the Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 9.22m) sales came from the disposal of players, including Pounds 5.5m for Paul Gascoigne. The share price, which had shot up from 90p to 113p this week, shed 12p to close at 101p as profits were taken. With Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, owning 48 per cent, and Mr Terry Venables, chief executive, 22 per cent, not much of the stock trades freely. Turnover other than player sales fell to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.36m). Mr Sugar said there had been fewer home fixtures in the first half and average attendance was down because of the recession. The newly formed Premier League had enhanced television and sponsorship income. Tottenham cut its bank overdraft to Pounds 2.41m, compared with Pounds 4.29m in May. Its debts peaked at about Pounds 15m in 1991, before a rescue rights issue underwritten by Mr Sugar. To comply with the Taylor report requirement for all-seater stadiums, Tottenham is about to spend Pounds 2m on its North Stand. Second half prospects have been improved by Spurs winning through to the quarter finals of the FA Cup. Earnings per share rose to 19.2p (8p).</p>

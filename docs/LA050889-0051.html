			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CANCER SURVIVAL RATE RISES  </P> <P> Survival rates for a common type of childhood cancer improved markedly at a  leading medical center after doctors started using chemotherapy more  aggressively, a study showed last week.  </P> <P> In findings presented at the Society for Pediatric Research's annual meeting,  Dr. Laura Bowman of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,  said the overall four-year survival rate for neuroblastoma has improved from  37% to 55% during the last decade.  </P> <P> Neuroblastoma, which originates in the adrenal gland or nerve tissue near the  spinal cord, is the most common childhood solid tumor after brain tumors,  Bowman noted. If the cancer is not caught in its early stages, it often spreads  to the lymph nodes, liver, bone and bone marrow.  </P> <P> In the past, doctors sometimes have been reluctant to rush childhood cancer  patients into chemotherapy because of possible toxic side effects. But about 10  years ago, St. Jude doctors started using several "front line" chemotherapy  drugs on neuroblastoma patients as soon as possible, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Since that time, the four-year survival rate for children younger than 1 year  old -- whose disease is often not as advanced as in older youngsters -- has  climbed from 48% to 89%, the doctor said.  </P></p>

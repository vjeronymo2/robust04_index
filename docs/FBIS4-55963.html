			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 24 (AFP) -- Troops from the mainly  Moslem Bosnian Government have stepped up attacks on Serb-held  positions in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  spokesman Matthew Nerzig said Tuesday [24 May]. The spokesman  said there were indications the fighting near Tesanj, a  Moslem-held town, "could represent a significant increase in  offensive actions" by the Bosnian Army.    A UN spokesman meanwhile said two Serb tanks had fired on  Bosnian army positions within the UN-imposed heavy arms  exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. The tanks  reportedly "fired from Mazovici, just inside the total exclusion  zone." UN military observers also reported "heavy shelling and  fighting" around Maglaj, another Moslem town 15 kilometres (10  miles) south of Tesanj. A spokesman surmised the fighting was  "a possible attempt by the BiH (Bosnian Army) to gain ground  west of the Maglaj pocket."    Further north, Brcko, under Serb control, had Monday  experienced a second consecutive day of shelling believed to  have been launched by Moslems. "There were 10 impacts recorded  last night in Brcko," a UN spokesman said. "We have seen some  significant shelling into Brcko and this is largely believed to  be the shelling of the BiH side into the town." Unconfirmed  reports suggested the shelling was designed to cut electricity  supplies to Brcko, situated in a corridor linking Serb- held  territory in Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia proper. Exchanges  between Serb and Croat forces were also reported at Orasje, a  Croat pocket of land northwest of Brcko.    Elsewhere, Bosnian troops shelled the northern Serb-held  town  of Doboj during Tuesday afternoon, causing damage, Belgrade's  TANJUG news agency said. Doboj, with its population of 20,000,  is an important regional rail hub. TANJUG said five people were  injured in two rocket attacks on the town Monday.</p>

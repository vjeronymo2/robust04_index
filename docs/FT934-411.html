			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Calculating the cost Some new issues are made with (say) one warrant for every 10 shares allocated, with only a price per share being announced. When shares and warrants are sold separately and at different times, how is the real cost of the shares and warrants calculated and indexed for the capital gain/loss calculation? The original cost can be apportioned between the shares and the warrants on the basis of their respective market values (on the quarter-up basis) on the first day upon which they are listed separately in the Stock Exchange Daily Official List. If need be, your tax office will tell you the apportionment factors for any particular issue. Listed warrants are included in the definition of 'traded option' in section 144(8)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, so they are exempt from the notorious wasting-asset rules. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares), but bear in mind that it is not up to date because of the Budget changes. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

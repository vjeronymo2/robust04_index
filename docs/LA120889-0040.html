			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH SMOG LEVELS IN 5 CITIES TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> Two anti-smog agencies and an American auto maker launched a study this week to  find out why an area of southeastern Los Angeles County that includes the  cities of Lynwood, Compton, Bell, South Gate and Huntington Park has carbon  monoxide levels more than double those in the rest of the Southland.  </P> <P> Last year, carbon monoxide levels in the area exceeded federal health standards  on 51 days, said Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality  Management District. The Southland area with the second-highest carbon monoxide  levels is right next door, starting in Hawthorne and extending south to San  Pedro and northwest to Marina Del Rey. Kelly said that area violated the  federal standard on only 26 days.  </P> <P> The AQMD, the state Air Resources Board, and General Motors Corp. are paying  for the three-month, $510,000 study.  </P></p>

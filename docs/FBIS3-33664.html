			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] After its meeting today at the  presidency of the republic, the Higher Security Council  appointed Lamine Zeroual as head of state, and he will keep his  post as national defense minister. Zeroual will be sworn-in  tomorrow. [passage omitted]    Zeroual, the president-designate and national defense  minister will assume several tasks in his capacity as head of  state. These tasks have been fixed by Article 13 of the  document of the national consensus platform [recently reached at  the national conference in Algiers]. Nasira Mennan reports:    [Mennan] The head of state has several authorities and  prerogatives: He is the commander-in-chief of all the Armed  Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national defense; he  decides and guides the foreign policy of the nation; he presides  over the Council of Ministers, appoints and puts an end to the  job of the prime minister, makes appointments in the civil and  military state functions, and signs presidential decrees. He  has the right to pardon, to reduce, or replace sentences. He  may consult the people through referendum on any issue of  national interest. He also appoints the ambassadors  extraordinary and envoys abroad. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Zeroual, the head of state and minister of  national defense, has an enormous responsibility, particularly  leading the country to safe shores. Chaabane Bounakel reports:    [Bounakel] The appointment of Zeroual as head of state and  minister of defense is considered an important political event  and a turning point in national political life. The man is  known for his honesty and sincerity, and he has secured the  respect of the public and the political class with its various  tendencies.    Zeroual is assuming a heavy task, and he should receive the  understanding, support and backing from all social and political  partners. This is a national matter that binds all and cannot  bear a retreat.    Just as his withdrawal from the scene was a rejection of  blessing a weak political system after the eruption of the  October [1988] events, and the bad management of the economy,  the abandonment by the state of its social role, the deviation  of some administrative organs, the domination of a narrow  partisan view amid the public, the return of the man at this  precise moment and after the convening of the national consensus  conference, all the more since he is both head of state and  defense minister, his return at this moment is in itself  considered the main guarantee for the national public in the  first place, second for political and social partners, and third  for the regional and international public.    For Algeria in a national consensus, which has not been easy  to attain, it has indeed found its way toward the transcending  of the trial and to move assuredly from the stage of the single  political party system to a new national system that entrenches  genuine democracy. The matter is not easy: Just as the  military establishment has provided categorical proof and  evidence of its goodwill not to spare any effort to get out of  the crisis, the political classes, particularly those deeply  nationalist and determined to meet the challenges, transcend the  crisis and give momentum to the wheel of the real change the  people want, these classes should drop any worn out positions  and practices.    This double appointment is not at all a review of the  withdrawal of the national people's army from the political army  as much as it is a respect for the will of the people to get out  of the crisis, and a way of avoiding the Army becoming a tool in  the framework of the political conflicts of any side. The  military establishment is a national school that forms tough  men, and these men will assuredly not retreat from answering the  call of the homeland.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS  </P> <P> California Amplifier, a Camarillo maker of electronic components for microwave  communications products, reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $404,000,  compared with a $224,000 loss a year earlier.  </P> <P> The company said its results are not likely to improve quickly. Manufacturing  problems, "resulting from the complexity of certain microwave products," led to  the latest loss, and "operating losses will continue through the second quarter  of fiscal 1990," California Amplifier said.  </P> <P> The loss in the quarter that ended Feb. 28 came despite a 33% increase in  sales, to $2.4 million from $1.8 million. For its fiscal year, California  Amplifier lost $649,000, compared with a profit of $220,000 the previous year.  Its annual sales rose 21% to $9.1 million from $7.5 million.  </P></p>

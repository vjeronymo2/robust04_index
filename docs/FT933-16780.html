			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Belgium warns of bigger EC problems BELGIUM opened its EC Presidency yesterday with a pledge to 'play by the rules' of the Community and a warning that the difficulty of enlargement negotiations had been underestimated. The two statements by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, underlined a shift in priorities after two nationalist-minded presidencies under Denmark and the UK, both of which pushed for speedy enlargement with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria. Mr Dehaene, who shares a passion for federalism and football, listed Belgium's priorities as giving life to the Maastricht treaty and strengthening EC institutions, particularly the European Commission. He also said he was favourable to holding an early EC summit in October, assuming ratification was wrapped up in the UK and Germany. But a summit required concrete decisions such as an agreement on the location of new EC institutions, notably the European Monetary Institute. The EMI is the precursor of the European Central Bank which will supervise the putative single EC currency. The UK is blocking a deal under which the EMI would go to Germany and some ministers are arguing that London's status as an international financial centre should give it control of some of its operations. Mr Dehaene warned that failure to reach a deal on the EMI could jeopardise the second stage of European Monetary Union, due to begin on January 1, 1994. A delay could lead to a repeat of the monetary instability of the past nine months which 'should be avoided at all costs,' he said. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, said he was enthusiastic about working with the Belgian Presidency. It was time to dispel the Euro-gloom and recreate the successes of the mid-1980s, a period of dynamic growth and job creation. Mr Delors recalled that an acquaintance from Harvard University had recently published an article suggesting that Europe was dead. But Americans had written off Europe in the early 1980s, and had been proved wrong. The Commission President, still hobbling from sciatica, said he intended to finish his study on European competitiveness by the Brussels summit in December.</p>

Ninety percent of the 10,001 taxis are said to  be involved in the three-day strike, which was organised by a  loosely- formed "union' and started yesterday.    Drivers are protesting against the Government's recent  approval of an extra 2,000 taxi licences, a move bound to  intensify competition. The drivers are also outraged that  Public Security Bureau and People's Liberation Army officials  often use threats to get free rides.    The strike went on quietly without any protests although  public security officers were on standby. Many drivers said  they were "just having days off". Violence was reported on the  outskirts of the city, where the windscreens of strike-breakers  were damaged.    Nine trucks were deployed outside the Shenzhen Government  building early yesterday morning to tow away any taxis trying to  take part in a blockade.    Traffic in Shenzhen was unusually smooth although passengers  had to wait slightly longer for taxis at the railway station.    "Even longer waiting time is expected on Saturday when more  Hong Kong people visit Shenzhen. Hong Kong people account for  about 50 per cent of our business," a striker said. Some  drivers said 90 percent of the ranks supported the strike. But  some taxi companies contacted denied any involvement. The  Government appealed to drivers not to take part in the strike  through radio broadcasts while some state-run companies  threatened to sack strikers.    The strike went ahead although Shenzhen Vice-Mayor, Zhu  Yuening, had held a meeting with representatives of the drivers  on Wednesday to discuss how to improve the operation of the  industry. A taxi driver who worked yester day said he had not  heard reports of violence against strike-breakers. "But, of  course, I am afraid. They can smash your car windows by throwing  stones while you are driving. Had it not been for my debts, I  would have supported the strike." He said he was also "ordered"  to do business by his taxi company.    One striker said: "Our business is made more difficult by  the  fact that some Public Security Bureau officers and soldiers  often ask for a free ride. If we object, they will use force.    The strikers are expected to lose about $1,000 business for  taking part in the strike. But they said it was worthwhile as  they wanted to vent their dissatisfaction.</p>

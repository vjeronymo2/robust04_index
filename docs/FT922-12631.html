			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Sega's winning touch in video games - A company which has ridden out the recession When other Japanese companies revised profit estimates downwards and expressed deep fears about the onset of recession, Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, also reviewed forecasts, and concluded that its expectations for sales and profits had been unduly modest. Having scored unexpected victories over Nintendo, the world's leading home video game maker, in the US and EC markets during the Christmas toy rush, Sega's only foes appeared to be the villains in its ever more elaborate software scenarios. But Sega this week lost a battle against an unscripted enemy, a US patent infringement action, and the Dollars 33m awarded to two inventors has prompted concern in the Japanese electronics industry about a spate of potential litigation from US and European companies and inventors. The Sega case follows a ruling against Minolta, the camera maker, which agreed last month to pay Dollars 127.5m to Honey well, the US technology company, after a court decided that it had infringed on patents for autofocus technology. About 15 other camera makers and electronics manufacturers face similar litigation from Honeywell. Mr Hayao Nakayama, the Sega president, and the architect of the company's rise to international prominence over the past three years, is clearly agitated by the Californian court ruling. He is angry that 'amateurs' are allowed to sit on US juries deciding on complex technical issues, in this case, colour image-displaying technology used in video games. 'We have concerns about the jury's level of understanding. This is a rather simple case and its clear that we should be okay. We had certainly taken professional advice before the hearing, and our professionals told us that we would win,' Mr Nakayama said. Sega now faces a dilemma similar to that of Minolta over whether to risk the company's US prestige in a potentially protracted and image-damaging court case. Minolta quickly settled with Honeywell after deciding that the likely returns of an appeal were outweighed by the possible negative publicity. The result of the case is already weighing down on the game company's share price. Tokyo stocks have risen by an average 0.5 per cent during this week's volatile trading, but Sega's price has fallen by 16 per cent since the verdict was handed down at the weekend. Mr Nakayama said that there would be 'benefits in a compromise for our young company', but he is confident that the case will be won. And he also shows supreme confidence that the company will be able to cope financially, if the appeal is unsuccessful: 'We have a lot of cash, and this would be a one-time payment.' That large pile of cash, about Y60bn (Dollars 452m), has accumulated as the company's sales have quadrupled over the past three years. Sega is forecasting sales of Y210bn in the year to end-March, up from Y106.6bn in the previous 11-month period, while pre-tax profit is expected to double to Y32bn. There are concerns that Japanese banks, burdened by bad debts and injured by the stock market collapse, will be unable to meet their corporate customers' needs for new lending. But Mr Nakayama said that Sega has no need for bank finance, and apart from a Y20bn convertible bond issue last June, is able to tap its cash flow. The company, dominant in amusement arcade games within Japan, is expecting to sell about 12m home game systems this year, up from 7.5m systems last year, and reckons that it will share the world market 50-50 with the hitherto all-conquering Nintendo. While the company has successfully ridden out the recession in Europe and the US, the downturn in the domestic economy has begun to influence consumer spending. Tokyo department store sales for March fell by 7.8 per cent on a year earlier, the largest real fall since 1965. 'In Europe, if you have a good product, then people are still prepared to buy it, in spite of recession. In Japan, the psychology has changed. Until recently, people bought whatever they wanted. Now it doesn't matter what sort of product you launch, it's very difficult to attract them,' Mr Nakayama said. Another reason for Sega's slower penetration of the Japanese home video market is that its game concepts have more appeal to foreigners than Japanese, a difference that Mr Nakayam presumes is cultural. Europeans and Americans, he says, like quick-hit, immediate gratification 'action games', whereas Japanese tend to be fond of 'role-playing' games. 'These games require more thought, more attention to detail. Japanese like to build little things. Some game maniacs in the US like the role playing type, but it's the common thing in Japan,' he said. There is likely to be more video competition in coming months, as Sega's success has prompted the larger Japanese electronics groups, including NEC and Sony, to expand their presence in the market. And Nintendo is upgrading equipment and cutting prices in an attempt to take back the market share lost over the past year.</p>

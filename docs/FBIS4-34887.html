If things are done for the good of  the country, "we will support it."    Acting President Guillermo Ford met at the Palace of the  Herons on 20 June with the PA president and top leaders, and  Mrs. Gruber proposed to the Molirena members who were present  they create a constructive alliance in opposition to  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' government.

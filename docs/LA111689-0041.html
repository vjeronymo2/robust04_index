			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> AGENT ORANGE CASH AWARDS ACCELERATED  </P> <P> A lump-sum payment of as much as $8,900 will be sent before Christmas to 9,300  Vietnam War veterans disabled by Agent Orange, according to an order signed in  New York by a federal judge. The payments, totaling about $30 million, won't  significantly change the total award an eligible veteran will receive but  provide a large share of the compensation in a single payment, court officials  said. In 1984, seven chemical companies -- without admitting guilt -- agreed to  pay $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam veterans  and their families.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Discharging the honourables - A lack of enthusiasm about the planned reforms GRIN AND bear it was the order of the day yesterday in officers' messes as Mr John Major announced his reform of the honours system. It was not a revolt over the effect of the changes on military decorations, but there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm among senior ranks of the armed forces about the way Mr Major's vision of a classless and meritocratic society was being applied. 'Are we actually achieving any great improvement?' mused one brigadier. But he added: 'I don't think anyone would die in a ditch over the changes.' The armed services have no wish to be depicted as diehard opponents of change. But by their nature they are hierarchical, and few felt strongly that the principle of different awards for different ranks was misplaced or wrong. 'There was never a great discussion about it,' another long-serving officer said. The hardest change to swallow is the loss of automatic knighthoods for those reaching 'three-star' level - lieutenant general, vice-admiral or air marshal. 'They don't get much else, poor things,' said a retired major general, whose army career ended one rank short of automatic knighthood. A former senior army commander commented: 'If he were an American you would give him a huge increase in salary, a thick carpet on the floor and a couple of extra secretaries.' So few make it to the top of their services nowadays that they deserved their knighthoods, he said. The number of officers on the active list in three-star posts and above - now about 50 - is due to shrink by a quarter or more in the cuts in the armed forces. Abolition of the two-tier system of gallantry awards, dating from the first world war, was widely seen as inevitable. Until now only officers could win the Distinguished Service Order. The equivalent for other ranks has been the Distinguished Conduct Medal in the army or Conspicuous Gallantry Medal in the navy or RAF. One step lower, the Military Cross, Distinguished Service Cross or Distinguished Flying Cross were for officers, while others had 'medals' instead of 'crosses' pinned on them. The only decoration available to all ranks, dating back to the Crimean war, was the top bravery award, the Victoria Cross. The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, with its separate military division, was also a first world war invention. Ranks below warrant officer, excluded from any of the classes of the order, earned British Empire Medals instead, for 'meritorious service'. They will now share the MBE awards with majors and squadron leaders - but not with higher ranks, who rate OBEs or CBEs. If the military is slightly aggrieved by the reform it is because it sets store by its special relationship with the Crown. After all, even the titles used for civilian honours - 'Commander', 'Officer', 'Order', 'Empire' - bear distinctly military overtones. And who should become a knight if not a cavalry officer?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What the honours shake-up means for the military  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Empire Medal to be abolished.

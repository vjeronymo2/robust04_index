			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): Japan: the tide turns MODERN JAPAN Sir Hugh Cortazzi Macmillan,Pounds 40/Pounds 12.99 242 pages THE JAPANESE POWER ELITE by Albrecht Rothacher Macmillan, Pounds 45 312 pages PLANNING FOR CHANGE: INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND JAPANESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 1945-1990 by James Vestal Oxford, Pounds 25 244 pages Until recently, studies of modern Japan tended to be of the awe-struck 'economic miracle' variety, with glowing accounts of post-war reconstruction, or, occasionally, dire warnings of the country's coming global domination. Then, a few years ago, the tide turned. The new consensus held that Japan was on the brink of collapse. As so often, the facts turned out to be less melodramatic. The miracle was flawed, but the descent to reality has been gradual rather than cataclysmic. The current deep recession is producing a more radical restructuring of the economy than previous downturns. After years of promises, political reform is under way. Society too is evolving, with previously unimaginable challenges to the primacy of the company in Japanese life. None of these three books was written late enough to take account of recent developments, but they each provide clues as to what sort of country might emerge. Sir Hugh Cortazzi spent 15 years in the British Embassy in Tokyo, most recently as ambassador from 1980 to 1984, and has written extensively on the country. Modern Japan is a thorough, factual survey of the political, economic and social institutions of the country. It is a compact book, a basic guide to Japan for newcomers. Ten chapters deal with the major themes: history, politics, government, law, foreign affairs, finance, industry, agriculture and infrastructure, employment and health, and education and culture. Each chapter provides little more than a brief pen-picture. At times the pace is too much. A thousand years of history is condensed into 30 pages. Its concise nature requires the author to dwell heavily on the institutional framework of the country, without too much detail of the way it works in practice. There is plenty of factual material on the basic political institutions  - parties, elections, cabinet, civil service - but virtually no account of the way in which those institutions have actually functioned in the recent past. No mention is made of either the Lockheed or Recruit scandals. Yet these two episodes tell us as much about Japanese politics in practice as any constitutional textbook. In the preface the author explains that the information has been selected on the basis that it is the kind of material he 'would have liked to have had as ambassador . . . to provide briefing for visiting ministers and officials.' This is its principal weakness. It is largely an administrator's guide. Even the sections on industry and finance begin with descriptions of ministries, not businessmen, as though only civil servants matter. Albrecht Rothacher's The Japanese Power Elite puts us right on that point. Rothacher is a European diplomat, who served in the EU Tokyo delegation until 1991. But his language is far from diplomatic. 'The country resembles a uniformed, almost fully functionalised work camp,' sets the tone. Meetings between Rothacher and his Japanese counterparts must have made for entertaining eavesdropping. The country, he claims, is run by around two thousand men (there are few women) spread across politics, the civil service and big business. Alas, however, the political upheavals of the summer have undermined that central proposition by largely removing from the troika the part on which Rothacher dwells most: the Liberal Democratic Party. Rothacher suggests that there has been a close community of interest between the three groups that makes their exercise of power 'self-serving and frequently corrupt', and he examines the nature of the relationship between the three. Its real strength, though, is the detailed descriptions of the power blocs themselves. First, the typical, ambitious LDP politician. In Japanese multi-member constituencies, electors have only one vote, giving scope for intense intra-party competition. To succeed in this rat-race, Diet members have to spend vast sums of money building up their support - donating to constituents' shrine openings, winning baseball teams, weddings, schools etc. There is only one source of that kind of money - big business. Thus the relationship develops. Since entry into politics is so expensive and exclusive, it tends to be a family affair. In 1990 41 per cent of the LDP's MPs were second-generation politicians. The political elite is literally self-perpetuating. Civil servants, because of the power of the great ministries like MITI and the Ministry of Finance, are full members of the elite. Though their profession is less nepotistic and more egalitarian in recruitment, its integration into the power triangle is assured, not just by its administrative clout and proximity to 40 years of LDP governments, but by the process of amakudari - 'descending from heaven', the practice whereby senior civil servants retire early to take up lucrative positions in business. With big business providing the funding for politicians to ensure their re-election, and then taking delivery of super-annuated civil servants, the triangle of power is complete. But is the existence of this elite the product of purely Japanese cultural or social circumstances, or are its roots principally political? Few systems could resist the encroachment of corruption after 40 years of single party rule. The swing of the pendulum in parliamentary democracies is the surest way of keeping the politically powerful members of society - politicians, administrators, and big business - honest. Whatever the political and ethical shortcomings of Japan's close-knit political and business systems, it has long been axiomatic that the intimacy of the relationship between government and business has been instrumental in Japan's post-war economic success. James Vestal's Planning for Change challenges that conventional wisdom. In an extensive analysis of the role of industrial policy in economic development, Vestal argues that the performance of policy has been patchy. While MITI and other government agencies played a key role in the reconstruction of the Japanese economy in the 1950s, their record in the 1960s and 1970s was less impressive. In the early days of MITI, government pursued a largely successful interventionist policy based on identifying and supporting key growth industries with enormous investment programmes, protecting them from foreign competition, but crucially, encouraging domestic competition. But in the 1960s MITI began to go wrong - abandoning its promotion of domestic competition and encouraging cartelisation. That damaged industrial performance by creating oligopolistic practices and leading ultimately to high inflation. In the 1970s, the economic policy consensus broke down and MITI's power waned. Today it occupies a relatively minor role in industrial policy. Vestal claims that MITI's success in the 1950s provides lessons for developing countries - that it can be efficient to protect and develop certain industries through government agencies - but he rejects the argument that the west has anything to learn from Japan now. There is a brief analysis of Japan's recent economic woes. The country's principal problem is now unbalanced growth, a surplus of domestic savings over domestic investment that gives rise to a chronic current account surplus. Industrial policy is powerless to deal with this, as indeed is macro-economic policy. The underlying cause is a lack of pluralism. In Japanese society the company is paramount. Workers put their own interests beneath those of business, with the result that wage settlements are too low. Only a radical change in the way Japanese see themselves in relation to their employers will resolve this problem. Unlike some observers of the country's economic problems, Vestal stops short of writing off Japan. I am sure he is right. The political earthquake of 1993 may result in a radical perestroika of the Japanese economy and society, with unforeseeable consequences. But the country is more likely to emerge strengthened from the trauma. After all, those who have already delivered the obsequies on Japan's might are often the same seers who have dubbed the next century the Asian century. Japan is unlikely to miss out on the fun.</p>

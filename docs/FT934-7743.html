			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (7): Starry-eyed optimism - Philip Gawith finds that business is looking on the bright side SOUTH AFRICA'S business community is either foolish, or possessed of great faith. Whichever the explanation, it is difficult to find a senior business executive who is not optimistic about the future. Considering the seismic changes occurring in the country, this is an amazing state of affairs. In part, businessmen are simply talking to their book. Businesses will stand or fall depending on how the country's fortunes wax or wane. With the alternative too ghastly to contemplate, they choose, understandably, to look on the bright side. There is also the punch-drunk factor. Businessmen reason that having lived through and survived the 1980s, there is little left to fear. Then business was faced with a government that did not care a fig for it, in a country experiencing serious domestic political unrest, and pariah status in the international world. Can things get worse? Clearly they can, and it would be wrong to suggest that business is possessed of a facile optimism at odds with events in the country. Indeed, there has hardly been an annual report issued in the past two years where the detrimental effects of violence and political instability on business has not been lamented. But people rightly treat the possibility of uncontrollable violence as a worst case scenario and plan from a more optimistic premise. More plausible a scenario is that a future government, set on advancing the lot of black business, could make onerous demands that seriously impede the ability of companies to operate freely. But this scenario is not given much credence in the business community. With the country just emerging from a four-year recession, businessmen are not about to let politics quench their ardour. Although some companies reporting recently have turned in good results, this has in most cases been due to extraneous factors, such as a weak exchange rate and lower corporate tax, or simply running a tight ship. But although trading conditions remain grim, business is keen to whet its lips again looking to the rise of more than 30 per cent per annum in corporate profits in the late 1980s. This optimism explains why the South African Chamber of Business's (SACOB) confidence index rose to a three-year high in October. However, there are some who believe next year's trading conditions will be poor because of disruption during the elections. Time could prove the business community to be starry-eyed in its benign assessment of the impact of political change. This optimism, however, is not baseless. While business and the ANC may not yet have reached the position of being ideological bedfellows, the toenadering (coming together) that has taken place since the ANC was unbanned has been remarkable. ANC leaders' diaries are chock-a-block with appointments to breakfast, lunch or dine with businessmen. Businessmen, for their part, are not averse to letting slip that they are on first name terms with ANC heavyweights. Indeed, one of the more interesting features of the 'new South Africa' is watching how companies try and position themselves for the future. Lining up in the robust corner is Anglo American, South Africa's largest company, which has always followed the adage 'We don't want to be loved. We want to be respected'. To its credit, it has never been afraid to stand up and be counted, and there can be little doubt that this has borne fruits. In the area of anti-trust for example, while the jury is still out on what sort of policy South Africa will eventually get, Anglo's muscular defence of its size has helped focus and improve the quality of debate. Others, however, favour the softly-softly approach, down-playing deficiencies in ANC policy and not seeing all differences as issues of principle that need to be confronted. Businesses normally arrive at this perspective by two different routes. Some have genuinely good relations with the ANC, the product of commendable liberal track records and a belief that they are dealing with 'good' men. Others are opportunistic, jumping ship after years of obeisance to the National Party. This is not necessarily a bad thing. They may lack principle, but they are 'operators' and their willingness to engage with the ANC has played its part in selling the case for business. Just as companies take different views on how they relate with politicians, so they take different approaches to how they should respond to change. All businesses, of course, are required to take a closer look at 'soft issues' such as affirmative action, black advancement and social responsibility programmes, safe in the knowledge that a new government will pay more attention to these issues. Although politicians may never be satisfied with business efforts, there can be no doubt about the considerable time and effort going into these areas. Beyond these issues, however, the scope to do business differently depends to a large extent on the business you are in. With production-driven business such as mining, the basic process of pulling ores out of the ground and shipping them to foreign markets remains fundamentally the same, regardless of political and social changes. Not so, however, for companies that interface more closely with the consumer. Here the battle is on to capture the spending of the emergent black consumer and this produces distinct challenges in product development. The consumer market, of course, is not the only growth market of the future. Indeed, optimists are inclined to argue that political democratisation will unleash enormous benefits for the economy as a whole. Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman of consumer industrial group Malbak, comments: 'South Africa's huge advantage is that enormous multiplier effect within its own borders, greater than anywhere except China and the old Soviet Union. The market traditionally only served 20 per cent of the people.' For South Africa's larger companies, a key benefit of political reform is that it has again allowed them to play on the world's stage. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman of Gencor, comments: 'If you have a good product you don't just stay in your home town.' South Africa's large corporates were, during the sanctions era, severely hamstrung. But the catch-up process has now begun. South African mining houses are swarming over the rest of Africa and in parts of South America and Europe, while industrial companies like Sappi and the then Royal Foods (now Del Monte International) have made large offshore transactions. Exchange control remains a considerable impediment to the internationalisation of activities, but South African companies are at least part of the hunt again. While change is the word on the minds of most businessmen, others also see a large measure of continuity - if not in the way they do business, then certainly in the challenges that face them.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "They Found a `Stash.' And </F> Immediately Shared It Out"]    [Text] Yesterday the State Duma began to examine the draft  federal law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" at its second  reading.    However, the previous day, Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the  State Duma Committee on Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances,  briefed journalists on his colleagues' stance. The deputy  stated that they had received about 300 amendments to the draft  law and studied them all carefully. The committee recommended  that the State Duma and government find reserves in the sum of  8.5 trillion rubles [R], mainly from foreign economic activity  and state administration. Mikhail Zadornov proposes that this  money be channeled into defense (R3.5 trillion for the purchase  of arms and equipment on a targeted basis), into the financing  of programs for the transfer, in Federation components, of funds  from the balances of enterprises and departments into the local  authorities' balances, and into research and development. There  was also some for the development of fundamental science (R600  billion) and for public education and the preservation of  cultural monuments (R130 billion).    Mikhail Zadornov believes that the development of the  economic situation in the first four months of this year  confirms the worst fears -- the decline in production is  continuing, collection of taxes is declining, and the deficit is  already equivalent to approximately half the expenditure side of  the budget. "The situation regarding nonpayments in a number of  respects is worse than in summer 1992, when the nonpayments  problem was at its peak," Mikhail Zadornov stressed. "That  means that the income side of the budget as a whole is in  jeopardy." According to the deputy, the committee refused to  pledge income that is not realistic.    Journalists recalled the words of Russian Government  Chairman  Viktor Chernomyrdin, to the effect that there are no "secret  stashes." And they inquired pressingly: Who is deceiving whom?  The chairman of the budget committee avoided giving a direct  answer and blamed the government for having no clear budget  policy concept itself yet failing to accept the legislators'  wishes.</p>

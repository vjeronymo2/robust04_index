			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENTS AND DESIRE FOR POWER  </P> <P> The June 11 collection of front page Opinion articles dramatically reveals the  darker side of governments around the world: the desire for power and the  efforts they will make to retain power.  </P> <P> The latest example is China, where our illusions have been totally shattered,  where we thought that democracy and reforms were the new political system.  </P> <P> In the United States the dynamics are similar and are obviously not limited to  political institutions. The revelations of corruption and environmental  degradation start at the top (Rocky Flats, Iran-Contra) and extend to Exxon and  others.  </P> <P> The desire for power, control and stability are obviously intrinsic to all  people and institutions worldwide, regardless of the nominal form of  government. Those decrying socialism or autocratic governments have no cause  for rejoicing. Our skirts are no cleaner than anyone else's.  </P> <P> The only solution (and one we are fortunate enough to have) is a system where  citizens are an intrinsic part of the political and economic process. The  problem with paternalistic governments, whether they be socialistic,  authoritarian or nominally democratic, is that the average citizen is outside  of the political process.  </P> <P> When citizen involvement is absent, power becomes concentrated and trouble is  sure to follow.  </P> <P> The reality seems to be that for political freedom to persist, it is necessary  that unceasing citizen effort be expanded. We need to vote, participate in the  political process and most importantly, base our decisions and activities on  principles that will guarantee political freedom, individual rights and  environmental integrity. This is very hard work, but we have now a world where  this kind of work is not being done. The negative results are obvious.  </P> <P> NICHOLAS R. RAY  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

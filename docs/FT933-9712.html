			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: Did hunting make us human? - Michael Thompson-Noel finds a lot to grouse about A VIEW TO A DEATH IN THE MORNING by Matt Cartmill Harvard Pounds 23.95, 331 pages I HATE hunting and huntsmen. At least I think I do. Certainly I hate violence. And the thought of killing things - foxes, game-birds, polar bears, people - makes me glow with fury. I believe that huntsmen are primitives: viciously non-intelligent throw-backs to the time when our ancestors first came down from the trees. I believe them to be prisoners of the same gorily malfunctioning maleness that leads to wars and death camps. If you ask me, they have grievous sexual hang-ups. I would like to stamp on their faces, shoot them, poison them, spear them and boil them up. On the other hand, I am in the grip of the notion that humans are only animals: that we are only chimpanzees and that we have a long way to go, evolutionarily speaking, before our achievements and our traits signify any real divergence from the rest of the animal kingdom. It follows, from this, that although I hate huntsmen - would like to stab and gas them - I somehow absolve them: they are prisoners of their genes. Confusing? Then you ought to read this excellent book, to discover just how confusing the subject of hunting and human nature really is. Matt Cartmill is a professor in the department of biological anthropology and anatomy at Duke University in the US, and his book a brilliantly well-realised study of the connections that have been drawn between hunting and being human. As he states at the outset: 'It deals above all with the hunting hypothesis of human origins, which is the story of how some apes became human when they took up weapons and began to kill. The killer-ape story has roots in older tales, and so this book is in part a literary history. But it is also a book about science, because scientists have been the chief tellers of that story.' The professor starts his story near its end, by tracing the rise and ascendancy of the hunting hypothesis - our notion of homo sapiens as lunatic killer apes - in anthropological thought after the end of the second world war. The hypothesis collapsed during the 1970s, and Cartmill asks why such a flimsy story, with such unpalatable implications, was accepted for so long. 'What do we get out of seeing ourselves as sick, disordered animals - and why should anyone think that the origins of our sickness are somehow tied to hunting?' His arguments - and answers - cover Greek myth and literature; the impact of Christian revisionism; the emergence, in the Renaissance, of the view of the hunt as symbol of tyranny and object of moral indignation; the link, from the 17th century, between the growth of anti-hunting sentiment and the growth of science; the blurring of boundaries between people and beasts; the Romantic reaction against science; the Darwinian view of nature as - in fact  -a struggle for existence (cited as a justification for hunting); and the 'Bambi syndrome' - fear of war mingled with Romantic reverence for nature and Freudian pessimism about man. At the end, the good professor expresses doubts about the meaning and reality of the distinctions we draw between artifice and nature, and between people and animals. Was hunting really an important factor in human origins? The author says it is a safe bet that hunting assumed an increased importance during the course of our evolution from our chimpanzee-like ancestors. But he says there is nothing to imply that hunting made us human. On the other hand: 'Even if hunting does not have the causal importance that anthropologists once attributed to it, it may still be linked to some essential human taint, some fundamental disorder or sickness that makes the human condition peculiarly tragic or dangerous. If so, we ought not to disregard the myth of the killer ape.' Professor Shipman is justifiably regarded as an extremely important evolutionary essayist - one whose hallmarks are erudition, stylishness, wit and piercing humanity. He really is a good chimpanzee. In five days' time, members of the numskull upper English and Scottish class, their grubby clients in tow, will be poncing across the moorland and cocking their firearms for the 'Glorious Twelfth' - the start of the grouse-shooting season. The experience will cost them a fortune. For a fraction of the cost, they could buy this book and start to get an education. But I don't suppose they will.</p>

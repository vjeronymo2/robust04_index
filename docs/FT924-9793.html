			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Confidence in Germany at a 10-year low THE mood in German business and industry is gloomier than at any stage for 10 years, and talk is openly of recession, according to the annual survey of business opinion by the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT). The poll covering more than 25,000 enterprises in both east and west of the country shows that the number believing the current state of the economy is good has halved in the past year, from 44 per cent to 22 per cent. The number judging it bad has more than doubled, from 11 to 25 per cent. The same gloomy picture emerges from employment forecasts - with 32 per cent expecting to cut their payrolls, against 9 per cent promising expansion. 'For German business, 1993 will be a tough year,' Dr Franz Schoser, chief executive of the DIHT, said yesterday. 'Since the unification boom is over, a recession can no longer be ruled out. 'For the coming months, we see no chance of a fundamental change in economic growth prospects.' German industry is equally pessimistic about export prospects, because of the stagnating international economy, and expected the appreciation of the D-Mark within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to curb them further, he said. The one ray of light spelt out by the survey is that investment plans in eastern Germany are expected to continue to increase - in spite of the latest decisions by Mercedes-Benz and Krupp to shelve big plans for expansion there. Just 19 per cent of west German enterprises expect the economic situation next year to improve, whereas 31 per cent expect it to get worse. Dr Schoser suggested that the recent report of the five German economic research institutes might be over-optimistic in expecting the beginning of a recovery after the second quarter of 1993. In east Germany, the mood of enterprises has become more cautious in the last six months, although it is more hopeful than last year. The survey expects the pace of job losses to slow down, although the process of large-scale structural change has by no means finished. The survey identifies the main factors cited by investors as a brake on investment in eastern Germany. Western industrial investors put legal uncertainty top (38 per cent said so), followed by the lack of administrative capacity, lack of infrastructure, and the burden of environmental damage. East German investors cited lack of access to finance as by far the greatest problem (70 per cent of industrial enterprises, although only 35 per cent of commercial concerns). Within west Germany, the only region with an overall positive expectation in the coming year was Hamburg. FAG, the large German ball-bearing producer, yesterday announced the closure of its subsidiary in east Berlin with the loss of 470 jobs. The east Berlin company had losses this year of DM22m (Pounds 8.9m) on sales of DM18m. IBM Deutschland said it would cease hardware production at its west Berlin plant which would be converted to software output and service. About 150 jobs will be lost.</p>

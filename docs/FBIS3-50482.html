			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Jaime Yoshiyama Tanaka, president of the Peruvian </F> Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), at the ceremony  promulgating the new Constitution at the Lima Government  Palace--live]    [Text] Mr. President of the Republic of Peru, ladies and  gentlemen: A year ago during the solemn ceremony installing the  CCD, we pledged to draft a new Constitution that would serve as  an efficient instrument to build a modern country with liberty  and justice for all Peruvians. Today, as a result of the  outcome of the referendum, which expressed the people's solemn  mandate, we proclaim that the new Peruvian Constitution is in  force. [applause]    This Constitution, which for the first time in the history  of  our Republic, has the backing of the people's vote, is  democratic, functional, and aimed at bolstering the development  of current and future generations.    The electoral process, which was held openly and within the  framework of unrestricted liberty, showed the maturity and  civic- mindedness of the public which participated in a broad  debate throughout the country to take a stand on the  Congress-approved constitutional draft bill.    We are convinced that the referendum was a historic landmark  for the consolidation of our democracy, and Peru was the single  winner. We have left behind past frustrations to forge a viable  country with opportunities in which all Peruvians will grow.  The new Constitution ratifies our belief in democracy as a way  of life that guarantees and encourages the people's freedom,  human rights, and dignity. The new Constitution reflects the  people's wish expressed in the elections to choose the current  Congress, which voted for the state branches' modernity,  efficiency, and moralization.    We have reduced the government's size and excessive  interventionism to transfer greater responsibility to civilian  institutions, to free up human resources, and to boost the  social market system without interference. As of now, the state  will fulfill three objectives: First, it will be a promoter  state; that is, it will work toward economic development and  well-being for the population. Second, it will act as a  regulator to secure the foundations of real competition without  privileges, as well as to protect workers, the elderly, mothers,  and children. Third, the state will also be a compensator  state, seeking social equity.    We have established a single chamber Congress with 120  members, which is the most appropriate system for our needs.  Similar to the current Congress, the new Congress will have the  advantage of being swifter and more efficient in debates and  legislative production as well as being able to exert political  control and supervise the handling of public affairs. The  judicial branch, whose restoration and autonomy is essential for  the balance of the democratic system and for the working of the  country, will be freed in the appointment of its magistrates of  all possible forms of political interference, be it from the  executive branch or Congress.    The appointment of judges and prosecutors, at all levels,  will be the decision of the National Council of Magistrates,  which will begin its duties when it completes the task that we  have entrusted to the Honor Tribunal. The praiseworthy work of  its five honorable members will soon become evident in the  appointment of prosecutors and judges. The country's pride,  prestige, and faith in the justice system will be restored with  these appointments.    The economic regime, which was conceived within a pluralist  system, is based on private enterprise, whether big or small, as  the center of development in a market system that is free,  competitive, and open to international trade in order to  guarantee a dynamic and sustained growth.    We are convinced that our juridical framework will allow us  to attract foreign investments. We are treating both national  and foreign investments equally to open more jobs, close the  existing gap, educate better our children, offer better  services, and, in sum, bring progress to the country.    We have thus acted with foresight and realism. Past  ideological battles are being replaced, almost everywhere in the  world, with a more pragmatic relation between market efficiency  and the social solidarity.    Consequently, we foresee a more humane economic system that  will allow everyone to gain access to the market and its  benefits.    The main tool for Peru to join the modern era is,  undoubtedly, education. It will be high-quality education  geared toward humanistic training, work, science, and technology.    The Constitution guarantees free education, at all levels,  in  public schools. Our contribution was that we extended free and  compulsory education to the preschool level; this is a step  forward to train and correctly stimulate our children to enter  primary school, where the percentage of students who repeat a  grade and the incidence of school drop-outs are alarming.    The modern Peru we want must be sown right now, and the best  fertilizer for it is education for our children. Children must  grow like healthy and robust seeds and plants; for this reason,  I would like to urge all sectors to depoliticize the debate on  this issue and find the best way to propose an educational  reform, a priority in the national agenda.    The new Constitution is a modern and pragmatic document that  is inspired by ethical values, but just like any other human  endeavor, it is a perfectible work.    Contrary to totalitarian regimes, democracy is based on the  plurality of ideas, the tolerance to differences, and the search  for consensus. The people trust that we will seek points of  understanding to diminish our differences and establish the  objectives and priority goals the country needs to face our big  challenges. This must be shown in the legal norms needed to  implement the Constitution.    The people also hope for greater consensus on the part of  all  sectors that are committed to ideas of change in order to give  stability to the modernization program.    Terrorism--this implacable enemy that has caused so much  death and destruction over the past 12 years--is abating, but it  has not disappeared.    We are going to persist until we eradicate this scourge,  but we should not allow ourselves to be deceived. If we  eliminate terrorist violence but overlook poverty and the  conditions in which millions of Peruvian live, we will be  exchanging one danger for another.    The national reconstruction process must be consolidated.  Our economy, for example, must grow until the end of this  century at a rate similar to those of developed countries solely  to recover the standard of living that we had 20 years ago. The  illiteracy rate reveals that 2 million people do not know how to  read and write in Peru; that is, one out of 10 Peruvians does  not know how to read and write. Seven out of 100 children die  before they reach age one, and this reveals our poor health  levels.    This painful situation that we inherited was worsened by the  poor economic and social policies of the past, and we cannot  remain impassive toward this. This is an immense challenge that  we will overcome and must tackle together. Only in a real  democracy can we articulate the contributions of all sectors to  establish a consensus, integrationist, and consistent force, a  long-range national project. Congress and the government are  committed to this task.    The great decisions [definiciones] made to relaunch a  country  are often painful and traumatic, and thus, a consensus is  indispensable; this is why no sector or group should reap  political benefits. We must all feel part of this modernization  program to ensure that a reform such as the one being  implemented to modernize the country will last long; we need to  have a collective determination and consensus.    Throughout these years, the government, with the people's  support, has won the most difficult battles in a country that  was in ruins. As a result of the good policies of this  administration, which is responding to a global vision as  opposed to a short-run vision, we have emerged victorious in the  main fronts of our struggle against subversion.    In the economic arena, we have defeated inflation. We have  begun to stop the serious recessive process and managed to grow  this year at a rate of 7 percent of gross national product. We  also rejoined the international financial community and are  again creditworthy at the international level. We have  successfully advanced in privatizing public companies. We now  have a more organized and healthier institutional structure. We  enjoy the support of popular organizations and the understanding  of businessmen and workers.    We have a legal framework--that is, the new  Constitution--which guarantees the application of structural  reforms that the country requires to modernize itself. The  people, who have placed their trust in these policies, have  collaborated with remarkable courage and generosity, but they  also harbor the hope of seeing better days.    The time has come to take a new path. We have to join  efforts in this frontal battle so that we can venture forth to  modernization. It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that we  present for your consideration an initiative to reach a national  consensus on priority issues related to the people's  development. The exchange of ideas and the conclusions to be  reached will guide the government in establishing policies and  will help Congress in implementing the legal norms the  Constitution requires.    To conclude, allow me to make a reflection. Democracy is  universally recognized as the system based on freedom which  promotes economic growth and collective well-being. The  dramatic events that have crumbled political totalitarianism and  economic socialism have reconfirmed that democracy is the best  form of government. The challenge before us is to demonstrate  that democracy is also able to promote human development in  Peru. If all of the Peruvians of our generation are able to  build an authentic democracy--which will bring prosperity and  happiness to our children and our children's children--all of  our struggles and sacrifices will have been well worth it.  Thank you. [applause]</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Mercedes quits Czech ventures MERCEDES-BENZ has pulled out of its planned co-operation ventures with two leading Czech truck producers, Avia Praha and Liaz, in another sign of the decelerating German and European new truck markets, AP-DJ reports from Stuttgart. The car and truck division of Germany's Daimler-Benz industrial group will instead build the new six-ton trucks at its existing truck plant in Woerth, said Mr Helmut Werner, chairman-designate. The German company has also scheduled a news conference for Monday in Dearborn, Michigan, when it is expected to announce plans to build a new factory in North Carolina or South Carolina to produce a new sports-utility vehicle, Reuter adds from Detroit.</p>

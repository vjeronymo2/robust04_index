			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Party dogma Sir, Your editorial, 'Free the Post Office' (October 7), asserts in nebulous privatise-speak that 'consumers stand to gain from the greater efficiency and entrepreneurial zeal' created by the privatisation of the Post Office. Were the benefits really so transparent, I doubt that your correspondent would have felt obliged to report only a week before ('Post Office watchdog raps sell-off plans', September 30) that 'users were also concerned. . .as to the benefits likely to flow from privatisation'. In reality, the benefits seem confined to satisfying party dogma. R M Walters, 6 Sunnyside Gardens, Upminster, Essex RM14 3DS</p>

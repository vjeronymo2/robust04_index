			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: PolyGram Comparisons of stock market values often highlight anomalies. That between the PolyGram music business and its 80 per cent shareholder, Philips, looks decidedly bizarre. Last year, PolyGram's market value overtook Philips' on the Dutch stock exchange. At its current value of Fl 7.9bn, PolyGram is worth 1.2 times more than its parent company. Philips' stake in PolyGram is equivalent to some 96 per cent of its own stock market worth. That suggests the market values the rest of the Fl 57bn turnover company at just Fl 250m. Great as Philips' problems are, that seems to be extreme. The obvious conclusion is that Philips should realise considerable shareholder value by fully demerging PolyGram as Racal did with Vodafone. It has long resisted the urge. But the pressure to do so may grow as the divergence in performance between the two companies seems set to widen. Yesterday, PolyGram recorded a 13 per cent increase in net income. With its sound balance sheet and strong market positions, it confidently predicted further growth. Tomorrow, Philips is expected to unveil dire annual results. Its recovery potential looks limited.</p>

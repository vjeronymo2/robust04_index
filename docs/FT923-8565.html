			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: PolyGram buys 51% of film-maker POLYGRAM, the music company 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, is spending Dollars 35m to acquire a 51 per cent stake in the film producer Interscope, which made Three Men and a Baby. The deal will lead to the winding down of Interscope's two-year-old joint venture with Walt Disney Studios and Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown, an affiliate of Nomura Securities. The deal, which will be financed out of cash-flow and available funds, is a further step in PolyGram's declared aim of increasing its presence in the film business. The company said yesterday that it might end up spending more than the Dollars 200m it originally earmarked for expenditure on film. Last year, PolyGram took control of Propaganda Films, makers of In Bed with Madonna, and Working Title, which made My Beautiful Launderette. The Dollars 35m will include payment for the services of Mr Ted Field, Interscope chairman and chief executive, and of Mr Robert Cort, chief operating officer. Mr Field, an heir to the Marshall Field retailing fortune, made his first film, Revenge of the Nerds, in 1984. Mr Cort is a former CIA employee turned film-maker. Under PolyGram's majority ownership, Interscope, which has also produced Cocktail and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, will make eight films over the next two years, rising to nine or 10 annually by 1997. Walt Disney Studios will initially distribute these films in the US and Canada, while PolyGram will handle them elsewhere. PolyGram says, however, that it intends eventually to become the worldwide distributor of Interscope's films. Interscope will continue its current projects with Walt Disney Studios, but will make subsequent films in-house. Film funding will be provided by PolyGram, but Interscope will continue to seek co-funding. Interscope said yesterday that by the end of 1993 it will have committed the funds previously raised by Nomura for co-financing film productions. Nomura will, however, retain the option of raising further money for Interscope. Exit provisions in the agreement allow PolyGram to limit its exposure if Interscope performs significantly below expectations.</p>

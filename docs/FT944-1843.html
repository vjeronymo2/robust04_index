			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Motoring: Small, roomy and smooth The new Volkswagen Polo 1.3 CL (pictured) was so refined, roomy and smooth-riding that it came as a surprise to turn round in my seat and see how small it really was - and to discover how easily it could be reversed up my awkwardly curving drive. Head room generous - there is no standard sun-roof to get in the way. Clutch and five-speed gearbox are up to the best Japanese standards of silkiness, and the 1.3-litre engine is eager to spin sweetly or pull hard at low revolutions. In town, the Polo CL's compactness, power steering and good visibility make parking easy. At motorway speeds, it did not sound unduly busy and, on winding roads, its handling was a delight. Reckon on averaging 43mpg (6.6 l/100km), or better than 400 miles (645km) a tankful. VW's prices are much keener than they were. The 1.3 CL three-door, with driver's air-bag and electric windows, costs a modest Pounds 8,700. Prices start at Pounds 6,950 for the one-litre Polo L, on which power steering is Pounds 400 extra, and go up to Pounds 11,750 for the five-door GLX 1.6 with ABS brakes, alloy wheels and manual sunroof.</p>

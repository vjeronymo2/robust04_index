The agreement was signed in Belgrade today  through the mediation of the President of Serbia Slobodan  Milosevic.

When units of the national defense of the autonomous  province  of Western Bosnia are deployed on the section of the front from  where the Fifth Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army launches  military actions against the Srpska republic army, permanent  peace will immediately be established in this remaining sector  of the front too.    -- Liaison officers, responsible for preventing incidents,  have been appointed in all sectors on the line of separation  between the forces of the autonomous province of Western Bosnia  and the Srpska republic army.    -- The governments of the autonomous province of Western  Bosnia and the Srpska republic will jointly provide conditions  and undertake measures to enable communications links, traffic,  and commerce between the autonomous province of Western Bosnia  and the Srpska republic.    -- Borders between the autonomous province of Western Bosnia  and the Srpska republic will be defined in line with the  Belgrade declaration, and exclusively between the legal bodies  of the autonomous province of Western Bosnia and the Srpska  republic.</p>

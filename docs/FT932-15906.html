			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Norwich Union The chancellor should not quake in his boots to find Norwich Union thinking of switching from gilts into equities. Investment fundamentals aside, the move into bonds 18 months ago was not unrelated to the declining free asset ratio of Norwich Union's main life assurance fund. Since the strength of the fund has improved it is only natural for investment strategy to adapt. There are plenty more life and pension funds with good reasons of their own for favouring gilts.</p>

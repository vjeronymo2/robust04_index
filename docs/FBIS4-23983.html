			<p>BFN     [Text] The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] High Command has denied  claims by Mr. Alhaji Koromah that troops of the Nigerian  contingent deployed in Tubmanburg are fighting alongside the  Krahn faction of the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia] under the Imam of Tubmanburg Alhaji  Mohamed Sheriff, (?war chief).    In a release issued yesterday, ECOMOG said no Nigerian or  any  other troops had ever supported any faction. The release  pointed out that Imam Sheriff had taken refuge in (Naibas)  territory with other displaced people. ECOMOG is inviting any  concerned citizens who visit (Naibas) territory to speak to Imam  Sheriff.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will adopt a presumption that the alleged crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants which were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751&hyph;760h. In order to receive a refund, end-user claimants need not submit any evidence of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Petroleum retailer, reseller, and refiner applicants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and they may not rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in refined product cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These applicants, however, may use econometric evidence of the type found in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OHA Report on Stripper Well Overcharges, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,507 (1985).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  PODRA &sect;3003(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 4502(b)(2). If a claimant has executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established by the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, it has waived its rights to file an application for Subpart V crude oil refund monies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Mid-America Dairymen <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  878 F.2d 1448 (Temp.

Supp. 1267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed Energy Guidelines &para;26,613 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As has been stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15 DOE &para;85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim to any other crude oil refund proceeding implemented by the DOE need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings finalized to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The DOE had previously established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 26318 (May 3, 1993). Although that date has passed, it has been decided to re-open the crude proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 Fed. Reg. 55656 (November 8, 1994). The new closing date for this proceeding has been tentatively set for June 3, 1996.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. While we anticipate that applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988 will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional refunds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  21 DOE &para;85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 at 90,687. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  It Is Therefore Ordered That:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The funds remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Co. pursuant to the Consent Order entered into with the DOE on July 15, 1994 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31132 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 7, INA--Arab and foreign experts taking  part in the International Symposium on War Crimes and Violations  of Human Rights which is being held here called for a joint  action to lift the trade sanctions on Iraq.    They called for setting up committees consisting of Iraqis  and chaired by Europeans in order to explain the effects of  trade sanctions on the Iraqi people.    They also called for establishing Arab and Islamic  organisations that would defend human rights of Arabs and  Muslims.    The Sunday [6 February] morning session was chaired by Amin  Shuqayr from Jordan. The main speaker of the session was Dr.  Safiyah Safwat, member of the Permanent Bureau of the Union of  Arab Jurists.    Dr. Safwat delivered a paper entitled "The Effect of  Sanctions (on Iraq), an Eyewitness Reports.".    She said that for more than three years Iraq has been  subjected to severe sanctions and blockade and the Iraqi people  have faced the most intensive and vicious air war in which  hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed and the country's  infrastructure destroyed.    The paper said numerous reports of international missions  have indicated the size of destruction caused to Iraq as a  result of the war and the imposition of economic blockade.  Among these reports are Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan's report in  July 1991, the report by the International Committee of the Red  Cross in October 1991, the report of the Harvard International  Team in May 1991, and the report by the General Federation of  Iraqi Women in November 1992, Dr. Safwat said.    On the child status, she said for a period of ten months  only, January to October 1991, 1,977 Iraqi children under the  age of five died from causes related to the effects of the  economic embargo. "For the same period in 1992, the total number  of deaths among such children was 3,821, an increase of 93 per  cent over the 1991 total," Dr. Safwat added in her paper.    The paper said the embargo has, moreover, deprived Iraqi  pupils and students of their learning and educational needs.    "There are acute shortages of stationery, educational and  laboratory equipment as there are shortages of technical and  sports materials," it said.    Dr. Safwat said the economic embargo against Iraq has also  severely affected social services as the deterioration of the  economy has led to cuts in crucial services such as children  nurseries and reformatories, and homes for the disabled.    The paper said because of the continuation of trade  sanctions on Iraq, prices of basic goods have exceeded the  economic capabilities of the majority of the Iraqi families.    Another speaker of Sunday's morning session was Mr. Ahmad  Nasir from the Sudan.    He said that the international and humanitarian  organisations  in the West are known of their achievements for the Western  people. He wondered why Arabs and Muslims do not set up such  organisations that would defend their rights.    Shaykh Muhammad Bu Stah from Libya said the Arabs need a  real  action towards the sanctions against Iraq and Libya.    He lauded the Libyan Human Rights Committee and its  contribution on both Arab and international levels.    Among the participants of the International Symposium on War  Crimes and Violations of Human Rights is former U.S. Attorney  General Ramsey Clark. Mr. Clark is one of those international  dignitaries who condemned the U.S. and other countries which  took part in the aggression against Iraq. Mr. Clark is chairing  an international war crimes tribunal.    Mr. Clark told THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER that the tribunal held  hearings in 35 cities in the U.S. and in more than 20 countries.    He said the tribunal, for example, held hearings in four  cities in Turkey and another four in Britain. "The final  tribunal was held in the city of the United Nations, New York,  because the U.S. was the aggressor," he said.    Mr. Clark said the tribunal accused former President George  Bush and other U.S. officials of 19 charges. In some countries  the court where the hearings were held added charges against the  country where the court was held. It happened in the UK,  Canada, Italy and Japan," Clark said.    The court has also charges against the Japanese Government,  because it permitted us to maintain naval vessels which were  used in the Gulf war, he said, adding that there was a big  protest in Japan where "I saw a hundred boats with people  protesting the arrival of U.S. vessels."    The former U.S. attorney general said the most important  crime now is the embargo.    "It is judged as a continuing crime against the U.S. [as  received]. The embargo punishes the whole people of Iraq," he  said, adding that it kills infants, the sick, and elderly people.    Mr. Clark said that the most urgent humanitarian issue on  our  planet is to lift the sanctions against the Iraqi people.    He said there are signs of lifting these sanctions. "Three  permanent members of the Security Council stating that they are  not feeling good about the sanctions, they have not voted  against them yet but I can say they feel badly of the sanctions.  There is uneasiness and you see it coming up more and more in  the press elsewhere," Mr. Clark concluded.</p>

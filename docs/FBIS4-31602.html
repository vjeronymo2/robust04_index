			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Maria Rokita, chairman of the Union of </F> Freedom's Krakow regional branch, by correspondent "Jam"; place  and date not given]    [Text] [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] Does the result of the election  of the Union of Freedom chairman not indicate that two parallel  but counteropposed orientations exist within the Union of  Freedom's [UW] Krakow regional organization?    [Rokita] It is certainly a clear indication that the efforts  and arguments I brought to the task of shaping the Democratic  Union over the past two years, on both the national scene and  here in Krakow, have somewhat eroded my authority. However, I  believe that a politician's authority is not something to  cultivate artificially but something to engage--even at a  risk--in fighting for just causes. My determined involvement in  the campaign to achieve a coalition with the Liberals, then in  the unification process and then in the effort to rid that party  of its openly anticlerical and prosocialist tendencies, has  naturally impaired my authority to a certain extent. Given  these circumstances, I view the result of the election as my own  personal success.    [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] The Krakow Liberals do not appear to be  particularly pleased with the course and outcome of the  unification campaign. Does this not pose a special, rather  delicate problem for the UW regional chairman?    [Rokita] It certainly creates a need for an honest, thorough  discussion with the activists from the former Liberal Democratic  Congress [KLD] structures. We recently had some differences  connected with the postulated composition of the election list  to be prepared by our new, joint coalition. I will not deny  that I made some considerable concessions for the Liberals. I  take full personal responsibility for these concessions, as I  made them against considerable pressure from certain structures  hailing from the former Democratic Union [UD]. This was not an  easy thing to do because many UD members still remember the  KLD's inauspicious beginnings in Krakow at the time that party  was still a marginal group set up by local anarchists. However,  that part of their past is now behind us, especially because the  present leadership of the Krakow KLD organization had nothing to  do with that episode. I trust we will be able to resolve  certain questions hinging on personal ambitions. In any case, I  do not predict any serious or lasting conflict based on these  minor difficulties.    [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] On the other hand, a much more serious  conflict, in which you are involved, arose at the central level  of your new party structures. You clashed quite sharply with  Sejm Deputy Barbara Labuda. How do you propose to resolve this  problem?    [Rokita] I cannot yet specify the detailed procedure by  which our conflict will be resolved, but I can already say that  I have no doubt that, given her record in the parliamentary vote  on the budget and the preparation of the new constitution, and  considering her fanatical attacks against the Catholic Church  and her part in the abortion debate, it is only a question of  time before Barbara Labuda leaves the UW parliamentary caucus  and, indeed, the party as such. However, the difficulty here is  that her temperament does not allow her to leave the party of  her own will, despite the open conflict and contentious argument  she has with almost the entire party on almost all of the  possible issues. But there is no question that a solution to  this problem will have to be found.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAROLYN MILLER CHAIRS ONE FROM THE HEART  </P> <P> She's all heart. Carolyn Miller not only looks like a Valentine and talks like  a Valentine, she acts like a Valentine. She is a Valentine for the American  Heart Assn., Greater Los Angeles Affiliate. She will chair the association's  Heart Ball Friday night at the Regent Beverly Wilshire -- for the third time.  Her gift of time and expertise is expected to help gross $300,000.  </P> <P> Love is what it's about.  </P> <P> "My mother has had two four-way bypasses and a valve replacement," Miller said.  "My father had a sister and brother who both died of heart conditions at age  59. I care about this."  </P> <P> She adds: "I basically am an optimist, but sometimes I feel depressed. So I  keep several quotes around me, and I try to do something for somebody else, and  that makes me feel better." One of her favorite quotes: "Where much is given,  much is expected."  </P> <P> She's married to Charles D. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of  Avery and its CEO since 1977. He's on the boards of Johns Hopkins University  and Occidental College, a director of four major corporations and past chairman  of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> She's on the boards of the American Heart Assn., the California Special  Olympics and the California Family Study Center. A Mormon, she also co-teaches  a Sunday school class for 14-year-olds.  </P> <P> The Millers, who live in Pasadena, privately adopted two children in one year.  First, they made arrangements through a lawyer to adopt a baby to be born five  months later. When another young mother said she wanted them to be the adoptive  parents of her baby, the Millers said yes. Thus, they have red-haired Amanda, 2  1/2, and blond Candice, 2.  </P> <P> Carolyn was at the hospital when each was born and brought both babies home  when they were a day old; each slept in the Millers' bedroom the first six  months.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be the one who bonded with them," she says. "I got up for a whole  year during the night. Chuck (he has three daughters by a previous marriage)  slept just fine. And I still did the company entertaining.  </P> <P> "Since I couldn't have children, these children were meant for me."  </P> <P> Motherhood hasn't thwarted her avocations. In July, Miller climbed Mt.  Kilimanjaro, hiking to the summit. She also keeps the computer and fax humming  in her home office, handling real estate investments.  </P> <P> "Yes, I'm good at balance sheets," she says.  </P> <P> She's a graduate of Brigham Young University, with a major in accounting, and  she spent 15 years pursuing a career in international finance, working with  Fritz Companies, Carnation, Capital Planning Resources and Van de Kamps. In  fact, it was on a Carnation business trip that she met her husband. Several  years later their paths crossed again. They were married in 1982.  </P></p>

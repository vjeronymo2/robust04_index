			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TELLING TALE OF MEXICAN REVOLUTION SPARKS ROW OVER WHO'S DOING THE TELLING  </P> <P> "The Old Gringo" is a novel by Carlos Fuentes, a movie by Argentine director  Luis Puenzo -- starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck -- and an occasion to dwell  on the way Mexico tells its story to Americans.  </P> <P> The film, which opened in the United States this past week, has already sparked  a new and lively version of the age-old debate in Mexico about what is wrong  with American, supposedly stereotypical portrayals of the nation and its  people. As one might expect, it has rekindled the nation's never-ending  discussion about whether those Mexicans who know how -- and want -- to share  their vision of the country with foreigners in general, and Americans in  particular, are traitors, fools, or -- more reasonably -- marvelous decrypters  of Mexico's code of fantasy.  </P> <P> Nobody tells the story of Mexico to Americans the way Fuentes does. In his  maturity as a writer he has partially devoted his talent to an often  unrewarding task: translating Mexico and the rest of the hemisphere into  American.  </P> <P> Fuentes always had a gift for interface. His first three novels, which many  still consider his best, told disbelieving Mexican readers the story of what  their adolescence in small provincial towns ("The Good Conscience"), their  capital ("Where the Air Is Clear") and their revolution ("The Death of Artemio  Cruz") had all become.  </P> <P> Fuentes taught an entire generation of midcentury Mexicans about the country  they really lived in. He is now striving to teach end-of-century Americans  about their neighbors -- across the river, but increasingly across the tracks.  "Gringo Viejo," the movie, is not strictly Fuentes' -- he did not write the  script -- yet in a sense it is his most ambitious, and successful, attempt to  achieve this end. It is a story deeply rooted in Mexico about the lives, loves  and death of Americans in the Mexican Revolution, told in a way that can catch  the American imagination.  </P> <P> But the film is also a set of impressions of Mexico, historical and  present-day, as Fuentes thinks Americans should see it. Like other Latin  American intellectuals, Fuentes has achieved a certain balance in the  presentation of his country and continent, of its history and customs. He is  not complacent with Americans, telling them what they want to hear. Nor does he  lecture them, resorting to the moralizing or paternalistic tones that often  drive many citizens of the United States to distraction. But he does have a  message, a vision of Mexico that he wants Americans to share, a message that he  believes they should receive instead of any other.  </P> <P> The result, in "The Old Gringo" and in many of Fuentes' other contemporary  writings (including the just-translated "Christopher Unborn"), is a rough,  proud, highly nationalistic and frequently anti-American, deeply introspective  yet brash Mexico that clashes with other images that Americans are familiar  with. Fuentes' tour de force is twofold: It consists of presenting this real  Mexico, and doing so in a way that does not turn Americans off to the country  and its people.  </P> <P> In Mexico, while a box-office success, the film has been damned by some as a  "gringada" -- a typically Americanized, Hollywood production with all the  stereotypes that many Mexicans consider demeaning. The scenes that most  infuriate Mexico's right-wing, nationalistic keepers of the faith are  undoubtedly those of the violence and debauchery the Revolution wrought: the  taking of the Miranda Hacienda, the horse in the mansion and bedroom, the  macabre death dance in the cemetery, the prostitute accompanying the  revolutionaries on their adventures.  </P> <P> The film's critics have let their xenophobia reach new extremes, blaming the  the movie's inevitable Hollywood traits on director Puenzo's Argentine  nationality, on Fonda's political leanings or on Fuentes' success along the  U.S. lecture circuit. They have also complained about the film's constant  association of its main participants with trains: They ride on trains, sleep  and make love on trains, do business on trains and are invariably hanging  around trains. But this is the way Mexico's revolutionaries liked to be  photographed, the way they posed, the way the Casasola Photographic Archive of  the Revolution depicted them.  </P> <P> Similarly, the Revolution was the supreme violent episode in a notably violent  country. Mexico was and continues to be a nation of pent-up, fully justified  and unending anger against unfathomable injustice, inequality and authoritarian  abuse. The Mexican people respond to the drama of their existence in  alternating fits of resignation and rage; their proverbial violence is not a  stereotype, but a reality. So are many of the other traits of national  character that the film depicts, in its own, avowedly Americanized fashion.  </P> <P> Thus one of the film's heroes, Gen. Thomas Arroyo, gets into trouble with a  subdued Pancho Villa (played by Pedro Armendariz Jr.) because he decided to  stay at the Miranda Hacienda more or less indefinitely. Why did he settle down  in that marvelous, entirely out-of-place mansion? For the most Mexican of  reasons one could imagine: He made a friend (San Francisco journalist Ambrose  Bierce, played by Peck) and fell in love (with Harriet Winslow, played by  Fonda). And more profoundly, the hacienda was where his mother, a servant, was  raped by the oligarch himself. Arroyo was born of that violent encounter, and  in his simple vision of the world, by prolonging his stay and sleep on the bed  of the crime, he was avenging his mother's violation.  </P> <P> Even Bierce's view of Mexico and the Fonda character's magical Mexican  rejuvenation are stereotypical -- yet not far from the perception Mexicans have  of why Americans come to their country. In one of the film's best lines, Arroyo  explains to his friends from the north: "Now I know why Americans come to  Mexico: They can't stand each other." In fact, Bierce learns how to die and  Jane Fonda learns how to love in Mexico, fields in which Mexicans believe  themselves miles ahead of their puritanical Protestant neighbors. Certainly  since Malcolm Lowry and D.H. Lawrence, Mexico's fascination with death and its  rituals have escaped few informed Americans, but the obsession with -- and  beauty of -- death in Mexico dates back many centuries.  </P> <P> In its own way, the film brings out the difference: Bierce comes to die in  Mexico, and learns that there is a better way to do so than the one originally  reserved for him north of the Rio Grande. Like any country or people, Mexico  has its vanity. Carlos Fuentes and the film reflect it well.  </P> <P> There is a price to pay for Fuentes' gift of interface. Unavoidably, the  trade-off is unfair, but real. The better Fuentes is at telling his country's  story to Americans, the greater the distance between that story and the  official one Mexicans tell themselves. The more accessible the same story is  for Americans, the more stilted or even corny it can seem to nit-picking,  superficially nationalistic Mexicans.  </P> <P> This is the underlying explanation for many of the recent attacks Fuentes has  been subjected to in Mexico, as well as many of the friendships and loyalties  he inspires. The critics come from the darkest, most conservative side of  Mexico -- the same groups who believed journalist Alan Riding betrayed his  Mexican friends' trust by writing a best-selling book ("Distant Neighbors")  about the country he worked in for a decade. The supporters have a different  origin: They spring from pride in having someone like Carlos Fuentes tell their  story to an all-important neighbor, and in having it told as splendidly as it  is in "The Old Gringo."  </P></p>

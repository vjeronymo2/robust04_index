			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Guinness sheds weight with sale of Champneys GUINNESS decided to shed some weight yesterday by selling Champneys, its up-market 170 acre health resort near Tring, Hertfordshire, for some Pounds 7m to a consortium led by two former Champneys directors. Champneys' 1991 turnover was in the region of Pounds 5m. Guinness, which paid Pounds 3m for the Champneys group, which included at that time another health spa in Scotland, in November 1984 - when Guinness was under the management of Mr Ernest Saunders - is selling Champneys to Mr Allan and Mrs Tanya Wheway, who managed it between 1972 and February 1989. The Wheways are backed by the Bank of Scotland. Their partners in the venture are Mr Frank Chapman and Mr Bill Bruce, directors of Bio-Cure, an Aberdeen company involved in medical research. The Wheways parted company with Guinness in 1989 after disagreements over managerial policy. Guinness - whose famous stout packs 200 calories per pint - said yesterday: 'We decided this year we are not really in the health and fitness sector. But this is probably the last non-drinks business we will get rid of. The Gleneagles hotel is not for sale.' First opened in 1925, Champneys was formerly the country home of Baron de Rothschild. Its daily single occupancy rates start at Pounds 150 for a room with no bath and reach Pounds 695 for a suite. The resort has numbered among its past clientele Princess Diana, Demis Roussos and Ringo Starr. However, occupancy rates have dropped recently, as Champneys, along with other UK health farms, has suffered from the recession. The Champneys Club at London's Hotel Meridien and Champneys Spa at the Guinness-owned Gleneagles Hotel in Tayside will continue to be managed by Champneys; those contracts will run until the end of the decade.</p>

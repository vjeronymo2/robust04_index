			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Brand pain How do you cure an 80-year-old headache? Open your wallet, take out Dollars 1bn, and buy a chunk of aspirin. That's what Bayer has just splashed out to acquire Sterling Winthrop, thereby regaining its old Bayer Aspirin brand. Bayer developed aspirin at the turn of the century. But during the first world war the US Alien Property Custodian took control of Bayer's US property and in December 1918 sold those assets to Sterling Drug for Dollars 5.31m. The German company has been smarting ever since; it lost not only its brands, but also the use of its name in the US. Mind you, the Kaiser always preferred paracetamol . . .</p>

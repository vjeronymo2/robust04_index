			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERENT STANDARDS?  </P> <P> Greg Braxton's Aug. 20 article on Shelly Garrett's play "Beauty Shop" quotes  Times critic Sylvie Drake as writing: "By the usual . . . standards 'Beauty  Shop' is a sentimental, poorly structured, badly directed, self-congratulating  show. But where is it written that those standards fit?"  </P> <P> These comment and the tone of Braxton's article perpetuate a tiresome  misconception. Some of us are tired of the lowest common denominator of black  taste being equated with black taste, period.  </P> <P> The music industry similarly insists on using the term black music only to  describe what is played on AM radio -- as if Duke Ellington or Charles Mingus  had never existed.  </P> <P> "Beauty Shop" certainly has the right to exist, but spare us the inane  suggestion that the type of theater it represents is somehow more ethnically  authentic than serious plays such as those of Charles Fuller, August Wilson or  Ron Milner.  </P> <P> ROBERT RUFFIN  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

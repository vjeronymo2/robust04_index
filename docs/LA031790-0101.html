			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> STEPHEN F. AUSTIN TO TEST CS LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Having barely survived what was expected to be an easy first-round game against  California, the Cal State Long Beach women's basketball team has come here to  face what probably will be a tougher opponent in Stephen F. Austin.  </P> <P> The sixth-ranked Ladyjacks (27-2) played well enough this season to be selected  as the No. 3-seeded team in the West. They have lost only once -- to No.  1-ranked Louisiana Tech -- at home.  </P> <P> Tonight's second-round game begins at 5 (PST) and should the 49ers (25-8)  advance, they will go to Stanford for a semifinal matchup against the winner of  tonight's Georgia-Arkansas game.  </P> <P> Long Beach has not played played very well against ranked teams this season,  going 4-8 against those in the top 25. For the 49ers to have a chance, they are  going to have to loosen up, according to Coach Joan Bonvicini.  </P> <P> "Trise (Jackson) and Angie (Lee) were as tight as a drum," Bonvicini said after  Wednesday night's 87-84 victory over unranked Cal. "I'm so happy just to get  that game out of the way."  </P> <P> Lee, though she scored 17 points and had 14 rebounds, fouled out with 1:10  remaining and the 49ers leading by one point. Jackson, one of the fastest  players in the nation, was at times out of control and finished with 12 points.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, they will have gotten any nervousness they might have had out of  their systems and will be ready to move on," Bonvicini said.  </P> <P> The calmest 49er player on the floor was 6-foot-2 sophomore forward Kari  Parriott, who in only 28 minutes scored 21 points, including 15 in the second  half.  </P> <P> Leading the way for the Ladyjacks has been Portia Hill, two-time Southland  Conference player of the year. She is averaging 22.7 points and 10.9 rebounds.  </P> <P> Stephen F. Austin Coach Gary Blair said: "Their style is similar to ours. The  only difference is, their guards are quicker and they're bigger inside. So,  basically they've got the size, I've got a little more depth -- I play nine  kids, she basically plays six or seven."  </P></p>

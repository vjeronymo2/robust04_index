			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> ANTI-FREEWAY PLAN OPPOSED  </P> <P> A citizens watchdog group has criticized a City Council plan to hire a North  Hollywood public relations firm to represent the city in its fight to stop the  completion of the Long Beach Freeway.  </P> <P> City Manager John Bernardi has been authorized by the council to contract with  Glazer &amp; Associates for up $1,000 a month to publicize the reasons for the  city's opposition to a state Department of Transportation plan to run the last  leg of the freeway through the middle of the city. The firm would conduct a  campaign aimed at the media, community leaders and the public.  </P> <P> The idea, Bernardi said, is to "put out the message, up and down the state,  that South Pasadena is not an obstructionist when it comes to the freeway . . .  that South Pasadena has, on many occasions, offered different alternatives."  </P> <P> "Bernardi spends money like a drunken sailor," said Thomas Beisek, a member of  South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn., which has frequently criticized city spending  policies. Added Robert Cook, chairman of the group: "I don't see the need for  all this money being spent for a questionable return." Both contend that the  money might be more wisely invested in a war chest to fight the freeway plan in  the courts, if it is approved by the Department of Transportation.  </P></p>

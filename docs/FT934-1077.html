			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dark horse takes wheel at Volvo Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, the new chairman-designate of Volvo, could hardly have a less public profile than his controversial, headline-grabbing predecessor, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar. 'Not very well known' or 'I don't know too much about him' were typical comments from analysts in Stockholm, who had previously regarded Mr Marcus Storch, the chief executive of Aga, the gas group, as the front-runner for the job. But his relative anonymity was not counting against Mr Svanholm yesterday. Market reaction - Volvo's most actively traded B shares ended the day up SKr6 at SKr531 - was positive as the appointment was seen as placing a solid industrial figure at the head of an equally heavyweight, industrial board in charge of Sweden's biggest manufacturing group. Mr Svanholm has been a senior lieutenant to Mr Percy Barnevik, the Swedish chief of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish Swiss engineering giant, since 1982 when he became deputy chief executive at the pre-merger Asea. Since 1988 he has been chief executive of ABB's Swedish operation. In that role he has headed a big productivity drive known as T50, an ambitious project aimed at cutting by 50 per cent the time taken between receiving orders and achieving delivery. In the meantime, Mr Svanholm has quietly become a stalwart of Sweden's industrial and business establishment. He has been chairman of the Swedish Manufacturer's Association since 1990 and is a vice-chairman of the Federation of Swedish Industry. Before joining Asea, he held senior posts at Swedish Match and Nitro Nobel. Aged 58, he is a civil engineer by qualification, like so many top Swedish managers. Mr Gyllenhammar, by contrast, arrived at Volvo as chief executive in 1971 after running Skandia, the insurance group. Mr Svanholm is set to complement the day-to-day leadership of Volvo by Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who led the management revolt that ditched the merger agreement with Renault earlier this month. Mr Gyll was reported yesterday to be very pleased at the nomination of Mr Svanholm. Analysts expect the two men to shift Volvo strategy towards a tighter focus on its core car and truck operations after the often extravagant schemes of Mr Gyllenhammar to diversify Volvo away from vehicle making. 'I think he is on the same wavelength as Soren Gyll,' said one analyst. 'He fits the market expectation that Volvo will now concentrate on its vehicle business.' Certainly, the contrast with Mr Gyllenhammar will be great. Where 'PG' relished the role of prickly outsider, based in Gothenburg, the 'second city', Mr Svanholm will be at ease and fully trusted by his Stockholm-based institutional shareholders.</p>

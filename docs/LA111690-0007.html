			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIATIVES AND ABSENTEE VOTING  </P> <P> With the appalling number of non-voting registered voters, perhaps now is the  time to consider mandating voting by absentee ballot. Would it not be easier  for a citizen to mail a ballot than to rush to polls where long lines and time  constraints often discourage voting? Elimination of polling sites and  utilization of absentee ballots would permit voters more time, deliberation and  review of all issues in the relaxed privacy of home, office or factory.  </P> <P> Employees, renters and homeowners could be required to turn in an absentee  ballot receipt or be docked a reasonable stipend from salary, rent or taxes.  Proceeds could be forwarded to an established homeless trust fund. This would  not be a poll tax, but rather a penalty for the right not to vote.  </P> <P> In the light of all of America's wars, including the pending Desert Shield  fracas, it makes no sense for Americans not to vote; the tactic of a penalty  seems like a small payment indeed. The utilization of a mandated absentee  ballot would preclude any and all non-voting excuses in today's fast-paced,  consumer-driven society.  </P> <P> NATHAN L.

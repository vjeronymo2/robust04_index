			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF A SOCIETY PAINTER;  </P> <P> LIFESTYLE: LIKE MANY AN ARTIST, JULIAN LA TROBE IS SEARCHING OUT ALL THE RIGHT  PEOPLE AT ALL THE RIGHT PARTIES.  </P> <P> Portraits of the rich and powerful are proof that both the sitter and the  artist have arrived.  </P> <P> Artist Julian La Trobe would like Angelenos to know he has arrived -- from San  Francisco, where for five years he has been painting portraits of that city's  elite society crowd.  </P> <P> Now, seeking to stretch his reputation south, he has rented an apartment in  Hollywood -- a 1920s-vintage domicile near the Hollywood Bowl -- with barrel  vaulted ceilings and a secret passageway that leads up to a tower. He has been  painting a nighttime sky with stars on his bedroom ceiling. The bathroom will  have a morning sky.  </P> <P> And he is engaged in meeting the right people, those he hopes will commission  portraits.  </P> <P> "It's scary," he admits. "To come down here and . . . be plopped in the middle  of a fabulous party where you don't know a soul, that's a little intimidating.  I haven't had to do that in about two or three years. So at parties I just have  eight hands out, I'm like an octopus, shaking hands and smiling and laughing  and having a wonderful time. I really like the people down here. I think  they're fun and exciting and doing things, which is a little different from up  there, where you have a lot of people living off of old funds."  </P> <P> He's especially fascinated by the relentless drive of those high on the food  chain in the movie business. "That would make a great portrait," he says, "that  intensity."  </P> <P> If it's intensity he's looking for, it's suggested that he might want to look  up Creative Artists Agency super agent Michael Ovitz.  </P> <P> "Ahhh. Michael Lovis," he says.  </P> <P> That's Ovitz.  </P> <P> "Ovitz. Michael Ovitz. I'll remember that."  </P> <P> Forgive him his unfamiliarity with the powers that be, for La Trobe has barely  scratched the surface of Los Angeles society. But it's destined to be his bread  and butter if he is going to make a name for himself here by painting the  city's rich and famous.  </P> <P> He was recently nudged out of his Pacific Heights apartment and pointed south  by two friends: Los Angeles artist Tony Duquette and interior designer Hutton  Wilkinson. They are introducing him to the Right Kind of People at the Right  Kind of Parties, like philanthropist Frances Brody, whose home La Trobe has  already rendered on canvas.  </P> <P> There's nothing unusual about La Trobe wanting to schmooze in the L.A. social  scene; artists -- including the late master schmoozer, Andy Warhol -- have been  doing it for decades.  </P> <P> "Artists have always (worked the party circuit)," says local artist Annie  Kelly, who met La Trobe through Wilkinson. "Very few don't. Most artists are  making the rounds."  </P> <P> The 27-year-old La Trobe -- whose flamboyant manner was described by one  acquaintance as "gently swashbuckling" -- very much wants to make it here.  </P> <P> "I love society people," he says. "I guess I know that they're real. I never  think about who they are and what they are, it's just your eyes and my eyes,  and us communicating. The other stuff -- what they have -- never gets in  between."  </P> <P> Money doesn't impress him?  </P> <P> "Absolutely not. It's a must for the business, but no, not really. If somebody  walked into a party and I didn't know her, and somebody told me she had $600  million she's dying to spend, the first thing that goes through my mind is,  'Let's do a portrait.' "  </P> <P> But there's a fine line between making nice with rich people and being an oozy  sycophant, and La Trobe is careful not to cross it.  </P> <P> "I know that on the one or two occasions when somebody wanted something out of  me, and they were being nice to me for it, I could tell. It just bothered me.  Hopefully I never seem that way."  </P> <P> What helped start his career in San Francisco, says La Trobe, was falling in  with "the right people" -- not society types, but the antique dealers,  architects and interior designers who could introduce him to their clients.  </P> <P> "The wealthy people don't make a move without their OK," he explains.  </P> <P> Before San Francisco he had been living in Europe; first Rome, where he  painted, then Venice, where he worked for the Peggy Guggenheim Collection,  entertaining rich American tourists whom the Guggenheim was wooing for funds.  </P> <P> He embarked for Europe after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design.  Reared by British parents in Memphis, Tenn., who encouraged his artistic  inclinations, he always felt a bit like an expatriate, and thought he might be  more comfortable living in Italy.  </P> <P> But that didn't suit him either, so he moved to San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I'm always looking in a sort of Fellini-esque way at the scene," he says.  "Always. Always. And never passing judgment, but just, boy, this is straight  out of a movie. Look how birds of a feather flock over there, or there's the  queen bee over there. I just loooooove that, I love that. I love it visually  too.  </P> <P> "And even though I am sort of going around (meeting people) and trying to get  business," La Trobe explains, "I think everyone at the party is doing it,  whether you're an investment banker or you have a film to produce, you're  meeting the people you should be meeting. I think everybody's at the party for  some reason other than purely just to be there and have a good time."  </P> <P> John Mariani, a wealthy Los Altos businessman who is among La Trobe's clients,  says the artist fits in quite nicely among the social crowd there. "He disarms  them completely. A little red flag goes up when someone is a little too grand;  there are so many fake grand people who make it somewhere else and come to San  Francisco to be grand. He is exactly what he is. Julian goes through society as  if he's going through a sieve: effortlessly. The only thing he leaves behind  are his brush marks."  </P> <P> Mariani bought a La Trobe painting at a San Francisco antique store years ago  as an anniversary gift for his wife, but met the artist some time later.  </P> <P> "He came to my apartment on Nob Hill about two years ago. I didn't know who he  was. He walked in and said, 'I'd love to paint your apartment.' I knew it  needed a paint job, but I didn't know anyone could be so bold. So the next  morning he arrives wearing a hair band, a white painter's smock with black  polka dots and shorts. He looked like a go-go girl from the '60s. And I said,  'I really don't want my apartment painted.' Then I saw what kind of paints he  had and finally realized who he was and all that. So I told him to come in and  went back to bed and told him to paint whatever he wanted."  </P> <P> What he ended up painting was a portrait of Mariani -- sound asleep in bed.  Subsequent canvases were filled with Mariani at the piano wearing silk pajamas  and Mariani at a small dinner party.  </P> <P> "I told him he'd have to clear out for dinner," Mariani recalls, "and he asked  if he could paint me at dinner. In San Francisco you're always looking for a  way to warm people up, and it became sort of the talk of the town that we were  painted at dinner. Very decadent."  </P> <P> Capturing home interiors on canvas may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the  tradition, popular among the wealthy in the 19th Century. Although portraits  are La Trobe's first love, he started doing interiors a couple of years ago.  Interiors start at $2,000, portraits at $5,000.  </P> <P> He explains: "A lot of people I work with have several houses, and they like  the idea of having a painting of one in the other, and vice versa. Why? Because  they made it, they created it. Whether they did it with a decorator or they did  it themselves, there's so little creativity out there that is available."  </P> <P> San Francisco interior designer Andrew Fisher and wife Katherine McGuire  recently commissioned La Trobe to do separate portraits; he also did a painting  of their garden and bedroom.  </P> <P> "His interiors show much more creativity than a photograph," says Fisher.  "Plus, you can tell lies here and there -- make things a few feet taller, make  everything look prettier. . . . It's also interesting to see how the artist  perceives how you live."  </P> <P> La Trobe says he is fortunate that most of the interiors appeal to his taste.  Occasionally they don't, as with a recent home he painted which he describes in  a whisper as " '60s motel."  </P> <P> A few of his peers are quick to denigrate his work, calling his paintings  "potboilers." "They say, 'Are you still doing your potboilers?' meaning, are  you still doing what you have to do? I keep telling them, 'I can't tell you how  happy I am with what I'm doing. It's so rewarding for me, and I honestly don't  see that you're a bastion of happiness.' But it's not their fault," he sighs.  "It's where art has gone . . . I have the facility to get my point across, but  they probably think that I'm not searching."  </P> <P> He showed in few galleries in San Francisco; none seemed to be the vehicle for  his work. Years ago, he was scheduled to mount an exhibition with Duquette, but  the building burned days before the show was to go up. Thus, he's never been  reviewed.  </P> <P> Duquette says that finding an L.A. gallery to exhibit La Trobe's work is among  the first orders of business once the artist is settled.  </P> <P> "I think he'll start to be known through exhibitions," Duquette says. "This is  such an enormous area. . . . In my time, there were really only three society  groups: Hollywood, Pasadena and Hancock Park. Now there are 30 or 40 factions.  I don't think he can be introduced to a group that would put him on the map,  but you can be introduced to a city that can."  </P> <P> La Trobe mulls this over and says, "The problem is that we haven't seen any  galleries that are quite right. It would be ideal to get a gallery, but  somebody with my sensibility is difficult to come by. I haven't seen anything.  In the meantime, until we find something, I'll continue on getting through  society."  </P></p>

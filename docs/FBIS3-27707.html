The bulletin said the group of inspectors were scheduled to  arrive in Pyongyang on March 1, and then visit seven nuclear  facilities in the country.    DPRK agreed on February 15 to open the seven nuclear  facilities, but said two other facilities were not included.    The U.N. agency urged DPRK on February 23 to grant visas to  the inspectors as soon as possible and set a one-week deadline.    In a related development, the United States agreed to cancel  joint military exercises this year with South Korea and to begin  the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks on March 21 in Geneva.    The two sides also agreed that the working-level contacts  between the North and South should resume in Panmunjom.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, the head of the Portuguese  Armed Forces, would like to move faster with the modernization  program of the Portuguese forces. He said this will facilitate  Portugal's participation in peace operations in an European  theater. Fuzeta da Ponte was speaking to RTP after a meeting in  Brussels dominated by the crisis in Bosnia. He was interviewed  by Pedro Oliveira.    [Oliveira] As for Portugal's contribution to international  peace efforts, Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte stressed the need to  proceed with the modernization program for the Portuguese  forces. In an interview with RTP, Fuzeta da Ponte began by  reiterating Portugal's Euro-Atlanticist vocation.    [Begin recording] [Da Ponte] I believe that the government  --  and the country -- have clearly defined that we are a  Euro-Atlantic nation. Therefore, our Euro-Atlanticism means  that we have great responsibilities toward Europe, and that is  what we are dealing with. But Atlanticism means other  responsibilities that go beyond Europe proper and that follow on  from Portugal's own history and its Atlantic aspect. I am  referring, as I said, to our participation in terms of support  to our former colonies. We are in Mozambique, we are and have  been in Angola -- and continue to be -- everywhere, this is a  national feeling [word indistinct]...[pauses] that seems to  identify with the state's opinion that we should be represented  there.    In Europe, we must have prepared forces on a par with the  European forces. I would say that in terms of the three  branches of the Armed Forces the last steps, taken recently,  point to certain equipment that favors, on the other hand, we  have to prepare the personnel so they can move that equipment  [sentence as heard]. It is to this effect that our efforts are  pointing.    [Oliveira] Even so, in your opinion are there shortcomings  in  the Portuguese Armed Forces that should be tackled?    [Da Ponte] Naturally there are restrictions, everyone knows  there are restrictions, we are not the only ones to have them.  But I think that the pace of our modernization leaves us all a  little unhappy. We would like to move faster, and why? Because  as you know our Armed Forces were equipped for an old colonial  war and only recently have we come out of that vision and begun  to alter the structure, the means, and the legislation to that  effect. My dissatisfaction, shall we say, is that we cannot do  this any faster because of the restrictions that are perfectly  compatible with national needs. [end recording]</p>

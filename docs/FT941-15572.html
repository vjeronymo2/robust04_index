			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Sports Council censured for lax finances The Sports Council, the government body which promotes sport in Britain, has been severely censured by Whitehall auditors for poor administration of public funds and for being unaware that its senior executives had business interests which conflicted with their official duties. In a damning report on the council's activities published last night, the National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, said the council 'did not provide full transparency of the benefits and cashflows' between itself and several bodies it had set up to help administer sports grounds. The report said the council 'had not established the necessary arrangements to avoid potential conflicts of duty or interest within the Council group'. The NAO listed several business ventures in which council officials, including the director-general and former finance director, had private interests. The NAO said it had discovered no evidence of financial impropriety. But Mr Alan Williams, a Labour member of the Commons public accounts committee, said he found it hard to understand the logic of the council's financial arrangements. The NAO had three main criticisms: The council had not established a 'full arms-length' relationship with other bodies within the Sports Council group, so that accounting arrangements were confused. The council's financial arrangements did not protect the taxpayer's position. Three years ago, the council created a charitable company called the Sports Council Trust Company, which administers Pounds 33.77m in assets, including leading sports centres. The NAO discovered that the company's officials would be in breach of their duties if they were to re-transfer assets to the council or to the Exchequer. The full council was not notified of conflicts of interest involving its officials. Neither the director-general nor the finance director had, for example, declared shareholdings in a company acquired by the Sports Council Trust Company in 1990. Yesterday the council stressed that the NAO's criticisms covered only a small part of its operations. It said the cited conflicts of interests related to businesses which were already within the Sports Council group rather than outside it. The NAO's report will go to the public accounts committee, which will question officials at a meeting on February 21.</p>

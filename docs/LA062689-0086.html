			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS: INERT ART SETTLES FOR MERELY FILLING IN THE BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The teen-ager had painted a still life, and she was burning to know what her  father thought of it. His words would mean more to her than just fatherly  approval, because he was the painter Philip Guston, one of a handful of major  artists in the United States:  </P> <P>  "Don't you see?" he asked.  </P> <P>  "See what?"  </P> <P>  "That background here. Just look how it's painted. Now, what was going on  inside you when you painted that?"  </P> <P>  I looked carefully. I couldn't remember what I'd been thinking. It looked  perfectly OK to me. "What's wrong with it?" I asked.  </P> <P>  Suddenly he seemed irritated, almost angry. "There's no feeling in it, that's  what's wrong. It's flat. Filling in. Like painting a house. . . . I don't mean  to hurt you darling, but you have to understand -- that's simply not painting."  </P> <P>  That conversation comes from a powerful new book, "Night Studio: A Memoir of  Philip Guston" (Knopf), by his daughter, Musa Mayer. It provides a close and  candid look at the artist's personality and struggles, and the way his family  was affected by them.  </P> <P> The passage came to mind the other day at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, where  "All Media '89" -- featuring nearly 100 works by county artists -- is on view  through July 18. Although this show is somewhat better than last year's -- when  the Irvine Creative Arts Guild first turned to a juried format for its annual  exhibit -- it remains a repository for a lot of depressingly inert art.  </P> <P> Juror William Otton, president of the Art Institute of Southern California, is  partly at fault in turning a blind eye to the deficiencies in most of the 98  pieces he chose from the 284 entries. It did not help that he was obliged -- as  is common in juried shows -- to pick enough pieces to fill up the gallery.  </P> <P> But ultimately the fault lies with the artists themselves. Most give no  impression of trying to make subtle and serious work. Instead, they seem to be  aiming no higher than lower-level gallery fare and second-rate commercial art.  </P> <P> While it would be ridiculous to expect dazzling execution or rigorous  conceptual standards from the artists who enter such shows, it is not out of  place to expect a glimmer of imagination and a degree of awareness of what  serious contemporary art is, or can be. Looking at a sea of tepid landscapes  and hackneyed figurative work and flatfooted abstraction, a viewer begins to  wonder whether the artists realize how distant their work is from the real  stuff.  </P> <P> Juried shows do seem to attract a small percentage of genuinely naive artists  who may see the world in wonderfully skewed ways, even if they are ignorant of  the difference between gift-shop kitsch and serious art.  </P> <P> But most of the artists whose work is on view seem to be doing little more than  "filling in the background," like the teen-aged Musa Guston. Unlike her, they  may not have heard the brutal truth from a respected teacher. Perhaps part of  the blame lies with community art classes, in which so much attention is paid  to technical matters that the passions and ideas that feed into art do not  receive their due. Perhaps teachers are also afraid of losing enrollments if  they get too critical.  </P> <P> If only everyone who takes an art course could emerge with one big idea  emblazoned forever in their minds: In fine art, as opposed to the lower slopes  of commercial art, technical ability does not substitute for fresh ideas. Based  on his drawing, "Looking Back at Youth," for example, a viewer is convinced  that Ron Elstad could probably draw anything under the sun. But his image -- of  a paunchy older man looking at a couple of pretty teen-aged girls at the beach  -- is trite. It tells us nothing new about youth or age.  </P> <P> A few artists do seem to be reaching for big things that elude their grasp.  Martha Jackson's "Stasis," a painting on wood with whitened, canceled-out  images, seems too carefully controlled, too clamped-down and consciously  perfectionist to come across as a trustworthy personal vision. In Lynn  Kubasek's "Five-Day Record" -- a series of tubular lengths of gold material  knotted in various ways -- the glitz factor makes it unclear whether the piece  is to be read as a kind of "process" art.  </P> <P> Among the brighter spots in the show, Phora Gerdes' "Ol' Lady on Cane" ranks  high. It did not even win an award, but it has a vitality lacking in many other  pieces. Made of castaway objects, the sculpture is a fragmentary portrait of an  elderly woman. Her single arm holds a metal cane planted in a circle of brown  rug. Inside her cotton-stuffed brain, we see the image from her youth that  sticks in her mind: two little girls on a tiny, revolving teeter-totter.  </P> <P> The witty "Rose Parade" title supplies the oomph factor for Sally Goldberg's  color photograph of rows of rose corsages in their little plastic vials, stuck  in a piece of plastic foam. The piece won an Irvine Art Center Special  Exhibition Award.  </P> <P> April Hunt-Good's "Laguna Canyon No. 1," a painting of the patterns left by  tractors in the earth -- which won the Orange County Centennial Theme Award --  is a cut above more routine landscapes, forsaking prettiness to express a point  of view about land use.  </P> <P> Darlene Campbell took first place with "Waiting for Another Season," a vividly  painted lonely landscape in which fallen leaves almost seem to hover over a  rich, dense carpet of grass. But this is work that hovers on the edge of  formula, with its neatly wrapped-and-tied presentation of sweet details.  </P> <P> Chris Gallup uses a sort of Chinese-box trick -- concentric, graduated images  of folded card tables attached to a real table -- in "The Vertigo of the  Simulacrum." A companion piece consists of similarly arranged photographs of  the first piece, taking the whole idea of copy-making into a truly dizzying  realm.  </P> <P> It was good too to see work by relatively established artists Duncan Simcoe and  Jim Cokas. (Cokas' blurry fixed-focus camera photographs netted an Irvine Fine  Arts Special Exhibition Award; Simcoe took second place with a wry mixed-media  piece, "A brief explanation of our home marketing techniques.")  </P> <P> Perhaps, with increasing numbers of entrants whose mettle has been tested in  the "real world" of respected curated exhibitions, other competitors will be  more likely to push themselves beyond banality -- or frankly face the  possibility that their talents might lie in another direction.  </P> <P>  "All Media '89" remains through July 18 at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321  Yale Ave. Gallery hours are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to  6 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Technology crucial to debate on UK's economic renaissance Sir, In his review ('British culture in the clear', April 8) of W D Rubinstein's latest book, Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain, 1750-1990, Sir Geoffrey Owen once again contributes thoughtfully to the debate about the causes of the British industrial malaise. Unfortunately, however, neither he nor, so far as I could tell, Rubinstein pays due attention to the importance of exploiting technology. In my experience, most analysts and historians - whether of an economic or sociological bent - overlook the salient role which technologies of many kinds have played in both the rise and fall of the British economy in relation to most of our international competitors. For example, the period of Britain's greatest economic (and military) power was during the 19th century, when it was pre-eminent in its ability first, to conquer new, basic technologies such as steam and the manufacture of iron and steel. It then was successful in exploiting these technologies commercially in the form of artifacts such as bridges, ships, railways etc and the components (rolling stock and so forth) that went with them. By comparison, in the most powerful and pervasive technology of the second half of this century - electronics - substantial British companies able to compete successfully in relatively free markets on a global scale are notable only by their scarcity. At the same time, the Japanese (and other Asian) industrial economies have risen from scratch to giddy heights largely on the skilful commercialisation of electronic goodies for the home and the office. And the US economy would be even closer to a sticky end were it not for its continuing strengths in this massive industrial sector comprising software, chips, information technology, computers and much else besides. My main point, then, is that whereas the debate about Britain's elusive economic renaissance must obviously go on (until we either succeed or relax finally into a thatched cottage economy), the argument must - simply must - take technology, and its power to deliver jobs and economic growth, fully into account in both the analysis of Britain's past successes and failures, and in building new industrial policies for the future.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mitzi Madrigal; from the "Radio Reloj Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres  Olsen promised no new tax packages during his administration.  What we need are tax reforms and a channeling of all taxes  through certain groups to prevent the country from going further  into debt, Figueres said. He also said that the agriculture and  livestock sector would be strengthened, and negotiations with  Mexico on the free trade treaty would be analyzed. If the  country's producers derive no advantage from the treaty it would  not be signed. Let us listen to the statements made by Engineer  Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of our country.    [Begin recording] [Figueres] It is a technical matter and it  will be up to the economic team to define what specific actions  will be carried out, but I can tell you we are interested in  solving the fiscal deficit problem. A high fiscal deficit is  not beneficial for the economy, the Costa Rican people, the  productive sector, or any one else. Therefore, I think we will  all be working on that task. This has to do a lot with [words  indistinct] where we have to be more efficient in collecting  taxes. This also deals with the expenditures; we have to be  more austere, more careful in the appropriation of public  resources.    [Madrigal] On the subject of sales tax, the current  administration increased it 3 percent even though it was always  at 10 percent. Now it is again 10 percent as was normal. Do  you think your administration will adjust that tax?    [Figueres] I do not think the country needs a new tax  package. I think the country certainly needs tax reforms in  which we have four or five kinds of taxes instead of having more  than 100 taxes. Also, those taxes should be easy to calculate,  easy to collect, and they should be easily and efficiently  controlled. Furthermore, those who have more should pay more,  and those who have less should pay less. In that sense, we are  interested in progressive taxes, rather than regressive taxes,  because those who have more pay more taxes.    Definitely, due to the current administration's a lack of a  clear policy to encourage the agricultural and livestock sector,  we have seen a considerable decline in cattle herds.  Furthermore, the numbers indicate that Costa Rica is on the  verge of going from being a meat exporting country to a meat  importing country, but we will be working very closely with the  country's cattle sector. The policies we will define to  reactivate the cattle sector will be worked out with this  country's cattlemen; and there will be policies to give priority  to credit, productivity, and efficiency in the handling of  cattle herds so this tendency may be reversed.    [Madrigal] Regarding the free trade treaty with Mexico,  Costa  Rica carried out a negotiation but it closed the chapter on  agricultural issues without really negotiating anything because  no basic product was included. What would your position be if  you were to take office and the treaty were still unsigned?  Would you continue to give priority to the agricultural  segment? Would you not sign that treaty with Mexico?    [Figueres] Well, we have said that we are interested in  continuing negotiations on the treaty with Mexico. We are  interested because it would open new markets for our export  products. However, we have also made it clear that those  treaties must be negotiated, on the Costa Rican side, by a team  that is made up of government people and people from the  productive sector. If the production sector is not satisfied,  does not agree with, or does not feel comfortable with the  agreement, then it will not be useful to us. In that sense, if  nothing has been signed with Mexico when we take office, we  would continue to work hand in hand with the nation's producers,  in the industrial as well as the agricultural fields, to see  what kind of treaty we sign with Mexico. [end recording]    The tour Jose Maria Figueres Olsen was scheduled to begin in  a few days has been rescheduled, because issues such as the  creation of the commission that will organize the transfer of  power, as well as the creation of the Figueres administration  cabinet that will be sworn in on 8 May, shall be analyzed this  week.</p>

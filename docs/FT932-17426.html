			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Training aspirations are wide of the mark: More effort is needed to ensure targets are met AMBITIOUS new national targets aimed at transforming the skills of the workforce by the turn of the century will not be met in full on present performance, according to the first annual report of a new government advisory council. Mr Peter Davis, chairman of the National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets, which was set up last month to monitor the targets, said the rate of take-up of the qualifications had to increase in order to meet the tar-gets. Mr Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier, said: 'These are not world-class targets. They are the minimum that have to be gained and they can only be achieved through effort at national and local level.' One of the targets is for 80 per cent of young people to reach National Vocational Qualification level two, or its academic equivalent of four GCSEs, by 1997. At present 55.1 per cent of young people have reached this, an increase of 3.7 percentage points since 1991. However, an annual rate of increase of 5 percentage points is required to meet the target. Ministers attending yesterday's formal launch of the advisory council appeared to be willing to take more responsibility for delivery of the targets, a development it is understood the Treasury opposes. The targets, set by the Confederation of British Industry, have in the past only been endorsed by government. By taking greater responsibility for meeting the targets, the Treasury fears it may have to put more money into education to achieve the goals. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said that in future all submissions to his department on new initiatives would be required to demonstrate the contribution they would make to the achievement of the targets. The council, made up of top executives and senior teachers, will report both to Mr Patten and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary. It will also make an annual report which will be publicly available. Mr Davis stressed the body's independence and the desire of its members not to be a 'talking shop'. A key task, Mr Davis said, was for the council to bring some rigour to the monitoring of NVQs. He said: 'Our credibility depends on accurate reporting and monitoring of the targets and making sure they are properly defined.' Critics have said that some targets are not measurable while, others are open to interpretation. One target aims for 50 per cent of medium-sized to large organisations to qualify for Investors in People, a government award which recognises good practice in training and career development. However, as the target is now worded, a company achieving the standard in many of its divisions could qualify for one or several awards, depending on how many company divisions there are. Unilever, for example, could receive as many as 30 awards. There are also criticisms of the methodologies used to establish target baselines. The targets for adults do not include attainments by the unemployed, and this could cast doubt on the overall results obtained. The council will also not have any information on how many people are working towards NVQs. There is no mechanism at present to record this.</p>

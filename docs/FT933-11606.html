			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recedes a little in spite of IBM rebound Wall Street US STOCKS edged lower from their record high yesterday in spite of a rebound in IBM shares after the computer group's second-quarter results were released, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.24 off at 3,565.46. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.85 to 448.24 and the Nasdaq composite shed 3.54 to 701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE was 257m shares. Analysts expected some early losses following Monday's record-breaking performance by the Dow, when the leading average finished at an all-time high of 3,567.70. In spite of the record, the markets remain jittery, as indicated by the failure of other indices to match the Dow's performance, and by early selling yesterday. This repeated the recent pattern of quick profit-taking on the day after a solid rise in share prices. The day's main economic news - a small decline in the Conference Board's July consumer confidence index - was not good for market sentiment; but it had little impact on prices because it had been forecast, and because the attention of investors and dealers was primarily concentrated on IBM's results, which were released during the morning. IBM announced a second-quarter loss of Dollars 8bn, or Dollars 14.10 a share, after taking a big charge against earnings to cover job cuts and plant closures. The group also made a dividend cut. In the days running up to the announcement, IBM's stock had fallen in expectation of a heavy loss, further restructuring and a dividend reduction. IBM's operating income, before the charge, was better than expected, which explained why investors greeted the results with a steady stream of buying. IBM closed Dollars 3 1/4 up at Dollars 45 5/8 , near its high for the day. There were declines elsewhere in the sector. Data General eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/8 on news that losses at the minicomputer manufacturer widened in its fiscal third quarter to Dollars 16.4m due to continued weak sales of its proprietary computer products. Stratus Computer tumbled Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 23 3/4 after unveiling flat second-quarter earnings and warning that its earnings for the full year would come in below the 1992 level. USX-US Steel fell Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after the International Trade Commission issued a ruling broadly favourable to foreign steel makers in a dispute with the US government over steel pricing. Analysts fear the ruling will force US steel groups to cut their prices. On the Nasdaq market, Novell dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 18 3/8 as investors reacted to Monday's late warning that its third-quarter income would be lower than that from the second quarter. Aldus rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 17 1/4 on reporting a return to profitability after posting a loss a year ago. Canada TORONTO finished sharply higher for the second consecutive day, but still in relatively subdued trading. The TSE 300 index jumped 42.1 to 3,911.6 and rises outpaced declines by 463 to 275 after volume of 46.2m shares valued at CDollars 522m. The gold shares index rose a further 2.66 per cent. Energy stocks gained 1.5 per cent.</p>

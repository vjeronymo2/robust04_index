			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> DECISION DELAYED ON GATED COMMUNITY  </P> <P> The Moorpark Planning Commission on Monday voted to delay consideration of a  subdivision of a 348-acre site that would become the first privately gated  community in Moorpark, with ranch-style houses costing more than $1 million.  </P> <P> The commission wanted more information on the use of bridle trails by  non-residents of the subdivision.  </P> <P> The commission was also concerned about drainage for three proposed lots.  </P> <P> The project would be located north of downtown on Walnut Canyon Road and about  half a mile north of Casey Road. Walnut Canyon Road is the city's only northern  outlet to Fillmore and carries about 7,000 vehicles per day, according to a  traffic report.  </P> <P> The exclusive community would have an elaborate gated entry on Walnut Canyon  Road and an electric gate at the west end.  </P> <P> The 66 lots, each a minimum of five acres, would cost $400,000 to $650,000 and  would be surrounded by three-rail white fencing.  </P> <P> The next hearing on the development is scheduled for Dec. 3.

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Tokyo eases bond issuance limits JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance will allow a greater range of companies to issue bonds overseas from next month, in a move which will ease the pressure on some Japanese companies which need to refinance equity warrant bonds issued in the late 1980s. The ministry will also loosen restraints on yen denominated bond issues in the domestic market by foreign issuers - known as 'samurai' bonds - allowing new low-rated borrowers into the market. Both moves are in line with government proposals earlier this year to eliminate limits on corporate bond issuance, allowing a broader range of companies to raise funds. The easing of limits will create an alternative funding method for weaker Japanese companies needing to refinance repayments on equity-linked issues. The slump in the Tokyo stock market has dried up sources of equity-linked financing. Moreover, Japanese banks, faced with increasing bad loans and the need to meet international capital-to-assets ratios, are setting tougher standards on loans. From next month, Japanese companies with a single-A credit rating or higher will be able to issue straight bonds denominated in a foreign currency, yen bonds issued in the Eurobond market and warrant bonds. A rating of triple-B, the lowest investment grade credit rating, will be the minimum requirement for a company to issue yen denominated convertible bonds. In addition, numerical standards on net assets, dividends and profits will also be eased. Bank-guaranteed bonds with warrants, straight bonds and warrant bonds guaranteed by a parent company are also subject to easier requirements. For samurai bonds, foreign borrowers or international organisations with an investment grade credit rating will be able to access the market. Currently, the issuance in the Samurai market is limited to foreign organisations with ratings of single-A or higher, or with a triple-B rating and a government guarantee. Ministry officials said the move was aimed at increasing domestic capital outflow abroad. However, the easing of restrictions comes when many Japanese investors are looking to decrease investment portfolios rather than expand. Many face large losses on investment portfolios due to the sharp decline in share prices, and the decline in profits due to the economic downturn is squeezing cash flow.</p>

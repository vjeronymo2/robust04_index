			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 2 April, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  concurrently foreign minister, gave a lecture at a meeting held  by a group mainly composed of junior bureaucrats for the purpose  of exchanging views among different professions. In dealing  with the realignment of political parties, Hata said: "It is out  of the question (that the coalition parties) should act as if  they were five horses heading in different directions while  pulling the same carriage. Efforts must be made to unite the  coalition parties in one way or another because political  dynamism now lies in competition with the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]." In this way, Hata reiterated his intention to  promote the plan for forming a new party and coordinate the  selection of coalition-supported candidates for the next House  of Representatives' election.</p>

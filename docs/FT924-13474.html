			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (2): Momentum remains strong - Privatisation programmes ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem put the country's telephone company Entel up for sale in 1989 at a time when the economy was in terminal decline and a restructuring of the public sector was urgently needed if the country was ever to dig itself out of a mounting foreign debt crisis. While the profits motive was the driving force behind the privatisation of Entel, the telephone company, it was not the only factor. The Menem government also recognised that an efficient telephone system is essential for any modern economy. Entel's network was antiquated and over-stretched after years of neglect, and one of the pre-conditions of the privatisation was that the new owners would modernise and upgrade the telephone system. When the Singapore government said it intended to privatise Singapore Telecom a year later, it had a different set of objectives. Singapore already had one of the most modern and sophisticated telephone networks in the world. Singapore Telecom wanted to bring in private investors to assist with its transition from a state utility to a dynamic multinational competing for business in both its own and overseas markets. Privately-owned telephone companies like BT and American Telephone and Telegraph had already started to move into the provision of global telecommunications services to multinational companies, and any telephone operator that failed to react to the threat that they posed ran the risk of losing its most lucrative business customers. Bessel Kok, the chief executive of Belgacom, the Belgian telephone operator, listed the various objectives of privatisation programmes illustrated by Entel of Argentina and Singapore Telecom, at an international conference in Amsterdam in June organised by IBC Technical Services. Mr Kok put the objectives of privatisation under three headings: Financial objectives: I. To reduce government deficit, often linked to a broader goal of reducing the public sector's involvement in the telecommunications business. 2.To create stable mechanisms to raise investment funds, which implies demonstarting a good prospect for the business and solid management. Political objectives: To encourage popular capitalism via widespread shareholding and special arrangements for small shareholders. Margaret Thatcher's crusading privatisation programme in the UK in the 1980s trumpeted the claim that Britain would become a nation of private shareholders. Business objectives: 1. To transform a state monopoly into a competitive business. This means not only creating internal shock within the company but also opening the business to external scrutiny. 2. To obtain technological know-how, this objective is absolutely essential for developing countries. 3. To create international alliances with other service providers, which could be defensive or offensive. Such is the momentum of the push towards privatisation, that it is difficult to keep track of the sell-offs in process. At the last count, there were eight completed privatisations, six telephone operators were in the middle of privatisation programmes, and there were 12 planned privatisations. Latin America and its new wave of right-wing presidents has been the biggest privatiser, and the catalyst for privatisations in other countries with large foreign debts. Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela have all sold majority shares in their national telephone companies while Brazil, Uruguay, and Costa Rica all have planned privatisation programmes. Interest has crossed the Atlantic to Africa over the last one to two years where governments in Kenya, Nigeria and the Sudan are working with the World Bank on privatisation programmes. In Europe, British Telecom has set the pace and the example for others to follow. Since its privatisation in 1984, BT's profits have climbed steadily and are now hovering at around Pounds 3bn a year - or, as the UK tabloid press prefers to say, Pounds 95 per second. The tax windfall and the proceeds from the sale - the 25 per cent of BT that was sold last year valued the company at Pounds 24bn - are the major enticements for Chancellor Kohl in Germany to privatise up to 49 per cent of Deutsche Telekom. The German operator will spend up to DM70bn modernising the east German telephone network between 1991 and 1997 and is in dire need of new funds. Deutsche Telekom is also pressing the German government for a part privatisatlon because of concern about losing large German customers to new competitors and losing out in the race to develop global services. Stung by tighter regulation in the UK and competition from Mercury Communications, BT has embarked on a global expansion programme and aims to steal major German business accounts from under the nose of Deutsche Telekom. The Deutsche Telekom privatisation will be in 1996, if the government can push it through parliament next year. In addition, Swedish Telecom, Telecom Finland, the three Portugese operators TP, TLP and CPRM, Telecom Eireann, the Hungarian Telephone Company and Czechoslovakia's two operators are either being privatised, or are being considered by their governments as possible targets for privatisation. Privatisations are providing telephone companies in Europe, the US and south-east Asia with an opportunity to off-load some of their monopoly profits. The trend in privatisation programmes to date has been for governments in developing countries to sell their telephone operators to other telephone companies, while in the UK, United States shares have been placed on the stock market. Leading buyers of telephone operators include the US Baby Bells, Cable and Wireless and the Spanish operator Telefonica. Bell Atlantic and Ameritech bought 100 per cent of Telecom New Zealand in 1990 and will reduce their joint stake to 49 per cent by 1994. Telefonica, meanwhile, has bought into Entel in Argentina and two Chilean operators. The momentum of privatisation programmes remains strong. According to studies by Booze Allen and Hamilton and the World Bank, some 30 privatisations will take place between now and 1995, with the goal to raise over Dollars 150bn. But at the end of his presentation at the Amsterdam conference this summer, Bessel Kok at Belgacom raised an important question: 'Will there be enough capital?' This question, he says 'will be particularaly critical for telecommunications in developing countries.' Investors will become more selective, he says, and opportunities in Europe and the Pacific Rim might be seen as safer bets than countries like Nigeria and the Sudan.

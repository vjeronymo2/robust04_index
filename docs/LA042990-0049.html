			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HANDLING OF STUDENT  </P> <P> We have been following the stories about Robert Davis, the John H. Francis  Polytechnic High School student recently arrested for living above the school's  auditorium.  </P> <P> It would seem more appropriate for Principal Virginia Holt to have referred him  to a school counselor or social worker for housing assistance.  </P> <P> The city attorney's time would be better spent appealing decisions that return  students who have assaulted teachers to the classroom.  </P> <P> This procedural mentality is the foundation of the educational crisis. It  stifles creativity and initiative to maintain custodial integrity. We hope the  mishandling of the situation has a greater impact on Holt's career than on that  of Davis.  </P> <P> WILLIAM PIRONE  </P> <P> ANN LARSEN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

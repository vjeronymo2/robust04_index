			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Overseas expansion holds ISA to 15% rise ISA International, the Bradford-based distributor of computer consumables, reported pre-tax profits up by 15 per cent from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 2.56m in the six months to the end of June. Turnover grew by 37 per cent to Pounds 91m (Pounds 66.6m). ISA said gross margins had been reduced as a result of increasing exports to new markets. Mr Jim Salmon, who took over as chairman earlier this month, said the company had been in talks with a number of manufacturers about working more closely together. The benefits should be seen in the next 12 months. Earnings per share came out at 3.821p (3.293p) and the interim dividend is being raised from 0.55p to 0.605p.</p>

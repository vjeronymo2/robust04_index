			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 10 Apr -- Zheng Jinggi, Chinese  ambassador to the State of Kuwait, has expressed his country's  readiness to exert intensive efforts to protect Kuwait's  legitimate rights and guarantee peace and security in the Gulf  region.    The Chinese ambassador said in a statement to AL-QABAS,  published here today, that China "calls for complete respect of  Kuwait's sovereignty, the actual implementation of the Security  Council's resolutions in connection with the border demarcation,  and the release of prisoners, detainees, and missing persons."  [passage omitted]    He praised bilateral relations between his country and  Kuwait, particularly political, economic, and commercial  relations, and pointed out that the Kuwaiti fund for Arab  economic development has offered loans at easy terms for 11  Chinese agricultural, industrial, and transport development  projects, and that consultations are underway on six other  projects. [passage omitted]    On the question of human rights in China, the ambassador  affirmed that "China pays enormous attention to human rights,"  pointing out that "the Chinese people currently enjoy the widest  democracy and freedom in history."    He said "we would like to conduct a dialogue on an equal  basis on human rights with other countries, including the United  States," to avoid the emergence of any obstacles which could  affect the development of natural relations between the two  countries because of this issue.</p>

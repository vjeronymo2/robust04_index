Journalist Cabrera Peinado has further details from Pinar del  Rio.    [Cabrera Peinado] Through 28 January some 400,000 union  leaders in Cuba will be preparing, holding discussions and  making proposals with regard to the measures the Revolution's  leadership will have to adopt to streamline internal finances;  and as of 28 January, meetings with all Cuban workers will be  held. Many proposals were made openly and without formalities at  the meetings held at La Primavera and at the dried tobacco  processing center. Among these proposals was that the monitoring  and safekeeping of state resources be improved, so that these  resources will not be squandered or end up in the hands of  antisocial elements. Also, in these assemblies taking place in  Cuba, the residents of Pinar del Rio Province came out in favor  of finding ways to reduce to a minimum the amount of currency  circulating -- which is affecting the nation and, in particular,  the workers, because of the high prices of products on the black  market. They also came out in favor of increasing the nation's  production levels and improving the efficiency of enterprises.  They noted the need to raise certain prices, such as those of  cigarrettes, alcoholic beverages, and other products which, even  though they may be articles of prime necessity, should cost what  it costs to produce them. They also came out in favor of  subsidizing people who need a subsidy.    It was also said that there exist a number of services which  could perfectly well be charged for, such as admission to sports  and cultural events and students' clothing and books, as well as  cosmetic surgery and other health procedures that are not  indispensable to life.    Pedro Ross Leal said that our fatherland is urgently in need  of a battle for economic efficiency, and, more than anything  else, needs to find solutions to current problems. He added that  the nation cannot allow itself the luxury of continuing to have  69 percent of its enterprises be unprofitable, for in addition  to what is invested in health and education, 1.6 billion pesos  are paid out in social insurance and welfare annually.    [Begin Ross recording] And what the nation wants, what the  leadership of the Revolution wants, and what we as a union  movement have to do is to encourage the workers, as owners, and  in the final analysis as the principal organizations in our  society, to play the part that befits them.

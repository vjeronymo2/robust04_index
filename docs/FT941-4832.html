			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst and BASF cut dividends as earnings fall Hoechst and BASF, two of Europe's biggest chemicals concerns, yesterday announced reduced dividends and earnings for 1993. BASF cut its pay-out to DM8 from DM10, Hoechst to DM7 from DM9. Although the German-based groups provided little more than basic 1993 data yesterday, the results further encouraged share traders who have shown increasing interest in the recovery value of cyclical stocks, notably chemicals makers. Sales and earnings figures from both groups suggested the rate of decline had slowed during the past year, while national economic growth figures, released yesterday, helped reassure markets that the worst of the domestic recession was past. Hoechst shares, up DM6.90 to DM315.50 at the end of official trading, continued rising after hours, while BASF had risen DM5.70 to DM311 by the close. Group pre-tax profits at Hoechst fell 42 per cent to DM1.23bn (Dollars 723m), after being 50 per cent down after six months. Turnover, which was 2.4 per cent lower at the half-way mark, rose 0.4 per cent to DM46bn. The company complained of price pressure and very low European demand, which was evened out by improved overseas business. Net group earnings were 36 per cent lower at DM756m. The weakness of domestic markets was highlighted by a 58 per cent slump in pre-tax earnings and a 7.6 per cent fall in sales at the German parent, Hoechst AG. A similar pattern emerged at BASF's parent, where German turnover fell 9.6 per cent, and pre-tax earnings were 16 per cent lower. Group sales were down 3.3 per cent at DM40.57bn, after being 7 per cent lower after six months. Pre-tax profits, 50 per cent lower in the first half of the year, were down 15 per cent at DM1bn. Both groups pressed ahead with savings programmes last year, shedding 10,000 employees between them. Further job losses are expected. Analysts expect more joint ventures, disposals of non-core, unprofitable businesses, and a search for profitable new ventures.</p>

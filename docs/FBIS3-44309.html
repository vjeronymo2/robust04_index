			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhou Nan Issues His New Year's Message, Looking </F> Forward to Hong Kong's Incomparably Bright Future"]    [Text] In the New Year message he delivered yesterday,  Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch,  pointed out: With the strong backing of the motherland and the  powerful support of the 1.2 billion people including compatriots  in Hong Kong under any circumstances, we have the firm  confidence and full ability to overcome any obstacles that might  occur in the course of progress and ensure Hong Kong's long-term  stability and prosperity. This goal of ours must, and can, be  attained. The full text of Zhou Nan's New Year message is as  follows:    As it will soon be the fifth Spring Festival of the 1990's,  let me extend my season's best wishes to all compatriots and  foreign friends in Hong Kong.    In the past year, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, more  profound changes have taken place in China, eye-catching  achievements have been scored in its reform and opening up to  the outside world and economic construction, its stable and  harmonious political situation has been further consolidated,  and its international prestige has been enhanced. In the new  year, China will continue to achieve sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development with development as the goal,  reform as the motive force, and stability as the condition, and  forge ahead with great strides along the path of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. The vigorous  development of the motherland has enabled Hong Kong to overcome  some manmade, negative factors cropping up in the past year,  thus maintaining its economic vitality. The compatriots in Hong  Kong have come to realize more and more clearly that the fate of  Hong Kong is more and more closely linked with that of the  motherland, whose stability and development is the indispensable  prerequisite for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability.    In the past year, the Chinese side has made active and  sincere efforts to strive to achieve an agreement with the  British side on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong  on the basis of the "three conformities" principle. However,  quite regrettably, the British side insisted on its wrong  position of "three violations," broke its promise by  unilaterally tabling its package to the Legislative Council for  discussion when no agreement had been reached between the two  sides. As a result, the bilateral talks came to an end. Under  such circumstances, we must, along with the Hong Kong residents,  fully accelerate the preparatory work for the formation of the  first government of the special administrative region to ensure  the smooth transition in 1997 and Hong Kong's long- term  stability and prosperity. This way of doing things conforms to  the Hong Kong residents' long-term interests.    We earnestly hope that people in various walks of life in  Hong Kong will make concerted efforts, offer suggestions,  actively participate in the preparatory work in various fields  for the formation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  [SAR], and continue to contribute their bit to the maintenance  of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. With the strong  backing of the motherland and the powerful support of the 1.2  billion people including compatriots in Hong Kong under any  circumstances, we have the firm confidence and full ability to  overcome any obstacles that might occur in the course of  progress, guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition,  comprehensively implement the "one country, two systems"  principle, and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity. This goal of ours must and also can be attained.  The future of the motherland is incomparably bright, and the  future of Hong Kong also will surely be bright.    In conclusion, I wish all Hong Kong residents good health  and  success in everything.    According to another report, at the time when he delivered  his New Year message to the Hong Kong media, Director Zhou Nan  answered reporters' questions. He pointed out: Hong Kong and  the Chinese mainland have become an integral whole economically.  As the mainland enjoys political stability and its economy  develops, Hong Kong will certainly have bright prospects, and  this is precisely where the Chinese Government's confidence and  ability are manifested.    Asked if the absence of British cooperation would pose a  problem for the smooth transition, Zhou Nan said: "As I see it,  it will not pose any big problem. Naturally, we hope there is  cooperation. However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one  side does not really want it, does that mean that we cannot get  along and we will not pursue the `one country, two systems'  principle?" "Still we will implement the Basic Law in  accordance with the `one country, two systems' principle."    Zhou Nan said: "The Chinese Government has strictly kept its  word in the past and will do so in the future. We already have  a good reputation in the world in this regard."    In touching the issue of how to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth  transition, he pointed out: The objective of the work of the  Preliminary Work Committee is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth  transition. With the mainland's political situation stable and  its economy developing at high speed and with the support and  participation of the entire Chinese people (including Hong Kong  residents), the Chinese Government will surely establish, as  scheduled, the Hong Kong SAR and the region's first government  in strict accordance with the principle of one country, two  systems and the provisions of the Basic Law.    He went on to say: "Now, the whole world has noticed that  China's political situation is stable and its economic growth  rate has won the admiration of many foreign friends. With their  economies becoming an integral whole, the Chinese mainland and  Hong Kong share weal and woe with each other. If the mainland  prospers, so will Hong Kong. This is where our confidence and  ability are manifested."    Asked of the impact of pursuing a single rate of renminbi  against other currencies, Zhou Nan said: The pursuance of the  single rate will be helpful and not harmful to Hong Kong.    Zhou Nan said to the journalists on the spot: We will surely  implement the Basic Law. We and you are identical on this  point. Some people will leave after 1997, but all of you want to  stay. We also hope you will stay.</p>

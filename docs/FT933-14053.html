			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Top US team to press Hanoi over MIAs MR Winston Lord, US assistant secretary of state, arrived in Hanoi yesterday to press for greater co-operation from the government on American servicemen unaccounted for since the Vietnam war. The delegation, the most senior from the US since the war, was dispatched by President Bill Clinton after he decided earlier this month to stop blocking Hanoi's access to loans from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral financing institutions. He demanded more progress on the 'missing-in-action' (MIA) issue before he could end a US trade embargo. In Washington it emerged that Vietnam could start borrowing from the IMF as early as October, after a review by the fund's board this week. Hanoi has been ineligible for IMF loans since 1985 after falling into arrears on debt. The IMF said the board meeting produced 'an international consensus that would allow full-fledged co-operation between Vietnam and the IMF to develop'. Vietnam's programme of macroeconomic and structural adjustment had made considerable progress, an IMF spokesperson said, and Mr Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, had expressed 'deep satisfaction' at the prospects of renewed co-operation. The next step is for Vietnam to clear arrears of about SDR100m (Pounds 92.9m) with the help of a support group led by France and Japan. The IMF could then restore its eligibility for loans and negotiate an economic adjustment programme. The first drawing of up to SDR120m on a standby facility could be made soon after the IMF's annual meeting at the end of September. Once the IMF and the multilateral development banks have resumed lending, pressure from US companies to be allowed to trade and invest is expected to grow. Mr Clinton must decide by September 14 whether to renew the trade embargo for another year. However, Mr David Givans, of Disabled American Veterans, one of four veterans' groups represented in Mr Lord's delegation, said Mr Clinton had made clear that his decision on IMF lending 'was not a precursor to any other economic outcome (and) that this trip would in fact decide how the US proceeds from here on in'. The Vietnamese government says it is doing all it can to help account for missing Americans and has opened archives, allowed investigators access to closed areas and hosted numerous American visitors. It says it has returned all 591 Americans it was holding in 1973 when US forces withdrew. Mr Allen Kent, of Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the veterans wanted to obtain a guarantee from Hanoi that it would give full co-operation and assistance to US investigators tracing the 2,253 Americans officially missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</p>

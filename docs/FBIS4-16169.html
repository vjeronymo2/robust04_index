			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the </F> Russian president, by Sergey Sidorov, under "Russia's Interests"  rubric; date and place not given: "Vitaliy Churkin: We Need a  Stable Europe"]    [Text] [Sidorov] Russia has viewed its interests in the  Balkans differently at different times. For example, in the  days of the Ottoman empire it advocated the protection of the  Christian peoples, who needed support in their national  liberation struggle. Later, during World War I, the Russian  emperor accomplished a special Christian exploit by standing up  for fraternal Serbia -- in many ways a suicidal step. In World  War II Yugoslavia was our ally. But in the cold war era our  interests were better served by a neutral Yugoslavia, which made  it easier to organize strategic defense in the southwest sector.  As the Russian president's special envoy who deals directly  with the questions of Yugoslavia, how would you express Russia's  present-day interest in the Balkans?    [Churkin] In the first place it seems to me that Russia, as  a great European power, has an interest in a stable Europe. But  there cannot be a stable, peaceful Europe without stability in  the Balkans. That is axiomatic and it stems from the historical  experience which you spoke about. In addition, the war in  former Yugoslavia is crippling the whole region because economic  and cultural ties are breaking down and normal political  cooperation has stopped. The fact is that because of the  traditional ties that we have with the Serbs and with other  peoples of this region, Russia can play a role in a settlement.  Furthermore, the world has finally come to realize recently  that without Russia there can be no settlement in the Balkans at  all. Here, it seems to me, we have traveled a complex path in  the development of our diplomatic line: Moscow has moved from  what was to some extent an anti-Serb position to a more complex  maneuver in which it began to use its channels of communication  with the Serbs so as to encourage their constructive approaches  to a political settlement....    We also have economic interests and opportunities. We now  have quite good economic ties with Croatia. Just look at how  many different firms from the former Yugoslavia there are in  Moscow. Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian firms -- despite all the  sanctions-related difficulties those firms are still in Russia.  So I think that our interest is manifold -- political,  economic, and psychological.    [Sidorov] Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of  state, was once asked the secret of his diplomatic skill. He  said it was that he always told the truth. This sounds  paradoxical -- diplomats usually employ a lot of flowery  language for just one purpose -- to hide what they are really  thinking. Tell us the truth, how does the West understand the  thesis that the settlement in the Balkans is impossible without  Russia, and how do you understand it?    [Churkin] You have asked quite a complex question. It is  hard for me to say how the West views this. I proceed from the  premise that the Americans, for example, have stated to us  authoritatively at the very highest level that they do not see  the possibility of settling this conflict without Russia.  Furthermore, these declarations have been backed up by  practical actions. The result of those actions is that we are  in constant contact with the U.S. representative, Redman,  virtually every day. We discuss the strategy and tactics of  future actions. When in the past couple of weeks we put forward  the initiative of holding meetings with the Krajina Serbs and  the Croatians to conclude a cease-fire agreement, which took  place in our embassy in Zagreb 30 March, the Americans were  involved in this. And they did their part of the work  honorably. Even though this was a purely Russian initiative.  So, based on the principle of truthfulness, I would put the  question plainly in these terms: Russia must take a most active  part in the Yugoslav settlement. Otherwise it will not be  possible to bring the sides together and reach the agreement  everyone needs.    [Sidorov] It is obvious that without the solution of the  Serbian national question there will be no real settlement and  peace in the Balkans.    [Churkin] I entirely agree with you, of course.    [Sidorov] The West, in my view, has its own concept of the  settlement. In a certain sense the United States openly  supported the historic striving of the Croats and Muslims for  self-determination. Is Russia ready to support the Serbs living  outside Serbia and Montenegro in their legitimate striving for  self-determination?    [Churkin] First I would like to draw attention to the  following fact. The United States put forward the concept of a  Croatian-Muslim federation and a confederation between it and  Croatia based on the sovereign rights of the Croatians and  Muslims. But this does not mean the creation of an ethnically  pure Croatian or Muslim state. On the contrary, this concept is  based on a mix of Croatians and Muslims within the framework of  a federation inside a single state. Plus a definite linkup  [pristegivaniye] through a confederation with Croatia. What are  we ready to do and what have we already achieved in the light of  these proposals from the Americans? We have achieved  recognition of the fact that the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina  cannot be resolved unless it is taken into account that in  Bosnia-Herzegovina there are three peoples capable of forming a  state [gosudarstvoobrazuyushchiy narod], each of which,  including the Serbs, has its own sovereign rights and can make  its own sovereign decisions. There is also the understanding  that the solution of the problems of the regions of Croatia  which the United Nations is protecting and the Serbs inhabit is  also impossible without full regard for their rights.    [Sidorov] It is very difficult to try to understand what is  happening outside the historical context or if you do not know  how the conflict began. After all, it has long been known that  it was not the Serbs who began the "ethnic cleansing" itself.    [Churkin] It is curious that each side has a completely  opposing view on absolutely all questions, including history.  But there is something that I would like to stress now. The  world community, I am sure, will never accept that national  problems be resolved by the forcible expulsion of the  representatives of other nationalities. Unfortunately, all the  peoples of the former Yugoslavia embroiled in the conflict did  not understand sufficiently that it is necessary to take into  account the national interests of other peoples. That is what  ultimately led to the conflict.    [Sidorov] There are several internal causes of the conflict.  But the Balkans have always been a sphere of interests of the  great powers. Stability emerged there when they found a balance  of those interests. In my opinion, the Serbs, Croats, and  Muslims would have reached agreement long ago if there had not  been outside interference. Let us take the policy of united  Germany. Its interest was shown, among other things, in the  fact that former FRG Foreign Minister H.-D. Genscher did his  utmost to secure the recognition of Croatia from the members of  the EC. Even though nine Community members opposed the  premature recognition of Croatia, where hostilities were in  progress. This was how "international recognition" of the  forcible breakup of Yugoslavia began. Russia sided with the EC  at that time. You surely were right when you said that this was  more an anti-Serb position in Russian policy, which is generally  speaking uncharacteristic of our relations with that people.  After all, this was the destruction of the state in which the  Serbian question and indeed other questions had been  historically resolved. It was destroyed in the name of  supporting the self-determination of the national republics.    [Churkin] No, I did not say that with regard to this  specific question. What I said generally was that we were  pursuing a more subtle policy. But let us examine this issue.  It is a very important question. I hold the completely  opposite viewpoint. It is that no matter how hard we -- the  intermediaries, peacemakers, call it what you will -- try, until  the sides themselves agree, until they decide that the time has  come to make peace and reach agreement, there will be no peace.  And no one can help them there.    Now about Genscher and Germany's role. My view of matters is  this. I would not disagree if you said to me that Germany  wanted to see Croatia and Slovenia as independent states. They  have their own historic ties. But it would be an exaggeration  to say that Germany's position and the sentiments there were the  prime cause of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The decision on  recognition, even it was a mistake, as events subsequently  showed, was motivated by the desire to prevent the spread of  war. But what happened was the complete opposite, as can be  seen particularly clearly in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It  seems to me that one lesson for the international community must  be that it should have shown a certain modesty. There are  international conflicts which cannot be prevented or settled  merely by the authority of the international community. It is  necessary to begin by understanding the logic of what is going  on and not to immediately try to impose some kind of decisions.    [Sidorov] But yet the international community, as you call  it in general terms, even though it consists of specific states  with specific interests, and despite the warnings of many  politicians, is recognizing Croatia, followed by  Bosnia-Herzegovina. And then, to the roar of the guns, it  seemed to say as an aside: This was a misunderstanding. It  seems strange to me that Western diplomats could make so many  mistakes. Is there not some other factor in evidence here?  Perhaps the geopolitical cataclysms of the period of the  disintegration of the USSR encouraged the temptation to  "capture" spheres of influence in the Balkans, too?    [Churkin] Well, clearly this was influential. Admittedly, I  do not know whether we should seek some evil design here. This  is simply how things coincided. As the experts attest, people  began talking about the danger of the disintegration of  Yugoslavia back in 1980. In other words, it all began earlier  over there. Probably if at that time we had not been so absorbed  with our own internal problems we could have played a more  energetic role in the international arena. And perhaps if we  had acted jointly with others we could have alleviated or even  prevented some things. But this is all hypothetical and, as we  know, the hypothetical does not exist in history.    [Sidorov] Do you never get the impression that the war in  Bosnia has nevertheless served someone's external interests? A  unique, controllable crisis has arisen against the background of  which various peace plans have appeared only to disappear.  While essentially what we have is the division of Bosnia in two  -- between the Serbs and the Croats.    [Churkin] I do think so. I can say this because I have  conversed on this topic with Muslims, with Izetbegovic and  Silajdzic. There are politicians who have not deemed feasible  or correct any solution which would lead to the creation of a  Muslim state, albeit a small one, in Bosnia. This concerns even  plans for a union out of the three republics. Even here they  have seen the specter of the emergence of a Muslim state,  fearing that the union would subsequently collapse while the  state remained. On the other hand, there are very many  questions which are intertwined here. But it is difficult for me  to imagine a rational, cool decision by the world community that  it is necessary to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina in two, as this  creates an extremely dangerous precedent of national demarcation  as a result of war. As far as the most promising ways of  securing a political solution in Bosnia and Herzegovina are  concerned, however, it seems to me that what we could have is  the creation of a union in Bosnia and Herzegovina consisting of  two parts -- a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic, or  that part could be called something else. With the capital in  Sarajevo. Here each part of the union will possess pretty  extensive rights, but the territorial integrity of the state  will nevertheless be preserved.    [Sidorov] I would like to return to what we started with --  Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement. As I see it, former  Yugoslavia was a bipolar country. At the one pole you had  Slovenia and Croatia, which gravitated toward the West, and at  the other Serbia and Montenegro, traditional representatives of  Eastern Christian culture. Such a state could exist as a  single, stable formation only when you had a geopolitical  balance between East and West. When people began talking about  the need for Russia to be more active in the Balkans, I thought  perhaps the West had realized that the world needs a distinctive  role by Moscow which would restore some kind of balance in  Europe. But, you know, you can only get a balance when Russia  speaks in its own voice. Let the Americans play the banjo,  while the Russians play the balalaika. It's a fine instrument,  after all.    [Churkin] I simply have to agree with what you have said.  But here a host of questions can harbor a host of subtexts. I  will not enter into interpretation, because those who loudly  demand, say, the restoration of the Warsaw Pact or the Soviet  Union sometimes start exploiting the logic of discussion. That  is history. What happened happened because of certain  historical causes. This has undoubtedly had negative  consequences. And both we ourselves and to some extent  Yugoslavia too have suffered from this. But we are returning to  major international affairs undoubtedly because in a certain  sense the period of maturation of Russian foreign policy is  complete. It has been very difficult for us, because it would  be fundamentally wrong to suppose that Russia is the same as the  former Soviet Union, only smaller. A new geopolitical  situation, a very complex, multidirectional play of forces had  arisen. And time was needed to grasp our position in the world,  to sense our potential, to curb the chaotic processes under way  on our borders, and to get a precise idea of the approaches of  our partners -- not only Western partners but our Eastern  partners too -- toward the new Russia. And then to adopt  clearer stances in affairs which go beyond the crises happening  literally on Russia's borders.</p>

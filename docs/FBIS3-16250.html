			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A well-informed source in Russia's Federal  Counterintelligence Service confirmed that the British agent  detained in Moscow last January was Russian citizen Vadim  Sintsov, who held a high post in the arms industry concern SMM.    According to the Federal Counterintelligence Service, he  passed over information about Russia's defense potential and  test defense projects to British intelligence agencies.    The source did not confirm, however, that Sintsov had worked  with the British intelligence agencies since 1986. He said that  he had been recruited much later, but refused to give the exact  time or assess the damage inflicted on Russia.</p>

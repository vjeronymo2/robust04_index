			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Courts crack down A damages award made by the appeal court last week is one of the biggest ever in the UK for environmental pollution. The judgment could redefine the potential liabilities of businesses and insurers. Three court of appeal judges awarded Pounds 1,046,866 against a leather tannery, Eastern Counties Leatherwork, to Cambridge Water Company in compensation for contaminating a water aquifer. The water company had sued after it was forced to abandon a borehole at Sawston, Cambridgeshire, in 1976 after discovering concentrations in ground water of perchloroethene (PCEs), a dry-cleaning fluid used to degrease animal pelts which can be carcinogenic in large quantities. In an original judgment last July, Mr Justice Ian Kennedy found that PCEs had been accidentally spilled more than 17 years ago, but that the leather company could not have foreseen the pollution and was therefore not liable. But in the appeal court ruling, which is binding in all high courts, the judges found that the fact the pollution was unforeseeable made no difference to liability. The court found that ECL was not negligent, but liable 'in nuisance' - an older legal concept under which it is not necessary to prove any fault to show liability. According to Paul Taylor, of Berrymans, the solicitors acting for ECL and its insurers, the judgment 'changes the goalposts' for environmental liability cases, and makes companies more vulnerable. 'Hundreds of companies who dumped their goods on waste ground 20 to 30 years ago could now find themselves strictly liable,' he says. UK insurers have tended to underplay the dangers of claims arising from liability in nuisance, often offering the cover at little or no extra cost. This case could well serve as a warning that UK courts are becoming more sympathetic to plaintiffs in these kinds of cases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F> 20-25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution]    [Text] Industrialization and modernization must first of  all come in agriculture to improve agriculture. The political  report confirms that from now until the end of this decade,  industrialization and modernization must pay special attention  to the industrialization of agriculture and the rural economy.    Where do we exploit the capital resources for our  industrialization and modernization?    To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must  mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with  effective efforts to manage our capital, with domestic sources  of capital being regarded as crucial and foreign sources of  capital as important.    We confirm that foreign sources of capital are important,  especially in the first stage. It is necessary to introduce  structures and policies to attract more foreign capital, put it  to more effective use, and invite in modern technology and  equipment.    But foreign capital resources are limited and the demand on  capital for the entire industrialization and modernization is  very great, even in the intermediate period. The capital from  development aid is not much and is normally attached to certain  conditions. Moreover, in order to use foreign resources, it is  necessary to have the same amount of domestic capital. In  obtaining foreign loans, moreover, we must consider our  repayment capacity and requirements to ensure our independence  and economic and political sovereignty. Therefore, domestic  capital is still a decisive factor.    The newly industrialized countries, despite receiving much  external financial support, still have to mobilize 70 to 80  percent of their domestic capital in the first stage and  maintain a total investment of more than 30 percent of their GDP  for many consecutive years. If we want to overcome the danger  of further lagging behind in our economy, there is only one way:  We must be diligent and economical in production, be thrifty in  consumption, save for development investment, and increase the  total annual investment to more than 20 percent of our GDP in  the years ahead.    2. We must strive to implement the policy on developing the  multisectoral economy consistently and give various economic  components and business establishments more headway to develop  quickly and attain strong economic results.    Our party uniformly applies a policy of multisectoral  economic development. It considers this a long-term strategic  duty to encourage all sectors and people to invest for  production and business. It protects the legitimate interests  of all owners. At the same time, it strives to build and  consolidate the state-run economy and develop the cooperative  economy, giving the state-run economy a leading role and  gradually turning the cooperative economy into a foundation for  our economy as outlined by the party platform.    All economic components are equal. That means they are equal  under the law and are encouraged by the government to develop  within the bounds of the law. That does not mean the roles of  all economic components are the same in our new socio-economy.    How does the leading role of the state-run economy manifest  itself?    The state-run economy is a force that controls all important  economic industries, dominates the economy, and ensure the  stable development of our economy. It is also a force that  creates conditions and helps unite all economic components for  common development. It has the ability to intervene and  regulate the development of other economic components and of the  entire national economy. It guides the market-oriented economy  along the socialist direction. It sets examples of productivity  and efficiency for other economic components.    According to those requirements, at present the state-run  economic sector is running enterprises in the most important  production areas. Therefore, it is playing the leading role and  dominating the national economy. But its leading role has many  limits. First of all, its productivity and efficiency are still  low. In some cases, they are worse than those of the individual  economy. The state-run economy is not operational in certain  business areas that it should be. These weaknesses need to be  overcome in the future.    What lines and policies need to be applied to continue  rearranging and building a state-run economy sufficient to  ensure its leading role in the national economy?    In order to consolidate and build the state-run economy, on  the one hand, we have to rearrange state enterprises and deal  with those that run perennial losses with different measures.  On the other hand, we have to build new enterprises. The most  important thing is that we have to find measures to improve  state-run enterprises' performance.    We have to introduce the share holding system gradually,  depending on the nature and field of the enterprise. We must,  however, ensure the state holds the majority of shares.    We have to sell a certain number of shares in different  stages to people who work at the enterprise. We will also  experiment with selling some shares to organizations and  individuals outside the enterprise.    We have to study, experiment, and gradually apply profit  sharing in state enterprises (after paying taxes and allocations  for production savings and the social welfare fund) with workers  and officials at the enterprise.    On the basis of introducing the share holding system, we  will  organize a board of management that includes representatives of  the state, workers, and other share owners. We have to outline  regulations and requirements for the board of management to  select managers.    We have to perfect and apply different contractual forms in  state enterprises, gradually change federated enterprises and  general companies to corporations, and slowly eliminate the  systems of managing ministries and managing administration  authorities and the distinction between centrally managed  enterprises and locally managed enterprises.    The aforementioned measures are aimed at:    -- Making sure state enterprises and state properties are  owned by a concrete and direct owner who has a definite  responsibility for the efficient use of the property.    -- Creating power for the worker to identify with the  enterprise, participate in business policies, and prevent and  eliminate corruption.    -- Guaranteeing the enterprise's sovereignty and the  state's control and attracting more capital resources.</p>

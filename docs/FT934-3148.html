			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: MFA extended for further year The Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which restricts most Third World exports of textiles and clothing to the industrialised nations, is to be extended for a further year to the end of 1994. The extension, agreed by the MFA's 44 members yesterday, was made necessary by the repeated delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. If the round is successfully completed by the deadline of next Wednesday, the MFA will be phased out over a 10-year period from 1995. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, said the latest extension, the sixth since 1974, was 'the final lease of life for the MFA'. Members of the MFA, which legitimises a web of bilateral quota deals between rich and poor nations, accounted for Dollars 136bn or 80 per cent of world textile and clothing exports in 1990. Representatives of Europe's textile and clothing industry were also in Geneva yesterday to raise concerns over the terms under which the MFA will be dismantled. The proposed Uruguay Round deal was 'far from offering the necessary guarantees of fair and balanced competition', the Brussels-based European Textile and Clothing Coalition said in a statement, arguing that the EU was one of the most open markets in the world. The coalition said the US offer to lower very high tariffs on clothing was inadequate and criticised the refusal of some developing country exporters such as India and Thailand to open their domestic markets to imports. The European industry said it would continue to press for a Uruguay Round package incorporating lower tariff and non-tariff barriers worldwide, and tougher action against unfair trading practices in developing countries including counterfeiting, dumping and subsidies.</p>

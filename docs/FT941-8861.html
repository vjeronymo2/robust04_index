			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: AECI improves 28% to R347m Improving domestic sales volumes and a sharp decline in financing costs buoyed results at South Africa's AECI in 1993 in the face of slow growth in export sales and weak prices for its output. The Anglo American-owned chemicals producer reported a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R347m (Dollars 102m) in the year to December 31 against R270m in 1992. Turnover climbed to R5.97bn from R5.55bn, including exports worth R649m against R643m, to leave the operating margin unchanged at 8 per cent. Although operating profit improved to R467m compared with R432m, the figure is still below levels five years ago. Financing costs benefited from lower domestic and overseas interests rates and fell to R120m from R162m. The group's extensive capital programmes and higher working capital needs pushed net borrowings R116m higher to R858m by the year-end. A R75m expansion project at subsidiary SA Nylon Spinners was completed in the year, while spending accelerated on the the group's R270m joint venture with the Industrial Development Corporation to make lysine, an ingredient in poultry and pig feed. AECI is committed to new joint ventures with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) - which has swapped its 25 per cent holding in the group for a 51 per cent interest in AECI's explosives business - and Sasol in a R400m project to merge the groups' upstream and downstream petrochemical operations. However, earnings growth at AECI remains hobbled by its 25 per cent stake in loss-making Soda Ash Botswana, plagued by operating difficulties and a slump in local demand for soda ash and strong overseas competition. AECI suffered a R12m investment loss and is considering making a provision of about R140m for present and future investment in the project which will be set off against proceeds from the deal with ICI. Attributable earnings, lifted by a R31m one-off tax credit, climbed to R237m from R164m, equivalent to 153 cents a share against 106 cents. Total dividend is unchanged at 58 cents.</p>

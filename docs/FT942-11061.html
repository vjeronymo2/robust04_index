			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Spirit of conciliation sweeps aside letter of vote - The election was deeply flawed, but nearly everyone likes the outcome South Africa has delivered what one political analyst yesterday described as a 'designer outcome': a political settlement which binds in all the significant parties, and leaves only the tiniest fractions to the far left and right out in the cold of extra-parliamentary opposition. Even Inkatha, most reluctant participant in the process, now has a vested interest in success. The outcome, reached after 10 days of electoral bungling and administrative farce, might have been designed by a higher power to bring long-term stability in the new South Africa. The African National Congress is strong, but not overwhelmingly dominant: it did not gain the two thirds of the national vote which would have made it simpler to force through its ideas on a new constitution in the constituent assembly. And crucially, it did not gain control of two important provinces, KwaZulu Natal, with a fifth of the population, and the Western Cape. The National party did not fare as well as outgoing President FW de Klerk had hoped, but it did scrape past the 20 per cent psychological barrier needed to give the party a substantial power base from which to argue the interests of minorities within the government of national unity. Mr de Klerk will be one of two deputy presidents; and the party's support within the civil service, the security forces and the business community will give it added clout. Even more important, the Inkatha Freedom party won the province of KwaZulu Natal with a fraction over 50 per cent of the vote, giving the party a one-seat majority in the 81-member provincial assembly. Local ANC officials are screaming foul play, and they are almost certainly right: there were no doubt many petty frauds, and perhaps some grand ones committed in the province. But the ANC's national leadership has either decided to accept that its hands, too, were not clean; or more plausibly, the ANC simply accepted that it had to concede the province to Inkatha, or jeopardise the whole election. The ANC paid a high price for ensuring that the election outcome was accepted by Inkatha: it surrendered Natal, where 15,000 people have died in the past decade in fighting which the ANC blames on the IFP. But this was almost certainly the wisest course: for with Inkatha running well ahead in the polls (however crooked the results may have been), the party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi would never have accepted defeat. And it is likely to prove much less belligerent within government than without. ANC supporters on the ground are unlikely to concur: they will find it hard to swallow an electoral result which they fervently believe is based on fraud. But the ANC leadership, even on the local level, has made clear that it will preach acceptance of the outcome. ANC southern Natal regional secretary Jeff Radebe, yesterday named a minister in the new national government, fumes and complains but concludes that the ANC must accept the result. 'We have no alternative,' he says, but adds that provincial realities will force the two parties to work together even so. 'The IFP knows in its own heart of hearts that even if they win this election, there is just no way that they can rule this province without us. We are the power in the Durban area: there is just no way they can be a bull in the kraal.' IFP leaders agree: under the constitution, the two parties must share power in the 10-member regional executive, along with the outgoing National party. (The IFP is likely to have five executive seats, the NP one and the ANC three or four). Both sides agree that the two top leaders in the province, the ANC's Jacob Zuma and the IFP's Frank Mdladlose, get on extremely well. 'It's a love relationship - to the annoyance of both sides,' says a senior IFP leader. He holds out high hopes that the two men, both moderates, can help bring peace to Natal. So, four years after Mr Nelson Mandela was released from jail, South Africa has delivered a political settlement that could bring lasting stability. But not all was perfection: the liberal Democratic party was nearly wiped from the national slate, gaining only 1.73 per cent of the national vote, casting doubt over the future of liberalism in Africa and substantially reducing its role in writing the new constitution (though it has more support in provincial parliaments). The right-wing Freedom Front fell far short of its goal of 800,000 votes, the total demanded by the ANC in exchange for taking the Front's demands for an Afrikaner homeland seriously. The ANC could, on this basis, decide to refuse the Front's demands; but it knows it cannot do so without provoking further right wing violence. And the poor showing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, with only 1.25 per cent of the vote, will enrage its supporters. But the PAC's defeat reflects a welcome rejection of black-on-white racism. South Africans did vote racially: 85 per cent of blacks and almost no whites for the ANC, almost no blacks but the bulk of other races for the NP. But they did not vote for racism; and that must be good for South Africa. No one will ever know if the result is an accurate reflection of the will of the South African people; indeed, if it is so, it is probably by accident. 'Both sides crooked like hell and it requires the wisdom of Solomon to sort out who crooked more,' says one political insider. Perhaps, fortuitously, the manifold irregularities experienced in polling and counting truly cancelled each other out; perhaps more overt manipulation was applied to the result. For there is such a neat parallel between what was supposed to happen, and what did happen, that one can be forgiven for wondering whether it is not the result of a serious intervention. But South Africans do not seem to care. The political parties have decided that it does not matter 'who crooked more'; the consensus view is that the South African people have spoken, and none dare gainsay that accepted truth. For, after all, things could have been so much worse.  ------------------------------------------------- National Assembly: 22.72m voters    400 seats  -------------------------------------------------     From national lists:            200     From provincial lists:          200 The provincial lists also elect the 425 members for the nine provincial legislatures  -------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        HOW THEY VOTED: RESULTS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NATIONAL ASSEMBLY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- African National Congress (ANC)                   12,237,655      252 National Party (NP)                                3,983,690       82 Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)                        2,058,294       43 Freedom Front (FF)                                   424,555        9 Democratic Party (DP)                                338,426        7 Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)                        243,478        5 African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP)             88,104        2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------- Orange Free State  -----------------------------------------------------               Provincial               legislature                 votes               Seats  ----------------------------------------------------- ANC            1,037,998              24 NP               170,452               4 FF                81,662               2 PAC               24,451               -

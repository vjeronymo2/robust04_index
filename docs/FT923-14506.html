			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Paris acts to break road blocks: Riot police move in as shortages force companies to lay off workers THE FRENCH government moved strongly against defiant lorry drivers yesterday, calling in 13,000 riot police with armoured cars and helicopters to dismantle some of the road blocks thrown up over the past week. But the tussle between police and the recalcitrant truckers continued last night, with drivers in some cases erecting new road blocks just a few miles away from those dismantled. Many barriers were still in place. Drivers embarked on the national blockade in protest against tough new licence rules under which drivers can be banned from the road after clocking up six penalty points. Police mounted a determined effort to crack some of the strategic points in the truckers' blockade as signs emerged of economic strain caused by the protest. Until the weekend the damage to French business had been comparatively slight, but yesterday dozens of companies announced temporary lay-offs because of supply shortages. Peugeot, the car company, said it may lay off up to 18,000 workers today. Citroen warned of the suspension of 2,500 employees. The Patronat, the French employers' federation, said the situation was becoming 'very serious' in vulnerable sectors such as tourism, petrol, farming and food in the regions where the protests had been strongest, including the Mediterranean coast and Rhone Alpes. The Patronat warned that if the dispute continued, many companies could face cash flow problems. Neighbouring countries have also felt the effects of the dispute. The British arm of Peugeot resumed production yesterday after being left temporarily short of components, but the Confederation of British Industry said many more companies would be affected if the dispute continued. German industry has so far taken the inconvenience in its stride. But Volkswagen chartered a transport aircraft to carry parts to its Spanish car plant. It appeared last night the Socialist government was beginning to master the most serious threat to public order since Mr Pierre Beregovoy became prime minister three months ago. But it was unclear how long the improvement would last, given protesters' skill in forming new roadblocks. Police relied on a show of force, which appears to have persuaded many to drive away. Truckers have also been discouraged by a government campaign to confiscate the ringleaders' licences. One of the first roadblocks to go was on the northern A1 Paris-Lille motorway, the main artery to central France from the Channel ports, Belgium and the Netherlands. An armoured tractor towed away a truck at the head of the queue. The remaining protesters then drove off, sounding their horns. One driver said: 'That's it. We are off. They are not going to bust our working tools,' after a policeman smashed the window of his truck to reach the brake. By yesterday morning rail traffic had returned to normal between Marseilles and Lyons, after weekend travellers were held up by rail blocks imposed by farmers protesting that truckers had prevented deliveries.

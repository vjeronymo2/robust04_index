			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (12): Magnetic island in the sun - Bermuda is the world's fastest growing offshore centre BERMUDA, home of some of the world's fastest growing and innovative reinsurance companies, has benefited from a flood of new interest this year. More than half a dozen new reinsurance initiatives have been launched, bringing more than Dollars 1bn in fresh capital to the island and consolidating its reputation as the world's biggest offshore insurance and reinsurance centre. Until this year Bermuda was known as a centre for captive insurers and more recently for highly specialised reinsurers which offer high-level liability covers. Centre Re, the biggest of Bermuda's reinsurance companies with assets of Dollars 2.9bn, has pioneered so-called finite risk transactions, while ACE and XL insure large - mainly US - corporations against legal awards. In June, American International Group, one of the world's biggest insurers, reinforced this trend by sponsoring the formation of a new excess liability company, Starr Excess Liability Insurance. Other backers include General Re, Munich Re, Primamerica and Aon Corporation. However, most attention has focused recently on the catastrophe reinsurance market, with Bermuda hosting a number of significant new initiatives by North American insurers and financiers. Attracted by the recent strength in reinsurance rates and prospect of attractive profits, Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the US bank, sponsored the formation last autumn of Mid-Ocean, a new Dollars 350m reinsurance company. The company began underwriting in January and in the summer announced plans to go public in the US with an initial public offering expected to raise nearly Dollars 250m. In the last six months five similar ventures have been formed: American International Group announced it was setting up a property catastrophe reinsurer, International Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Co, which aims to provide excess of loss treaty reinsurance for personal and commercial risks. AIG has a 24.4 per cent stake in the Dollars 300m company which will also underwrite retrocessional business for other reinsurers and also some non-catastrophe business. Investors including General Re, the biggest US reinsurance company, and AIG have raised Dollars 500m to support Tempest Reinsurance, which is expected to begin underwriting in October. Goldman Sachs, the securities house, and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance broker, are organising another company, Global Capital Reinsurance, which is expected to have some Dollars 300m in capital. Investors include Underwriters Re Holdings Corporation. Investors including Warburg, Pincus Investors, General Electric Pension Trust, Investment Private Placement Partners and USF&amp;G, the US insurance company, are raising Dollars 140m to invest in Renaissance Reinsurance. It plans to underwrite property and short-tail casualty insurance, earning more than 60 per cent of an expected Dollars 100m a year in premiums from the US market. Centre Re itself has formed a Bermuda-based shell company, Centre Cat, which will also underwrite catastrophe reinsurance. Separately, General Re is opening a wholly-owned underwriting management company, to help meet growing demand for back office services on the island. Two obvious attractions are Bermuda's tax regime (companies pay no income or corporation tax and can build up tax-free reserves allowing them to build up much stronger financial strength to meet large scale claims) and its benign regulatory environment. Bermudian companies are able to avoid the very high so-called 'frictional' costs, which are typical of a market - such as London - in which dozens of relatively small insurers and brokers combine to insure and reinsure large risks. They tend to conduct a small number of high-value transactions, transferring huge blocks of risk on to their own books in exchange for multi-million dollar premiums. Already there are signs that the amount of fresh capital in Bermuda is having an impact on rates and terms and conditions on international markets. One prominent London underwriter estimates that capacity for leading US buyers has risen from around Dollars 120m per event to Dollars 150m per event in recent months. So far, however, there is little sign that Bermudian underwriters are winning market share at the expense of established marketplaces in the North America and Europe, either by offering cheaper policies or better security. Mid-Ocean, the most active Bermudian catastrophe reinsurer at present, generally underwrites portions of reinsurance programmes, in which prices and conditions are set by so-called 'lead' underwriters in Lloyd's. The new companies look set to follow suit. Mr James Stanard, chief executive of Renaissance, says: 'Much of our business will be participations on catastrophe programmes led by recognised lead underwriters.' Although there is concern among some US reinsurance buyers about the quality of security in the London market and particularly at Lloyd's, other buyers - especially from Europe and South Africa - are equally sceptical about the durability of Bermudian companies and are particularly mindful of the problems experienced by many Bermudian companies in the mid-1980s. Industry leaders such as Mr Michael Butt, the chief executive of Mid-Ocean, insist that the Bermudian market 'complements' rather than competes with London. Indeed in some other ways the Bermudian market has recently provided direct support for Lloyd's underwriters. Underwriters Capital (Merrett), another new Bermudian company, was formed with the specific purpose of providing quota share reinsurance to the syndicates of the Merrett Group, for example. Centre Re agreed at the end of last year to back a multi-million pound reinsurance scheme, which will allow Lloyd's Names to obtain stop-loss, or personal, reinsurance. And Centre Re also provides dozens of financial reinsurance policies - called 'time and distance' policies - which allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves more flexibly. However, as the Bermudian market develops and the confidence of buyers increases, local Bermudian underwriters may begin to seek to lead business. One prominent London underwriter predicts this could happen in the 1995 renewal season. 'Customers are already using Bermuda as a stick to beat us over the head,' he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------                  BERMUDA'S BIG INSURERS     Net insurance premiums written in 1992 (dollarsm)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Centre Re                       1,100.0 American International            850.0 Excel                             434.5 ACE                               325.4 OIL                               187.6 Mid Ocean Re                      130.0 Mutual Risk Management             82.2 Heddington Insurance               74.0  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Bermudan  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

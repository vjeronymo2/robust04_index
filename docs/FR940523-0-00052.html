Statutory Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Sections 1001&hyph;1004 of Public Law 102&hyph;486, 42 U.S.C. 2296a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (hereinafter ``the Act'')), enacted on October 24, 1992, requires the Department of Energy (hereinafter the ``Department'') to reimburse eligible uranium and thorium licensees for certain costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action at active uranium or thorium processing sites, which also include vicinity properties. Consistent with section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;1) the Department is promulgating this final rule to implement the requirements of Title X and to establish procedures for eligible applicants to submit claims for reimbursement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title X provides that, with certain exceptions, remedial action costs at active uranium or thorium processing sites shall be borne by persons licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2092, 2111) (hereinafter the ``Atomic Energy Act''). Section 1001(b)(1)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(1)(B)) requires the Department to reimburse eligible licensees of an active processing site a portion of the costs determined by the Department to be attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and either (a) Incurred by such licensee not later than December 31, 2002; or (b) placed in escrow not later than December 31, 2002, and incurred by the licensee in accordance with a plan for subsequent decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action approved by the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to be reimbursable, such costs must be for work which is necessary to comply with applicable requirements of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (hereinafter ``UMTRCA'') or, where appropriate, with requirements established by a state pursuant to a discontinuance agreement under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021), hereinafter ``Agreement State''. In addition, claims for reimbursement of costs of remedial action must be supported by reasonable documentation as determined by the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1001(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)) limits the amount of reimbursement paid to any one licensee of an active uranium mill tailings site to an amount not to exceed $5.50 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct material located at the site on October 24, 1992, and generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Total reimbursement, in the aggregate, for work performed at active uranium sites shall not exceed $270 million. Total reimbursement for work performed at the active thorium site shall not exceed $40 million, and is limited to costs incurred for offsite disposal. Under sections 1001(b)(2)(D) and 1003(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(D) and 2296a&hyph;2(a)), the $5.50 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement to individual uranium site licensees and aggregate ceilings shall be subject to annual adjustment for inflation based upon an inflation index chosen by the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview of Uranium Processing Activity Licensed Under the Atomic Energy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Army's Manhattan Engineer District, from 1942 to 1946, and later the Atomic Energy Commission (hereinafter ``AEC''), from 1947 through 1970, entered into several contracts for the purchase of uranium concentrate to support the Nation's defense programs. Initially, four mills provided uranium for the Army, primarily through reprocessing radium and vanadium mill tailings. Eventually a total of 34 commercially operated mills produced uranium concentrate for sale to the United States Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These contracts were for the purchase of an agreed-upon quantity of uranium concentrate. Contract specifications addressed physical characteristics, grade, and impurities but did not include provisions for mill decommissioning, long-term management of the milling-process wastes, known as tailings, or stabilization of tailings piles. When these contracts were executed, the potential hazards of tailings were not fully recognized. Over the ensuing decades, however, potential radiological and chemical hazards associated with uranium and thorium mill tailings were identified and standards and requirements were developed for the control and management of tailings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between 1975 and 1979, the Department and the Energy Research and Development Administration, successor agencies to the AEC, completed studies of uranium mill sites that had produced uranium concentrate for the AEC, had subsequently ceased operations, and were considered inactive. These studies determined that uranium mill tailings located at these inactive uranium milling sites posed potentially significant health hazards to the public and that a program should be developed to ensure proper stabilization or disposal of these tailings to prevent or minimize radon diffusion into the environment and other related hazards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> INFORMATION SOUGHT ON FATAL HIT-AND-RUN  </P> <P> Anaheim resident Sharon Rowe, 42, remained hospitalized in serious condition  Sunday while police continued to search for a hit-and-run driver who killed her  husband shortly before she was struck by a second car.  </P> <P> The Lakewood man whose car hit Rowe was not cited.  </P> <P> Anaheim police Sunday were seeking information about the driver who ran down  her husband, Thomas Clifford Rowe, 38.  </P> <P> "I think they're kind of scraping" for clues right now, said Lt. Jack Jansen of  the Anaheim police. He said he did not believe that police had any new  information on the accident.  </P> <P> Earlier, police had reported that the driver who hit Thomas Rowe was a man 35  to 40 years old with a mustache and glasses driving "a small gray vehicle."  </P> <P> Jansen asked anyone with information about the accident, which occurred at 8:45  p.m. Friday in the 100 block of South Magnolia Avenue, to call police.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sharon Rowe, who sustained multiple injuries, was expected to be  transferred out of intensive care onto a regular ward at UCI Medical Center in  Orange late Sunday, nursing supervisor Lillian Sondquist said.  </P></p>

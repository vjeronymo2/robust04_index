			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Aerospatiale Awarded Two Billion Francs </F> [Fr] in State Aid"]    [Text] French defense and economic ministers announced on  Wednesday, 2 February that state-owned Aerospatiale company will  receive capital funding of Fr2 billion. Although initial  discussions had centered around the figure of Fr3 billion, the  aeronautics firm (60 percent owned by the state, 20 percent by  Credit lyonnais, and 20 percent by a public holding company,  SOGEPA) said it was satisfied with the decision. "The state  shareholder's decision will enable Aerospatiale to take full  advantage of the market's gradual recovery, notably through such  new programs as the Airbus A-330 and A-340," the ministers  commented in a communique.    The aeronautics industry has been hard hit by the slump in  sales, and the Fr2 billion in government funds will bring a  much-needed injection of oxygen. In 1993, Aerospatiale faced  "abominable" civil markets, "stable" military ones, and "fairly  good" demand for space products and services, said its CEO Louis  Gallois when he presented the group's results on 5 January. This  forced the manufacturer to cut back employee hours and eliminate  1,145 jobs, including 500 in its Eurocopter subsidiary, in 1993.  Aerospatiale's deficit reached Fr2.38 billion, and the company  expects to break even again in 1995 at the latest.    The Fr2 billion in fresh capital should enable the company  to  pursue the reduction of its debt, which it trimmed from Fr16 to  13 billion over the last two years, and to increase its equity,  which now totals Fr6 billion. The cash should also help  Aerospatiale expand its programs, several of which--both civil  and military--the manufacturer is now studying with its European  partners. Examples include the Ariane 5 rocket, the Tiger NH-90  and C-120 helicopters, the ATR-82, the Airbus A-319, the  proposed FLA military transport plane, and Airbus A-330-340  spinoffs. Aerospatiale announced in January that it was  considering allowing capital investments by outside partners,  either this year or in 1995, provided that the state remained  majority shareholder.</p>

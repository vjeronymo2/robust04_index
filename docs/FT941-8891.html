			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: County Smaller Cos seeks Pounds 35m and plans name change County Smaller Companies Investment Trust is to raise more than Pounds 35m through a placing and open offer of conversion shares and change its name to NatWest Smaller Companies Investment Trust. Qualifying share and warrant holders will be entitled to buy three C shares at 125p for every two ordinary shares or warrants already held. On conversion, one warrant will be issued for every five new ordinary shares. The placing and offer has been underwritten by UBS. Dealings in the C shares are expected to start on March 18, and conversion will take place by July 28. The trust is managed by NatWest Investment Management, formerly known as County NatWest Investment Management. The proposed name change is intended to reflect this. Results for the period from July 1 to December 31 showed the trust's net asset value per share ahead to 116.65p, an increase of 15.8 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 1.06p to 1.45p. The board has declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.125p, as the portfolio is being weighted towards stocks with higher growth prospects but lower yields.</p>

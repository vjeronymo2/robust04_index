			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Shell's smart way to score points Shell UK has launched a smart card scheme to promote petrol sales, which it describes as the world's largest electronic points collection scheme. More than 3m petrol buyers are expected to use the smart cards to collect points for gifts, flights, entertainment or charities. The points, which are stored on a microchip inside the card, can be processed by more than 1,800 electronic terminals in UK service stations. Shell believes it is the largest retail use of smart card technology in the country. The cost of handling electronic transactions is expected to be far less than processing the paper vouchers and stamps used previously. Shell UK: UK, tel 071 257 4444; fax 071 257 5549</p>

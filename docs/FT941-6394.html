			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / N-waste delays pose 'safety threat' Workers handling radioactive waste at sites owned by the Atomic Energy Authority could suffer additional doses of radiation because of delays in constructing a permanent repository for nuclear waste in the UK, a nuclear safety study group said yesterday. The group, set up by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear safety committee, said the sites were running out of storage space. The group's report, however, concludes that the AEA, the body charged with leading the development of the nuclear power industry, is aware of these problems and is dealing with them. The authority said it accepted the findings and was addressing the problems. The report says that at Sellafield in Cumbria there are still problems after a fire in 1952. Yesterday's findings do not directly affect plans to privatise the authority. The division responsible for managing and decommissioning redundant plant will remain in government hands.</p>

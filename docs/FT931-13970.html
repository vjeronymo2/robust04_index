			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / BA board considers strategy over 'dirty tricks' affair THE British Airways board will meet this morning to consider urgent steps to restore the company's battered image and to discuss the conclusions of an internal inquiry into its 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic. Some BA directors met last night to prepare for the special full board meeting which is seen as critical in BA's effort to prevent the affair escalating. It also emerged yesterday that the European Commission is understood to be interested in examining whether BA may have abused its dominant market position. The Commission confirmed yesterday that it had received a complaint from Virgin about alleged abuse of BA's dominant position in the allocation of take-off and landing 'slots' at London's Heathrow airport. Despite mounting criticism of BA's discredited campaign and its subsequent handling of the affair, the airline does not appear poised to make sweeping changes in its top management. Big investors and employees are demanding action by the company. But calls for the resignation of either Lord King, the airline's chairman, or Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, have been dismissed by board members. Sir Michael Angus, a non-executive deputy chairman of BA and president of the Confederation of British Industry, said last night: 'Nobody is seeking the resignation of either Lord King or of Sir Colin.' Although Sir Michael has been tipped as a possible interim chairman when Lord King steps aside in the summer, he said he had not been asked to take on the role. He added: 'Everything is feasible in an emergency, but I don't think it will occur.' The question of splitting the responsibilities of chairman and chief executive - both of which have been expected to go to Sir Colin - is not believed to be regarded as an urgent issue. The board will, however, be giving immediate attention to an 80-page report into the airline's efforts to undermine Virgin by Linklaters &amp; Paines, BA's solicitors. The document is understood to lend weight to the airline's repeated claims that the covert campaign was confined to a limited number of employees and did not reach into the highest levels of the company. The report, however, damns aspects of the airline's anti-Virgin operations and some directors already appear to accept that those responsible should be dismissed. Legal, public relations and marketing personnel are thought to be most at risk. It is also likely, as part of its damage-limitation exercise, that the board will consider establishing a compliance committee to enforce a code of conduct within the company to ensure BA does not become embroiled in such a highly damaging affair again. BA's board hopes to end the highly embarrassing episode by the end of this week. While BA pursues internal action, it is maintaining a high-level dialogue with Mr Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, in an attempt to prevent further legal action against it. BA has sent a second, confidential note to Mr Branson asking him to spell out the circumstances in which he would bury the hatchet. Virgin's head has threatened to sue BA in the US on anti-trust grounds, a move which could undermine its efforts to take a stake in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier.

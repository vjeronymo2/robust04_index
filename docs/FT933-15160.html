			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Clinton claims summit success - The US president got most of what he wanted IF OFFICIAL hyperbole is taken at face value, each head of government personally made the Tokyo summit a resounding success. Mr Miyazawa, a charming host, broke the logjam in the market access talks by throwing whisky on to the table. Messrs Mitterrand, Kohl and even Major toughened the words condemning Serbia and Croatia. Mr Ciampi had a lot to say about the Balkans and the Middle East, and Ms Campbell engaged the US on beer. All, except possibly Messrs Kohl and Mitterrand, who like a little ceremony, agreed future summits should go back to their simpler roots. But it was President Bill Clinton who came to Tokyo with most to lose and who is leaving it with most gained. The extent to which summits play in Peoria or the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue may be debated but it is hard to deny the case, advanced by every administration official round the clock, that he got most of what he wanted. Mr David Gergen, the new presidential counsellor and designer of a skilful and disciplined US public relations exercise here, yesterday cited the following achievements. The market access agreement, a priority identified by Mr Clinton several weeks ago, at least makes possible successful completion of the Uruguay Round. Failure here would have made the Tokyo summit a laughing stock. On the economy, for the first time since 1980, a summit communique did not implicitly criticise the US for not tackling its deficit. This legitimises Mr Clinton's claim that growth  - and jobs  - matter most, with more Japanese fiscal stimulus and lower European interest rates tools to be used along with US deficit reduction. The lack of jobs is now on the international agenda, with Mr Clinton's structural unemployment autumn conclave the next forum for debate. The great focus of Mr Clinton's foreign policy, sustaining Russian reform, has been endorsed with the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) privatisation programme, achieved in spite of European and Japanese reservations and lack of resources. The president's preference for summits with less formality and more talk has taken hold. As far as can be ascertained here (heads of government are terribly discreet about other members of the club) Mr Clinton's intelligence and charm were well received and he 'inter-acted' to good effect. Early today, US officials added to this list by announcing that Washington and Tokyo had struck a deal in principle on a new economic framework aimed at putting trade between the two countries into better balance. But because such an accord was by no means certain, officials had been more than usually careful to keep expectations low. Mr Clinton goes on from here to Korea and a short break in Hawaii before flying back to Washington, where the temperature has been cracking 100 degrees. The political heat back home, with critical budget divisions looming, will be even higher, probably making Tokyo's mildness and harmony soon a distant memory.</p>

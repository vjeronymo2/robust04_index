			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Call for deregulation  -Japan's closed-door policy Japan's tightly regulated pension fund industry is liable to be seen by US trade negotiators as another example of the bureaucrats' reluctance to relinquish accumulated power, and to open Japan's doors to foreigners. However, as the Japanese population ages and concerns over maintaining an elderly society mount, many officials are calling for deregulation of the corporate and state pension investment schemes. US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management of corporate pension and mutual aid associations in 1990, allowing foreign investment managers into the market. The welfare ministry also wants better returns on the state pension investments, at present restricted to life assurers and trust banks. It has called for a broadening of investment channels ahead of the expected rise in pension liabilities as Japan's population ages. However, unlike the social security planners at the welfare ministry, who hope that increased investment returns will reduce the strain caused by the increase in future pension payments, the finance ministry bureaucrats adopt a prudent line. They claim that the government has to guarantee social security benefits, and cannot allow further investments in stocks, which most investment advisory companies excel in. For many European and US fund management companies, which have failed to gain access to such funds due to the tight relationships between Japanese corporations and fund managers, winning public fund management contracts is the only way they can justify maintaining operations in Japan. Investment of state pension fund reserves totalling an outstanding Y100,000bn (Dollars 136bn) is controlled by the finance ministry, of which a bulk is funnelled into low interest loans for public works. The finance ministry allows Y20,000bn of the balance to be invested by the Welfare Service Public Corporation, (Nenpuku) run by the health ministry, but rigid finance ministry laws still govern how the organisation invests in the financial markets. The health and welfare ministry, which is revamping the state pension system and the eligibility age for pensions, also wants to alter legislation limiting the state pension fund investment during the present parliamentary session. Another concern is the large amount allocated to one manager by Nenpuku. The organisation is only allowed to allocate funds to 14 life assurers and 15 trust banks, with one institution managing as much as Y2,000bn. Deregulation of the public pension fund market is on the agenda of the bilateral trade talks between Japan and the US and the deadline has been set for July. 'By allowing the 150 foreign and Japanese investment advisory companies in, we want to increase our options and maximise the efficiency of the investments,' says Mr Keiichi Fukuyama, a director in charge of pension fund management at the welfare ministry. Nenpuku also wants more competition from skilled European and US fund managers to maximise the returns on investments. Meanwhile, the corporate pension fund business is also growing fast as more corporations are setting up funds ahead of the next century. Outstanding assets of total corporate pension funds, which only totalled Y462.8bn in 1971, has grown to Y47,212.5bn at the end of March last year. However, although pension fund asset management was opened up to investment advisory companies in 1990, most of the funds are still managed by trust banks, which at the end of last March were managing 56.9 per cent of the total outstanding, and life assurance companies, which held 42.8 per cent. The investment advisory companies are only allowed to bid for a third of corporate pension funds' new assets, or 'new money'. Even then they have not been able to win management business from Japanese companies, many of which value old ties and relationships rather than the returns on the investments. Other restrictions which prevent newcomers into the business and at the same time deprive beneficiaries of returns, include limits on fund allocation. Fund managers are forced to invest more than 50 per cent of the clients' money into safe investments such as bonds and deposits, while a 30 per cent limit is placed on stocks and foreign investments, and a 20 per cent limit is set on real estate investments. Unlike the US where pension funds invest in venture businesses, derivatives and securitised instruments to maximise returns, the number of asset types to which Japanese fund managers can allocate funds are limited to the conventional stocks, bonds, cash deposits and real estate. Pension fund assets value their assets at historic cost, or the price at which the investments were made, rather than the actual market price. This helps fund managers to conceal unrealised losses made on stock investments made during the late 1980s. It also inflates the amount of stocks held on the portfolio (since most of the stock investments were made during the stock market 'bubble' of the 1980s) and limits the amount of new cash allocated to equity investments. The ministry of finance claims that it is maintaining regulations on pension fund investments to ensure prudent investments and to secure the funds until full pension payments commence due to the demographic changes at the end of the century. However, as the day of reckoning draws near, the ministry will need to face the reality - that regulations are only helping fund managers to cover up losses and the state may have to subsidise the low returns due to inefficient investments. The most painless way to correct this situation will be to free the market to more professional fund managers who will maximise returns through more innovative investments.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS FUNDS TAKEN FROM RESEARCH, GIVEN TO CLINICS  </P> <P> Creating a debate that pits scientists against AIDS activists, the Legislature  has diverted funds from the University of California's AIDS research budget to  help pay for early treatment of those infected with the deadly virus.  </P> <P> UC scientists argue that the $1.8-million cutback could significantly harm AIDS  research in California.  </P> <P> "If this trend continues, it's going to be devastating for the program," said  Dr. Nirmal K. Das, director of the university-wide AIDS Research Program.  "We're going to lose credibility among (medical) investigators. We're not going  to be able to expand our research or attract a new generation of researchers."  </P> <P> The UC program, the state's main AIDS research vehicle, had a budget last  fiscal year of $10.5 million, and the same amount was proposed for this year  before the diversion. Scientists said that since the program's inception in  1983, it has made such important advances as isolation of the  human-immunodeficiency virus in 1984, discovery of how HIV replicates itself  within cells and testing of the anti-HIV drug AZT.  </P> <P> Many AIDS activists, while not disputing the important medical advances made by  UC researchers, argue that other programs should take precedence in this tight  budget year. They say the most urgent need is for early treatment and  counseling of those diagnosed as HIV-positive, for their own sake and to  prevent the spread of the virus.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian has budgeted only $3.5 million for early-intervention  programs, compared to $40 million proposed by the AIDS Budget Task Force, a  group of doctors and activists convened annually to advise the Legislature on  AIDS funding.  </P> <P> Acting on the group's recommendation, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee, proposed in late June that the Senate-Assembly  conference committee on the budget strip $3.6 million from the UC research  budget. The Santa Clara Democrat scaled back his request to $1.8 million after  other committee members argued for a smaller cut.  </P> <P> The diversion of AIDS funds is part of the spending program contained in the  conference committee report and approved Tuesday by the Senate. The measure  still must be approved by the Senate and Assembly and signed by Gov.  Deukmejian.  </P></p>

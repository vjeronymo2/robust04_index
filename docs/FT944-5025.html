			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Head start for VCITs - In a Nutshell The prize for being first to the draw on the new Venture Capital Investment Trusts, details of which were published last week in the UK Budget, must go to Rothschild Asset Management. Hardly had the Chancellor of the Exchequer sat down after announcing significant tax breaks for investors prepared to back unquoted companies than Rothschild was committing to launch a trust. This trust will invest in the food sector. It will focus on companies with potential for rapid growth that are involved in product or market innovation or technology development, investing up to Pounds 1m in any one business as the new rules allow. Such has been the early enthusiasm among venture capitalists that other trusts will not be far behind. The question whether investing in these risky investment trusts is wise will be addressed elsewhere in this paper. After the finance bill, this page will review the kinds of growing businesses the trusts might back.</p>

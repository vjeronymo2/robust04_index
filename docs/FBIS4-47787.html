			<p>BFN     [Text] The suspended amir of Agai in Niger State, Alhaji  Abubakar Tahiru, will soon appear in court in connection with  the recent assassination of the former chairman of the Agai  local government, Alhaji Ibrahim Sado.    The state commissioner of police, Alhaji Hakim Abdulahi,  disclosed this while addressing newsmen in Minna. He said  (?with the) suspension of the amir, more people have provided  the police with useful information on the murder case. Alhaji  Hakim Abdulahi said although before the suspension of the amir  the police command had received substantial information that  implicated him to the murder. [sentence as heard]    In a related development, six students of the Federal  Polytechnic, Bida, have been arrested by the state police  command while attempting to kill their lecturer, Mr. Festus  Akindo Lani, over what they described as the lecturer's  wickedness. According to the police commissioner, the students  have confessed that they wanted to kill the lecturer to create  fears in the mind of other wicked lecturers in the institution  to force them to always dance to their tune. Alhaji Hakim  Abdulahi said a sharp knife was recovered from one of the  students in the house of the lecturer by detectives who had  earlier been drafted to his residence following a tip-off.</p>

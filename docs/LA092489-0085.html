			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE:: SONGS OF RODGERS &amp; HAMMERSTEIN; SAMUEL RAMEY, BASS; NATIONAL  PHILHARMONIC, PETER MATZ CONDUCTING. EMI 7 49581 2 (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> Ramey admirably lightens his sound for such numbers as "June is bustin' out  allover!" and "The surrey with the fringe on top." "A fellow needs a girl" and  "Some enchanted evening" are genuinely touching. But in such muscular, treacly  numbers as "Climb ev'ry mountain" and "You'll never walk alone" he sounds for  all the world like one of Verdi's fathers or priests singing in an English  translation. Still, for show-tune aficionados the disc is worth having. Walter  Price  </P></p>

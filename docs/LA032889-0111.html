			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN TODAY FOR HUNTER TRIAL  </P> <P> Jury selection is set to begin today in the trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, who  is charged with fraud, conspiracy and income tax evasion stemming from the  collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, but much of the questioning  of potential jurors will be done in private.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam said Monday that reporters will be barred  from sessions where potential jurors are questioned individually about their  views on a number of subjects, but did not specify what those subjects are. The  potential jurors also will be asked to fill out a lengthy questionnaire  intended to cut down on the amount of information they are asked to provide in  questioning in open court.  </P> <P> Lawyers involved in the case said later that the private sessions, in which  potential jurors will be questioned outside the presence of other potential  jurors, will deal with questions about pre-trial publicity and other matters.  </P> <P> Gilliam said 119 potential jurors will be on hand today and a total of 300 will  be available.  </P> <P> Hunter was charged in November, 1986, in a 234-count indictment and faces  another trial on an indictment returned in March, 1988, in which she is accused  of 56 counts of conspiracy and using the mails to sell unregistered securities.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> National Organization for Women President Molly Yard and former NOW President  Eleanor Smeal announced a campaign to bring the drug RU 486 -- sometimes called  the "abortion pill" -- to the United States. "RU 486 can help save so many  lives that we are determined to build a network both nationally and  internationally to ensure that its research and development proceeds as fast as  possible," Yard told a news conference in Washington. "Today in the world, one  woman dies every three minutes from a botched illegal abortion," said Smeal,  now president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority. RU 486, also known as  mifepristone, was developed in France in 1982 and tested for many uses,  including inducing abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.  </P></p>

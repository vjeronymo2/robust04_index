			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Climate improving for foreign investors in Russian oil The investment climate in Russia for western oil companies is slowly improving, according to the head of Magma Oil, one of the first Russian oil companies to be privatised, writes Robert Corzine. Mr Sergey Shafranik, director general of Magma Oil and brother of Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian energy minister, said he expected production to expand with the lifting of export quotas and the lowering next month of export levies. Magma last year brought into production the Yuzhnoye field in the Tyumen region of western Siberia. It was the only new field to be brought on stream in Russia last year. The company is controlled by Australian-listed Vanguard Oil through a 50.3 per cent holding by its Eurosov subsidiary. The remainder is held by the main Russian oil production, refining and transportation companies.</p>

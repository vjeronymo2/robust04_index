			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Opening-up is the key  to the common development of all countries and regions in the  world, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today,  expressing his concerns over rising protectionism.    He said, "opening-up is not only the key to China's  development, but also the key to the development of all  countries and regions of the world."    He expressed "frankly" his concerns over the fact that trade  protectionism in some countries and regional grouping "is still  gaining ground," though the Uruguay round of GATT (General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks produced the final act and  the world trade organization is to be established soon.    "In my opinion, such a tendency is not only affecting the  healthy development of the world trade and economy, but is also  detrimental to their own long term development," Li said, while  addressing the international conference of "waves of the future  - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business".    The meeting was attended by more than 800 delegates, mostly  senior government leaders and officials, businessmen, and policy  researchers, from 21 countries and regions of the world.    China adopts positive attitude towards economic cooperation  in Asia-Pacific, Li said.    But he was quick to add that such cooperation should be  based  on full respect for state sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit  and openness, and comply with the rules of the world  multilateral trading system.    Any "cooperation" which is exclusionary and leads to growth  of instabilizing elements in the world is totally different from  what China stands for, he stressed.    Citing experiences in the history of the two world wars, Li  said that exclusionary self-development would lead to division  of sphere of influence, growing imbalance of development and  fight for places of origin of raw materials and markets for  goods as well as outlets for capital and technology.    In this context, he reiterated China's position that it  never  seeks sphere of influence, has no intention of filling the  "vacuum" left over after the end of the Cold War and strongly  opposes division of sphere of influence.    "To boost the openness of the whole world and every part of  it is exactly what we should advocate," he said.</p>

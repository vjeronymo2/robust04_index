			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Moslem militants polarise Arab world: Fears over the spread of fundamentalism JUDGING by the wary reaction throughout the Arab world to events in Algeria, Arab leaders do not for one minute believe that attempts to deny Algeria's Islamic party a ballot box victory will be the end of the story. Rather, concern over the spread of fundamentalism is almost palpable in Arab capitals, at a time when the Islamic tendency has been on the rise regionally. The Algerian drama also coincides with deepening disillusionment with autocratic regimes across the region, fuelled partly by economic distress. Militant Islam, while most conspicuous, is by no means alone in its opposition to the established order. Concern will be greatest among Algeria's Maghreb neighbours - Tunisia and Morocco. Tunisian leaders, who crushed the local Nadha (Renaissance) fundamentalist party after concluding several years ago that dialogue would serve no useful purpose, had been most openly fearful that free elections in Algeria would bring the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to power. Tunisian newspapers, predictably, have voiced relief over the steps to deny Algeria's fundamentalists control of parliament. The independent daily, Assabah, yesterday compared developments 'to a last-minute change of direction by a train heading towards the abyss'. King Hassan of Morocco, who has kept silent in the face of disturbing events across the border, is certain to be relieved that the fundamentalists have been stopped, if only momentarily, although he cannot be particularly sanguine about the future. Morocco banned an incipient fundamentalist movement in January 1990, but Islamic militancy will almost certainly continue in an autocratically governed country burdened by economic deprivation. In Egypt, where there is persistent tension between the authorities and Islamic militants, the interior minister warned just hours after President Chadli Bendjedid's resignation that the security forces would not tolerate any attempt to sow instability. 'Our commitment to democracy does not limit our movement to confront immediately any attempt to break the law or destabilise security, whether by religious extremists or others,' Mr Abdel-halim Moussa told a parliamentary committee. Egypt's banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood had cheered the FIS's first ballot triumph as an inspiration for the religious across the region. Mr Mohammed Hamed Abul-Nasr, the Brotherhood's spiritual guide, wrote to the FIS: 'I pray God to grant you a complete and sweeping victory in the final stage and that all Moslems will stand united so that there is no weakness for Satan to exploit.' Saudi Arabia has remained silent on developments in Algeria, but its rulers  -under pressure from extremists  - are likely to be quietly relieved that the FIS has been denied control for the time being. The Saudis have been grappling with a resurgence of Moslem militancy among their subjects, a challenge which has provoked unusually forthright criticism from a member of the royal family and from the country's spiritual leader. In statements widely quoted in December in the Saudi press, Sheikh Abdel Aziz Ben Baz, the country's spiritual leader, condemned as a 'conspiracy' against Islam a campaign by militants to undermine the authority of the ruling family. Extremists have attacked Saudi rulers for alleged personal excesses, for their attempts to modernise the state by allowing a greater role for women, and for their support of the US-sponsored Middle East peace process. Prince Turki al-Faisal, son of the late king and head of the Saudi intelligence services, expressed the ruling family's concerns in a speech at a Riyadh mosque last month attacking the underground campaign being waged by Saudi militants. Egyptian and Saudi leaders have also been looking askance at developments in Sudan, where General Omar al Bashir's ruling junta is widely regarded to be in the thrall of the powerful National Islamic Front (NIF), headed by the charismatic Dr Hassan al-Turabi. The recent visit to Khartoum of Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and reports that Tehran was supplying Sudan with military training and equipment was enough to generate heated criticism in Cairo's official press. Mr Ibrahim Nafeh, editor-in-chief of the Cairo daily newspaper, Al Ahram, and a confidante of President Hosni Mubarak, attacked Sudan's alliance with Iran. 'God help the brotherly Sudanese people,' he wrote. 'For years, the situation in Sudan has been deteriorating with governments changing hands consecutively until Gen Al Bashir rose to power in a military coup d'etat and overshadowed all previous leaders in his blunt efforts to push Sudan down the drain.' There is little doubt that in both Algeria and in the wider Arab world, the battle between the secularists and Islamic militants has been joined.</p>

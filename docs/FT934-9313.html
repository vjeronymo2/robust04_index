			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / BT users 'would prefer AT&amp;T' CORPORATE customers of British Telecommunications believe that American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications giant, would provide a better all-round service than BT if allowed to compete in the UK, says an industry survey to be published today. The Telecommunications Users Association, which represents more than 1,100 users across the public and private sectors, said the 1,000 respondents believed AT&amp;T had the 'strongest set of credentials' to compete in the UK, and was rated above BT on three out of five performance indicators. The survey is a significant boost to AT&amp;T in its attempt to gain a licence to compete with BT in the UK. Its application is being considered by the government. Although user perceptions of AT&amp;T depend to some extent on reputation alone, the association stresses that a large proportion of respondents has already dealt with the US operator, either through AT&amp;T's US offices or other services already available in the UK. Ms Vivienne Peters, the association's chief executive, said: 'BT is going to have a tremendous fight on its hands if AT&amp;T is given a licence and takes the UK seriously. It will be good for UK companies.' AT&amp;T was rated ahead of BT on customer-service skills, value for money and understanding of the business needs of customers. BT scored more on reliability and financial stability. Two-thirds of the respondents believe that BT and Mercury have become more customer-focused in the last two years, with strong support in particular for new billing arrangements. But 41 per cent of BT users and 27 per cent of Mercury users reported 'recurring faults' over the past year. Nearly a third of Mercury users reported a 'major loss of service' over the past year, compared with 22 per cent of BT users. The frequency of changes in account managers was felt to be a shortcoming with BT. Most respondents said account managers were influential in their perception of the network operator: 'Frequent changes in account managers mean that customers very rarely reached a point where the BT manager fully understood the business organisation.' Although competition was welcomed, most felt discount schemes were too complex. Advanced services were generally considered too expensive, while the cost of calls within Europe caused strong dissatisfaction. New operators such as Colt and Worldcom attracted positive responses, particularly from users in the City. Outside the City, however, users were reluctant to use more than two network operators because of the complexity involved.  ----------------------------------------------- HOW BUSINESSES RATE TELECOMS COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------                               Score (max 5)  ----------------------------------------------- 1 AT&amp;T**                       3.97 2 BT                           3.73 3 Mercury                      3.67 4 Worldcom                     3.34 5 Energis*                     3.18 6 Cable                        3.11  ----------------------------------------------- * service starts April 1994 ** no UK public operator licence  ----------------------------------------------- Source: TUA  -----------------------------------------------</p>

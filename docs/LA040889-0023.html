			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VICKERS FACES A GRUELING TASK IN NORTHRIDGE INVITATIONAL  </P> <P> As a high school senior in 1987, Janeene Vickers single-handedly led Pomona to  the girls' team title in the state track and field championships at Hughes  Stadium in Sacramento, winning the 100 meters, the 100-meter low hurdles and  the 300-meter low hurdles.  </P> <P> Her three victories totaled 30 points, two better than runner-up Long Beach  Poly.  </P> <P> However, the UCLA sophomore's propensity for excelling in numerous events might  push her endurance to the limit in the Northridge Invitational at Cal State  Northridge today.  </P> <P> Vickers has entered six events -- the 100, 200, 400, 400-meter low hurdles,  400- and 1,600-meter relays -- in the two-day meet, which begins this morning  at 10.  </P> <P> "I'm wouldn't be surprised if she runs all those events," Northridge Coach Don  Strametz said. "She's been doing that in recent weeks. A lot will probably  depend on the weather."  </P> <P> While Vickers may be the most noteworthy entrant, there will be plenty of local  talent on display, including Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge and former  CSUN standout Vaughan Kastor.  </P> <P> Arreola, the defending NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000, will  run in the 800 and 1,500 during the women's meet today while Kastor has entered  the same events in the men's meet Sunday. Kastor, who set the Northridge school  record of 1 minute, 49.21 seconds in the 800 meters last year, will compete for  Running Experience Track Club.  </P></p>

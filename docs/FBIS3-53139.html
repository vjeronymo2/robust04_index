			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik -- live] </F>   [Excerpts] In a media briefing held in Taba a half an hour  ago, Israeli elements said that no agreement has been achieved  so far, and the sides are not even close to an agreement on any  of the issues on the agenda. [passage omitted covered in  referent item]    A mini-storm broke out after REUTER announced that an  agreement had been achieved on the size of the Jericho area,  with angry people rushing about making dozens of telephone  calls. The bottom line is that no such agreement has been  attained.    A short while ago, Israeli delegation sources said: The  Cairo understandings are neither an agreement nor a signed  document. Although the understandings are not legally binding,  they are a fact. In addition, today's discussions revealed gaps  in the interpretations of the understandings.    The chief Palestinian delegate today accused Israel of being  unwilling to complete the draft within three weeks.    [Begin Nabil Sha'th recording, in English] Obviously, many  statements have come out showing that the Israeli party is not  ready to finish in three weeks. I repeat: If goodwill is  there, and if the decision to reach an agreement is there, three  weeks is enough, but if it's not there.... [end recording]    [In a live telephone interview earlier in the newsreel,  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked by reporter 'Arad Nir  about "chief Palestinian delegate Nabil Sha'th's implication  that Israel is guilty of trying to stall the talks." Peres  replied: "If our repudiating their rejection of the Cairo  agreement means stalling, then we are stalling. I am still  convinced that we did reach understandings in Cairo, and they  bind both delegations."]    The sides also disagree on the border crossings issue, in  addition to the size of Jericho. These two issues are now being  discussed on the upper floor. [passage omitted]</p>

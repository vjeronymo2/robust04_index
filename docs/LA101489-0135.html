			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ATHLETES' LOVE AFFAIR BECAME A FATAL ATTRACTION  </P> <P> Apart from the warm embrace of his family, Thomas White was alone in the world.  A standout high school athlete in Europe, where his father was stationed in the  Army, he was a nobody when the family moved to Orange County in 1986, a young  man mostly without friends.  </P> <P> Then he met Krisden Yoshiko Tanabe, a statuesque high school basketball star  from Huntington Beach. The attention White once focused on his jumpshot and  major-league fastball was turned toward his new girlfriend.  </P> <P> That love, family members said Friday, eventually became an obsession. When  Tanabe broke off the relationship a few months ago, the bespectacled  21-year-old grew so troubled that he committed himself in September to a Long  Beach psychiatric hospital. He was released earlier this week, and family  members said he seemed renewed, ready to move on without Krisden.  </P> <P> But on Thursday, just days after his release, White confronted Tanabe in front  of a friend's Westminster house. He was carrying a shotgun that family members  say he had just purchased with money borrowed from a friend. Tanabe, 18, was  shot and killed as she tried to flee, then White turned the gun on himself and  took his own life, police said.  </P> <P> Now, friends and family of the young couple are trying to sort out the pieces,  to put the terrible tragedy into perspective.  </P> <P> "He was the last person on Earth I would expect to do this," said Dr. Mark  Kopit, a veterinarian at Stanton Pet Hospital, where White worked until earlier  this year. "It must have happened in the heat of the moment. I guess he was  just very much in love and very hurt. It's a sad thing, very tragic."  </P> <P> Tanabe's teammates at Golden West College, where she was about to begin her  first season of college basketball, talked long and deeply Friday about the  friend many of them were just beginning to know, agreeing to dedicate their  season to her.  </P> <P> The girl's mother, Anita Tanabe, knew White like a member of the family. He  was, she recalls, a good person. There was never any trouble, Krisden was  always home on time. But he became "obsessed" with her daughter and fell apart  emotionally when she tried to break off their romance, the mother said.  </P> <P> "In my heart I forgive him," she said. "I know at the time that Thomas shot my  daughter that wasn't Thomas. That was someone who was very sick and  distraught."  </P> <P> White's family, meanwhile, is grappling with grief and dismay. For them, it all  seems improbable, impossible. How could Thomas, so quiet and friendly, commit  so violent an act?  </P> <P> "She was like his Madonna. She was everything to him," said Greg White, a  younger brother. "He was addicted to loving her. It was kind of a fatal  attraction. . . . We all know someone who would do anything for love. And this  is an example."  </P> <P> The eldest child of Cherry and Wallace White, Thomas was described as a great  athlete, a good son and brother. Friends and family say he didn't smoke, he  didn't abuse alcohol. Though he took care of many of his own bills, he lived at  the family's comfortable stucco-and-wood house in a sedate corner of Cypress.  </P> <P> "He was quiet, sincere, serious," recalled Greg White, 19, a college sophomore.  "If he said he needed to get something done, he'd get it done."  </P> <P> Although only an average student, garnering mostly Cs in class, White was  A-plus when it came to athletics, his brother said. His stage, however, was not  the home field of some Orange County sports power, but rather the ball fields  and basketball courts of West Germany, where his father, an Army major, was  stationed.  </P> <P> When the family moved to Orange County after White graduated from high school,  it hardly mattered that the 6-foot, 1-inch, 190-pounder was selected to the  All-Europe high school squad in baseball, football and basketball, his brother  said. He was a newcomer.  </P> <P> "He didn't have any friends, he didn't know anyone," Greg White said.  </P> <P> But that void was soon filled. In 1987, Greg and Thomas White went to a  regional championship basketball game to watch a friend play. White met Tanabe.  They talked, and later started seeing each other, Greg recalled. Within a month  or so, they were an inseparable couple.  </P> <P> "That was her first serious boyfriend, and it was his first serious  girlfriend," the brother said.  </P> <P> The pair spent most of their free moments together. They often played  basketball together, always on the same team, at some neighborhood courts.  Tanabe was frequently around the pet hospital, and the couple seemed happy,  deeply in love, Kopit said.  </P> <P> "He seemed interested in pursuing a long-term relationship with her," the  doctor recalled. "He talked about getting married. He was very dedicated. I  knew he loved her very much, and cared very much, but he never seemed obsessed.  Their relationship seemed normal, typical for a couple of that age."  </P> <P> Indeed, though Tanabe considered athletic scholarship offers from schools  including Columbia and Arizona, she ultimately chose to pass them up this year  because she wasn't ready to leave home.  </P> <P> As graduation neared for Tanabe, however, there were signs of trouble, White's  brother said. Tanabe told a girlfriend that she wanted to date other people,  and the girlfriend told Greg White.  </P> <P> Tanabe even tried to force a breakup by making White angry, his brother said.  But the tactic never worked with White. He pursued her despite the coolness.  </P> <P> Even when the couple split up about four months ago, they still saw each other,  their friendship seemingly surviving the rocks that shattered their romance.  </P> <P> But for White, it wasn't enough. Friends of Krisden's say he continually  called, asking where Krisden was, what Krisden was doing. The unwanted  attention bothered Tanabe, they said.  </P> <P> White also began contemplating suicide, his brother said. "At first, I think he  was saying it to get her back, to get attention," he said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, White decided last month to sign himself into Los Altos Hospital  and Mental Health Center in Long Beach. He stayed nearly a month, his brother  said.  </P> <P> When he arrived home at the beginning of the week, White seemed better, the  brother said. His singular focus on Tanabe had apparently dissipated. Just  weeks before, White called up a coach at San Jose State and talked about  playing basketball for the Northern California college, Greg White said.  </P> <P> "Everything seemed to be OK," the brother said. "We went out and played some  basketball when he got back. She seemed out of his mind."  </P> <P> Through it all, White remained a close family friend with the Tanabes. He was  planning to move into an apartment with Tanabe's brother in a week, according  to Anita Tanabe. It was Krisden Tanabe who talked him into getting help. She  had driven him to the hospital.  </P> <P> "He kept telling her he was going to kill himself. She was quite concerned,"  Tanabe's mother said. "She kept saying, 'I can help him.' "  </P> <P> After he checked himself out of the hospital on Tuesday, White came by to talk  to Tanabe's mother about his obsession with her daughter. By the end of the  conversation, White seemed to have accepted a life without Krisden.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, however, White confronted Tanabe at her friend's house and  accused her of giving her phone number to another guy, Tanabe's friends said.  The verbal sparring quickly escalated into a violent slapping and shoving match  in the front yard.  </P> <P> Then came Thursday afternoon. White's mother was at home watching the local  news when word of a murder-suicide in Westminster flashed across the screen.  She saw her son's car and two bodies draped with yellow covers. She knew, even  before authorities could come knocking on the door, what had happened.  </P> <P> "I never pictured something like this happening to this family," said Greg  White. "It was like the ideal Cosby family. We laughed a lot, we cracked jokes.  My parents were always very understanding with us."  </P> <P> In the kitchen of her Fountain Valley home Friday, Krisden Tanabe's mother  clutched a pink Kleenex in her hand and seemed to have trouble following what a  woman from her church was saying. The woman promised to help her get through  the excruciating arrangements of burying her daughter. Together they would pick  out nice psalms and music that Krisden would have liked for the funeral Mass.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's hit us yet that we won't be seeing her anymore," Krisden's  mother said. "She gave me so much joy and so much laughter -- everything a  mother could want out of a child. She was so full of life. She needs to be  remembered like that."  </P> <P> Other members of the Tanabe family started coming home early Friday morning.  Her sister, Kim, 24, an Air Force navigator, flew in from Washington. Her  brother, Mike, 19, had come home from college. A funeral Mass is to be  celebrated Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Saints Simon &amp; Jude Catholic Church in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Tamie, 16, the youngest, sat in the middle of the living room and looked  through her big sister's yearbook and cried. There seemed to be picture after  picture of Krisden Tanabe, wide-eyed and bubbly, a popular, pretty high school  basketball star.  </P> <P> "She loves her sister," Anita Tanabe said. "She's so proud of her sister.  Krisden did leave her mark behind."  </P> <P> Family members said Friday they felt the system had failed both young people.  They wondered why White, so obviously distraught, had left the hospital.  </P> <P> "We just assumed that the professionals were taking care of him," Lisa Barros,  Tanabe's aunt, said. "He just got out of a mental hospital and he was able to  walk in and buy a firearm. That, to me, seems criminal."  </P> <P> Police said they were still trying to determine how White obtained the gun.  Greg White said his brother had borrowed money from a friend, saying he needed  it to pay some bills, then apparently purchased the shotgun sometime during the  days after he left the hospital.  </P></p>

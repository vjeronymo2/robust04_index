			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- In 1991 a total of  1,334,434 people lived on the territory of southern Slovakia,  excepting Bratislava, Kosice, and the Nitra district, with  771,196 Slovaks (57.9 percent) and 517,936 ethnic Hungarians  (38.8 percent), the daily REPUBLIKA writes today.    Statistics "experts" from the ranks of participants in the  January 8 Komarno meeting maintain that according to the 1991  census, 824,946 people, including 507,073 Hungarians, live in  the ethnically mixed southern Slovak region spreading from  Bratislava to south Zemplin, with Slovaks and other ethnic  minorities (Romanies and Czechs) comprising the rest. These  data are not correct, says the daily, organ of the state-owned  Slovak News Agency (TA SR).    Other data concerning an ethnic Hungarian area south of  Nitra, where ethnic Hungarians allegedly are in the majority in  18 villages of the district, are false, the daily asserts.  According to the 1991 census, Hungarians make up a majority  only in 10 villages of the district. Ethnic Hungarians make up  the majority in southern Slovakia only in the Dunajska Streda  and Komarno districts. In other districts, Slovaks make up the  majority and they have therefore the decisive right to speak on  the question of the future territorial administrative  arrangement of this region, REPUBLIKA writes.    Slovaks living on territories with mixed population are  considerably harmed by the election law drafted on the principle  of majority participation. This is witnessed, for example, by  the situation in the Nove Zamky district where there are only 8  Slovaks in the 45-member local representation, although Slovaks  make up 70 percent of this district's population.    The reason for such a situation is a very simple. Almost all  ethnic Hungarians voted for actually one party -- Egyutteles  (Coexistence) while Slovaks voted for representatives of  different parties which led to the diffusion of their votes.  They thus failed to further the majority of their deputies in  local representations even in towns and villages where Slovaks  make up the majority, the daily writes.</p>

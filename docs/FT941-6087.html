			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Tragi-comedy of the rising yen The last few days' shakeout in the financial markets bears the clear sign 'Made in the United States'. It has been triggered by an overreaction to a couple of flash American economic indicators coupled with persistent reports that President Bill Clinton was about to grant authority for trade sanctions against Japan. The resulting renewed upward pressure on the yen may indeed be more disturbing for the Japanese economy than any actual sanctions. For two decades until the end of Bretton Woods in 1971 the dollar-yen exchange rate remained fixed within a narrow band around Y360 to the dollar. Trade imbalances were modest; Japan experienced double-digit growth rates; and trade barriers came down. After President Nixon floated the dollar in 1971, the US currency plunged and the yen soared, at one stage reaching almost Y200 to the dollar. The dollar recovery in the early Reagan years in the first half of the 1980s turned out to be a blip. The yen began rising again and is now within a whisker of Y100 to the dollar. A believer in the exchange rate approach to the balance of payments might expect that this three or fourfold rise in the yen over two decades would at least have killed off the Japanese trade surplus with the US. Yet in the course of the 1980s, this surplus has risen and now approaches Dollars 60bn per annum: an uncomfortable result for those who erroneously believe bilateral trade balances to be important. There is never a conclusive answer to those who believe that the only reason why a medicine is killing the patient is that he is not taking enough of it. US officials have often pressed still further revaluation on Japan and threatened to talk the dollar down. Of course, it is impossible for either currency to move just against the other without affecting the exchange rates of third and fourth countries. But the Bundesbank, for instance, does not mind if American pressure for a low dollar helps to keep the D-Mark higher than it would otherwise be. For the moment, the action is in the US-Japanese relationship. Judged by the standard not of GDP but of industrial production, Japan's recession has been the worst among the main industrial countries, with little sign of recovery so far. Indeed both the concentration of the Japanese output fall on the internationally exposed industrial sector and its dimensions are a strong reminder of the UK in the early 1980s. At that time the combination of the 'Thatcher effect', North Sea oil and the second international oil price explosion produced a ferocious rise in the pound and consequent industrial shakeout which remain a folk memory in UK business. Professor Ronald McKinnon of Stanford has long been an opponent of dollar depreciation; and the present state of the Japanese economy makes a new paper* of his specially timely. His argument is that the rising yen has produced deflationary pressures in the true sense in Japanese wholesale prices. Consumer prices, which respond more sluggishly to economic forces, are rising at a minimalist 1 per cent per annum. Nominal short-term interest rates could hardly fall very much below their present 2 1/4 per cent level. But taken in conjunction with falling producer prices, the real rate of interest for even blue-chip Japanese borrowers must be at least 4 1/2 per cent. Monocausality rarely works; and a sceptic could point to the experience of 1985-87 when a sharply rising yen and even severer producer price deflation did not prevent a vigorous recovery in the Japanese economy. A more modest diagnosis is that the high indebtedness left over from the recent domestic property bust and the vulnerability of the financial system make it more difficult for the economy to bounce back in the face of falling prices than on other occasions. McKinnon estimates the purchasing parity exchange rate to be about Y140-Y150 to the dollar, and he would like to make a start in moving towards this rate. But how could the Bank of Japan manage this? The usual way that central banks ease policy is by lowering short-term interest rates. If the Bank of Japan cannot go much further in reducing rates, what is left? The main way, in these circumstances, to expand the money supply is by official purchases of foreign exchange. In these circumstances, an easy money policy would have a double effect. The traded goods sector would be freed from deflation and real Japanese interest rates would for a time become negative. Alas, in the present Washington mood, a Japanese effort to edge the yen downwards might be taken as an economic Pearl Harbour. If the Japanese seriously wanted to gain acceptance of a weaker yen, they would have to persuade the Americans that the stimulative effects of a monetary expansion combined with a lower yen exchange rate would more than offset the loss to the US on the direct price competitiveness front. I would not like to undertake the task. Yet I would not despair of McKinnon having the last laugh. The present Japanese and American authorities have in common a desire to get back to some form of world exchange rate accord - if not a full Bretton Woods, at least of the informal kind that marked the Louvre and Plaza accords of 1985-87. The difference, of course, is that the Americans would like this stability around a high yen and the Japanese around a somewhat lower one. This is reminiscent of the period when James Baker was US secretary of the Treasury and always favoured stability provided that the dollar could be low enough. The Americans are, however, in a difficulty because they want Japan to stimulate its economy. Monetary easing would involve a weaker yen. On the fiscal side, the Japanese government has announced endless packages to stimulate spending and cut taxes; but so far with disappointing results. The orthodox view would be that the budget surplus that Japan runs in non-recession years needs to be cut and that the structural US budget deficit also needs to decline. The hope is that Japanese saving will thereby be reduced and US saving boosted. Is this entirely rational? The Japanese structural budget surplus represents the effort of a high-saving society to safeguard itself against the burden of an ageing population. It is quite rational for the Japanese to lend net sums to the US, which has a deficiency of savings except during periods of recession. At some time in the next century, the net flow of investment will reverse. Meanwhile it really is on the monetary front that action will occur, if it does. The logjam might be broken by some chance events precipitating a rise in the dollar or fall in the yen persisting long enough for the US to see that it is not so damaging after all. A US-Japanese Bretton Woods would present some delicate adjustment problems for Europe. If it made the European Community get its act together, so much the better. But before we can have a Japanese-American currency accord, the threat of an economic war between the two countries must be averted. Unfortunately, the massive investment that the US has made in public economic education has not killed the crudest mercantilist fallacies about bilateral trade balances. Indeed the 'Austrian' critics of the US economics establishment, about whom Michael Prowse wrote in the FT on Monday, may be understating their case. *Dollar and Yen, Asia-Pacific Research Centre, Stanford</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Travel: Formula based on esprit I DISCOVERED Inntravel seven years ago, soon after it began operating, by joining a cross-country skiing weekend in the Swiss village of Kandersteg. In its early days, Inntravel advertised in slim black-and-white leaflets offering skiing and not much else. Now its brochures are large, colourful and plump with suggestions for those seeking weekends or short breaks in France, Switzerland, Italy and Norway. Inntravel is owned by Richard Hearn and his wife, Linda. Hearn used to work for Wallace Arnold, where he had already recognised a demand for short-break holidays when he decided to set up on his own. He began with Winterinn in 1984, after taking six months off to study business management on a government-aided scheme at Durham University. He and his wife decided to make their base in Helmsley, near York, and gradually established a loyal clientele, many of whom re-book each year. They started with 500 bookings. Last year it was about 9,000. 'The average age of the Inntravel holidaymaker is 45 and upwards', says Hearn. 'They are usually people who were sporty in their youth but who haven't done a lot since. Even so, they like the idea of trying something new. They also want a holiday which is tailored to their needs and don't want to be part of a large group.' Some five years ago, when I first went to Kandersteg, the story was rather different. Since then, Inntravel has moved slowly up-market. Today's customers are older and richer. They insist on value for money. Linda Hearn is a young, blue-eyed blonde who looks after three small children when she isn't dashing about Europe discovering yet another 'characterful' hotel or 'authentic' village. Richard Hearn is small and slight and sets out his business aims with a mix of realism and high hopes. 'At present, four of us do the travelling and we work from one year to the next without five- or even three-year plans,' says Hearn. 'I still wake up and panic each morning. It will probably be a bad day when I don't but we are incredibly lucky with the hoteliers we work with. They are so enthusiastic.' It is this enthusiasm which links Inntravel to many of the inns and family hotels it has come to consider its own. High on a hillside at Les Alisiers, in Alsace, Ella and Jacques Degouy mirror the Hearns in age and ambition. Jacques used to work for a pharmaceutical company in Paris until deciding to start a small hotel near the village where his wife was born. Jacques likes to entertain his friends in his own restaurant as well as work there and is dangerously generous to visitors. Ella, his wife, is shy and practical. It was Ella who decided to reduce the number of hotel rooms to a handful, improving and enlarging a few, releasing time to concentrate on the restaurant. It was also Ella who trained the young chef and it is Ella who cooks on Sundays and takes the orders every evening while keeping an eye on the student waitresses. The rooms at Les Alisiers, like many other Inntravel hotels, are clean, comfortable and uninspiring. The food on the restaurant's set menu is wholesome rather than interesting. But the atmosphere is friendly, the staff helpful and everyone extremely pleasant. It is this esprit which makes Inntravel, and the small hotels it discovers, so successful. Inntravel's Inn-Active Summer '92 brochure, to October 31, offers flexible holidays in France, Italy, Norway and Switzerland for those who want to travel on foot, by horse or bike. In addition, there are wine-tasting, sailing, painting and self-drive holidays. There is also a Portfolio brochure (to October 31), of fishermen's cottages, alpine farmhouses, family hotels, etc. Inntravel: The Old Station, Helmsley, York YO6 5BZ, tel: 0439-71111, fax: 0439-71070.</p>

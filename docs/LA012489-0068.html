			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet military stepped up emergency airlifts to the capital of Afghanistan  to ease severe food shortages it blamed on hoarding and inefficiency by local  authorities. Soviet officials said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving daily  on a dozen flights from the Soviet cities of Tashkent and Fergana, both about  an hour from the capital of Kabul by plane. Observers said the supplies had an  immediate impact on the food shortage, which also was blamed partly on  disruption of road supply convoys by Muslim guerrillas. It was unclear whether  the Soviets would be able to mount food airlifts after their troops withdraw  from Afghanistan by Feb. 15 as expected.  </P></p>

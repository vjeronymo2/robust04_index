			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Austrians in a fever over EU referendum: Not long ago, a Yes vote seemed assured; now it's far from certain In the European Union, tomatoes must be square, chocolates are made of blood and cucumbers are all radioactive. These are among the scare stories put about in Austria in the past couple of weeks as campaigning towards the country's referendum this Sunday on joining the EU has reached an extraordinarily fevered pitch. According to the results of two polls published this week, sentiment has become finely balanced, with 31 per cent of those who have made up their minds in favour of joining and the same number opposed. An astonishing 38 per cent are still undecided. If Austrians decide not to join the EU, Swedes and Norwegians, who vote in referendums in the autumn, might easily follow, leaving the Union's expansion strategy in tatters. Anti-EU sentiment in Austria has recovered dramatically since early March when the successful conclusion of entry negotiations left the country in a pro-Europe euphoric state. Polls then indicated as much as a 25 point lead for the pro-EU campaign. That momentum was soon dissipated when Britain and Spain held up ratification of the treaty over the arcane issue of voting weights in the council of ministers. This was just another demonstration of the meaningless wrangles that paralyse the Union, anti-EU forces in Austria exulted. But, until a few days ago, polls continued to show that a small, but comfortable, majority of Austrians would vote in favour of joining the Union. The motley collection of extreme right-wingers, farmers and some leftish Greens who formed the opposition looked completely overwhelmed by the unified ranks of the country's political, business and union leaders. And the fundamental economic and security arguments for joining the EU, while not inspiring, were difficult to refute. In post cold war Europe, it is no longer clear who, if anyone, would guarantee Austria's security unless it becomes part of the Union. The country's economy is already closely integrated with those of neighbouring EU countries, especially Germany and Italy. While membership will not make a big difference in Austria's growth prospects, there is general agreement that inward investment would be weaker if Austria did not join. 'We believe that 90 per cent of Austria's workers will benefit from membership, and the rest will be protected by special measures,' Mr Heinz Vogler, president of the federal chamber of labour, says. But these arguments were forgotten when the scare stories started appearing. Apart from the silly ones mentioned above which appeared in tabloid newspapers, there have been more substantial ones carefully tailored to Austrian sensitivities. One legal expert discovered that, once inside the EU, Austria could not prevent its neighbouring countries from draining the Austrian Alps for their water requirements. Mr Jorg Haider, charismatic leader of the extreme right-wing Austrian Freedom party, promptly put up posters warning that joining the Union meant the country would lose its water. Then a constitutional lawyer in Salzburg said that membership of the EU, including Euratom, would invalidate Austria's law outlawing the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, in spite of a comforting side letter in the entry treaty. From there, it was but a short step for EU opponents to claim that Brussels would force the country to build nuclear plants. Last week, the Socialist-Conservative coalition government, which is leading the pro-EU campaign, took fright, realising that the scare campaign was having an impact. Now the government, too, has become somewhat extravagant in its claims. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister, threatened last week that taxes would have to be raised if the country stayed outside. On Wednesday, Mr Otto Habsburg, a descendant of the former Austrian monarchy, was trotted out to say that the old Austrian idea of bringing people together in peace could only be realised in the EU. On Sunday, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who is recovering from a back operation, rose from his hospital bed to plead emotionally with his countrymen in a television interview to vote in favour. He warned that a No vote would greatly weaken Austria. 'We wouldn't go hungry. Our country is strong. But we would suffer many disadvantages - above all the next generation.' Ordinary Austrians seem put off by the increasingly shrill tone of the campaign, as is shown by the large number of undecided voters even at this late stage. One Vienna banker said this week: 'One day when I talk to people, I get the impression that it will go through. The next day, I get the opposite impression.'</p>

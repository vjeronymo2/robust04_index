			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Investment grade rating for Chile debt CHILE yesterday became the first of Latin America's problem debtors of the 1980s to meet international standards of creditworthiness when its debt was given an investment grade rating by a leading US credit rating agency. The announcement yesterday that Standard and Poor's had assigned a BBB rating to Chilean government debt came 10 years to the week after Mexico's announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments triggered the Latin American debt crisis. The investment grade rating, from Standard &amp; Poor's, widens significantly the potential group of buyers for bonds issued by the Chilean government and its entities. Many investment institutions, particularly in the US, have guidelines which strictly limit the amount of below-investment grade debt that they can buy. The rating, announced yesterday by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, ranks Chile as the safest country in Latin America for foreign investors. It places Chile in a category of countries of low political and economic risk for investment, ranked above Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, and only slightly below the newly industrialised economies of south-east Asia. 'The rating should significantly decrease the cost of financing foreign investments in Chile,' Mr Foxley said. 'It should strengthen Chile's reputation abroad as a reliable partner for trade and long-term investments.' He forecast a big leap in foreign investment flows, which totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 576m) last year. Chile's economy is set to expand 8 per cent this year - its ninth consecutive year of growth - while inflation is expected to fall to around 13 per cent, from 18.7 per cent at the end of 1991. Despite the healthy macroeconomic outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's evaluation cautioned that greater efforts were needed to bridge the income gap between rich and poor, and that Chile needed to improve its health and education services and infrastructure. It also noted that exports were still too dependent on copper. Paradoxically, the 'investment grade' rating comes at a time when Chile is trying to stem a flood of dollars into the country. The dollar glut is a product of the country's trade surplus and foreign investment flows, and has led to an appreciation of the peso. Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

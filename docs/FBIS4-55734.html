			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 19 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the republic of Srpska's national assembly, has  said that the Bosnian Serbs have pointed to the shortcomings of  the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "However, it  failed to seriously convey all the remarks we had voiced during  the last talks in Pale," Krajisnik said in a statement for  TANJUG prior to the beginning of the Bosnia contact group's  two-day work in Washington.    Our first remark, Krajisnik went on, is that the Serbs  cannot  take part in the continuation of the conference without  receiving equal treatment, meaning that the sanctions should be  lifted and that the pressure now being exerted on the Serbs  should end. "The second thing concerns territorial demands put  to the Serbs so the Muslims could get 51 percent of the  territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina--this was demanded of  us without explanation and was not backed by any arguments,"  Krajisnik said and expressed hope that the contact group will  acknowledge these remarks on the basis of new information at its  disposal, and find an acceptable solution. "True, there will be  problems with the territories because our remarks will be  construed as a condition for continuing the talks--which would  be a mistake because we are not setting any conditions for the  cessation of hostilities and the continuation of the conference.  Hope lies in negotiations, but we cannot allow ourselves to be  under pressure while the Muslims and Croats are not, and this  only makes the continuation of the talks more difficult,"  Krajisnik added.    Commenting on reports of a new international conference on  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that thorough  preparations must be carried out ahead of such a meeting, and  certain dilemmas must be settled because which part of Bosnia  belongs to one or the other side is not immaterial.    What is good and provides a good basis for talks is the fact  that the stance has finally been agreed that Bosnia must finally  be divided into two parts. Attempts to create obstacles to  division by calling for a unified Bosnia, and by linking its  parts either into a federation, a confederation, or a union--all  these things are, in fact, attempts to turn back the clock,  although it is clear that it cannot be turned back, Krajisnik  said. In his opinion, the most important problem has been  resolved and that is that Bosnia must be divided into two parts,  while the West has resolved the problem of what it will do with  the Muslims.    Speaking about the current Muslim offensive, the National  Assembly speaker expressed his disappointment with the role of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] because, he said, "we have  noticed bias on the part of the peacekeeping forces." Not only  do they tolerate the Muslim offensive, but they fail to react at  all to their offensive actions, hoping that the Muslims will  improve their position, and that this will be a good basis for  the continuation of negotiations. We must accept and  realize--and this is the most difficult thing in this war--that  there is no justice for the Serb people either, because we are  an obstacle to the realization of major interests, but we must  hold out because we have a great chance of achieving our goals,  although the road to accomplishing this will be difficult,  Krajisnik said.    Momcilo Krajisnik also hinted at a new session of the  republic of Srpska's parliament, most probably next Tuesday or  Wednesday [24th or 25th May]. Owing to large-scale diplomatic  preparations for the upcoming international conference on  Bosnia, the assembly session--instead of being held this  week--has been postponed until the beginning of next week,  Momcilo Krajisnik, concluded in a statement he made to TANJUG  today.</p>

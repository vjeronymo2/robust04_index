			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Unit trust body opposes new rules THE Unit Trust Association has called for proposals on unit trust disclosure produced by Lautro, the unit trust and life assurance regulator, to be withdrawn. It says they will confuse investors and add unnecessarily to costs. Lautro was required to produce unit trust disclosure rules as part of the Securities and Investments Board's review of retail regulation. The review has already devised exhaustive disclosure rules for life assurance products. The association says the proposed rules are appropriate for life assurance but inappropriate for unit trusts and 'will take an essentially simple product and make it appear complex'.</p>

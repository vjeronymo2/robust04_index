			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWN WITH DOCTRINES UP WITH A TREATY;  </P> <P> FINDING THE PROPER TERMS FOR A WORLD REBORN;  </P> <P> SUMMIT: GEORGE BUSH COULD DO WHAT WOODROW WILSON AND FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT  FAILED TO DO -- LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A PEACEFUL, PROSPEROUS WORLD.  </P> <P> Poor George Bush. By temperament and training, he may be the best-qualified man  in America to administer the foreign policy and the alliances we inherited from  the 1940s, but history has given him an infinitely more difficult assignment.  The world is being remade and, like Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D.  Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, Bush is doomed to work under the spotlight of  history.  </P> <P> Will he throw away a historic opportunity for lasting peace -- like Wilson at  Versailles? Will he concede too much -- like Roosevelt at Yalta? Or will he  achieve the elusive goal that U.S. diplomacy has sought through a century of  revolution and war, to create the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous  world?  </P> <P> These questions haunt the meeting between Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  Disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union blocked a peace  treaty to end World War II and, since the '40s, U.S.-Soviet negotiations have  been maddeningly difficult, frustratingly slow. Bush's predecessors won praise  for even limited agreements with a recalcitrant Soviet Union, but historians  will inevitably ask whether Bush, in the face of unprecedented opportunities,  rose to the occasion with requisite wisdom and enough of "the vision thing."  </P> <P> He will need plenty of both. The face of Europe changes day by day, and no one  knows what it will look like in 10 years' time. Independence movements within  the Soviet Union, the push for German reunification and the host of territorial  claims and counterclaims that have kept Eastern Europe in turmoil for centuries  threaten to plunge the world into a new generation of conflict. The Hungarians  think about their "lost territories" to the east and south of their current  boundaries; the Turks and Bulgarians nurse their ancient mutual grudge; the  Albanians and Yugoslavs quarrel over Kossovo even while Yugoslavia's  nationalities revive ancestral feuds; Romania wants the return of territories  taken by Josef Stalin in World War II.  </P> <P> Security and territorial questions are bad enough; economic issues are even  more grave. Despite all the encouraging talk from the West, there is no  guarantee that market economies will send fleets of Volvos humming through  dingy East European streets. Eastern Europe was poor before Stalin; it may not  grow rich after Gorbachev. Historically, Eastern Europe has been the  Continent's Latin America -- a region where economic potential was stunted by  political and cultural obstacles. Worse, no country anywhere in the world has  yet made a successful transition from communist to capitalist economy.  Yugoslavia, where reform started earliest, is in deep trouble and the other  reforming economies -- the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland -- have problems of  their own.  </P> <P> The combination of economic trouble and political chaos should give us all  pause. Eastern Europe may want to join the West, but the region could end up  like the Middle East -- a hotbed of chauvinism and a breeding ground for war.  It's been that way since the Goths fought the Romans; a Nazi occupation  followed by a generation of communist repression may not have laid the  groundwork for peaceful cooperation among these long-suffering peoples.  </P> <P> This prospect is one problem confronting Bush, but it is far from the only one  he faces. The economic problems of the United States, almost forgotten in the  spate of news from Europe, are still with us: trade and budget deficits in  excess of $100 billion a year; the value of the dollar still depends on the  attitudes of West German and Japanese investors.  </P> <P> In 1945, the United States was a creditor nation; its economic supremacy could  not be doubted. A war-ravaged world looked to America for its daily bread. Our  economy, our technology and our political system enjoyed a global prestige we  can no longer command. Bush has a weaker hand than his predecessors; we must  all hope his skill as a player can make up for the deficiencies in the deal.  </P> <P> The most immediate difficulty facing Bush -- an unprecedented problem for  recent times -- is how to keep the United States in the game. The great  movements in Europe today -- the consolidation of the Common Market, the  reconciliation of the Germanys and the liberation of the East -- are all out of  our control. In the chaos of his collapsing empire, Gorbachev is closer than  any of his predecessors to the dearest goal of postwar Soviet diplomacy:  cutting a deal with Western Europe that excludes the United States. As many  Europeans -- especially the Germans -- fear the Soviets less, they feel less  need for the Atlantic connection.  </P> <P> The history of this century teaches that the New World cannot afford to be  isolated; Europe and America need one another. As the old Cold War rationale  for the Atlantic Alliance fades, Bush must do more than rethink relations with  the Soviets, he must find a new framework for U.S. relations with Europe as a  whole.  </P> <P> To make this work, he must find strategic partners in Europe who are willing to  work with the United States toward a common vision of the future. This probably  means Paris. Britain is too poor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has  allowed herself to become too isolated to be of much use; the West Germans are  preoccupied with their own concerns. Of all major European powers, France is  most likely to see things our way. The French distrust Soviet intentions as  much as we do, but they are as cautious as we are -- perhaps more so -- about  the prospects of a strong, united Germany at the center of Europe. Like us, the  French would like to see a rapidly growing world economy and a reduction in  German and Japanese trade surpluses.  </P> <P> Both Paris and Washington seem to understand the importance of cooperation.  While relations between French and U.S. leaders have sometimes been chilly,  Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Bush have cemented a warm personal  relationship based on mutual respect. Reportedly, Bush believes Mitterrand is  the most farsighted and realistic of West European leaders and like most  Europeans -- Thatcher excepted -- Mitterrand greatly prefers Bush to his  predecessor.  </P> <P> Bush must regain diplomatic initiative with bold and imaginative strokes. It  isn't easy to get out in front of Gorbachev, one of history's great  scene-stealers, but Bush has one possibility. He can, in consultation with U.S.  allies, call for a general peace conference to deal with the questions left  over from World War II and new questions that rise from the ruins of Stalin's  empire. A peace conference would have an even broader mandate than the Helsinki  II gathering Gorbachev proposed Thursday, and would touch on some subjects --  such as the infamous Hitler-Stalin agreements -- that Gorbachev might prefer to  avoid.  </P> <P> Peace conferences, or "conferences of nations," are the way the modern West has  tied up the loose ends of one war and tried to avoid the next. While  conventional negotiators focus on one specific issue, a peace conference works  on all outstanding problems, always keeping one eye the new world order being  created.  </P> <P> A peace conference could find the appropriate framework for German  reunification and take up the broader issue of Eastern Europe. In the current  climate it will be possible to extend and strengthen the Helsinki Accords,  perhaps including the right of appeal to international bodies in the case of  violations of human rights. The French-backed concept of a European Development  Bank with international -- including U.S. and Japanese -- participation could  take firmer shape; the various East-West negotiations for arms reductions may  make faster progress if part of a much broader process.  </P> <P> Bush has the opportunity to succeed where Wilson and Roosevelt failed, but the  window for peace may never open this wide again in our lifetimes. The hatreds  of World War II have subsided; the bitterness of the Cold War is fading; every  major power has more to hope for than fear from a general settlement in Europe.  Gorbachev has indicated that the Soviets are ready to come to the table; bold  leadership now from Bush will do more than assure his place in history. In the  long term it can place the peace of Europe -- and the world -- on a firm  foundation. In the short term it will put the United States back where it  belongs: at the center of international affairs and in the forefront of the  struggle for peace.  </P></p>

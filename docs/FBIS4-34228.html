			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio today thanked the Ibero-American  nations for their solidarity during the peace negotiations with  the guerrillas and urged them to prevent the talks from becoming  bogged down.    During the first session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit  of heads of state and government, De Leon Carpio said that  "there is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel" and that  despite the difficulty of the negotiations the Guatemalan  Government is determined to fulfill its moral commitment.    "On 29 March we signed a negotiations agreement-schedule,  which underscores such points as the cease-fire in September and  the demobilization of the guerrillas in December and which  confirms that the signing of peace in 1994 is irreversible," De  Leon Carpio said.    The Guatemalan president told the leaders of 21 countries,  including the Dominican vice president, that he hopes to be  remembered as the president whose administration established  "total respect for the law and the conviction that that is the  best attitude." "We have made considerable progress by signing  the general agreement on human rights and immediate  international verification," the president added.    The Guatemalan president pointed out that "with the end of  the 30-year-old internal armed confrontation -- the leading  source of human rights violations -- we will achieve total  respect for life and individual guarantees." After urging  Ibero-America to allow the opening of markets and the  elimination of protectionist barriers, De Leon Carpio said: "We  can set the example by trading among ourselves and later  requesting similar conditions from the rest of the international  community."    According to the Guatemalan president, Central America is  attempting to reduce its huge social disparities, improve its  peoples' standard of living through democratic consolidation and  productive transformations, and increase its participation in  worldwide trade.</p>

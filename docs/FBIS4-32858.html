			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation in the Armed Forces has been tense  in the last few days as a result of the personnel reduction in  the Armed Forces. Defense Minister Raul Tovar said that the  comments made by General Moises Schiriqui Bejarano, Armed Forces  chief of staff, were distorted.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Mario Espinoza] This report does  not seek to increase a disagreement between the Armed Forces and  the constitutionally established civilian government. The idea  is to reflect what is happening between the Armed Forces and the  executive branch. Today President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  arrived 40 minutes late to a ceremony prepared by his escort  batallion. Furthermore, the issue of the reduction of personnel  and economic resources in the Armed Forces has created concern  not only because of the reaction of the Armed Forces chief of  staff, as reported by an editorial in LA RAZON, but also because  of how it was done, as if it were an answer to an offense  against the Armed Forces which in reality never existed. This is  why the comments of the defense minister also created concern  when he said that the declarations of General Moises Schiriqui  Bejarano have been distorted.    [Tovar] His comments were distorted.    [Espinoza] Does this mean that there are no disagreements  between the Armed Forces and the civilian power?    [Tovar] No, there are no disagreements, absolutely none.  There is complete respect for democracy.    [Espinoza] As far as we know, General Schiriqui never  questioned the government's policy, in this case democracy. What  is indeed under discussion is the possibility of a reduction of  personnel and economic resources in the Armed Forces within the  framework of the economic crisis affecting the country for the  last few years. [passage omitted] [end recording]    After President Sanchez de Lozada delivered his speech the  impasse with the Armed Forces was overcome. President Sanchez de  Lozada was very clear in the speech he made during the ceremony  on the anniversary of the Colorados Regiment.    [Begin recording] [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada,  with the Constitution in his hands, reminded the Armed Forces of  their constitutional role of guaranteeing the stability of the  legally established government and of cooperating in the overall  development of the country.    [Sanchez de Lozada] The Armed Forces have the basic role of  defending and maintaining national independence [words  indistinct], and the honor and national sovereignty, insuring  the reign of the Constitution, guaranteeing the stability of the  legally established government, and cooperating in the overall  development of the country. This is the government policy, this  is the government guideline [words indistinct].    [Espinoza] President Sanchez de Lozada said there is not,  nor  will there be, any policy that does not benefit the nation and  this includes the Armed Forces because when a country grows, its  Armed Forces also grow.    [Sanchez de Lozada in progress] a stronger institution,  better prepared to fulfill its constitutional duties, and to  represent, and defend our country. [words indistinct]    [Espinoza] The president believes there are no poor  countries  with great Armed Forces and that the current effort is to  strengthen the national economy and society, to educate the  people, to watch over their health, and also to appropriate  resources to have a strong Armed Forces. In the afternoon, the  president summoned the high military command to explain the  government policy regarding the Armed Forces. Then Armed Forces  Commander General Fernando Sanjinez referred to the presidential  speech.    [Sanjinez] We are very pleased with the speech delivered by  the president this morning. We are really very pleased with his  speech.    [Espinoza] Apparently the situation is now clearer. There  was  undoubtedly a moment of confrontation but following the meeting  the situation is completely normal. [end recording]</p>

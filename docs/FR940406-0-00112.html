			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA-incurred costs associated with the certification program can be recovered in the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program (MVECP) fee program (see 40 CFR part 86, subpart J). Today's action is likely to increase the amount of the MVECP fee which is collected during the certification process since the Agency's burden is expected to increase. As discussed in the Fee Updating Procedure section of the Fees final rule, (57 FR 30049, July 7, 1992), EPA will periodically review its fees. During that fee updating process, the Agency intends to assess the additional burden incurred due to this action, and if, as a result of the review, EPA determines that there has been a significant change in the MVECP costs, a proposal to revise the fee schedule will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Thus, manufacturers will be provided with sufficient notice and comment period prior to any changes in the amount of the fee collected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fuel Economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not have any direct impact on fuel economy labeling, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), or gas guzzler data submission requirements. Because the changes to the test procedure promulgated in this action may affect fuel economy measurements, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA will not require use of the new procedure for fuel economy testing. Therefore, to generate city fuel economy values, manufacturers may use the previously established Federal Test Procedure or may optionally use the pre-loaded canister test procedures established in this action (which are essentially the same test procedures established in the enhanced evaporative emission final rule, ref. 58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA will normally use the same procedure for confirmatory testing as used by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The fuel economy measurements may be affected because vehicles will now be tested with pre-loaded evaporative/onboard canisters. Purging these canisters during the city and highway tests could affect the air/fuel ratio of the engine which, in turn, could affect the measured fuel economy values for the test vehicle. EPA expects the effect to be minimal, although it is possible that measured fuel economy values could change for some vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Onboard Diagnostics Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's action extends the existing provisions for onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems to ORVR equipment. (The final rule for the existing program was published February 19, 1993, 58 FR 9468). ORVR systems are very similar to evaporative systems and this action requires that the OBD performance requirements which currently apply to evaporative systems apply on LDVs and LDTs also to ORVR systems, both integrated and non-integrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the current OBD program for evaporative-only systems, OBD monitoring of the ORVR system is not mandatory. However, the same approach to in-use testing will be used. That is, any in-use vehicle with evaporative emissions of 30 g/test or higher measured over the first 24 hours of the three-day diurnal from the revised evaporative test procedure will be flagged for further evaluation. That evaluation will consist of making any necessary repairs to ensure system integrity, and then making a 0.04 inch (1 mm) orifice anywhere within the system. To demonstrate compliance, operating the vehicle in this condition over the full FTP must cause the malfunction indicator light (MIL) to illuminate. A failure of the OBD system to signal a problem could contribute to a decision to initiate a recall action. While a system operating in such a manner (i.e., without the MIL going on) may not detect a malfunction related solely to refueling events, EPA nevertheless believes that such a system will be sufficient if it detects general problems with vapor and purge system integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For integrated ORVR systems, manufacturers can use the same OBD systems they use to monitor evaporative systems. For non-integrated systems, both the evaporative and refueling sides of the system will need to be monitored. It should be possible for the same technology to be used for both monitoring tasks in most cases. For example, a strategy that uses engine vacuum to draw a certain minimum level of vacuum or uses a small pump to generate a positive pressure in the entire vapor system could include a non-integrated ORVR canister in the monitoring as well. For both integrated and non-integrated systems, EPA believes this approach will result in an adequate level of certainty that key potential malfunctions in ORVR systems will be identified and repaired. Since a 0.04 inch orifice would emit only about 3 grams of hydrocarbon vapor in a normal refueling event, this approach will assure a high level of in-use control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

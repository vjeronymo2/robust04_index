			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Broad brush to sell Lautrec in Paris - The walking sticks, gloves and dinner plates on offer at the Grand Palais When the Grand Palais staged a retrospective of Paul Gaugin's paintings three years ago, people stood shivering in the Paris drizzle for three or four hours as they queued to get in. Anxious to avoid another round of rain-drenched visitors, the Grand Palais has adopted a different strategy for its next big retrospective the Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition, which opens on Saturday. The Lautrec is the first important French art exhibition where the tickets have been sold in advance. For weeks, the streets and subways of Paris have been plastered with posters of one of Lautrec's least sleazy scenes of fin de siecle Parisian low life with the slogan, 'Reservez", slapped across in red. Bookings began in November. So far, more than 50,000 individual tickets have been sold and all the 31,500 group tickets have gone. The Lautrec show is almost certain to be a sell-out. Advance booking is one of a number of marketing ploys harnessed by the Grand Palais for the Lautrec, an expanded version of the recent retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London. The exhibition is one of the most ambitious, in terms of marketing and merchandising, ever staged in France. Merchandising is already an established part of exhibition organisation in France, as in most other countries where museums sell catalogues, prints and postcards as souvenirs of their shows. But the Lautrec retrospective sets new standards in the scale of its merchandising activity. The Reunion des Musees Nationaux, the body that runs France's big museums, has adopted many of the methods used for the recent Van Gogh retrospective in Amsterdam. It hopes that, thanks to its merchandising revenue, the Lautrec will not only cover its costs, but produce a profit of around FFr15m.( Pounds 1.53m) A huge white tent has been pitched outside the Grand Palais to act as a 'supermarche Lautrec' throughout the exhibition. The merchandise includes all the customary catalogues and T-shirts, but also runs to souvenirs evoking Lautrec's life and the world of the Montmartre demi-monde in the early 1900s. In the tent, visitors will be able to buy anything from a FFr315 dinner plate festooned with a Lautrecesque flourish, to a FFr195 pair of gloves like those worn by Yvette Guilbert, one of his favourite models, and even a FFr1,200 replica of the artist's cane complete with a secret phial which could secrete two glasses of wine, or, if it was still legal in France, demon absinthe. The Musees Nationaux has modelled the marketing of the Lautrec show on the methods developed by the large US art galleries. The Museums of Modern Art in New York and Los Angeles and the Metropolitan Museum in New York were among the first to present exhibitions to the public in a populist way. Toulouse-Lautrec lends himself perfectly to populism. The story of the sickly, absinthe-addicted artist, who left his gilded life among the French aristocracy to struggle on the fringes of the Montmartre arts scene, conforms to all the Hollywood cliches of the impoverished painter. His pictures of prostitutes and their patrons are now among the best known examples of early 20th century art. The Grand Palais expects the exhibition, which runs until the end of May, to attract at least 500,000 people. However it hopes that the final tally might equal other popular Paris retrospectives, the Manet exhibition of 1983 which attracted 735,000 visitors, the Gaugin with 662,000 and the Renoir show of 1985 which holds the record of 790,000. The final cost of researching, organising and staging the Lautrec retrospective should be about FFr15m. The Musees Nationaux has already recouped a significant - though unspecified  -part of that by roping in as sole sponsor Ferruzzi Beghin-Say, the French arm of Ferruzzi, the Italian industrial group. For Ferruzzi, which began publicising its involvement at Christmas by sending out Lautrec catalogues as corporate gifts, the sponsorship offers a discreet opportunity to high light its commitment to France.</p>

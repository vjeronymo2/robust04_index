			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (24): Learning lessons the hard way - Julian Ozanne investigates the 'appalling' crisis in higher education IN THE libraries of Nigeria's universities most foreign periodicals stop dead in the early 1980s. When the money ran out the subscriptions of all but the most essential were cancelled. Few new books have been brought from abroad in the past 10 years. At Ibadan University, the oldest in Nigeria, a display in the library shows mutilated books - partly, academics say, a result of the desperation of students hunting critically short reading materials. The number of foreign medical journals purchased has been slashed from 350 to 20-25. On campuses across the country rooms made for two people are crammed with four times that number. Medical, science and technology faculties are equipped with outdated equipment, much of which has broken down because of a lack of spare parts. Chemistry departments are even short of reagents. Many departments have also experienced a brain drain, especially at the senior level in medicine, science and literature, as Nigeria's academics have headed overseas, particularly to the Middle East and the US, in search of better pay and conditions. At least Dollars 120m of unfinished projects have been abandoned until better days. A recent report by a government appointed commission into higher education under Chief Gray Longe says: 'During their visits to the institutions, the commission was appalled by the physical conditions of most of them.' The origins of the crisis lie in an unplanned and ad hoc expansion in universities and enrolments which grew faster than anywhere else in Africa, followed shortly afterwards by a severe lack of funds caused by the fall in international oil prices. Between 1972 and 1982, student enrolment in universities increased almost fivefold from nearly 21,000 to nearly 98,000. By 1990, the figure had increased to 180,000 students in 31 institutions and graduate unemployment was rising dramatically as universities failed to match manpower needs. The rapid growth in the Nigerian university system took place with little regard to costs and with particularly high proportions of expenditure devoted to administration (currently more than 50 per cent of recurrent expenditure) and post-graduate programmes. According to a World Bank report, recurrent expenditure per student fell by 38 per cent between 1982 and 1986 alone. Devaluation of the naira throughout the 1980s has had a particularly severe effect on the ability of universities to pay expatriate academics and to buy books, spare parts and western technology. According to one educationalist, the naira cost of an imported book today is at least 25 times what it was in 1981. 'We have been in a severe crisis for the past decade and inevitably there has been a drop in the quality of higher education,' said Professor Ayo Banjo, the former chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors. 'There must be a restriction on the numbers of students but this is not what the politicians want to hear,' he says. Combating costs, restructuring the expenditure priorities and limiting further expansion of enrolment and institutions have been identified as the critical factors for the development of higher education in Nigeria. Some economists also say the government needs to reorientate its budgetary expenditures away from defence spending and questionable large projects to education and health. Within the education budget, a greater proportion of resources should be devoted to the 13.5m primary school students and the 4m secondary education students. In its recommendations, the Longe Akinkube Commission called for the declaration of a 10-year period of emergency to restore higher education, a freeze on new university establishment at least until 2000, the development of an open university and distance learning, the establishment of a higher education fund, cost reduction and prudent management and a minimum of 15 per cent of budgetary expenditure to be devoted to education. (In 1988 the Federal government only devoted 3.7 per cent of total budget directly to the sector.) Some steps have already been taken by the government, including much greater cost recovery measures. Students in Nigeria now pay for their meals and contribute N90 a year for accommodation - a sum which most economists say needs to be raised dramatically. But much greater reforms will have to be undertaken to try to restore standards and rehabilitate the decimated infrastructure. 'Universities are at a key stage,' says the World Bank. 'Either they can cling to history which no longer exists and . . . face a drastic fall in the quality and effectiveness of education they provide or they can carry out a major reform.' Among the reforms agreed by the Federal government are deregulation of postgraduate fees for full cost recovery; reduction of the student lodging element in the government block grant; increased level of student loans; serious cuts in administrative staff and a maximum ceiling of 60 per cent of the block grant to be devoted to salaries by 1994-95. However, there is a widespread acceptance that there is little hope for much more resources to be provided by Federal government which must concentrate on the serious crisis in the primary education sector. To aid the cash-strapped university sector, the Bank has approved a Dollars 116.5m loan to stimulate the search for cost reduction measures in universities. The loan will be made available for book and equipment purchases and to supplement expatriate salaries, especially in science and technology. The loan is expected to provide about 17 per cent of total expenditure available over the next four years. To qualify for the access to the funds each university must meet eligibility criteria, spread over three years, which include staff reduction, course rationalisation, increased self-financing at hostels and increased revenues from non-governmental sources such as consultancy services. The Bank loan and greater cost recover will provide some financial relief but unless the Federal government resists political pressures by the states to create new institutions, which will almost certainly increase under civilian rule, and puts some limitation on the amount of new enrolments, further decline in standards will be inevitable.</p>

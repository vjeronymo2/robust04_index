			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Personal View: The waning power of Westminster 'Michael Portillo,' sighed one of that gentleman's right-wing admirers, 'is showing all the subtlety of a Spanish tuna fisherman.' The disgruntled Tory was referring to the unfolding saga of Mr Portillo, Britain's disabled workers and the European directive on public procurement that nobody bothered to check. He feared the overtones of incompetent government would damage the Conservative party. He could be right. But the episode has wider significance. It provides a cameo example of why the public is disillusioned with politicians of all parties and of how the balance of power in Britain is shifting. Above all, it underlines the decline in the authority of the House of Commons. Almost without anyone noticing, Westminster's power and prestige has been flowing away - to ministers, to judges, the press, to quangos, to the financial community and to Europe. The Portillo affair underlines the fact, as the employment secretary intended it should, that more and more laws are made in Brussels, not Westminster. But it also demonstrates the weakness of the British parliament and the growing power of ministers. The House of Commons had no input into the two-year drafting of the European directive. It was negotiated and agreed by ministers and civil servants. The power and prestige of the Commons has been so undermined that now senior parliamentarians such as John Biffen, former leader of the House, believe only drastic action will save it. 'Parliament is getting increasingly out of touch,' he says. The public is expressing its disillusion through opinion polls - politicians are rated as less trustworthy than just about any other group, including journalists and estate agents. Small wonder there is disquiet - it is not just European directives that are flawed, domestic laws are often just as ill-considered. Nor is the Commons' method of doing business calculated to command respect. As Sir Edward Heath, father of the house, says: 'It's what the public has seen of the behaviour of the House of Commons and the way it conducts itself  -through television - that has brought about a lot of the disillusion.' There is also public disquiet at the way Westminster is failing in what Gladstone said was its great duty: to hold to account those who run the country. The long years of Conservative rule, often with huge majorities in the Commons, have strengthened the government machine. The growth in the number of young, ambitious MPs planning a lifetime career in politics has made the alternate blandishments and bullying of the party whips more effective. And the cultural revolution in Whitehall appears to be fostering a more compliant civil service. The job of making ministers answerable is now being taken over by others besides the Commons. It was the courts and the press that forced a reluctant government to set up an inquiry into the arms-related exports to Iraq. And the entire brouhaha over Mr Portillo's European directive would never have impinged on public consciousness were it not for the press. Mr Portillo's insistence that European law must be rigidly obeyed no matter how flawed showed a healthy respect for the judges. In recent years the senior judges, sensing the constitutional gap created by an increasingly powerful executive and an ever more supine parliament, have started developing judicial review as a way of constraining the excesses of central government and other public bodies. Westminster is losing power to other groups: to quangos over which it has comparatively little control, the financial community - it is pointless for MPs to tramp through the voting lobbies to deliver a verdict on the 400-page Finance Bill when ministers admit they cannot control the money markets - and to Europe. Almost every day the headlines bring further proof of Europe's power to set aside British Acts of Parliament - whether it is ex-army women suing for unfair dismissal or fishermen wanting to overturn UK limits on the number of days they can spend at sea. European law has taken precedence in areas governed by the Treaty of Rome ever since Britain joined the Community in 1973. But only now is the reality starting to hit home. And what is the input of the British parliament - as opposed to its ministers - to European law? As Mr Portillo and the European directive showed, it is virtually non-existent. Westminster MPs are powerless to change European legislation. The remedy for this abdication of democratic responsibility lies in parliament's own hands. There are some small grounds for optimism. The Liberal Democrats and the Labour party have reform on their agendas. There are also signs that opposition and government will agree on the modest changes recommended by the all-party Jopling committee. But it is time for a whole raft of more far-reaching proposals. A new system of scrutinising legislation - including proposed new European laws - when still in the drafting stage is a possibility. Proper support staff for select committees so they can better monitor government departments and quangoes is another. And there must be greater transparency in all areas - notably in government and Commons appointments. Yet there is another dimension to the way power has passed from Westminster. When economies and industries are run on a supra-national level, why should law-making be limited to individual countries? The author presents BBC2's Newsnight.

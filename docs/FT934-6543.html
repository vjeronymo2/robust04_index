			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Litigation costs put Rodime Dollars 2.14m in red As foreshadowed at the interim stage, Rodime, the Glasgow-based disk drive technology licensing company, fell into the red for the year to September 30. It blamed increased litigation spending and lower licensing income. The pre-tax loss was Dollars 2.14m (Pounds 1.4m) against profits of Dollars 1.69m. Losses per share came out at 1.7 cents, against earnings of 0.8 cents. The company is still in litigation over patent infringements with three US disk drive manufacturers - Seagate Technology, Maxtor and Quantum. During the year the company completed agreements with Samsung Electronics and Sony. Mr Malcolm McIver, chairman, said that no significant agreements had been reached in the second half as other companies deferred or delayed negotiations until the outcome of the three cases was known. Operating income fell from Dollars 8.69m to Dollars 4.18m. Bank debts were cut over the year to Dollars 2.7m. The company has, however, negotiated with the Bank of Scotland an Dollars 8m increase in its Dollars 3m revolving credit facility. Mr McIver said that would provide sufficient resources to complete its patent infringement strategy through litigation or negotiation. The company produced the first 3.5 inch disk drive in the early 1980s. It has since ceased production and is concentrating on gaining income from licensing. During the year it completed the disposal of assets of its subsidiaries and the renegotiation of some obligations of its offshoots which Rodime had guaranteed.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: Wealdway's hike through English history - Christopher McCooey describes a walk through vineyards, hop gardens, Saxon hamlets and Norman churches in south-east England You do not have to go to the ends of the earth to 'travel'. You can make a journey through a locality or follow a river or path that is on your doorstep. After 30 years of travel - not non-stop, but certainly extensive - that has taken me throughout south-east Asia and the far east, to Pacific islands, to north America and northern Europe, I have discovered that it is just as pleasurable to travel in my own locality. Every day, either walking my children to the village school or exercising the dog, I see distinctive black-on-yellow 'WW' tags - for Wealdway - on stiles or gateposts, which explains why I found myself at Gravesend, Kent, recently. The Wealdway starts at the River Thames and ends on the chalk cliffs of Beachy Head overlooking the Channel at Eastbourne. In between you have 80 miles, mostly on public footpaths, of some of England's most varied scenery  -wind-swept heathered heath, lush meadows beside meandering rivers, mature oak and beech woodland, and grasslands. And a history and land-use of equal variety. The Wealdway takes you past neolithic burial chambers, through vineyards and hop gardens and pick-your-own fields of strawberries and runner beans, at times following a Roman road, to Saxon hamlets and Norman churches. It crosses farmland with serried fruit trees carefully tended or paddocks where racehorses stand at stud, skirting Elizabethan iron foundries and Georgian homes. Eventually it leads to the sea, where you may look out over one of the world's busiest shipping lanes towards France, just over the horizon. This corner of the British isles, pointing to Europe and, only 8,000 years ago, joined to it, has been the entrance-way through which passed the main peoples and armies and trade that have shaped Britain over the centuries. From Europe came hunters and farmers who could work bronze and iron. They were followed by the legions of Rome, the Jutes under Hengist and Horsa, the Angles and Saxons. Then came the Norman knights led by William who landed at Pevensey, just east of Eastbourne, and later the Flemish weavers. The Wealdway is a hike through history with surprises along the way. One of the first is the memorial to Princess Pocohontas Rebecca Rolfe in St George's church, overlooking the grey Thames at Gravesend. Daughter of the Algonquin Indian chief Powhatan, she was taken hostage in 1612 by the English settlers who had founded the colony of South Virginia. They hoped to ransom her in exchange for eight settlers held by Powhatan. Her gentle disposition endeared her to the colonists. She was taught English, converted to Christianity and fell in love with a man called John Rolfe, whom she married in 1614; they sailed for England in 1616. In the churchyard of St George's is a bronze statue of Pocohontas, a replica of the one in Jamestown given by the people of Virginia in 1957, the 350th anniversary of the founding of the colony. On the outskirts of Gravesend the first of numerous Wealdway signs can be seen on a stile beside the Tollgate Moat House, just south of the A2 road. The first few miles are over the North Downs. You are on chalk. The fields are wide and the soils light with pieces of flint. A hard stone, it was indispensable to the earliest settlers of this upland area. If the land has been recently ploughed, you will have no problem finding flint, a lump of which makes an unusual paperweight. Soon you descend the scarp of the downs. Impenetrable blackthorn keeps you on the steep track. At the foot of the slope are the Coldrum Stones; they are what is left of a 90ft-long burial chamber, thought to be the family vault of a chieftain who lived in the New Stone Age (2,500BC-3,000BC). It is similar to tombs in Germany and Holland and could have been erected by invaders from those areas who followed ancient tracks along, or at the foot of, the chalk uplands. Pressing on towards the River Medway, you enter the Garden of England - acre after acre of apple, pear, plum and cherry trees. Richard Harrys, 'fruiter' to Henry VIII, was the yeoman who first established the growing of fruit in Kent. In 1533 he bought a farm and 'with great care and no small labour brought from beyond the seas the sweet cherry, the temperate pippin and the golden reinette'. Continuing through Tonbridge, Bidborough and Speldhurst, the Wealdway leaves behind the busy, intensively-farmed land on the clay soils. Gaining height by undulations, passing through much more woodland with outcrops of sandstone, you approach Ashdown forest, at 732ft the highest point on the Wealdway. This is all that remains of the great forest that the Romans called Sylva Anderida, which formerly covered much of the Weald. With its obstinate clay, general dampness and thick forest, Anderida might have been skirted by the practical Romans. But they hacked a highway through the middle of the Weald  -there is a section of it still to be seen beside the Wealdway at Camp Hill in Ashdown forest - because they wanted the iron ore which was found there in abundance. The Weald iron smelting industry went into decline after the Romans left Britain, but was revived in Elizabethan times. At Buxted, on the Wealdway, an ironmaster named Ralph Hogg cast the first English cannon in one piece in 1543. Weald cannons blasted the armada of Spanish galleons that came up the Channel in 1588. Some of the fine houses you see along this section of the Wealdway (Hendall Manor, Hogg House, Tickerage Mill) were built with the profits from iron, and many of the ponds are 'hammer ponds', streams dammed to turn water-wheels which drove huge bellows and hammers that smelted and forged the ore into iron. At the southern end of the Wealdway you come once again to chalk downland. The trail goes right up to the feet of the Long Man of Wilmington, a huge figure - at 230ft the largest in Europe - human but sexless, cut into the north-facing scarp, 'looking naked towards the shires'. Its origins remain a mystery. An Iron Age fertility god? The work of the monks from the nearby priory in medieval times? An 18th century squire playing a joke on the archaeologists? It is just one more surprise on the Wealdway. The Wealdway is marked with distinctive tags on gates, stiles and posts. It can be walked in all seasons although Ashdown forest can be bleak in winter. It is probably best in spring and early summer when the flowers are at their best, or in October and November, when the colours can be spectacular. After rain, sections of it can get very sticky. Light-weight hiking boots with good ankle support are recommended, and it is a good idea to take a small back-pack for snacks, a change of clothes and rain-gear. There are a number of guides to the Wealdway. Constable publishes A Guide to the Wealdway by John Mason (Pounds 6.95). It includes much useful information such as opening times for shops, castles and museums, early closing days (usually Wednesdays and Saturdays) for post offices, pubs that offer accommodation and/or food, and details of public transport. The Ramblers' Association, Kent and Sussex area (11 Old London Road, Brighton, Sussex BN1 8XR, tel: 0273-883306) publishes a slimmer guide which you can slip into your pocket when walking (Pounds 3.50) and a list of Wealdway accommodation and transport services which it updates periodically (Pounds 1). Both guides have their own long-distance footpath maps drawn in sections, but the Ordnance Survey Landranger 1:50,000 maps are recommended to place the Wealdway in relation to surrounding countryside, and to enable you to pre-plan detours to historic sites or villages. The Wealdway is marked on the OS maps; you will need sheet numbers 177, 188, 198 and 199, obtainable from Stanfords, Map Centre, 12-14 Long Acre, London WC2. The easiest way to get to Gravesend from London is to take one of the frequent British Rail trains from Charing Cross. From Eastbourne, there are hourly trains back to London. If you do not want to walk the whole distance, the Wealdway is never far from a bus stop or train station that will get you back to civilisation. Allow at least four days to walk the Wealdway non-stop, or else plan to do the hike over a number of weekends.</p>

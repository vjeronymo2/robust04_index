The Cambodian government should be responsible for foreign  investors, including Thais, Amnuai said. It is common for  foreign investors to be involved in unlawful business in other  countries, he said.    The government has warned Thai business people not to engage  in illegal activities in foreign countries, and only a few Thais  were allegedly involved in such activity, he said. "Every  country has such a problem, which is solvable," Amnuai said.    Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said over the weekend  that a handful of foreign investors, including Thais, have  well-established mafia-type links and were deeply involved in  money laundering and drug trafficking activities in that country.</p>

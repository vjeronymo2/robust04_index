			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Rise in consumer borrowing but retail sales show decline The upward trend in consumer borrowing was boosted further in December, suggesting that the tax increases set out in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget had little early impact on demand. Lending to consumers by finance houses, through unsecured loans from building societies and through bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems rose by a net seasonally adjusted Pounds 443m in the month, up from Pounds 290m in November. The Central Statistical Office said that, apart from a high September figure, December's rise was the strongest since January 1990. New credit advanced to consumers in December was Pounds 4.98bn, just Pounds 4m more than in November, but a record monthly high. Finance houses boosted their net lending to Pounds 398m in December, the highest figure for five years, as spending on vehicles and consumer durables grew. There were small increases in net lending by building societies and on bank credit cards. Analysts were surprised by the strength of consumer borrowing. The City expected a net lending figure nearer Pounds 290m. The rise was in the face of a disappointing drop in retail sales of 0.2 per cent in December, but most analysts believe the trend is still upwards. Other figures published yesterday added to the picture of continued economic growth. Housing starts rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.7 per cent in the three months to December over the previous three months. A survey by the accountancy firm Touche Ross showed that business failures in January were at their lowest level since December 1989. The Treasury said the credit figures were consistent with the upward trend in consumer spending over the past year and a half. Officials said net lending in the three months to December was at levels last seen before the recession. In the three months to December, net lending rose to Pounds 1.05bn from Pounds 919m in the previous three months. However, more comprehensive net lending figures, which include bank overdrafts and personal loans, showed a drop in the fourth quarter of 1993 to Pounds 634m from Pounds 714m previously.

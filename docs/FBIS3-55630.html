NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, while noting that for 11 days Russia  has  had no parliament at all, points out that by the beginning of  the session the deputies' factions in the State Duma have failed  to reach agreement on important questions, despite numerous  talkfests.    "As far as the Federation Council session, opening here on  Tuesday, is concerned, one can suppose that a struggle for  leading positions in it will be no less tough than that in the  Duma."    TRUD on the Federal Assembly functioning:    "The legal life of the Federal Assembly begins today. Will  it be marked by an end to antagonism between branches of power  and by businesslike contacts between the parliament and the  government? It is only businesslike contacts that can bring  reassurance and future material wellbeing to the country".    PRAVDA on the first State Duma session:    "The first day of the session of the State Duma will be  decisive... Despite a certain played-up excitement, the general  impression is that the deputies want and are prepared to work  efficiently".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yuriy Baturin  who was recently appointed the first assistant to the president  of Russia on national security affairs.    Having pointed out that there are a lot of difficult tasks  in  this field, Baturin emphasised that "Russia's national security  existed before and is still being elaborated". His opinion is  that the concept "should be continuously modified in response to  changing conditions. In our days, conditions change fast".    TRUD runs an interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy  director of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS)  which was founded by a presidential decree.    Stepashin dwelt on how the newly-established service differs  from the old one and singled out six main tasks of the FCIS, the  first among them being "to expose, prevent and put a stop to  intelligence and subversive activities of foreign secret  services and organisations against Russia".    PRAVDA carries notes by Former Russian Parliament Speaker  Ruslan Khasbulatov. The notes, dated October 3, last year, are  headlined "Notes from the `White House'". Khasbulatov analyses  the situation in Russia after the August of 1991, expresses  considerations about "direct motives for the anti-state coup"  (as Khasbulatov describes the presidential decision to terminate  the functioning of the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's  Deputies -- note by ITAR- TASS), and criticises President Boris  Yeltsin's policy, the kingpin of which, as Khasbulatov  maintains, is "antagonism and confrontation"    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Ramiz Rizayev,  Azerbaijan's plenipotentiary representative in Russia, who  denied information that Afghan mojahedin take part in combat  operations on Azerbaijan's side in the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.    In SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, Vladimir Isakov, former people's  deputy of Russia and one of the leaders of the National  Salvation Front, strongly criticises the current privatisation  policy. He believes that "everything seems to indicate that  privatisation in Russia will go down in history as an example of  unprecedented and shocking social hypocrisy".    PRAVDA on President Clinton's forthcoming visit to Moscow:    "The U.S. delegation again has in its bag more pieces of  advice and political declarations than specific economic  programs, and, most importantly, funds for their realisation".</p>

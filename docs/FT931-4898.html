			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO cuts estimate of tropical forest loss THE UN's Food and Agriculture organisation has reduced its estimate of the rate at which tropical forests were being cut down in the 1980s. But it still puts the annual loss at a much higher level than at the start of the decade. The FAO's new estimate of 15.4m hectares a year is down from the interim figure of 16.9m ha presented to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, but well above the 11.4m ha of 1980. It now estimates that the area lost between 1981 and 1990 was 154m ha, leaving 1.75bn ha, or 37 per cent of the planet, covered in tropical forest. Most of the loss is attributed to population growth and rural poverty, resulting in land clearance for agriculture. The organisation estimates that at least 10m ha a year will have to be cleared for agriculture because of population pressures up to the year 2050. Worldwide re-afforestation is put at only 18m ha for the whole of the 1980s. In Europe the forested area is put at 149m ha, up from 137m ha in 1980.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS: HALF-MOON DESIGNS, PIZZAS THAT SHINE: MEZZALUNA  </P> <P> Flavor of the Month among the new Italian imports is Mezzaluna, a New York  franchise with Beverly Hills connections.  </P> <P> It seems that Aldo Bozzi, owner of the original Mezzaluna in New York, has  franchises in Aspen and Beverly Hills in conjunction with a couple of Lebanese  partners. Now along comes Bozzi's friend and countryman, Romano Molfetta, who  disclaims affiliation with the Aspen and Beverly Hills locations but insists he  is running an offshoot of the main restaurant in The Apple itself. Very  confusing.  </P> <P> Especially when it becomes obvious that this location in Corona del Mar is just  like the other three: a lively bar, a cafe with designer trimmings and a  slightly specious theme. All the restaurants are dominated by a colorful series  of framed prints done by various artists and illustrators which pay homage to  the mezzaluna, or half-moon in Italian.  </P> <P> This is a play on words. Mezzaluna means not only a fraction of the lunar disk  but, more colloquially, a crescent-shaped chopper with wooden handles on each  end, an indispensable tool for any Italian housewife. The restaurant has gone  off the deep end a bit with this theme, even going so far as to put smiling  half moon logos on all the menus and plates. It's as if the "have a nice day"  thing had gone Mediterranean or something. Sheesh.  </P> <P> Despite the trumped-up theme, though, I like the place. I wish I could say  Molfetta had a resounding success on his hands, in fact, but up to now his  reception has been rather lukewarm. Oh, there are certainly enthusiastic swarms  of young Italians coming for the authentic pastas, not to mention a mysterious  looking late night crowd wearing the latest fashions from Soho and Milan. But  the locals just don't seem to get it.  </P> <P> I can guess why. In Mezzaluna's noisy main dining room, you sit at  marble-topped tables too close together for comfort, shifting about on wooden  chairs that feel harder with each passing course. Downstairs, in a cozy,  semiprivate room, you watch foccaccia and pizzas being shoveled in and out of a  yellow tile oven while sitting at long tables that look almost medieval in the  ochre light.  </P> <P> In short, there's plenty of style but very little comfort in this restaurant.  And this is certainly not Soho. Or Milan.  </P> <P> But the menu is attractive enough, providing your taste runs to designer  pizzas, Italian dishes you need a Berlitz course to pronounce or original stuff  such as goose carpaccio and coffee zabaglione. You'll be tempted to start with  something from the lengthy appetizer list, but move cautiously. Most of them  are just decoys.  </P> <P> The real target here is a mouthful: carpaccio di prosciutto d'oca parmigiano e  olio tartufato. It's thin sliced goose topped with parmesan and truffled oil,  and you simply cannot get enough of it. When you taste its delicate, lingering  flavor, you may never be satisfied with beef as the main ingredient for this  dish again. I ordered it all three times I ate in the restaurant, which I'm  really not supposed to do. Don't spread it around.  </P> <P> Other good appetizers are vitello tonnato, a credible version of the Tuscan  classic consisting of cold roast veal in an unctuous tuna sauce, and a  marinated dish of shrimps, beans and celery called insalata di gamberetti. The  other cold appetizers, I'm afraid, just left me cold.  </P> <P> But really, it's time to hurry on to the thin-crust pizzas and first-rate  pastas. They are the most consistent courses in this restaurant.  </P> <P> Pizza con scamorza e radicchio is my personal favorite, a crisp pie oozing  smoked mozzarella that is redolent of bittersweet radicchio -- a soaring  combination. Pizza pugliese, with sweet onion and pecorino cheese, is another  exotic winner, and the more mundane pizza Margherita, with fresh basil and  tomato, its humble equal.  </P> <P> Pastas are made fresh daily, and cooked strictly al dente, with a variety of  sauces that compromise little to the American palate. Maccheroni integrali is  an all-wheat pasta with a muscular bite, flavored strongly with olive puree,  capers and tomato. Rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta is the kind of pasta dish  that you dream about, a wonderfully soft version with an almost fluffy texture.  But black linguine in spicy sauce seemed just plain tired, a gummy rendition  with a generic, undefined sauce.  </P> <P> This is not a restaurant where main courses are emphasized, and in fact the  menu lists just five. All look appealing, but if you only choose one than make  it the misto griglia, a seafood mixed grill consisting of slices of salmon, sea  bass and swordfish blanketed with a tomato and olive concasse. It is executed  to near perfection.  </P> <P> There is a large and somewhat contrived dessert list which is a hit-or-miss  proposition. The simpler ones, such as the caramelized upside down pear tart  and the biscotti with vino santo, hit. Others, like a positively weird coffee  zabaglione and a misplaced melon mousse with kiwi sauce, miss.  </P> <P> The service is erratic, too, despite Signore Molfetta's efforts to be a  gracious host. (He often treats his customers to shots of grappa at the bar.)  One evening, I had a highly solicitous waiter who hailed from somewhere in  Sicily. On another, I got stuck with someone who looked and sounded totally  perplexed throughout the evening. Maybe there was a full moon that night.  </P> <P> Mezzaluna is moderately expensive. Antipasti are $6.50 to $12. Primi piatti are  $5 to 14. Griglia are $14 to $20. There is a very pleasant wine list with some  excellent, low-priced Italian wines. Among the whites, try a bone-dry Arneis  Ceretto for $27. Among the reds, enjoy the eminently drinkable Dolcetto d'Alba  from Bruno Giacosa at $21.  </P> <P> MEZZALUNA  </P> <P> 2441 E. Coast Hwy., Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> (714) 675-2004.  </P> <P> Open for lunch Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.; for dinner daily, 5  to midnight  </P> <P> American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted.  </P></p>

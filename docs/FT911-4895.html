			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Money Markets: No tightening yet THERE WAS no indication of further tightening by the German Bundesbank when it set the terms for this week's securities repurchase agreement tender. The central bank tightened a notch last week, when offering one-month money at a fixed 8.60 per cent, compared with 8.50 previously, but yesterday the Bundesbank renewed its offer of 28-day funds at 8.60 per cent. This led observers to believe that a rise in official rates at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting is unlikely. At this week's tender banks are invited to bid for one-month fixed rate money and for 63-day funds at variable bid rates. This will be required to replace a total of DM25.1bn draining from the money market today as two earlier facilities expire. Call money was slightly firmer in Frankfurt, rising to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent. In London wholesale interest rates were little changed. Three-month sterling interbank was unchanged at 11 29/32 -11 27/32 per cent and 12-month money was steady at 11 1/2 -11 3/8 per cent. Short sterling futures also showed little movement on Liffe. June opened weaker at 88.64 and touched a low of 88.63, before closing at 88.66 compared with 88.67 previously. This discounts a three-month interbank cash rate of 11 11/32 at delivery. On the cash market the Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 600m, but revised this to Pounds 700m during the morning and to Pounds 650m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 498m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 323m bills outright, by way of Pounds 4m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 319m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 175m bank bills were purchased in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 254m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 510m. These outweighed a fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 90m to liquidity and bank balances below target of Pounds 75m. In Paris the Bank of France left its money market intervention rate at 9 per cent and the five to 10-day repurchase rate at 10 per cent when adding liquidity to the banking system via a securities repurchase tender.</p>

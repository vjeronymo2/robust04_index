			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The House of Representatives  budget committee, overriding the ruling coalition's opposition,  decided Tuesday [7 June] night that there should be a unanimous  decision on Diet testimony by former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa for his questionable personal finances.    Parliamentary sources said the opposition camp, led by the  Liberal Democratic Party, pushed for a Hosokawa testimony,  encouraged by budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi.    Yamaguchi, a Social Democratic Party member, proposed that  both the ruling coalition parties and opposition parties should  decide unanimously on whether or not Hosokawa testifies before  the Diet about his personal finances, an issue which drove him  out of power in April.    Yamaguchi said the Hosokawa issue should be determined after  testimony by Hosokawa's former secretary Masatoshi Miyama, who  the opposition camp alleged has a good grasp of the former  premier's monetary affairs.</p>

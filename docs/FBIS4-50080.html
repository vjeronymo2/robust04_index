			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] In a show of force triggering memories of the  Tiananmen Square massacre, six People's Liberation Army trucks  roared through Beijing's centre yesterday. The convoy of  trucks, each carrying about 50 soldiers from the Beijing  Military Region, was indicative of the Army's heightened profile  around the capital ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4  massacre.    Troop trucks and other army vehicles have been sighted in  increasing numbers over the past two weeks, particularly in  Beijing's northwestern university district, but yesterday's  daylight procession past the China World Trade Centre was  perhaps the most blatant demonstration of the military's  presence so far. "They did not seem to be armed but it was  still a little scary," said an office worker at the World Trade  Centre who watched the convoy pass. "I hadn't seen anything like  that since 1989. It was weird."    But despite the Army's higher profile, military analysts  said  there was little to suggest that troop numbers actually had  increased in the capital over the past few months. The Army  maintains about 50,000 troops in the Beijing Municipal District.    Likewise, the People's Armed Police (PAP), which has between  30,000 and 50,000 officers in Beijing, does not appear to have  acquired reinforcements in the past couple of months. "I think  they are just trying to let the people know they are there and  that no one should try anything stupid in the run-up to the  (June 4) anniversary," a Western military attache said. "The  number of military and PAP troops in Beijing at the moment  should be enough to handle any disturbance.</p>

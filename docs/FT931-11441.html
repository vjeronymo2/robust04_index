			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt's hopes of breakthrough recede THE STRENGTH of the dollar had less of an impact on senior bourses yesterday than it did on Monday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's hopes of breaking up through 1,600 on the DAX index receded as carmakers fell, an attempt to boost Siemens ran out of impetus, and some profit-taking set in. Turnover remained subdued as the DAX closed 2.07 lower at 1,583.09. Siemens stood out with heavy volume, closing DM2.40 higher at DM606.50 after DM609. Carmakers eased as traders accepted that the fundamentals were against their recent rally. Daimler dropped DM2 to DM582.50, BMW DM5.80 to DM499 and Volkswagen DM1.80 to DM282.70, but dealers said that their losses were higher compared to Monday's strong post-bourse close on the IBIS screen trading system. PARIS ended marginally higher with a strong feature in Matra-Hachette after an upbeat presentation from its chairman, M Jean-Luc Lagardere. The market failed to hold an early rise above 1,800, which traders see as a firm ceiling. The CAC-40 index closed up 1.41 higher at 1,787.31 although turnover was more active than on Monday, at FFr2.37bn. M Lagardere's media and defence group rose FFr1.50 to FFr98.50 after he forecast 1993 profits substantially higher than those of 1992, and average profits growth of 30 per cent in the period 1993-96, with turnover gaining 5 per cent a year over that time. Auto industry stocks suffered after a 36.8 per cent drop in French car sales for January. Peugeot lost FFr3 at FFr567 but the tyremaker, Michelin, fell FFr3.40 to FFr187.10 and St Gobain, the glassmaker, by FFr13.50 to FFr484. AMSTERDAM focused on Daf, whose shares were suspended as the loss-making truckmaker filed for protection from creditors. The shares will resume trading today but sector analysts believe that they will slide sharply from the Fl 4.55 quoted at Monday's close. Overall, the market was mixed in slow trading which saw the CBS Tendency index 0.4 lower at 98.0. The Daf suspension spilled over into the financial sector. ABN Amro eased 40 cents to Fl 51.70 as as investors assessed its exposure to Daf. The bank, which is DAF's main creditor, also holds an 8.24 per cent stake. However, ING, which holds 10.36 per cent of the Daf shares, edged 10 cents ahead to Fl 58.40. Ahold, the retailer, added Fl 1.70 to Fl 92.00 as the market digested its expansion plans in Portugal and a statement from Mr Cees van der Hoeven, who becomes chairman on March 1, that the company will continue to seek large stakes in other US and European supermarket operators. MILAN was in a more positive mood with the news that the Socialist Party had pledged full support for the administration of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. The Comit index rose 4.10 to 491.56. Heavy speculative activity in insurance issues was attributed both to the imminent creation of pension funds and a view that the weekend death of the Fondiaria president, Mr Camillo De Benedetti, could spark a big reshuffle in the sector. Fondiaria rose L256 to L28,033 ahead of a statement by the chairman of AGF, the French state-controlled insurer, that it would not be buying the Italian group's 20 per cent stake in AMB, the German insurer, because it was too costly. However, analysts noted that Mr Michel Albert left the door open for further talks, telling shareholders: 'There is a price below which we could buy.' ZURICH closed narrowly mixed in moderate turnover, the SMI index ending 2.0 lower at 2,118.7 Banks saw SBC bearers SFr3 firmer at SFr330 ahead of the announcement of higher parent company profits in 1992 and an unchanged dividend. MADRID was boosted by foreign interest in the Spanish bond market, and expectations of a cut in three-month and six-month Treasury bill yields at today's auction may also have boosted equities as the general index closed 4.26 higher at 233.98. Volume was strong at around Pta25.5bn, almost Pta10bn of which was accounted for by put-throughs and block trades. ISTANBUL hit a new 12 month high, the market index putting on 196.74, or 4.3 per cent to 4,748.11, up 10.9 per cent over the past three days. Turkish equities saw heavy buying by banks and brokerages, buoyed by the banks' plans to set up mutual funds with an equity content, and by strong expectations for lower January inflation and bond auction rates this week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FEBRUARY 2                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open       10.30      11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1090.54     1091.57    1090.29   1089.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1161.43     1161.31    1159.28   1156.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00       14.00      15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1087.56     1089.13    1090.10   1089.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1157.51     1156.59    1157.24   1155.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 1    Jan 29    Jan 28    Jan 27    Jan 26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1088.01   1079.18   1072.70   1072.28   1084.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1158.83   1148.15   1148.06   1147.45   1156.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 -  1091.77; 200 -  1163.55 Low/day: 100 -  1087.56  200 -  1155.36  .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

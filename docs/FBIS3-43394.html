			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front, AVF] leader  General Constand Viljoen says the establishment of a national  peacekeeping force is only a political requirement and a waste  of taxpayers' money. The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC]  subcouncil on defense yesterday said the 10,000-strong force  would be deployed in election hot-spots by the end of March.    The AVF leader has reiterated that his organization rejects  all TEC structures as a waste of taxpayers' money and energy,  because he says they try to solve South Africa's problems in a  one-sided manner. Viljoen says the country's police and defense  force's command structure should not be tampered with, because  they stand [word indistinct].    Meanwhile, the Conservative Party [CP] says it won't  recognize the authority of the command structure of the national  peace-keeping force or joint defense force. CP deputy leader  Willie Snyman says the peace-keeping force will fall under the  complete control of the TEC's subcouncil on defense and Snyman  says the TEC, which is the product of multiparty talks, is  nothing but a seizure of power by communist terrorists. He says  therefore the CP does not recognize the powers of the TEC and  the powers and actions of the comnmand structure of the national  peace keeping force.</p>

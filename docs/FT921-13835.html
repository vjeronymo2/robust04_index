			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Kinnock gambles on the numbers game: Philip Stephens on the electoral impact of Labour's National Insurance proposals IF ANYTHING more was needed to explain the anxiety of the Labour leadership over the election impact of its planned abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions it was provided yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The independent think tank with a reputation for rigorous and unbiased analysis of taxation published figures showing that 20 per cent of households in London and 18 per cent in the south-east would pay more if the present Pounds 20,280 ceiling were abolished. That means one in five households would pay higher National Insurance contributions in the swathe of marginal seats in those areas on which the outcome of the election will to a large degree depend. Across the country as a whole the figure is 11.8 per cent, while it falls sharply in the north to about 8 per cent. The proportion of taxpayers affected, however, would be higher as the institute's figures include households - such as those with pensioners and those on benefit - which do not pay National Insurance contributions. Other experts say that if those households were excluded the proportion of losers in London would be closer to 30 per cent. As the tables show, there is good as well as bad news for Labour in the report. It shows that if the party's planned increases in child benefit, pensions and related means-tested benefits are netted out against the abolition of the contributions ceiling there are many more winners than losers. Because the additional money from abolition of the contributions ceiling is raised from a relatively small number of people while increases in child benefits and pensions would affect many more, the institute calculates that in net terms 8.7 per cent would lose from the Labour package while 46 per cent would gain. Those figures almost certainly overstate the number of gainers because they exclude the self-employed. But there is no doubt that Labour has a powerful case for saying that more would win than lose under the whole package. Its problem, however, is that voters tend to be convinced that politicians will meet pledges to raise taxes, but they are less persuaded that the same politicians will deliver on offsetting promises. As one leading opinion pollster said yesterday: 'People need no convincing that Labour will push up their taxes. They are much less certain that it will deliver on child benefit and pensions.' The overall figures for winners and losers also disguise some other weak spots for Mr Neil Kinnock. Even if in London more than twice as many households are shown as winners than losers, the question is: are they the right people? The gainers from higher child benefit and pensions are heavily concentrated among traditional Labour voters. If Mr Kinnock is to win he must attract support in the south-east from greater numbers of relatively affluent voters. The institute's breakdown by age of losers from the National Insurance contributions reform shows the largest segment concentrated in the 35 to 44 age group. About one-in-four are affected nationwide, with a much higher proportion in the key marginal seats in London and the south-east.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Effects of abolishing NI ceiling*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AGE RANGE            PER CENT            LOSING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Under 25                2 25-34                  13 35-44                  24 45-54                  16 55-59                  12 60-64                   3 Over 65                 0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *By age range of family head  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional effects of abolishing NI ceiling for employees and self-employed: Proportion of families losing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- REGION              PER CENT       FAMILIES IN                    LOSING         REGION (m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern England       8              1.8 Yorkshire              8              2.7 North-west             8              3.6 East Midlands         10              2.4 West Midlands         10              3.0 East Anglia           11              1.3 Greater London        20              3.5 South-east            18              5.6 South-west            10              2.7 Wales                  9              1.5 Scotland               9              2.8 Northern Ireland       8              0.5 UK Average            11.8           31.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regional effects of abolishing NI ceiling for employees but increasing pensions, child benefit and related benefits  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- REGION              PER CENT          PER CENT                     LOSING            GAINING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern England       7                50 Yorkshire              6                48 North-west             6                48 East Midlands          7                45 W Midlands             8                46 East Anglia            7                43 Greater London        15                38 South-east            13                45 South-west             7                48 Wales                  6                57 Scotland               7                48 Northern Ireland       6                58 UK average             8.7              46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COMPROMISES TO KEEP SUNSHINE CANYON OPERATING  </P> <P> Faced with the possible closure of the only city-owned dump, the Los Angeles  City Council unanimously agreed Wednesday to a compromise with operators of the  privately owned Sunshine Canyon Landfill that will help the facility remain  open for several more years.  </P> <P> City Council members said they had little choice but to agree to an operating  extension for the landfill, despite resistance by city zoning and planning  officials to the plan.  </P> <P> State-imposed limits on operations at the city's Lopez Canyon Landfill had  pushed city officials into a corner last week when they learned that the dump,  where two-thirds of the city's trash goes, may have to reduce operations or  shut down. Sunshine Canyon is a standby destination for some of those 4,000  tons of daily trash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Under the Gun'  </P> <P> "The city of Los Angeles is under the gun," said Councilwoman Joy Picus. "This  does help us meet our needs and give us time to plan for the future."  </P> <P> The compromise satisfied representatives of the landfill owner, Browning-Ferris  Industries, who had predicted at least a temporary closure of the San Fernando  Valley dump if the city refused to extend a December deadline for many changes  and improvements.  </P> <P> "This is something we can live with," said attorney Christopher Funk, who  represented Browning-Ferris.  </P> <P> The key to the compromise was a six-month extension of the deadline -- from  December, 1989, to June, 1990 -- for Browning-Ferris to move its trash disposal  to a northern area of the dump, away from homes in neighboring Granada Hills,  as required last year by the city zoning administrator's office. The extension  will be reviewed monthly by the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Necessary Permits  </P> <P> Funk said the extra time is needed to apply for the necessary city, county,  state and other permits and to prepare the northern area.  </P> <P> For the dump to remain open through the end of its 1991 permit, the company  still must comply with other requirements by December, including applying for  permission to keep the height of the dump at 1,724 feet and keeping litter and  dust out of residential areas.  </P> <P> Landfill opponents said the timing favored Browning-Ferris, which during the  past year had consistently encountered resistance to its requests from various  city boards and commissions. "The feeling I get is we didn't completely win,  but we got a little bit," said Mariko Gueringer, an opponent of the dump who  lives a mile from the landfill.  </P> <P> Several homeowners said they fear that the compromise paves the way for future  Sunshine Canyon expansion onto county land owned by Browning-Ferris. Funk, the  company's attorney, said the dump could remain open up to 35 more years if that  expansion ultimately is allowed.  </P> <P> But Councilman Hal Bernson, who proposed the compromise even though he  ultimately wants to see the dump closed, said Wednesday's outcome could have  been much worse for landfill opponents. Originally Browning-Ferris had appealed  the zoning administrator's entire ruling, saying the company should not have to  comply with any of the restrictions.  </P> <P> "There was a good opportunity to lose this whole thing, in light of Lopez,"  Bernson said.  </P> <P> Opponents also complained that they were outgunned by lobbyists hired by  Browning-Ferris, who have been manning phone banks to generate community  support and meeting with council members for more than a year.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a few hundred dollars versus quite a few thousand  dollars," said Don Mullally, a Sierra Club member and Granada Hills resident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buttons and Stickers  </P> <P> During the council meeting, about 50 people wore anti-Browning-Ferris buttons.  Most of them were Granada Hills residents and environmentalists.  </P> <P> A nearly equal number of landfill supporters filled the other side of the  council chambers wearing "YES Sunshine Canyon" stickers. They ranged from  Browning-Ferris attorneys to the dump's security guard and two women from  South-Central Los Angeles who said they feared that limiting the landfill would  increase illegal dumping in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Later, Browning-Ferris spokesman Mark Ryavec said the two women were among  those contacted by Browning-Ferris representatives during the company's  lobbying effort.  </P> <P> City action against Sunshine Canyon began in September, 1988, after Bernson  asked zoning officials to investigate neighbors' complaints, including those  about airborne dust and litter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Council Testimony  </P> <P> In testimony before the council Wednesday, company attorney Linda Bozung  suggested that zoning officials were unfairly influenced in their earlier  rulings by photographs supplied by the community, supposedly showing clouds of  dust from the dump.  </P> <P> She described the photos as out of focus and out of date. "They show what can  very well be haze," Bozung said.  </P> <P> But Mullally, who works as senior gardener at nearby O'Melveny Park, said that  when winds blow off the Santa Susana Mountains, the park air is filled with  clouds of dust and "at times windblown trash comes down almost like a  snowstorm."  </P></p>

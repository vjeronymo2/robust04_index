			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "President Leghari's Visit and Pakistan-U.S. </F> Relations"]    [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that  the nation is unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and no  government can make any decision ignoring this consensus. He  said that Pakistan will not tolerate any unilateral pressure or  discriminatory treatment over its nuclear program. The  president was addressing a gathering of Pakistani  representatives of professional institutions of North America  and Canada in Rochester, New York. The president said that  Pakistan-U.S. relations are not confined to a single dimension;  they are multidimensional. He said that his talks with U.S.  authorities will cover all aspects.    Pakistan has been spelling out its position on the nuclear  program for years, especially since the U.S. Government stopped  economic and military aid four years ago on the pretext of the  Pressler Amendment and refused to deliver the F-16 planes which  were purchased by Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan tried to  convince the United States about the peaceful nature of its  nuclear program and clarified its stand at various levels that  not only is Pakistan's nuclear program peaceful, but the nation  is unanimous about it also. Moreover, Pakistan is ready to  implement any proposal on declaring the South Asian region a  nuclear-free zone which is also acceptable to India.    Despite these clarifications, Pakistan has so far failed to  persuade the U.S. Administration to stop enforcing the Pressler  Amendment. Of course, the success it has achieved is that the  United States is not pressuring Pakistan now to roll back its  nuclear program unilaterally. This is an important and positive  change in the U.S. attitude. However, the United States should  also admit that the Pressler Amendment cannot bring an end to  the arms race and halt attempts to manufacture nuclear weapons  in South Asia. Neither did implementing the law against Pakistan  prove helpful nor did it conform to the requirements of justice.  Similarly, the United States should also realize that the  people and various sections and circles in parliament are  unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and it is therefore  impossible to terminate the program by exerting pressure on the  government.    During his current visit, President Farooq Ahmad Leghari is  scheduled to hold extensive talks with U.S. authorities on a  number of issues other than Pakistan's nuclear program. It is  expected that our position will become clearer to the U.S.  Government as a result of these talks. We also hope that the  U.S. president will review the situation as a result of the  Pakistani president's talks and not only supply the F-16 planes,  but also stop making unjust and inequitable demands concerning  the nuclear program issue.    Our position is that our nuclear program is peaceful and is  presently in a frozen state. The United States is free to  verify if it wants, using technical means provided it does not  affect Pakistan's proclaimed nuclear program. It is hoped that  President Leghari's visit will enable Pakistan and the United  States to come closer to each other, boost the process of  understanding, and help remove the prevailing misunderstanding.  We also hope that the opposition will not become a victim of  unjustified misunderstanding, nor will it create an impression  which is contrary to reality.    As President Leghari has stated in recent interviews with  "JANG" and "THE NEWS," all centers of power in Pakistan are  sending the same hints and identical signals to the outside  world and it is clear that Pakistan's stand is being devised by  all centers of power jointly. Therefore, no one should have a  misunderstanding or apprehension that any particular individual  or circle can adopt or declare a unilateral stand on the nuclear  issue. The whole nation should remain satisfied that any  decision will be made with the consensus of all centers of power  and nothing will be accepted which is not in the national  interests.</p>

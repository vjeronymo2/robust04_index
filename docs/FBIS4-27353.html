			<p>CSO     [Text] Sony is being more thorough in the creation of  products that consider environmental problems such as ease of  recycling, centering on its domestic and overseas television  divisions. Previously, checks were made of the dismantling time  and recycling possibilities for each model in its domestic  Products Design Division, but beginning in April, it introduced  an environment inspection evaluation system with specific target  values, and also widened the scope to offices overseas. Manuals  targeted at Product Planning Division have also been newly  prepared and consideration of the environment is promoted  consistently from the planning stage. A recycling research  committee has also been established with an eye to the future  and they are putting together a guide with next spring as the  goal.    Checksheets for product design introduced by the company are  being prepared for each division such as television and audio.  For televisions, a total of nine items are checked: packing,  energy consumption, harmful substances, use of plastic, use of  recycled resources, reduction of resources used, product life,  dismantling time, and recycling possibility.    Previously, inspections were by the O-X checklist method,  but  beginning in April, a quantitative evaluation containing  specific target numbers was introduced. Combined with this,  overseas offices with design divisions have begun to use it..    Sony has prepared inspection manuals for product planning  divisions that are in charge of research and development. They  introduce an explanation of the laws and regulations on  recycling and what items the design divisions will be checking.  Explanations cite actual examples of products with consideration  of the environment.    The recycling research committee is comprised of head office  staff, centering on designers in the AV (audiovisual) Equipment  Division, and persons in charge of the FA [factory automation]  division. There are six to seven core members, and they are  promoting research on recycled resources and recycling such as  actually trying to disassemble discarded televisions from  various firms, with the goal of giving feedback to design.    Sony established an in-house global environment committee in  1990, and has promoted the undertaking of environment problems.</p>

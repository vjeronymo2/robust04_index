			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BUILDING BOOM TRIGGERS AN INITIATIVE TO LIMIT GROWTH  </P> <P> Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and clear mountain views,  fast-growing Seattle has become a metropolis with the usual smog and traffic  jams. Some people are starting to protest.  </P> <P> A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to limit the  height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is gearing up before a  vote on May 16.  </P> <P> The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in the last  decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and permit applications for  three more were submitted before a recently imposed six-month moratorium on  downtown growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buildings Top 50 Stories  </P> <P> The 55-story Washington Mutual Tower was completed last year, bumping the  50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No. 1 is the West Coast's  tallest building, the 76-story black-glass Columbia Seafirst Center built in  1985, before downtown zoning went into effect. A dozen office towers are 30  stories or more, and all but three were opened in the 1980s.  </P> <P> The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and shoppers, make  downtown Seattle a lively place.  </P> <P> Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants compete  shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place Market.  </P> <P> Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the downtown retail  core, with major flagship department stores and a variety of small businesses,  recently settled one 30-year-old land-use debate with the opening of Westlake  Center, a new mall of expensive shops and a 24-story office tower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern for Pollution  </P> <P> Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown Development, or CAP,  say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more pollution as more people commute  by car and more box-like apartment buildings replace single-family houses and  dilute the flavor of old city neighborhoods.  </P> <P> CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the office district.  New office floor space would be limited to 500,000 square feet a year for the  next five years and 1 million square feet a year from 1995 through 1999. After  that, the ceiling would be lifted unless re-imposed by the City Council.  </P> <P> By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office space is newly  completed, under construction or has received city permits, said Virginia  Galle, a City Council member and CAP supporter.  </P> <P> At the present rate of growth, in 10 years about 67,000 new office workers are  expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000 more car trips daily  into downtown, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formula for Size  </P> <P> There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A building's  size is worked out according to a formula based on the size of the site, with  extra height allowed in exchange for such amenities as plazas, retail space and  day-care centers.  </P> <P> CAP supporters insist that they want growth, but not at a high cost to the  environment and the neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense," says Patrick Strosahl, a  jeweler and president of Vision Seattle, which supports CAP. "We're really much  more into shaping growth so that it produces and accentuates the livability of  the city."  </P> <P> Some participants in the growth debate argue that the city needs controls that  are more lenient than the CAP initiative.  </P> <P> Mayor Charles Royer presented a plan of his own that would limit office towers  to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code, but not as much as CAP  would.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Encourage Height  </P> <P> Royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow developers to build  higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the bonuses from street-level  amenities to housing, human services and open space.  </P> <P> The Downtown Seattle Assn., a group of developers and business executives,  contends that the 1985 zoning law is strict enough.  </P> <P> John Gilmore, president of the association, says downtown growth makes more  sense than spreading development into neighborhoods and suburbs. A downtown  provides a focal point for a rapid-transit system, something Seattle needs, he  said. And Seattle must grow, he contended. "We're having children like every  other part of the country, and there's got to be jobs."  </P> <P> Folke Nyberg, a professor of urban planning and architecture at the University  of Washington, agreed that Seattle's location on the Pacific Rim means that it  will grow, but disagreed that concentrated downtown growth is good.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Physical Constraints'  </P> <P> Seattle has an "hourglass" figure, squeezed between Puget Sound and Lake  Washington, he said. "So there are some very limited physical constraints that  make it imperative that we have an effective transportation solution before we  allow growth to happen, and this was not done."  </P> <P> A better way to grow, Nyberg said, would be in decentralized clusters  throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would live near their  jobs and go to downtown Seattle mainly for conventions and cultural events.  </P> <P> Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality, traffic  congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of affordable housing, he  said.  </P> <P> Seattle, which "has been a very livable city," he said, failed to learn from  other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied: "It's all greed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prefers Hearings  </P> <P> Gilmore, of the Downtown Seattle Assn., said that the city's 1985 downtown  zoning was the product of four years of debate and that any changes should be  made through more hearings and City Council votes. The American Institute of  Architects' local chapter agrees.  </P> <P> CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely.  </P> <P> According to Strosahl, San Francisco needed to enact stiffer downtown limits in  1986 because it waited too long, until the cost of housing went way up and the  character of the city changed.  </P> <P> San Francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree in which 25  million square feet of office space was added between 1979 and 1984. The  high-rises nearly blocked out all the sun in San Francisco's financial  district.  </P> <P> San Francisco's voter-approved plan limits new office space to 475,000 square  feet for several years for a city with a population of 690,000. That compares  to CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet for five years and 1 million square feet  for the next five in a city of 490,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions Motives  </P> <P> Gilmore suggests that people who signed CAP did not really want to limit growth  but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown caused by construction  of a downtown bus tunnel and a state convention center. The initiative text was  long and complicated, and people probably did not read it, he said.  </P> <P> What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it needed.  </P> <P> Strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a highly  financed campaign against it.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Thatcher may have tried to skirt aid rules Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, appears to have tried to circumvent government rules on aid and arms sales by making separate references to offers of defence equipment and overseas aid in a letter sent to the Malaysian government in 1988. The letter, which was sent to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, confirmed that Britain would go ahead with a promised offer of aid that would eventually be used to build a dam on the Pergau river. But careful phrasing of the letter also assured him that Britain wanted to complete the sale of Pounds 1bn of defence equipment, without expressly linking the two issues. Details of the document were given yesterday to members of the Commons foreign affairs committee, which next week will cross-examine Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on Britain's decision in 1988 to offer nearly Pounds 300m of aid to help build the Pergau dam. The dam project has been described by government auditors as 'a very bad buy'. Labour MPs have accused ministers of breaking established guidelines on aid provision in order to secure a defence deal with the Kuala Lumpur government. In a statement made to the committee this week Mr Hurd acknowledged that the aid provision and defence sales were 'briefly linked' in a protocol in March 1988 on the sales of military equipment signed by Lord Younger, then defence secretary. A Foreign Office summary of the protocol was given to the committee yesterday. It says that the protocol contained a reference to a grant in support of non-military projects 'which should amount to no less than a specific value of the (defence) equipment'. In the months following the signing of the protocol, however, the government took furious measures to formally de-link the projects, while assuring Malaysia that both were going ahead. Lady Thatcher's letter of August 8 of that year was a critical assurance. A Foreign Office summary of the letter said that 'she was glad to be able to confirm the assurance that the British government had always given the Malaysian government that Pounds 70m of grant aid in association with Pounds 130m of ECGD cover would be available for civil projects'. But the summary continues: 'The prime minister said she looked forward to Dr Mahathir's visit to Britain in September 1988, when she hoped that the memorandum of understanding on the defence package could be signed.'</p>

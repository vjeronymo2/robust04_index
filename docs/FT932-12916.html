			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Court gives go-ahead to Marriott bond group A US court has declined to dismiss the fraud suit brought by certain bondholders of Marriott Corporation, against the hotel and food services group. The bondholder group is led by PPM America, the Chicago-based US fund management arm of Britain's Prudential insurance group. The controversy centres on Marriott's plan to demerge its financially-healthy lodging business, leaving behind a company which retains the property assets and the bulk of the group's large debts. The PPM-led bondholders alleged that Marriott sold them debt securities in the spring of 1992, when it knew of the plan. Marriott, which announced the plan last autumn, sought to have this suit dismissed. Judge Aexander Harvey, in the US district court in Maryland, denied to dismiss four counts of the complaint but dismissed a fifth count. This allows the PPM-led bondholders to go ahead with the pre-trial 'discovery' process.</p>

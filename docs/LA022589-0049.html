			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO WAS THAT MASKED MAN? ASK THE INS  </P> <P> The masked man appears wherever his people are suffering injustices, a crusade  that has taken him from the run-down tenements of Mexico City to the chambers  of the Mexican Congress and now, to the streets of Spanish-speaking Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The short and stocky man who calls himself Super Barrio came to California this  week to see for himself how things are going for his "brothers on this side of  the border." And on Friday, he learned firsthand about what some of his  compatriots consider the heavy hand of the immigration authorities.  </P> <P> The Mexican folk hero, who dons red tights, a flaming yellow cape and a bright  red mask to become the "defender of tenants and scourge of greedy landlords,"  was detained by agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service who  had received anonymous complaints that he was here illegally. The allegations,  the agency later acknowledged, turned out to be false.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hustled Away  </P> <P> As Super Barrio walked with his entourage near Union Station about 2 p.m., he  was handcuffed and hustled away by plainclothes INS agents. He was held for  more than 2 1/2 hours until his attorney, Antonio Rodriguez, met with INS Los  Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson and persuaded the official to  release him.  </P> <P> "I wasn't committing any crime, I just came here to talk and dialogue with  people," Super Barrio said after his release. "This has opened my eyes to the  situation lived not only by Mexicans, but by all foreigners in this country."  </P> <P> Before his run-in with authorities Friday, Super Barrio spent a busy week,  speaking before the Los Angeles City Council on behalf of men who solicit work  on street corners, meeting farm workers in Oxnard and homeless men who seek  shelter at a downtown church. He also found time to insult the Mexican consul,  whom he called an "accomplice" of abuses committed against immigrants at the  border.  </P> <P> Although Super Barrio disappeared soon after his release Friday, a San  Francisco publicist for his tour angrily said his detention was an act of  retribution for his pointed criticism of INS policies.  </P> <P> "He came here to talk about abuses on the border, about Mexican and poor  people's rights and why they don't have those rights," said the publicist, who  declined to be named. "That's why they detained him."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Telephoned Tips  </P> <P> Gustafson acknowledged that Super Barrio, whose true identity is a carefully  guarded secret, had the proper papers for his visit -- a visitor's visa that he  used to enter the United States on Feb. 19. Gustafson said that INS agents had  taken Super Barrio into custody because of "two or three" tips telephoned into  the agency over the last week.  </P> <P> "There were some calls regarding his status from various people anonymously,"  Gustafson said, adding: "I wish this guy had his documents on him at the time"  of his detention.  </P> <P> The masked man appears in Mexico City to aid people suffering injustices -- a  crusade that has taken him from the Mexican capital's run-down tenements to the  chambers of the National Congress and now, in his first visit across the  border, to the streets of Spanish-speaking Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There isn't any work in Mexico, so they come over here," Super Barrio said on  Thursday as he watched a group of Latino men soliciting work on Pico Boulevard.  "They've practically been driven into economic exile."  </P> <P> Wearing gold lame bikini briefs and with "SB" emblazoned across his chest,  Super Barrio inevitably drew a few laughs at some of his appearances. The  portly super hero is taken seriously in Mexico, however, where he has an impact  on urban politics.  </P> <P> Super Barrio is the symbol of the Assembly of Barrios, a movement of urban  slum-dwellers that has flourished since the September, 1985, earthquake  destroyed much of Mexico City's poor, inner-city neighborhoods. Modeled on "El  Santo," a popular wrestler, Super Barrio's exploits have since become the stuff  of legend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prevented Evictions  </P> <P> In Mexico City, he appears suddenly and unexpectedly when poor tenants are  about to be evicted from their homes and more than once he has prevented those  evictions from taking place. He took to the ring to wrestle and defeat a  mythical "Nuclear-saurus" during protests against a nuclear power plant in  Veracruz, and he has been invited to attend meetings at Los Pinos, the Mexican  equivalent of the White House.  </P> <P> Unaware of his wide-ranging exploits, some council members smirked and laughed  out loud when Super Barrio arrived at the chambers of the Los Angeles City  Council on Wednesday to speak on behalf of immigrant day laborers.  </P> <P> But the costumed super hero strode with dignity down the marble-lined aisles of  the chamber, his long yellow cape flowing behind him. At the podium, he made a  short but impassioned speech.  </P> <P> "Work is one of the fundamental rights of life," he told the council, which was  considering an ordinance that would have made it illegal for the immigrant  workers to solicit work on street corners. "We are not delinquents, we are  workers and we want to be treated like human beings."  </P> <P> The council members were impressed enough that they quickly drew up a  commendation and presented it to the costumed hero after the meeting.  </P> <P> "I thought he was amazing," said Marjorie Bray, coordinator of the Deparment of  Latin American Studies at Cal State Los Angeles, where Super Barrio spoke  Wednesday. "He had a theoretical grasp of what he was doing, but his language  was very clear and down-to-earth."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Idea Behind Costume  </P> <P> Before his detention, he gave a relaxed interview in the home of a Westlake  family, his home during his stay in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The idea behind the costume, Super Barrio explained, is to capture the  imagination of Mexico's poor, working people by using the symbols of popular  culture to deliver a "social message."  </P> <P> "In the ring and in the movies, the wrestlers fight against false enemies --  mummies, vampires, ghosts, whatever. I decided to step out of the ring and  fight against the real enemies, the landlords and the corrupt politicians," he  said, in costume and masked, as always.  </P> <P> Little is known about the real man behind the mask. He has revealed that he has  a wife and family, and that he lives, like the people he represents, in a  dilapidated apartment building in downtown Mexico City. He said he was once  part of Mexico City's large army of street vendors, hawking trinkets, candy and  cigarettes to earn a living.  </P> <P> Even after his detention Friday, his identity remained a mystery. "I've seen  several different names," Gustafson said. "And I can't remember any of them."  </P> <P> Super Barrio says his anonymity serves a purpose.  </P> <P> "When we are united we are strong," he said. "If we are divided and dispersed  then I'm not strong, we're not strong. The mask represents the idea that our  struggle is a collective one, that it doesn't belong to one individual.  </P> <P> "Superman doesn't wear a mask," he continued. "All of his victories belong to  him, they are his. I try to be the opposite of that."  </P> <P> The masked hero's last day in Southern California started out with an  appearance at the House of Ruth, an East Los Angeles shelter for homeless  Latina women, and a second stop at the Mexican Consulate, where a small group  of people were protesting the results of last year's presidential elections in  Mexico.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Facing INS Agents  </P> <P> As he and his entourage walked to their car, Super Barrio found himself facing  the INS agents. It was only his latest hair-raising encounter with authorities.  </P> <P> Super Barrio laughed when he recalled an impromptu wrestling match he had with  the governor of the state of Jalisco. The super hero was delivering a speech  calling for housing reform and the governor, Super Barrio said, attempted to  remove his mask.  </P> <P> "Luckily, the people came to help me and nothing happened," he said. "There are  many functionaries who don't understand the symbols of the people. What would  they win by unmasking me? Super Barrio is everyone."  </P></p>

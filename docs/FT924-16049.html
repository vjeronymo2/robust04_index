			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An impeachable source for TV promotions - The growing cult of 'opportunity advertising' in Brazil 'And how do you explain all these assets?' demands the stern-faced interrogator, one of a bench of men looking down sceptically at the nervous witness. To Brazilians, the scene is familiar, recalling the much televised inquiry into government corruption which resulted in a congressional vote on Tuesday in favour of impeaching President Fernando Collor. But this 30-second scene on peak-time TV has a twist. 'I made it with Banco Boavista', says the witness. 'Honestly it's the best way to make money.' This is the most visible example of what Brazilian advertisers call 'opportunity advertising' - taking advantage of a news event to promote a product. Currently the most popular themes in advertising in Brazil - government corruption and the impeachment of the president - are being used to sell everything from bank accounts and language classes to stockings and amusement parks. The rush by merchandisers to out-do rivals is giving the Brazilian advertising industry a new boom during otherwise lean times. The first agency to seize on the theme was W/Brasil. Back in May when the corruption allegations were first laid against Collor by his younger brother, Pedro - forcing the family matriarch, Dona Leda, to intervene  - Washington Olivetto, who runs W/Brasil, could not resist the opportunity. Within days he produced an advertisement for a video game which ran: 'Dona Leda. Give a Mastersystem to the boys and stop them squabbling.' He explains: 'The opportunity ad is something we use a lot. We want our ads to be as up-to-date as the news. In Brazil, this means we have to react very fast because things change so quickly.' Other agencies soon caught on to the idea, particularly as the fraternal feud and subsequent corruption inquiry reached soap opera proportions. One of the most common references in marketing slogans has been to the so-called 'phantom' bank accounts, allegedly used to transfer money to the president from the scheme's front man, Paulo Cesar Farias, known as PC. 'Come and meet the phantoms of PC, the best loved in Brazil. Playcentre, the PC which admits to its phantoms.' This advertisement for an amusement park was so successful that on a recent Saturday, it attracted 22,000 children and had to close its doors because it was full. Even Pedro Collor's glamorous wife, Maria Thereza, has been involved since she rose to fame defending her husband against allegations that he was mentally imbalanced. Nastrotec has seen a 20 per cent increase in sales of its Flow Lady stockings since commissioning a film by the agency Lew Lara Propeg which shows a man talking about the quality of Flow. Suddenly a pair of stunning legs appears and the man starts repeating women's names until he settles dreamily on Maria Thereza. Jacques Lewkowicz, the creator, explains: 'When there is not enough money for a big, prolonged campaign, there is nothing better than taking advantage of an event to draw the consumer's interest.' Luis Roberto Pires from the Contemporanea agency which produced the advertisements for Banco Boavista, agrees. 'For us, the corruption inquiry was a perfect chance to focus attention on a reputation that Boavista already had - that of honesty.' Olivetto says the trend for corruption-related advertisements has come as a godsend at an otherwise difficult moment when political and economic uncertainty on top of two years of recession means that planning is on hold while everyone waits to see what will happen next Perhaps the most popular theme has been impeachment since the country's first ever impeachment process was started. 'Impeachment. Learn other interesting English words. Stop by Inlingua,' reads the billboard for English lessons in the southern city of Porto Allegre, taking advantage of the fact that there is no Brazilian word for impeachment. The slogan was so successful that the classes sold out almost immediately and new teachers had to be contracted. Despite the current proliferation of corruption-related advertisements, Olivetto predicts their popularity will soon pale. 'We're avoiding ads on the theme because everyone is using them, so they are losing impact. We're waiting now for the next event.' In the meantime at least one sector is benefiting from the crisis.</p>

Citing informed sources in Iraq, the assembly's statement  said that the sabotage teams received extensive lessons during  the course under the supervision of experts experienced in  assassination, explosives, terrorism, spreading rumors, and  sowing the seeds of sedition.    The statement said that those who were trained had been  divided into four groups according to the tasks allotted to each  group. The first group had been given the task of assassinating  foreigners working for the UN agencies and organizations that  are active in many parts of Iraq, particularly in the Iraqi  Kurdistan region. The second group would carry out operations  against prominent figures of the Iraqi opposition. The  statement added that the third group had been given  responsibility for sabotage operations and planting mines in  important and densely populated areas in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran,  and Syria, where the Iraqi opposition is active. The statement  pointed out that the fourth group would spread rumors and leak  fabricated information through various media channels to mislead  public opinion and create a state of frustration among the sons  of the Iraqi people in and out of Iraq.    In another development, the assembly's statement said that  the pathology department in Baghdad was receiving between 20 and  25 bodies daily brought in by officers of the special security  organization, which is under the control of Qusay Saddam Husayn.    The assembly said that, according to reliable information  received from Iraq, the bodies of people who had been executed  were transported in ambulances with a confidential note from the  special security organization ordering the pathologist to issue  death certificates, stipulating that death had occurred as a  result of a long illness, the nonavailability of treatment, or a  heart attack. The statement added that the special security  organization's note stressed that when the bodies of those  executed were handed over to their families, they should be told  not to open the coffins and to keep the funeral and burial  rituals to the minimum.</p>

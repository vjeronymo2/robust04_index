			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Stasi probe puts SPD state leader on spot Mr Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic (SPD) prime minister of Brandenburg state and east Germany's best-known politician, was strongly condemned at the opening of hearings yesterday on his contacts with the former Stasi security police. Mr Rainer Eppelmann, a former east Berlin pastor and prominent anti-communist dissident, told a parliamentary investigating committee in Potsdam that Mr Stolpe had been 'objectively compromised' by his links with the Stasi. 'Mr Stolpe's confidence in the Stasi was greater than in the Church,' Mr Eppelmann charged. He called on the Brandenburg leader to present long-awaited evidence which would exonerate him instead of acting like an 'informer who is on the defensive'. Mr Stolpe has admitted having contacts with the Stasi while serving as a senior Protestant Church lay official. But he says the regular meetings with Stasi officers were part of the Church's efforts to help east Germans persecuted by the communist authorities. Last week the Green party, a partner in Mr Stolpe's coalition government in Potsdam, threatened to break up the coalition if he did not resign. However, it then backed down. Mr Eppelmann accused Mr Stolpe of breaking his Church vow to remain silent and of disclosing intimate details to the Stasi about the former pastor's private life. Mr Eppelmann, a Christian Democratic member of the German parliament and head of the government commission on the history of East Germany, said he had learned this on reading his own Stasi file. Mr Stolpe will be questioned today over the circumstances in which he was awarded East Germany's Order of Merit in 1978. Mr Klaus Rossberg, a former Stasi officer who is also to testify today, said he personally handed Mr Stolpe the medal in a clandestine Stasi residence.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: RH Macy wins access to Dollars 600m financing facility R. H. MACY, the large US department store group which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, yesterday won access to a Dollars 600m financing facility. The debtor-in-possession facility, being led by Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust Company, was approved by Judge Burton Lifland in the bankruptcy courts in New York after an 80-minute hearing, despite a handful of objections. DIP financing is a common feature in bankruptcy situations and lenders rank at the forefront of the repayment queue. The most significant dissent came from the Macy bondholders, whose lawyer questioned one of the covenants in the DIP financing. He noted that it required Macy's to perform better during the next Christmas season than it had in the one just past. 'If Macy's does as it did last Christmas, it would default,' he suggested. However, after some jostling between the lawyers and firm assertions that the DIP financing package was the product of hard negotiations, Judge Lifland overruled the objections. Macy's takes in 144 department stores and 11 furniture and clearance stores in 18 states, employing nearly 70,000. Like some other retailers, the privately-owned company has struggled with debts taken on in the 1980s and the depressed retail climate of the 1990s. When it filed for bankruptcy, it had assets of Dollars 4.95bn and liabilities of Dollars 5.32bn.</p>

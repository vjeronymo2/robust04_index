			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / LDP faction split opens up again THE split in the largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) widened again yesterday when the faction's new chairman, Mr Keizo Obuchi, excluded his opponents from executive positions. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister, was chosen as Mr Obuchi's deputy and other loyalists were given senior positions, while their opponents sought to garner members for a newly-formed 'policy-study group', which remains within the faction, but which could become a new faction. The LDP will be put to the test today at a special sitting of the Diet, Japan's parliament, which must approve an emergency economic package. It is likely to call a former prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, to give evidence about his alleged dealings with gangsters. Mr Takeshita is the patron of Mr Obuchi, and if the former prime minister comes under extreme pressure, it could further destabilise the leading faction and the LDP, which has been paralysed since the factional struggle began two weeks ago. The LDP has yet to settle a dispute with opposition parties over whether Mr Takeshita will give evidence under oath, and these parties could delay the passage of the emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) economic package to revitalise the flagging economy if their demands for an oath-taking are not met. The parliamentary session could also serve to focus public attention on Mr Takeshita, who has become the main target for criticism since the resignation two weeks ago of Mr Shin Kanemaru, who had been leader of the party's largest faction. Mr Kanemaru had violated political funding laws and was also condemned for his dealings with gangsters.</p>

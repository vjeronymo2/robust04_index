			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ban Nuclear Weapons"] </F>   [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  has just visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea.    Lately the United States has been pressuring international  agencies to persuade North Korea to allow inspection of its  facilities and has even threatened to nuke North Korea if they  ever built and used one. Butrus-Ghali was on a mission to  intercede between the U.S. and North Korea. North Korea has not  accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to  inspect its facilities and considers its nuclear activitis to be  peaceful and regards U.S. attempts as bullying moves of  intimidation.    What is unfortunate is that the secretary general of the  United Nations is putting himself at the disposal of one of its  members, namely the United States.    This is an important and opportune occasion (the birth of  Jesus Christ); the secretary general should have considered  other places. For instance, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  cries for intervention of an international body. Butrus-Ghali  could have visited Serbia to put pressure on Serbs to end the  genocide and massacre of innocent people.    The question of nuclear weapons should worry any  conscientious individual. Weapons of such destructive powers  are no toys for any military. Only the United States has used  this weapon (in World War II). The Islamic Republic of Iran has  maintained that its nuclear activities are peaceful and  representatives of international agencies have repeatedly  confirmed this.    Governments with nuclear capability claim to be stable and  promise to take measures to control its military use. The  former Soviet Union was such a stable government. When  President Reagan was shot, the confusion in the White House as  to "Who is in control!" testified to another stable government.    Conscientious individuals in the world have been rallying to  ban nuclear weapons. Iran also believes that since nuclear  weapons are dangerous and destructive, and that they could get  out of control and create a world disaster, no country should  have them.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> U.S. LOOKS ABROAD FOR ITS HEROES;  </P> <P> AMERICANS OFFER ADULATION TO FOREIGNERS SUCH AS MANDELA, WHO SEEM TO EMBODY THE  HEROIC QUALITIES LACKING IN THE INSTANT CELEBRITIES AT HOME.  </P> <P> The faces in the crowd are the same: eager and expectant -- that mixture of awe  and hope in the gaze of people who have waited hours for a chance to touch the  hand or hear the words of a hero.  </P> <P> Only the heroes have changed. The objects of Americans' adulation have  developed a distinctly foreign cast.  </P> <P> Over the last few months, Lech Walesa and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made  triumphal tours across America that no domestic figure seems able to equal.  </P> <P> Now it is Nelson Mandela -- cheered by a million New Yorkers this week,  showered by confetti in a ticker-tape parade on Broadway and saluted at rallies  as he began a tour of America.  </P> <P> Is the American hero now an import?  </P> <P> For most of this century, American heroes have been just that -- American.  Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., John  Glenn -- each excelled in a different sphere. But all were seen as embodying  central aspects of the American character and were placed on the exalted  platform that the nation reserves for its most admired figures.  </P> <P> In recent years, by contrast, America has been marked by a deep cynicism about  its domestic political figures and institutions, said David Riesman, a retired  Harvard social historian. In arenas as varied as sports, politics and  entertainment, idols have turned out to have feet of clay.  </P> <P> At the same time, Americans in the final decade of the 20th Century are  bombarded with celebrity, as Daniel J. Boorstin, formerly the librarian of  Congress, noted in his book, "The Image."  </P> <P> "Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused," Boorstin wrote.  "Yet we confuse them every day," and "by doing so we come dangerously close to  depriving ourselves of all real models."  </P> <P> Because they are unable to identify real domestic heroes among the mass of  instant celebrities, Americans naturally gravitate to foreigners who seem to  display heroic characteristics such as courage, decisiveness and mastery of  fate.  </P> <P> "There's almost gratefulness to these people for existing," Riesman said. "We  still want to look up to people. We're not as cynical as we sometimes like to  make out we are."  </P> <P> There are no exact measures of the breadth of these new heroes' appeal. Each  has tailored his U.S. visit to cities where his appeal would likely be  greatest, as UC Berkeley political scientist Raymond E. Wolfinger noted.  </P> <P> Thus Polish labor leader Walesa visited Chicago, with its huge Polish-American  community. Soviet President Gorbachev visited Minneapolis and San Francisco,  two of the most liberal cities in the nation. South Africa's Mandela is  visiting a series of cities with large black populations.  </P> <P> The eagerness of national politicians to get close to the visitors, the  attentiveness of the news media, the vast enthusiasm of the crowds and the  results of public opinion polls all indicate that the impact has been real and  considerable.  </P> <P> That impact has been possible because of both a dearth of home-grown heroes and  a shift in how Americans view the nation's position in the world.  </P> <P> The decline of home-grown heroes has many possible causes.  </P> <P> Boorstin argues that the cult of celebrity has drowned out the possibility of  authentic heroes. The whirl of stars, each rising fast and most falling just as  fast, along with the widespread commercialization of popular entertainment,  have changed the way Americans view many aspects of mass culture.  </P> <P> Consider sports, to take one example. Basketball player Michael Jordan is  probably the best-known sports star in the nation. Americans know him both as a  player and as a commercial symbol for such products as Wheaties and Nike. He  earns a huge income, far more than ever dreamed of by Babe Ruth or Joe  DiMaggio. But neither Jordan nor any other athlete of today seems able to  command the broad public affection that was lavished on Ruth and DiMaggio.  </P> <P> Few Frontiers  </P> <P> Those who conquered new frontiers traditionally became American heroes. Daniel  Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson and "Buffalo Bill" Cody went west. Later  heroes crossed the frontiers of air and space: Charles A. Lindbergh with his  solo flight across the Atlantic, Glenn with the first American orbit of the  Earth.  </P> <P> Today, those frontiers seem constrained, said Michael Lofaro of the University  of Kentucky, who has studied heroes in American literature. Heroes are far  harder to develop, he said, in an age when "the great man has been replaced by  the machine."  </P> <P> Political figures have provided another source of heroes in eras past. But,  today, said historian William C. Leuchtenberg of the University of North  Carolina, politics is dominated by "men in gray flannel suits" who simply fail  to excite.  </P> <P> The only recent political figure who approached hero status is former President  Ronald Reagan. In the latter part of his term, however, Reagan lost  considerable standing because of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> After leaving office, Reagan appears to have fallen victim to the defect that  has plagued many other would-be American heroes -- commercialization. The  multimillion-dollar fee he received last year for a brief speaking tour in  Japan detracted from his image as a man who transcended the worldly concerns of  ordinary Americans.  </P> <P> The news media's intense concentration on the private lives and scandals of  popular figures may also play a role in knocking down American heroes as fast  as they can rise.  </P> <P> Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado might never have become a heroic figure even  if the press had not reported on his interest in women other than his wife  during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, as  biographers have since disclosed, earlier political figures, such as President  John F. Kennedy, had similar sexual peccadilloes that were not reported at the  time.  </P> <P> The absence of domestic heroes leaves a void. As Riesman said, heroes are an  essential part of every culture, reassuring the public that something exists  that is larger than life.  </P> <P> Boundaries Fall  </P> <P> America's changing role in the world has made that void easier to fill from  abroad.  </P> <P> Foreign heroes are not entirely new. After a wave of mostly unsuccessful  revolutions swept Europe in 1848, some of the leading insurrectionaries -- the  Lech Walesas of their day -- toured America, the land of democracy and  revolution, seeking support. Lajos Kossuth, the leader of Hungary's failed  attempt to free itself from Austria, attracted 100,000 people, who lined the  railroad tracks from Columbus to Cleveland to cheer him as he toured Ohio,  still a frontier state, in 1852.  </P> <P> A century later, Sir Winston Churchill became one of the most widely admired  men in America for his brave leadership of Britain in the fight against Nazism.  </P> <P> Those events, however, have been exceptions. More often, Americans have been  notable for a feeling that theirs was a country that would find little to learn  and even less to admire in the "Old World."  </P> <P> Indeed, those who were thought to cleave to non-American role models were often  subjects of suspicion. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was  forced to defend himself against charges that his Roman Catholic faith would  subject him to dictation from a foreign Pope. Jews were often suspected of  possessing a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel that placed their  patriotism under suspicion. During the height of the Cold War, that wariness of  foreigners became entwined with fear of communism to produce a generalized  suspicion of "outside influences" in much of American society.  </P> <P> That resistance appears to have faded, at least among substantial parts of the  American population. An increased amount of travel abroad, widespread  television pictures from overseas and the increased celebration of ethnic  diversity at home have combined to make Americans more open to foreign  concepts, said Berkeley's Wolfinger.  </P> <P> At the same time, said Stanford sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, Americans  once more see the world as being open to them and their values.  </P> <P> Until very recently, Mandela, for example, might have made many Americans  nervous. Although American opinion generally has opposed apartheid for years,  the African National Congress' ties to the South African Communist Party and  its guerrilla tactics made many Americans uneasy.  </P> <P> But now concerns about communism have sharply diminished. Even the leader of  the Soviet Union, which no longer seems poised to launch its nuclear missiles,  can be praised in the United States for pursuing greater freedom and openness  -- what many Americans see as "their values."  </P> <P> Projection of those values onto a public figure is at the heart of how a hero  is created. Throughout history, heroes have been concocted of fact mixed with  large amounts of fantasy and hope. Indeed, one of the major deterrents to the  development of new American heroes may be the relentlessness of the modern  publicity apparatus, which renders nearly everything accessible and leaves  almost nothing mysterious.  </P> <P> By contrast, although satellite television pictures and overseas newspaper  correspondents bring foreign figures unprecedented amounts of public  recognition within the United States, foreign leaders still remain sufficiently  veiled behind a curtain of distance and unfamiliarity that they leave something  to Americans' imagination.  </P> <P> Skepticism Fades  </P> <P> When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Americans initially viewed him as being  cut from the same cloth as his predecessors, said Jeffrey C. Alexander,  chairman of UCLA's sociology department, who has studied the development of  Gorbachev's public image. Within the first year, however, Americans, and  particularly their news organizations, began to describe Gorbachev as  pragmatic, dynamic, informal, spontaneous and self-confident.  </P> <P> That in turn appears to have influenced American policy. Public confidence in  Gorbachev has tempered domestic pressure on the Bush Administration to take a  tough line with the Soviets over the Lithuanian crisis, for example. White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attracted criticism when he referred to the  Soviet leader last spring as a "drugstore cowboy," and Bush now routinely  praises Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The process has been even more striking in Mandela's case.  </P> <P> "For the broad American public, we didn't know who this man was," said pollster  and political consultant Paul Maslin. In the last few years, Mandela's name  became known to some Americans, particularly blacks, but little was known of  his history. For nearly 28 years, his words and ideas had reached the outside  world only sporadically and through the intermediaries who were allowed rare  visits with him in prison.  </P> <P> Strangest of all in this video age, no one outside of a small circle of  intimates had seen his face.  </P> <P> And then, in pictures watched by hundreds of millions of people around the  globe, Mandela walked out of prison in a scene that almost perfectly  recapitulated essential elements of ancient myths about heroes who dramatically  return from long exile to save their people.  </P> <P> For most Americans, the specifics of Mandela's ideas and the details of his  policies remain obscure and, perhaps, not even relevant. When asked by  reporters why they turned out to see him, people in the crowds commonly used a  phrase that applies more to the United States than to Africa: civil rights.  </P> <P> For many Americans, black and white, Mandela has become "a 1990 version of  Martin Luther King," Maslin said.  </P> <P> That connection could become the key to how the country greets the African  National Congress leader as his tour of the nation continues. Mandela began  entering the American consciousness primarily as a hero for black Americans. He  was part of a long tradition of ethnic heroes -- nationalist leader Eamon de  Valera for Irish-Americans earlier in this century, for example, and the late  Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir for Jews.  </P> <P> More recently, however, Mandela has emerged as a hero with a broader reach. As  an apostle of a future cleansed of racism, Mandela fills a void for many white  Americans who, since King's assassination in 1968, haven't had "a black leader  they can unambivalently admire," said Anne Fabian, who teaches American studies  at Yale University.  </P> <P> "Mandela makes us feel good about ourselves," said UCLA's Alexander. "He's  raising a dream of a multiracial society; that's what we're celebrating.  </P> <P> "We don't know what the person is like, so we're really thinking about our own  society," he said. "These heroes are projections of what we think they are or  what we'd like to become. That's why we create them."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: NEW YEAR'S NEWS  </P> <P> Parade Wars: KTTV Channel 11 sent KTLA Channel 5 three blank commercial  cartridges, claiming that since it won't be running commercials during its Rose  Parade coverage on New Year's Day, KTLA perhaps could use them.  </P> <P> The stations have been sniping at each other in their on-air parade promos.  KTTV says that it will be mentioning sponsors but won't run spots as such; KTLA  cameras won't leave the parade but will use "see-through" overlay images of  sponsors on the screen. The cartridges were sent by Greg Nathanson, president  of the Fox Station Group, to Steve Bell, general manager of KTLA. A KTLA  spokesman said he was amused by the free cartridges but that Bell was  unavailable for comment. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST KEPT WINE SECRET IN L.A.  </P> <P> From the outside, Les Freres Taix on Sunset doesn't appear to be the kind of  restaurant that would have one of the great wine lists in America. Maybe that's  what makes it such an incredible place: It's still unknown.  </P> <P> Well, not exactly unknown. Any night of the week the valets can be seen  scampering to handle the traffic. It's just that a place that has about 200  seats for dinner and serves twice that number of dinners on weekend nights  should be selling more than $250,000 worth of wine a year.  </P> <P> It's not. It is, however, doing more than twice the wine business it did in  1984, the year before Mike Taix took over the wine program from his father and  turned it from something that was merely interesting to something that was  exciting and dynamic.  </P> <P> It wasn't until about a year ago -- when Taix began printing a multi-page  computerized menu listing virtually every drinkable wine owned by the  restaurant -- that the real intent of this program took shape. (Previously,  only 30 or 40 of the restaurant's wines were printed on a menu and it was  rarely updated.) It may be another year before Mike gets his true pay-back:  national recognition.  </P> <P> Here are a few of the things this wine program offers:  </P> <P> Good wine-by-the-glass selections that change often.  </P> <P> 450 selections all priced so low you think they're a misprint.  </P> <P> Many wines for sale to take home by the case -- at prices competitive with the  deepest-discount shops in town.  </P> <P> Some examples: There are 25 white Burgundies priced at less than $30 a bottle,  including 13 from the famed 1985 vintage; 37 California Chardonnays priced at  $20 or less (including 1987 Silverado at $16.75, 1985 Vichon at $18.75 and 1985  Simi at $17.75); 80 Bordeaux including 1976 and 1978 Chateau Montrose at $30  and 1974 Lynch Bages at $27; and a string of California Cabernets, many from  older vintages.  </P> <P> You won't find any vertical selection of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild here,  however, because Mike buys with his palate, not his ego.  </P> <P> "I'm a close-out buyer," he said. "I buy good wines in small quantities until I  find that 'deal' that other people can't see because the name is wrong."  </P> <P> Such a wine is the 1981 Chante-Alouette, white Hermitage from Chapoutier, a  wine you can buy for $9.75 a bottle here, or $3 a glass. The wine is a good  example of an older white Hermitage. It would sell for about $13 a bottle at  retail. Mike bought dozens of cases of it after the wholesaler went out of  business.  </P> <P> He made the same kind of deal on a 1979 Haut Cote de Beaune red wine, which you  can buy for $8.75 a bottle with your dinner. Or you can take a case home for  $54 -- $4.50 a bottle.  </P> <P> The tradition of selling wine both on-sale (with dinner) and off-sale (for  take-out) is an old one at Taix, going back to Marius Taix's pharmacy,  Brunswick Drugs, on Commercial Street in downtown L.A. in the 1930s where  medicinal wines were sold.  </P> <P> Later, his son, Raymond Taix, handled an extensive wine list at the old  family-style Taix Restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. When office development  forced a move to the present location on Sunset, Raymond opened a wine shop at  the entrance of the new restaurant. He closed it a decade ago to add seating  space.  </P> <P> Mike, 30, said he was raised the same way his father been raised: with wine on  the dinner table. At age 16, Mike already knew what he liked. In 1985, after  taking a course in wine appreciation from the late Dr. Ralph Hutchinson, Mike  asked his father if he could handle the wine program.  </P> <P> Shortly after Raymond gave his OK, Mike stumbled upon a treasure trove of White  Burgundies and Bordeaux from the 1920s hidden in the wine cellar.  </P> <P> The wines had been perfectly stored, and were in fine condition, but the  clientele that then dined at Taix wasn't knowledgeable enough to know they were  worth hundreds of dollars per bottle.  </P> <P> So Mike shipped them off to an East Coast wine auction house, took the profits  he earned from their sale and began to stock the cellar. Fancy names or  gold-sprayed labels meant nothing. Taste was everything.  </P> <P> And instead of re-opening the shop, Mike simply put the case prices of wines  available to take home right on the wine list.  </P> <P> Example: 1981 Chateau Clos L'Eglise, $22 with dinner, $165 by the case ($13.33  a bottle).  </P> <P> Case prices for older wines here are often a bargain: a 1976 Burgundy at $19 a  bottle; a 1982 Bordeaux at $12; 1977 Louis Martini Monte Rosso Zinfandel,  $6.50. (Alas, the latter wine was discovered recently by a gentleman who bought  all five cases that were left.)  </P> <P> There are some obvious weaknesses with this sort of buying program -- you  sacrifice depth for price -- but there's no denying the validity of Taix's  formula for pricing younger, commercially available wine:  </P> <P> "I price everything at $5 a bottle above retail," Mike says. "That way, I can  discourage people from bringing in their own wine."  </P> <P> Of course you can bring in your own wine -- corkage is $5 -- but when you can  get well-cellared wine for the same amount you'd pay retail plus corkage, who  would want to?  </P> <P> Les Freres Taix, 1911 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 484-1265.  </P></p>

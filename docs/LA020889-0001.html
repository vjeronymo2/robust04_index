			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: ONE MORE BUSH FOR WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> President Bush and his wife, Barbara, will be brushing up on lullabies after  becoming grandparents for the 11th time. Their daughter-in-law, Sharon, gave  birth to a 7-pound, 2-ounce baby girl in Denver, the White House said. Ashley  Walker Bush was delivered at 3:45 a.m. at Denver's Rose Medical Center. A White  House statement said that the mother and child were resting comfortably. The  new father is Neil Bush, the third oldest of the Bushes' five children. Ashley  is her parents' third child. The statement quoted the First Lady as saying she  and her husband are "very excited" by and "enormously grateful" for the birth  of their granddaughter.  </P> <P>  -- "Wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom" are not the typical lyrics for official  state music. But Rep. Billy Randall, a Georgia state legislator from Macon,  wants "Tutti Frutti," which contains those lyrics, to be the state's official  rock 'n' roll song. The Democrat said he introduced the measure to give some  overdue recognition to "Little Richard" Penniman, a Macon native whose style  was copied by many of the rock stars of the early 1960s, including the Beatles.  "Quite frankly, I don't think Little Richard has ever gotten the acclaim or the  notoriety for his contribution to rock 'n' roll," Randall said. "Tutti Frutti,"  Little Richard's first big hit, reached No. 2 on the rhythm and blues chart in  1955 and became a rock standard. Georgia's state song is "Georgia On My Mind"  by Ray Charles.  </P> <P>  -- Veterans of the Ronald Reagan Administration are not the only political  insiders who get book contracts. Bert Lance, the President Jimmy Carter aide  who was pushed out of Washington by charges of financial irregularities, has  signed with Summit books to write about his experiences. The book, which is due  for publication in the fall of 1990, will touch on his work on behalf of Carter  and, more recently, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, politics in general and his  successful fight against charges of bank fraud.  </P> <P>  -- Country music singer Loretta Lynn has been hospitalized in Nashville,  Tenn., after a fall, a spokeswoman says. Lynn was hurt when she slipped and  fell while vacationing recently in the Bahamas with her husband, O.V. (Mooney)  Lynn, said Lorene Allen, vice president of Loretta Lynn Enterprises. "She is in  Park View Hospital for observation because she . . . broke her arm and suffered  unbelievable pain, and that is all I know at this point," Allen said. SHIRLEY  MARLOW  </P></p>

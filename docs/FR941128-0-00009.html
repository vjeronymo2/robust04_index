This adjustment is known as the low reserve tranche adjustment. The Board has increased from $4.0 million to $4.2 million the amount of reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a reserve requirement of zero percent. This action is required by section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act, and the adjustment is known as the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment. The Board is also increasing the deposit cutoff levels that are used in conjunction with the reservable liabilities exemption to determine the frequency of deposit reporting from $55.0 million to $55.4 million for nonexempt depository institutions and from $44.8 million to $45.1 million for exempt institutions. (Nonexempt institutions are those with total reservable liabilities exceeding $4.2 million while exempt institutions are those with total reservable liabilities not exceeding $4.2 million.) Thus nonexempt institutions with total deposits of $55.4 million or more will be required to report weekly while nonexempt institutions with total deposits less than $55.4 million may report quarterly. Similarly, exempt institutions with total deposits of $45.1 million or more will be required to report quarterly while exempt institutions with total deposits less than $45.1 million may report annually.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  December 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For depository institutions that report weekly, the low reserve tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment will apply to the reserve computation period that begins Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the corresponding reserve maintenance period that begins Thursday, December 22, 1994.

The initial reserve requirements imposed under section 19(b)(2) were set at three percent for net transaction accounts of $25 million or less and at 12 percent on net transaction accounts above $25 million for each depository institution. Effective April 2, 1992, the Board lowered the required reserve ratio applicable to transaction account balances exceeding the low reserve tranche from 12 percent to 10 percent. Section 19(b)(2) also provides that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting for the next calendar year the total dollar amount of the transaction account tranche against which reserves must be maintained at a ratio of three percent. The adjustment in the tranche is to be 80 percent of the percentage change in net transaction accounts at all depository institutions over the one-year period that ends on the June 30 prior to the adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the low reserve tranche on net transaction accounts is $51.9 million. The increase in the net transaction accounts of all depository institutions from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, was 5.0 percent (from $788.5 billion to $828.3 billion). In accordance with section 19(b)(2), the Board is amending Regulation D (12 CFR Part 204) to increase the low reserve tranche for transaction accounts for 1995 by $2.1 million to $54.0 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

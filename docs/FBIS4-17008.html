			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Belyakov] </F>   [Text] Samara April 20 TASS -- There has been considerable  progress in reforms in Russia lately, according to Russia's  choice leader Yegor Gaydar. Meeting journalists in Samara, Volga  region, on Wednesday, Gaydar said "we have already passed the  most crucial phase of the crisis. However, we have yet to do the  most important -- assemble mechanisms which could allow the  economy not only to survive, but also to develop and grow."    Gaydar is in Samara to see if his idea of presidential party  has chances of success in Russian regions. He believes it  should not be entirely presidential, but must support the  president so that he could count on it. The new party will be  seeking to reduce budget expenditures, curb inflation, protect  the rights of owners and carry out a reasonable tax policy.  Gaydar confirmed that his party will move from rhetoric to  action and is ready to bear responsibility for all decisions,  including unpopular ones.    "The present tax rates make economic growth impossible. Cuts  in budget expenditures are vital for changing the tax policy.  They should be reduced by means of gradual reforms, primarily  in the military sphere," Gaydar noted. "We cannot keep the army  which in its present form is absolutely incapable and absurdly  expensive," he added.    In his view, entrepreneurs, the intelligentsia and farmers  who were considered "kulaks" in the Soviet past will make up the  bulk of the new party. It will support itself by levying  membership fees and receiving donations from commercial  structures that understand the significance of the new party and  are ready to invest in politics.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Plunging markets test Major: Steep fall in equities Sterling plumbs new depths Interest rate fears intensify MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced a crisis of confidence in London's financial markets after a slump in share prices and a sliding pound raised intense pressure for a clear statement of the government's economic strategy. As the markets cast a shadow over the opening today of the Conservative party conference, Mr Major responded to crumbling confidence by stressing that low inflation remained the 'centrepiece' of his policy. But share prices had already suffered their biggest one-day fall for five years, prompting Lord Tebbit, a former Conservative party chairman, to warn that Britain now faced 'an economic and political crisis'. Arriving in Brighton, the prime minister told journalists that sterling, which yesterday fell to another record low against the D-Mark, had been caught in the much wider turbulence on financial markets across Europe. The pound had been particularly hit only because it was one of the world's most widely traded currencies. He added: 'These things happen from time to time. . . .I don't think people should get unduly panicked about it.' But as Mr Michael Heseltine's budget at the Department of Trade and Industry emerged as the latest victim of Treasury spending cuts, Mr Major said he would not shirk 'difficult choices' over public spending. The economic gloom was deepened by a warning from the Building Employers' Confederation of further big job losses. Throwing a pall over what had already promised to be a fractious party conference, the London stock market recorded its biggest one-day fall since the 1987 crash. The FT-SE 100 share index lost 103.4 to 2,446.3, amid concern about the apparent lack of direction to UK economic policy. The policy vacuum saw the pound lose fall 3 3/4 pfennigs in London to DM2.3925, bringing losses to 12 1/2 pfennigs in three trading days. It is more than 55 pfennigs below its former ERM central rate of DM2.95. In New York, the pound closed at DM2.43165. But as sterling's weakness intensified concerns among senior Conservatives that the government might soon be forced to raise interest rates, Mr Major declined to anticipate Mr Norman Lamont's speech to the conference on Thursday. He told journalists: 'I am not going to pre-empt what the chancellor is to say. But we have made it perfectly clear that the centrepiece of our economic policy remains to get inflation low and to keep inflation low.' Mr Lamont faces growing City pressure to use what was originally envisaged as a general description of economic objectives to issue a more detailed statement of how policy will operate outside the ERM. Senior ministers were still stressing yesterday that the party conference did not provide the right venue for a technical analysis of the operation of monetary policy. But they acknowledged that unless Mr Lamont offered a clear set of guidelines on Thursday, the markets might force a damaging rise in interest rates. Speaking at a private dinner for party officials last night, Mr Major acknowledged that sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM had left his gov-ernment under fire. But in what senior Tory officials characterised as a 'fighting speech', he indicated that he was ready to spell out the 'home truths' on which economic policy would be based. He sought also to pre-empt the threat of a damaging battle over Europe by stressing from the outset of the conference that he would not be budged from his support for the Maastricht treaty. Confirming that the Maastricht bill would be brought back to the House of Commons later this month, Mr Major said: 'I have no intention of going back to Europe to break my word and the agreement I entered into.' Sir Norman Fowler will attempt to reinforce the call for unity when the conference opens this morning with a warning to delegates that the Conservatives have built their election victories by eschewing public divisions. But leading Tory Eurosceptics signalled that they planned to use today's debate on the government's European policy to demonstrate the strength of opposition to Maastricht.

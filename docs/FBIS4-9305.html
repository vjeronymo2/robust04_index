			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- Another 247 members  of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were early on Monday [25  April] deployed between the warring local Serb and Muslim troops  in Gorazde, Muslim enclave in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  U.N. spokesman said. According to REUTERS, the British, Russian  and Egyptian soldiers joined the 200 U.N. troops which had  arrived in Gorazde on Saturday. The aim of the U.N.  peacekeepers in Gorazde is to form a buffer between the  belligerent sides, to secure the safety of the humanitarian  agencies and monitor the withdrawal of the Serb heavy artillery  to 20 km away from the centre of the town, as called by a NATO  ultimatum which expires at midnight Tuesday.</p>

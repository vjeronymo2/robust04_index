			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / National Lottery plans to be unveiled PLANS for a national lottery to raise funds for arts, sports or cultural projects will be unveiled today by Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, writes Ralph Atkins. His announcement to the Commons appears to have been deliberately brought forward as part of efforts to build momentum ahead of an announcement about the general election. Proposals for a lottery had previously been expected to be set out in the Tory election manifesto. Home Office ministers have for some time indicated support for a lottery but their plans are thought to have met resistance from the Treasury because of the impact on the football pools business. Estimates for how much a lottery could raise range as high as Pounds 1bn a year.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (4): Starting from a high base - The economy BELGIUM should be among the very best performing economies in Europe. Within a few weeks, when it presents its convergence programme to meet the tight financial criteria for European economic and monetary union (Emu), it is expected to give an earnest undertaking that it has every intention of becoming just that. It starts from a high base, but weighed down by public indebtedness which is more than twice the average of its EC partners. To take but one startling illustration, a recent study by the Cologne Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft shows that Belgian productivity is on average 20 per cent better than that of Germany, the EC's leading industrial power. Yet Belgian per capita income is 13 per cent below German average living standards. The two main explanations are that the government payroll has swelled to include about a quarter of the workforce, while more and more Belgians are retiring early - subsidised, in effect, by the exchequer. The number of public employees has grown about two fifths since 1970, to nearly 900,000, while private sector employment has contracted. Yet civil servants' earnings have only risen 40 per cent in that time, or less than half the rate of remuneration in the private sector. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of workforce participation rates for 1987, shows that in Belgium only 54 per cent of males, and 15 per cent of females between the ages of 55 and 59 were in work, against respective averages of 76 and 38 per cent in Germany, 81 and 54 per cent in the UK, and 74 and 37 per cent among the main OECD economies. The state's generous facilitation of early retirement helps fuel both the budget deficit and the debt. Belgium's public debt is about Dollars 200bn, or 130 per cent of its gross domestic product. Interest payments on this debt eat up nearly 11 per cent of GDP each year, leaving about double this to meet the public sector payroll, but only one tenth of this for public investment - about a third of the EC average. Just about everything else in Belgium's economy is in good working order or better. Growth averaged about 4 per cent in 1987-90. This fell to 1.5 per cent last year, mainly because Germany - which provides the Belgian economy with a large part of its locomotion - started running out of its post-unification steam. A slight pick-up in demand and investment this year points towards gradual recovery, conservatively estimated by the central bank at 1.6 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next. Inflation is creeping below 3 per cent (2.6 per cent in the first five months this year). Wage increases, averaging 4.8 per cent so far this year, are below German settlement levels. The current account, strongly negative in 1975-85, has been in surplus ever since and is now averaging about 2 per cent of GDP, and rising. This surplus reinforces the cornerstone of Belgium's economy, the hard franc policy it introduced in May 1990, along with a reduction of the withholding tax on income from financial assets from 25 yo 10 per cent. For two years, the central bank has held the franc to a narrow fluctuation band of half a percentage point either side of the D-Mark. This is a far tighter discipline than the 2.25 per cent band allowed the Belgian currency within the exchange range mechanism of the EMS. In fact, the franc in the past 18 months has been no further than 0.06 per cent out of alignment with the EMS anchor, according to the central bank. As a result, the narrowing of short-term interest rate differentials with Germany has been almost total, from a 5.1 per cent gap in 1980 and a 2 per cent premium before the hard franc policy was adopted. Indeed, Belgian short-term rates have been dipping 0.2 per cent below German rates recently. The premium on Belgian long-term rates has also narrowed in the past year, from 1 per cent to just over 0.6 per cent. The difference reflects the main area of vulnerability: Belgium's public finances. The annual budget deficit came down from 13 per cent in 1981 to 5.6 per cent in 1990. This implied cuts in spending - exclusive of interest payments on the stock of debt - of 10 percentage points of GDP. But last year there was slippage, on both the deficit (to 6.3 per cent of GDP) and debt stock, and only this year will the public sector shortfall return to 1990 levels. Belgium's currency and interest rates easily meet the criteria for Emu laid down in the Maastricht treaty (which Belgium, along with its partners, assumes will come into effect next year despite rejection by Denmark). But it still has a lot of work to do to 'converge' its public finances towards targets of 3 per cent for the deficit and a ratio of debt to GDP of 60 per cent, by the end of 1996, the first possible date for the third stage of Emu and the creation of a single currency. Yet Mr Alfons Verplaetse, cautious governor of Belgium's central bank, is certain his country will enter Emu in the first wave: 'I don't doubt it for one second,' he says. He argues that last year's deficit - primarily the result of higher unemployment and pension payments - was quickly brought under control by the new government of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene. Mr Dehaene took over in March after more than 100 days of hiatus following last November's inconclusive general election. In April, he introduced a corrective fiscal package of savings and extra revenue which, Mr Verplaetse says, prevented the deficit reaching 7 per cent this year. Without any further measures, he adds, this will reduce the deficit to 5.5 per cent next year, within hailing distance of the current EC average. However, the hope is that the government will swiftly follow presentation of its convergence plan with stringent budgetary measures to implement it, possibly in August. In theory, there would then be four years to cut back to 3 per cent, a target which should be achievable. This is especially true given Belgian enthusiasm for Emu and European political union. 'Maastricht has been good for Belgium; it has been useful as an alibi,' says Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque. Most officials appear to believe that if the deficit is cut, and the debt stock is clearly coming down, then Belgium will not be held to the 60 per cent debt-to-GDP target stipulated by Maastricht. But much depends on whether Mr Dehaene can keep macroeconomic policy separate from the mired issue of constitutional reform, upon which the future of his shaky coalition depends. A consensus on convergence is thus urgent. 'No matter what happens with the government,' says Mr Verplaetse, 'once you have in place the mechanisms of Maastricht nothing untoward will happen.' When Belgium was without a government for more than three months, its squabbling politicians must have been chagrined to learn that the franc strengthened and interest rates fell. But the rigorous fiscal effort required by Emu will need political will and persistence. Furthermore, in the 1987-90 years of high growth the authorities were able to do little more than stabilise public finances. The size of Belgium's debt overhang makes it potentially dangerous in a downturn, especially if Emu provokes a budget squeeze across Europe. Belgium has potential shock-absorbers, however. Its rate of savings is unusually high and could be drawn down if the government creates sufficient confidence in the rigour of its convergence plan. Belgium's conservative companies built up huge cash surpluses with each leap in profitability during the 1980s. While much was reinvested, a great deal was kept as a buffer rather than distributed in dividends or spent on acquisitions. This means, Mr Praet believes, they can face with equanimity slower growth, high interest rates and greater fiscal pressure, through the closing of tax loopholes rather than higher tax rates. 'The major difficulty is social consensus in the public sector,' says Mr Praet. Cutting back on the public payroll will not be easy in a time of fast-spreading disenchantment with the traditional parties. One possibility being canvassed is greater devolution of public spending so that the Flemish and Walloon language communities, for example, would be directly responsible for passing on the cost of, say, more teachers that they assume their electors want. This superficially attractive idea would risk making Belgium more fissiparous than it already is.</p>

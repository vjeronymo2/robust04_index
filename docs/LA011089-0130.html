			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> WEDTECH ACCOMPLICE GIVEN 6 YEARS  </P> <P> A tearfully contrite Bernard Ehrlich, once a law partner of former U.S. Rep.  Mario Biaggi and a key figure in the Wedtech scandal, was sentenced today to  six years in prison for racketeering and other crimes.  </P> <P> "I deserve anything I get for what I've done. I feel sick over what I've done,"  Ehrlich told Judge Constance Baker Motley in U.S. District Court. Motley  admonished Ehrlich for his "major and substantial role" in the Wedtech scheme  and fined him $222,000. Ehrlich, a former deputy commander of the New York  National Guard, could have received 135 years in prison and been fined $6.3  million. He is the last major figure in the scam to be sentenced.  </P></p>

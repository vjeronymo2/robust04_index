			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Media Futures: SRI denounces superhighway claims SRI International, one of the world's largest research institutes, has denounced the information superhighway as a myth created by media hyperbole, and as too vague and ill-defined a concept on which to make investments. The sceptical note comes at the end of a Dollars 1.4m, two-year study programme, and as SRI - formerly the Stanford Research Institute - embarks on a further two-year research programme on digital-video-multimedia. SRI is also increasingly sceptical about the idea of a significant degree of convergence between the main communication industries, although several major industries are becoming closer through alliances and involvement in each other's markets. 'The notion that the computer, TV, video-game and telecoms industries are likely to merge into one gigantic full-service entity has no support, and much evidence to suggest that the industries will continue to remain separate,' SRI says. The organisation, which over the next two years plans large reports on company strategies in the emerging interactive-media and digital-media markets, the latest technology trials, new media business models and market prospects, warns that consumer acceptance and demand for the new services is 'highly speculative'. It believes that, though the potential for change in digital video technology is vast, the rate of change for most applications will be much slower than expected. The problems range from the fact that most of the required infrastructure will not be in place before the end of the decade, a lack of agreed standards and that the cost of the technology's initial deployment remains too high. 'A good example is desk-top video-conferencing. The value added to most users in increased productivity is not great enough to warrant spending approximately Dollars 3,000 per desk-top,' SRI argues. More than 50 large corporations, ranging from IBM and Sony to Microsoft and Siemans, are sponsoring the SRI research project. With the exception of areas such as education and video games, SRI believes there will be no stampede in the direction of interactivity, and that watching video entertainment will remain a mostly passive activity. New services will also not only face competition against each other but with existing media. In the face of advanced pay-per-view services and video-on-demand, video rental stores will not disappear 'quietly, or quickly' but will probably lower their prices and compete fiercely. SRI sees 'packaged media' in the form of CD-Rom-based video games and video information products at the forefront of emerging new markets. Video CD will also, SRI believes, attain modest success during the next three years, but it will not reach the critical mass in consumer markets necessary to elevate it to the same levels as CD audio or VHS video. The SRI Digital Video Multimedia programme costs Pounds 23,000 to sponsor for two years, including seminars and consultancy. SRI International Europe Menlo Park House, 4 Addiscombe Road, Croydon.

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Peru receives IMF's praise MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has praised the success of Peru's 18-month-old structural adjustment programme as 'an example for many countries around the world'. However, he warned that continuing international support for Peru's efforts would depend on substantial improvements in tax collection levels. The tax system was 'a weakness that Peru still has to confront', said Mr Camdessus on Wednesday during a two-day visit to Lima. Collections, while twice the level of a year ago, are still equivalent to only 8 per cent of gross domestic product. This figure needs to double again, and quickly, he warned. Mr Camdessus also stressed the dangers of 'adjustment fatigue', both for Peruvians suffering the direct consequences of economic stabilisation and for those abroad supporting it. Peruvian businessmen, increasingly impatient with ongoing recession, are demanding government intervention to cut internationally uncompetitive interest charges and to fix an export-promoting exchange rate. Congress, meanwhile, has rejected government proposals for raising direct taxes on income and company assets. It has also passed an emergency law to restore subsidies to beleaguered farmers. The combination could unbalance Peru's budget for this year, carefully agreed with the IMF. When President Alberto Fujimori took office in July 1990, he inherited 60 per cent monthly inflation, a bankrupt treasury and a massive fiscal deficit. After meeting Mr Camdessus in New York, Mr Fujimori imposed harsh austerity measures to control inflation, eliminated subsidies and floated the exchange rate. Peru has been paying Dollars 50m a month to the IMF, World Bank and International Development Bank since Mr Fujimori took office. The IMF approved Peru's economic programme last September. The same month Peru reached a rescheduling agreement on its Dollars 6.5bn debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. Earlier this month Mr Fujimori signed a Dollars 115m loan agreement with the Andean Reserve Fund.</p>

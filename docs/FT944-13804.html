			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iraq should export oil to aid civilians Sir, Blackmail and mass hostage-taking are instruments of policy used by Saddam Hussein, not only internally but also externally. During the occupation of Kuwait, he held foreign civilians hostage: if foreign aircraft bomb my installations, they will bomb their own citizens also. He is now holding the Iraqi people hostage: if the sanctions hurt my regime, they will hurt the Iraqi people also. In both cases he has used large numbers of human beings as an object of blackmail. Back in 1991, UN Resolutions 706 and 712 provided for oil sales by Iraq  - equivalent to Dollars 1.6bn - to finance supplies for essential civilian needs. This sum was to be reviewed according to those needs. However, Saddam Hussein refuses to export oil so that he can use the suffering of the Iraqi people as a means of blackmailing the world into removing the sanctions completely, thus freeing his regime to regain its former power. Well-intentioned people who call for the end of the sanctions should not be deceived by Saddam Hussein, but put pressure on him to export oil for essential civilian needs.

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / OECD takes heat off Bundesbank GERMAN money supply, the supposed hot potato to be juggled at the Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow, seems not so hot after all now that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest economic survey of Germany has handled it with cool detachment. 'The currently rapid money and credit growth has given rise to concern that, if it continues, it may impair the credibility of the monetary authorities by allowing inflationary pressure and expectations to remain strong,' the report says. However, it explains, there are special factors behind the runaway expansion of the broad M3 measure - 9 per cent annualised in May compared with the Bundesbank's 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent target range. To paraphrase the report's delicate language, it says that, since reconstruction of the wrecked eastern economy has increased calls on every conceivable west German resource, it is hardly surprising that money is in demand. There is also evidence of D-Mark hoarding and demand from neighbouring Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where the hardest currency in Europe is widely preferred to the softer local alternatives. The Paris-based organisation believes accordingly: 'A temporary above-target monetary expansion would not seem to call for further tightening of monetary conditions'. Meanwhile, it adds, the interest rates screw must be held down until inflation rates respond. Making no mention of the impact of the maintenance of existing high rates on Germany's partners in the European Monetary System  -Bundesbank policy has been under persistent fire as the main dampening influence on attempts to break out of recession - the report focuses solely on domestic challenges. The OECD notes that the speed at which policy decisions had to be made and implemented has introduced inefficiencies and distortions, particularly in the labour market. It suggests that transfers to the east, equivalent to 25 per cent of western GNP, may be in danger of 'generating negative incentive effects. 'Expenditure on income support that does not produce real investment in human or physical capital will tend to weaken economic incentives and discourage initiative in the new states,' it warns. Job-creation schemes, for example, which are funded by the labour office and pay relatively high wages, are often involved in clean-up and industrial renovation work which could be carried out by private enterprise. Meanwhile, other workers are being paid too much, the study says. Wage deals in 1990 and 1991, in which many eastern German employees were promised pay parity by 1994, took no account of the labour situation in the eastern Lander. Last year's deals should now be renegotiated, the report says. Running a substantial budget deficit - at least for a time - is also acceptable to the OECD's economists as an exceptional response to extraordinary times. A deficit of 2.75 per cent of GNP in 1991, and rising this year, is 'not a sign of over-spending or weakness of the tax system'. It will correct itself as the east catches up, the report claims. However, the rise in government spending in 1990 and 1991 has wiped out virtually all the consolidation gains obtained in the years 1982-1989. Meanwhile, increased taxes and social security contributions have brought the overall tax burden in the west back to the level before the tax reform programme which started in 1986. The government is committed to re-setting the budgetary balance, cutting subsidies and capping public spending with nominal 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent annual increases in federal and state budgets respectively, but the report warns that state and local authority spending is likely to remain 'vigorous'.</p>

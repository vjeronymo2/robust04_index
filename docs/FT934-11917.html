			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / State telecoms executive arrested: Anti-corruption inquiry widens to involve more public-sector figures MR VITO Gamberale, a divisional head at Sip, Italy's main state-controlled telephone utility, was arrested yesterday for alleged attempted extortion concerning a telecommunications contract in the Naples region. This the first time a Sip executive has been linked to anti-corruption investigations. The arrest coincided with that of another prominent public-sector figure, Mr Marcello Inghilese, head of the foreign trade institute (ICE), on charges of fraud concerning the opening of a trade office in Orlando, Florida. Mr Gamberale, head of the cellar telephones division, has previously worked with ENI, the state oil concern, and is considered close to the Socialist Party. He was arrested along with three others, including a local Socialist politician. Naples magistrates alleged Mr Gamberale attempted to threaten the owner of a local telephone equipment company with the loss of a contract unless he employed a specific number of people 'recommended' to him by local political bosses. The Naples magistrates' investigations are part of a broadening inquiry into alleged vote-buying by the most prominent politicians in the Naples region. Their inquiries into telecommunications contracts are separate from those of Milan magistrates. In May and June, Milan magistrates detained a number of senior executives in the state-run telecommunications companies. These included Mr Francisco Silvano, then managing director of Stet, the umbrella telecoms group, and the heads of Sirti (its engineering subsidiary) and Italel, responsible for equipment manufacture. In Milan yesterday, the trial opened of Mr Sergio Cusani, who is suspected of being a key financial intermediary in alleged pay-offs to politicians by Montedison, the industrial arm of the Ferruzzi conglomerate. As the trial opened, Montedison announced it had become a civil party to the case. This appeared to be part of a strategy by the administrators of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group to recover the large amounts believed to have been paid over to politicians, as well as money allegedly siphoned off for personal use by the Ferruzzi family. The Italian Senate yesterday approved a law removing parliamentarians' immunity from interrogation by the judiciary, but preserving their right to resist arrest unless due cause is presented to parliament in written documents.</p>

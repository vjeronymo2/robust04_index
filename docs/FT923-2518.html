			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: D-Mark bloc advances amid hopes of cut in Bundesbank rates RUMOURS that the Bundesbank would announce another cut in interest rates at its regular council meeting today and speculation about a further realignment in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) sent bond markets in the D-Mark bloc sharply higher in hectic afternoon trading. The rumours were fanned by sterling's chronic weakness, which forced the announcement of two interest rate rises during the day. The market had closed long before sterling was eventually suspended in the ERM, with the second of the rate rises - due to take effect today - reversed. Other signs that led the bond markets to believe the Germans would ease interest rates again today were: the Dutch central bank's cut in its key rates for the second time this week, independently of the Bundesbank; Belgium's cut in the discount and emergency lending rates, also for the second time this week; and the Bundesbank's injection of short-term funds into the money market yesterday at rates of around 9.25 per cent. UK government bond prices yesterday managed to shrug off most of the bad news from the currency markets and the two announcements of interest rate rises, leaving many traders perplexed. 'It's difficult to explain,' one trader said. 'It appears that gilt market investors seem more convinced about sterling's long-term position in the ERM than foreign exchange speculators.' Another said that higher interest rates would further undermine an already weak economy, a positive development for bond prices. Long gilt futures bounced strongly yesterday afternoon after opening the day at 96.10, a whole point lower than their close on Tuesday. By late in the afternoon, after trading a massive 92,000 contracts, the futures price had jumped sharply to 98.08. In relatively thin trading, meanwhile, cash prices slipped in medium and longer-dated gilts, with losses of up to  5/8 of a point. Despite the fears for sterling - confirmed by the later suspension of the currency in the ERM - there was steady, if slow, buying of gilts, both from UK and overseas investors. One UK investor said: 'Gilts are really a one-way bet. Either there is a devaluation, in which case rates come down, or the government holds on and rates stay up, which is good for gilt prices because it pushes the economy further into recession.' Other observers also said that higher interest rates would further dampen the economy and kill off any danger of inflation, so helping longer-dated gilts. THE Italian government bond market was largely paralysed in the face of the country's latest foreign exchange crisis yesterday. The lira fell like a stone to its floor in the ERM, prompting analysts to suggest that the currency may have to be taken out of the system until some semblance of stability returns. Bond prices, though, eased back by only about a quarter of a point. Foreign investors have largely abandoned the market in recent weeks, and domestic investors were reported to be largely inactive as they waited for the crisis to be resolved. GERMAN bond prices were boosted by the Bundesbank speculation and an influx of foreign capital. The purchases drove the average yield on German public-sector debt to a new 1992 low of 7.91 per cent, after 8.02 per cent on Tuesday. The benchmark 8.0 per cent July 2002 Bund rose to 103.47 from 102.69 while in London, the December Bund future jumped to 91.20 in late trading from 90.19 in a volume of 12,082 lots. DUTCH 10-year bonds outperformed their German counterparts following the central bank's 25 basis point cut in its three key official rates. Dealers reported that there was active domestic buying across the board, while the seven-year bonds made the biggest gains. The yield on the 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 dropped to 7.87 per cent from 8.01 per cent, while the 10-year Dutch-German yield spread narrowed to 39 points from 41 points. YIELDS on Swedish bonds closed sharply higher but trading ground to a standstill after the Riksbank raised its marginal lending rate to 500 per cent from 75 per cent in the early afternoon. After the move, the central bank said the market could close if traders wished. Dealers said that a krona devaluation was still very much on investors' minds, but that 'there was not a lot one could do against rates of 500 per cent'. Three-month Treasury bills were some 550 basis points higher at 33 per cent while the 11-year bond rose 27 basis points to 11.50 per cent. FRENCH bonds ended a volatile session about a half point higher than Tuesday's close on speculation of a cut in German interest rates and an ERM realignment. Matif bond futures were pushed lower in early trading on the ERM tension and on news that President Francois Mitterrand had prostate cancer. They then lifted on statements that the president was not seriously ill but this was offset by the UK rate rises. The September futures contract settled at 107.92, 46 basis points up on Tuesday's close, having briefly tested resistance at 108.00. It had hit a low of 106.90 after the first rise in UK rates. In the cash market, the 2002 OAT finished 0.82 higher at 99.74 to yield 8.53 per cent after 8.65 per cent. The Matif will open pit trading of its key French Treasury bond future at 7 am local time next Monday, a spokeswoman for the French futures and options exchange said yesterday. The French vote on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. SWISS bonds were in demand as investors switched out of EMS currency-denominated markets. A rise in the Swiss franc against the D-Mark also pushed the market higher. Short-term rates continued to fall, with the benchmark three-month eurofranc rate down at 6 bid in late trading after 7 per cent on Tuesday. In the futures market, December government bond futures jumped to 95.15 from 94.49. At the long end, the Swiss government's 7 per cent bonds due 2005 rose to 102.05 from 101.65. THE long end of the US Treasury bond market dipped slightly yesterday, adding to Tuesday's sharp drop, as Wall Street was further buffeted by the extraordinary developments in the European currency and money markets. After a weak opening, the bond market moved off its lows, encouraged by rumours that the European monetary crisis might force the Bundesbank to cut interest rates further. However, those hopes dissipated when Britain announced its suspension from the Exchange Rate Mechanism to ease the currency crisis. Sentiment was helped, however, by further evidence that the US economy remains extremely sluggish, with the Federal Reserve reporting that August industrial production fell 0.5 per cent, greater than Wall Street's consensus expectation of a 0.3 per cent dip. The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was quoted in late trading at around 99, down  7/32 to yield 7.327, but the short end saw a slight rise, with the 4.25 issue due August 1994 quoted up  3/32 at 100  13/16 to yield 3.797.</p>

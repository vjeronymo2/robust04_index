			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Malaysia makes a pitch for off-shore financial haven: Kieran Cooke visits Labuan, Mahathir's dream of an East Asian equivalent of the 'Eldorados' off the US and Europe BUSINESS is brisk at the Casanova Bar in downtown Labuan. Girls from the Philippines, some recently working the bars round the now closing US military bases, have drifted south into Malaysian waters. The drink is cheap. The air conditioning is turned high against the tropical heat. A man from nearby officially-dry Brunei is knocking back doubles of top-shelf whisky. Labuan is a 92-sq-km island in the South China Sea, about 10km off the west coast of the island of Borneo. To some it is as remote a place as is possible to find. But to the Malaysian government it is the new financial Eldorado, set to join the list of leading international offshore financial centres round the world. A high-powered roadshow, led by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's minister of finance, is due this month to explain the attractions of Labuan to financiers in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Similar events are planned in Europe. The idea of making Labuan an IOFC (the Malaysian authorities studiously avoid the term tax haven) was first mooted by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, in 1989. The rationale behind the project was straightforward. The bulk of the world's offshore financial centres are either off the coast of the US, in the Caribbean or clustered round Europe. East Asia is the most dynamic economic region in the world yet only Hong Kong and Singapore have any IOFC status. The Malaysian government felt that enough financial business was being generated in the region to justify the existence of another centre. Malaysia alone, with an economy growing at more than 8 per cent a year, needed the facilities of an IOFC. A growing need was perceived to develop Malaysia's financial services industry: in the process the aim was to encourage progress in East Malaysia, one of the country's least developed regions. Some Malaysians had to reach for the maps to locate Labuan. The sceptics were in full cry. 'Who would want set up shop in such a place?' they said. Yet plenty have - to date 57 offshore companies have established operations on Labuan. Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has issued seven offshore banking licences and two offshore insurance licences. A number of trust companies, law firms and accounting practices have also been established on the island. Even experienced offshore operators in Singapore have been surprised at the speed at which business has developed on Labuan. Since the island was officially declared open for offshore activities in October 1990 funds deposited with offshore banks are estimated at well over Dollars 500m (Pounds 251m) with loans issued more than Dollars 400m. While such figures hardly compare with the estimated Dollars 200bn of offshore funds deposited in Singapore, most concede that Labuan has made a good start. 'We always knew it would take time to develop business,' says Mr Mainor Awang, manager of the Labuan Development Authority, 'But so far we are very encouraged by the interest shown.' The ideas of Dr Mahathir, considered by many to be the principal architect of Malaysia's economic success, are not treated lightly. Labuan has been pump-primed with official funding and many hours of ministerial attention. The government puts great emphasis on Labuan's minimal regulatory framework and the IOFC's strict provisions on secrecy and confidentiality, though it has also said all applications for licences will be 'carefully screened' to exclude money laundering operations. The government says Labuan's tax package is among the most attractive of any IOFC. Offshore trading companies can elect to pay either 3 per cent of net profits or a maximum of MDollars 20,000 (Pounds 4,020) on their operations. Hong Kong has a 16.5 per cent corporate tax rate; Singapore has a 31 corporate tax rate though many offshore activities are taxed at a lower level. Mr Kamari Zaman, Bank Negara's manager on Labuan, says it is likely that more Hong Kong money will be attracted to Labuan in the run-up to 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule. There is also a great deal of Japanese interest, in particular from Japanese banks lending to companies investing in Malaysia. 'Some might think we are remote but Labuan is strategically placed, right in the middle of an expanding region' says Mr Kamari. But Labuan faces several problems. Most financial operations on the island are still Malaysia-related. If it is to succeed it needs the presence of big foreign banks and other financial institutions. Seducing the big players to set up on Labuan will not be easy. Many other IOFC's have developed their operations in tandem with tourism. Though the government has poured millions into Labuan, infrastructure is limited. With only one direct Kuala Lumpur flight per day, most connections have to be made through long flights via East Malaysia. Another problem the potential Labuan inhabitant faces is staff. There are only about 40,000 people on Labuan, a large portion of them immigrants from the Philippines and Indonesia. Skills are limited. Financial institutions will have to offer attractive benefits packages to staff: Malaysia has serious labour shortages and workers will be reluctant to move from urban centres to an outpost such as Labuan. While Labuan's corporate tax rate is low, personal tax rates are higher than either Hong Kong or Singapore. Over the years Labuan has been known as a haven for smugglers. Now it wants to be a home to financiers. The Casanova bar is looking forward to a new clientele.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / London keeps its banking status LONDON maintained its status as Europe's main financial centre last year with the number of banks leaving the city equalling those moving in. The latest survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which specialises in financial statistics, shows that 22 banks moved out of the capital last year while the same number moved in. The number of foreign banks in London totalled 494. According to the survey, however, seven of the apparent departures were the result of mergers or restructuring of foreign banks. European banks accounted for more than half the departures or mergers and US banks for another five. These included the merger of Security Pacific National Bank with Bank of America and that of Manufacturers Hanover Trust with Chemical Bank. Pressure on US banks has led to a steady decrease in their presence in London from 77 in 1982 down to 45 last year. For the first time since 1960, the number of Japanese banks in London fell - to 52 last year from 54 with the departure of Nippon Trust and Hyogo banks. New Foreign Banks in London.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek Deputy National Defense Minister Nikolaos  Kouris said the unified defense doctrine has a clearly defensive  and preventive dimension, which at the same time improves the  negotiating position of Cyprus during the talks being held under  UN auspices.    Speaking last night in Athens, Kouris also stressed that  Turkey's provocations in connection with challenging Greek  airspace over the Aegean has caused tension that could erupt  into violent incidents at any time. If the violent incidents  increase, he added, they could lead to a huge clash. Kouris  also said that Turkey's direct military threats, with actions  and plans against Cyprus and Greece, come from Ankara's  intention to change the balance of power in the region. He said  that Greece also faces medium- and long-term threats in relation  to Macedonia and North Epirus.</p>

Judge  Doug Tucker gave Acosta one round.  </P> <P> The 22-year-old Carbajal used a four-inch height advantage and an extra 4 1/2  inches of reach to sting Acosta to the body and head, staggering the Mexico  City fighter several times in the middle and late rounds. Neither boxer went  down.  </P> <P> Carbajal, the North American Boxing Federation flyweight champion, will  challenge IBF junior flyweight titleholder Muangshai Kittikasem of Thailand for  his belt May 13 at Atlantic City.  </P></p>

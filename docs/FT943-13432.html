			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Legal and General's new business decline Legal &amp; General, the investment management and financial services group, saw the value of its worldwide new business fall from Pounds 156.1m to Pounds 146.3m in the first half of 1994. The group, which calculates the figures by adding 10 per cent of single premiums to annual premium income, said UK life and pensions premiums fell from Pounds 102.3m to Pounds 122.7m in the first half. Although UK annual premiums also fell, the downturn was offset by Pounds 74.7m (Pounds 54m) generated by its unit trust operations and Pounds 44m (Pounds 33.4m) from overseas businesses. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said: 'The current UK market for our products has proved difficult and this has been reflected in our new business figures.' The group's direct salesforce has been cut from 2,400 to 1,900 to improve efficiency, but Mr Prosser warned that the operating environment was unlikely to improve in the short term.</p>

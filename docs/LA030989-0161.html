			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGES;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO WINS ON MCTAGGART'S HOMER  </P> <P> John McTaggart got a mistake -- a hanging breaking pitch -- and turned it into  a two-run home run in the ninth inning that gave Rancho Santiago a 9-7 victory  over Cypress in an Orange Empire Conference baseball game Wednesday at Cypress.  </P> <P> The home run, McTaggart's second in two days and fourth of the season, came off  Jeff Patterson and broke a 7-7 tie. Cypress got a lead-off single from Doug  Yates in the bottom of the ninth and a two-out walk to Bobby Thome, but Jim  Short flied out to end the game.  </P> <P> Patterson (5-1), who is one of the top pitchers in Orange County, struggled  most of the game.  </P> <P> He allowed 10 hits, including two home runs. He also threw wild pitches to  allow two runs and balked in another.  </P> <P> Sean Ramos hit a solo home run in the fourth off Patterson, who had a 2.02  earned-run average coming into the game.  </P> <P> "That wasn't the real Jeff Patterson," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "He  battled the whole game, but he just didn't have very good stuff."  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago pitcher Willie Navarrette (4-2) was only a little better.  </P> <P> He allowed nine hits, including a home run and four doubles, but also pitched a  complete game.  </P> <P> "He stayed with it the whole way through," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon  said. "We needed him to go nine innings to alleviate the pressure on the rest  of the staff."  </P> <P> Because of rainouts last week, conference teams are playing four games this  week instead of three.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago opened a 6-2 lead going, but Cypress scored four runs in the  fifth. Jason Friedman hit a two-run home run, and Short had a two-run double.  It was Friedman's fifth home run of the season and extended his hitting streak  to 11 games.  </P> <P> Each team scored a run in the seventh.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago (11-6 overall, 4-0 in conference play) moves into first place.  Cypress (15-5, 3-1) falls to second. STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

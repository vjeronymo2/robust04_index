			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 73% rise at Bemrose Bemrose Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer which is now the largest supplier to the US advertising specialty market following a series of acquisitions, yesterday reported sharply higher 1993 pre-tax profits. Pre-tax profits rose by 73 per cent from Pounds 6.26m to Pounds 10.8m and included a Pounds 579,000 profit on the sale of a subsidiary. Turnover grew to Pounds 89m (Pounds 49.3m) including Pounds 40m from acquisitions. Earnings per share, including the profit on disposal, grew to 30.47p (22.18p). An unchanged final dividend of 7.45p makes a total of 11.75p (same) on increased capital. The shares closed 1p higher at 453p. Operating profits jumped to Pounds 11.87m (Pounds 5.48m) with all of the increase coming from acquisitions. Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said that in the UK, earnings and operating profits were maintained despite margins coming under pressure. The continued downturn in UK bank cheque printing was offset by gains in other security products. Sales of promotional products were a little higher, but margins tightened. Nevertheless, all the group's businesses in the promotional sector performed close to 1992 levels, including Barnard and Jackson, the diary manufacturer acquired in April. In the US - the focus for the group's recent expansion which has been funded through two rights issues - operating profits increased, with additional gains generated by the strengthening dollar. The US businesses, including Bemrose Yattendon, previously a 50:50 joint venture company, contributed Pounds 4.65m to operating profits. COMMENT 1993 was a transition year for Bemrose which has successfully built a new US leg to its operations. With margins under pressure in the UK and the traditional cheque printing business in decline, the US businesses should help maintain profit and earnings growth this year. Profits of around Pounds 11.8m are likely this year, producing earnings of about 28.4p. The shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16 and the price looks about right.</p>

DEP leader Hatip Dicle said that free local elections  must be held under equal conditions so that the Kurdish problem  can be resolved in unity. He asserted: "We wish to take part  in the elections. However, free elections must be held under  equal conditions. A cease-fire must be imposed to end  bloodshed."    Hatip Dicle and DEP Deputies Seat Yurttas, Nizamettin Toguc,  and Slim Sadak held a news conference in the Milan movie theater  at 1100 yesterday morning. Extensive security measures were  taken during the news conference, which was attended by 250  people. Dicle disclosed the names of the DEP candidate mayors  from eastern and southeastern Turkey, and said: "I urge the  government to reconsider the need to resolve the Kurdish problem  in unity." Claiming that attacks on his party have increased,  Dicle asserted: "Won't these attacks cast a shadow on the  elections?"    Hatip Dicle recalled the arrest of several DEP candidate  mayors and claimed that the pressure on members of his party has  been intensified. He said he will hold talks with President  Demirel and ask for help. Stressing that the European  Parliament will send observers to the local elections, Dicle  asserted: "We will explain our anxiety to President Demirel and  inform him about the DEP policy on solving the Kurdish problem.  Furthermore, we will discuss the realization of the European  Parliament's call for holding secure local elections."    The DEP's candidate mayors from the eastern and southeastern  provinces are as follows: Meting Toprak from Diyarbakir; Bedim  Cetin from Adiyaman; Osman Nuri Aksoy from Agri; Ishak Tape from  Bitlis; Mevlut Ilk from Gaziantep; Huseyin Mit from Hakkari;  Mehmet Emil Ozdemir from Gus; Is Mail Itik from Karl; Hasan  Dogan from Malatya; Aziz Saran from Marvin; Ali Gokot from  Kahramanmaras; Cihan Sin Car from Kiziltepe; Atilla Kizilaslan  from Tunceli; Muhsin Melik from Sanliurfa; Sahabettin Ozarslaner  from Van; Ramazan Buzgan from Bingo; Emil Adiyaman from Igdir;  and Ilhan Clear from Boatman.</p>

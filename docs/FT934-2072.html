			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance turned back in nervous session - Market report A nervous stock market in London yesterday fell prey to a host of unsettling factors, ranging from the implications of the Russian election results to the prospects for interest rates in continental Europe and moves by the US and the European Union towards a settlement of the Gatt debate. Adding to uncertainty was heightened activity in stock index futures ahead of expiry on Friday of the December future contract on the Footsie index. An erratic trading session saw the FT-SE 100 Index travel through a range of nearly 35 points before closing 6.2 down at 3,248.4. Traders sounded uncomfortable at the close, pointing to weakness in other European bourses after reported comments from Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky of Russia's Liberal Democrats party, and to falls in UK bonds. Equity trading volumes increased as share prices eased in the second half of the session. 'We've had all the good news for a while. Now is the time to watch out,' commented the leading dealer at a US house. The session started well, with the Footsie soon ahead by 23 points at an intra-day peak of 3,277.6 as firmness in the December stock index future supported hopes that the domestic Retail Price Index, due this morning, and the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow, will open the way to a cut of at least half a point in domestic interest rates before Christmas. However, analysts and traders in the Continental markets were clearly more cautious than London ahead of the Bundesbank meeting, and UK stocks began to falter as currency markets moved nervously. Dealers said that buyers were less willing to chase share prices until the stock index futures market clears its expiry hurdle. Record closes overnight in key US stock market indices had given London a boost at first but the new session saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average turning off from a firm start to show a fall of 10 points in UK trading hours. International blue chip stocks drew sustenance from the firmness of the US dollar which helps their overseas sales and profits. Pharmaceutical stocks achieved a scattering of gains which helped the Footsie Index. Among domestic issues, Trafalgar House, the hotels and shipping group, delivered the disappointments for which the stock market was braced. Higher dividend payments continued to help some utility stocks and the expected indications of further bid activity surfaced among in the television sector. Trading volume, moderate at first, had increased by the close of business to a Seaq total of 705.4m shares, compared with 654.1m on Monday, when retail or customer trade was worth Pounds 1.4bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.7 ahead at another new peak of 3,614.3, but its gain had been halved in the second half of the day. Trade in non-Footsie stocks increased to around 63 per cent of the day's total. Optimism on the outlook for UK interest rates was helped by reports from the Confederation of British Industry of increased retail sales. But the overall market prediction is that today will bring news of a small rise in domestic Retail Price Index in November. With international funds unwilling to chase share prices in London this week, the stock market is influenced by near-term and largely domestic considerations, with Friday's expiry in derivatives markets in both London and New York an important factor.</p>

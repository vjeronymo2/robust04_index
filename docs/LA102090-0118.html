			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEOPLE  </P> <P> If your child thinks carrots come from the grocery store and peanuts are  manufactured in a factory and sealed in a can, perhaps it's time to consider a  back-yard garden.  </P> <P> "We see a lot of youngsters here who have no idea how vegetables are grown,"  said Jim Bailey, a former agriculture teacher at Sunny Hills High School in  Fullerton. He donates his time and expertise at the Youth Garden at the Orange  County Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> The fairgrounds in Costa Mesa operates a youth garden at its year-round farm.  Youngsters can see firsthand how carrots, lettuce, beans and tomatoes are  grown. In addition, more unusual "crops" are also grown here -- grapes,  berries, peanuts and popcorn.  </P> <P> "Tour groups come by to see how these foods are grown as well as visit with the  animals at the farm," Bailey said. "We started the garden about two years ago,  and 16,000 children have come through since then."  </P> <P> Bailey stressed the importance of youngsters knowing about agriculture and  where they get their food and what it takes to produce it.  </P> <P> "In Southern California, many children haven't seen gardens or fields of  vegetables growing," he said. "It's hard for them to realize the time and  effort it takes to grow what they eat."  </P> <P> That's unfortunate, according to Bailey, because a back-yard garden can be an  educational experience for youngsters. And in Orange County, the weather  provides opportunities for year-round growing. Even preschoolers can get  involved on a limited basis. By the time children are 6 or 7, they can take  further responsibility for a garden with some adult supervision.  </P> <P> "With youngsters, start by giving them a seed, like squash, and plant it in a  cup," Bailey said. "When it's about two inches high, they can transplant it out  in the yard."  </P> <P> Radishes are another good choice for first-time farmers, because they grow  rapidly. In 28 days, they're ready to eat.  </P> <P> "With children, it's nice to grow something fairly quickly to maintain their  interest," Bailey said. "With carrots, it can take a lot longer for the  results. By that point, the child may have given up."  </P> <P> During the warmer spring and summer months, recommended fruits and vegetables  for a back-yard garden include beans, tomatoes, melons, cucumbers,  strawberries, peas and peppers. In the fall and winter, turn to the leafy  members of the vegetable family: cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels  sprouts and different types of lettuce. Such vegetables as squash and zucchini  are other garden favorites of children; they are easy to grow and produce  multiple offerings from one plant.  </P> <P> But what if your yard is too small? Not to worry.  </P> <P> "You really don't need a lot of room to grow vegetables," Bailey said. "In  fact, I have a planter at home that is four feet wide and about 15 feet long.  In it I grow radishes, carrots, beets, cauliflower and several types of  lettuce. In a space that size, about 60 square feet, there's plenty of room to  grow enough vegetables to feed a whole family." Gardens can also be grown in  containers.  </P> <P> A six-inch pot is all that's required to grow about four or five beet plants,  although a tub is needed to grow honeydew. Herbs are another option for  container gardening, and many nurseries and seed catalogues feature mini, dwarf  and compact versions of different vegetables.  </P> <P> "With very little space, children can learn about the growing cycle and achieve  hands-on learning," Bailey said. "They begin to understand concepts of  germination and the effects of the seasons and the weather. Agriculture is a  science and there's no end to the experiments you can try. You can water one  area more than another and see what happens. Or fertilize one section and not  another. Measure the plants as they grow to see how quickly they shoot up. Do  they grow better in the sun or the shade?"  </P> <P> Children can also be taught the parts of a plant (roots, stem, seeds, leaves)  and even "dissect" flowers to locate the stamen, petals, sepal and pistil.  </P> <P> Even garden "pests" can provide learning experiences. Bailey recommended  turning ladybugs loose in the garden to eat the aphids that may appear.  Earthworms can help aerate the soil and teach children lessons about how  different life forms interact. Bailey also recommends using organic materials  to control insects -- especially if children are involved in tending the  garden.  </P> <P> "At the youth garden, we work with integrated pest control," he said. "That  means we use ladybugs as well as organic materials to control insects. You can  purchase organic materials at most nurseries. Just check the bottle to make  sure it says 'organic.' "  </P> <P> Another advantage of back-yard gardening is its minimal expense. Other than  seeds, the only tools that are required are a can or hose for watering, a  pointed-nose shovel for digging, a hoe for weeding and making furrows, and a  rake to break up dirt and spread soil. An occasional feeding of fertilizer is  recommended to enhance growth. But what you spend on the garden can be saved on  the grocery bill.  </P> <P> But with all the other opportunities around, why is it important for a child to  know about gardening?  </P> <P> "First, it's educational," Bailey said. "It's a living science experiment, and  I also think kids need to be involved in a hands-on working environment. And  gardening is . . . a different kind of work. You get dirty and you get tired,  but it's worth it when you see the results of your work. Children are very  proud when their gardens begin to yield fruit and vegetables. . . . They are  even more likely to eat something if they've grown it themselves."  </P> <P> Children can achieve a sense of satisfaction and learn patience while they wait  for their gardens to bear, Bailey said. They also learn responsibility by  nurturing it -- watering, weeding and taking care of garden pests.  </P> <P> As a former agriculture teacher, Bailey said he was pleasantly surprised by the  number of students who wanted to learn more about agriculture.  </P> <P> "The truth is that youngsters are interested in gardening," he said. "If you  give them the responsibility and some direction, they can do very well."  </P> <P>  For further information on the children's tours at the Youth Garden at Orange  County Fairgrounds, call (714) 751-3247.  </P> <P>  For further information on gardening with your children, other resources  include:  </P> <P>  National Gardening Assn., Youth Programs, 180 Flynn Ave., Burlington, Vt.  05401.  </P> <P>  "A Book of Vegetables," by Harriet L.

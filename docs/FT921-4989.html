			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Renishaw down 24% to Pounds 4.1m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Renishaw, the maker of precision metrology and inspection equipment, fell 24 per cent from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 4.1m in the half-year to December 31. Sales fell from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 21.3m reflecting a depressed worldwide machine tool sector. Mr David McMurtry, chairman, blamed most of the profit fall on the decision to maintain research and development expenditure and investment in manufacturing which is running at an annual rate of Pounds 5m. Earnings per share fell to 6.1p (7.6p). An interim dividend of 2.5p (2p) is declared.</p>

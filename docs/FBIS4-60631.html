			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid's envoy  Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas today asked Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to reinstate south  Yemen's membership in the Arab League.    Following his meeting with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid this afternoon,  al-'Attas stated that the issue of reinstating south Yemen will  be added to the agenda of the League's ministerial council. He  added that he requested the League's support in tackling the  Yemeni situation. He noted that his current tour of Arab states  aims to discuss the recognition of the new situation in Yemen  and returning the situation to what it was before May 1990, the  date on which unity was declared between the two sectors of  Yemen.    Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the Yemeni Socialist  Party's political bureau, who attended the meeting, expects  several Arab states to recognize the Democratic Republic of  Yemen soon. He said Dr. al-'Attas will tour the Gulf states  after his visit to Cairo.    Al-Dali believes it is unlikely north Yemen will end the  ongoing military battles to its advantage. He also denied that  south Yemen received military assistance from any Arab or  foreign state.</p>

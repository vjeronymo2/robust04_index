The House had earlier discussed voting on Republican Decree  No. 33 of 1992, which concerns the salaries and pensions of the  Armed Forces and security personnel, in light of the provisions  enshrined in Articles 83 and 130 of the bylaws of the House of  Representatives. The House postponed voting on the  aforementioned decree to its next session.    At the outset of its session today, the House discussed the  overall economic situation, and particularly the declining  exchange rate of the Yemeni currency, the exorbitant cost of  living, and price hikes of staples, foremost among which are  food supplies, medicines, and other basic survival requirements  throughout the Republic of Yemen. The House decided to hold a  general debate on this issue in the presence of government  ministers in the session it will hold on the morning of Monday  [10 January], God willing, to make firm decisions to address the  people's living conditions, remedy the situation of the Yemeni  currency, and accord due attention to public issues that concern  citizens throughout the country.    The House asked the House committee assigned the task of  finding the facts pertaining to the current political crisis to  continue its duties in light of the accomplishments it has thus  far made, and to inform the House of the results of the tasks it  will undertake during the next phase without any delay.    For the Ministry of Transportation, the session was attended  by Ahmad Hasan Qa'id, director general of the Public Postal  Organization, and 'Ali Muhammad al-Qasim, director general of  the Postal Services Department.</p>

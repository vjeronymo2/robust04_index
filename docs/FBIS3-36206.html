			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Satisfaction in Moscow"] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Feb -- The report that the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] authorities have provided CSCE  states with information on their military forces -- their status  as of 1 January 1994 -- for the first time since the collapse of  former Yugoslavia has been welcomed with satisfaction in Russia.  This was stated at a briefing by G. Karasin, director of the  Foreign Ministry Department of Information and the Press.    A document distributed by FRY representatives in Vienna  notes  that the Yugoslav Army does not plan to deploy additional  categories of heavy weapons or operational systems on its  territory in 1994, the Russian Foreign Ministry representative  reported.    "The provision of data about the stationing of troops and  their armaments in conditions of constant combat action in  Bosnia and Herzegovina is evidence, in our opinion, of the FRY's  commitment to solving the problems of military security and  stability in the region," Karasin noted.</p>

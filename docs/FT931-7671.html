			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: UAP share sale fuels Adidas controversy UNION des Assurances de Paris, the largest French insurance group, has fuelled the political controversy over last week's sale of Adidas by announcing that it plans to sell its shares in the German sporting goods group. UAP last week joined forces with two other French state-controlled financial groups in a consortium that bought the controlling stake in Adidas for DM615m (Dollars 370.4m) from Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman recently reappointed to the French cabinet as minister of towns. The involvement of three state companies in the deal has already provoked a political row in France. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, told yesterday's edition of Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that he had instructed Banque Worms, the UAP subsidiary responsible for the transaction, to withdraw from Adidas 'in the near future, as soon as the financial climate is right'. Banque Worms, which originally held a 2 per cent holding in BTF, the German holding company that controls Adidas, raised its stake to 5 per cent under the terms of last week's deal. Mr Peyrelevade's statement comes only a few days after the French government issued an official denial through the finance ministry that it had exerted any influence over the companies involved with the Adidas transaction. President Francois Mitterrand on Friday claimed on French television that all three groups had decided to buy shares from Mr Tapie on an independent basis. Adidas has just emerged from a turbulent period since Mr Tapie took over in summer 1990 when its financial performance deteriorated and its workforce has been racked by protests against rationalisation plans. It saw net profits fall from DM52m in 1990 to DM15m on static sales of DM3.35bn in 1991 and is believed to have gone into the red last year.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Exclude Saddam That President Saddam Hussein cannot get away with invading Kuwait was conclusively demonstrated in 1991. That he can be deterred from invading it, in spite of the certain consequences, is less sure. He only has to look as if he might be about to try, and thousands of troops and aircraft are rushed to the scene. This procedure is expensive and if repeated would be undignified. Mr Saddam is well aware of that. In fact he is probably enjoying the commotion he has caused. Even if it does not pay any diplomatic dividend, such as a Russian-brokered deal involving an easing or gradual lifting of sanctions, it shows that he still has the capacity to induce something like panic in the international community. That may make him look stronger and so reinforce his grip on his own armed forces. The US and Kuwait are rightly looking for ways to make it more difficult for him to achieve this effect. The no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel, imposed in August 1992, already helps, since it deprives his forces of air cover as soon as they are within 130 miles of the Kuwaiti border. But clearly it is not enough. So they are canvassing the idea of a total exclusion zone, in which the movement of troops and military equipment would be banned on the ground as well as in the air. Such a zone has been imposed by the allies north of the 36th parallel since April 1991, and has helped to preserve the Kurdish 'safe haven' in the north-east. If only the same had been done in the south in March 1991, Mr Saddam would surely not have been able to defeat the Shia rebellion in the south. At the time, the US declined ostentatiously to give any support to the rebels, although it had half a million men virtually within earshot of what was happening. President Bush's spokesman, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, even stated publicly that the US had no objection to the use of helicopter gunships to suppress the revolt. The only reason given publicly for this attitude at the time was an unconvincing, and in the circumstances hardly appropriate, neutrality in Iraq's internal affairs. The real reason was that the US feared a Shia success would mean that Iraq, or at any rate the southern half of it, would become a satellite of revolutionary Iran. Washington hoped and believed the Iraqi army, having suppressed the revolt and secured the integrity of the country, would depose Mr Saddam and replace him with a more pliable regime. That strategy has manifestly failed. The US is now supporting an alternative leadership, the Iraqi National Congress, which has brought together Kurdish, Shia and some Sunni opponents of Mr Saddam. The right course now would be to declare southern Iraq a demilitarised zone, and encourage the INC to establish its authority there. It is hard to believe Mr Saddam's regime could long survive in Baghdad once more than half the country was outside its control.</p>

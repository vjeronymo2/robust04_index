			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa open offer Shareholders in Havelock Europa applied for a total of 309,845 shares under the recent open offer, 3.09 per cent of the total available. Havelock explained that the outcome was in line with expectations, as nine out of 11 of the principal shareholders took part in the placing and, therefore, did not apply for further new shares in the offer. Shares not applied for under the open offer will be subscribed by placees who have undertaken to take the shares in full.</p>

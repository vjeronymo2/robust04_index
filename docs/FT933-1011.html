			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (8): Enfranchisement: the word means freedom - Gerald Cadogan explains how the new leasehold reform act will work / The rental sector THE ENGLISH and Welsh property markets enter a new phase on November 1 when the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 comes into force. When the measure left the House of Commons for the Lords its proposals for leasehold reform had provoked strong reactions from landlords, especially in central London where many of the great estates are situated. Both landlords and leaseholders are perhaps happier now that the Lords have had their say, although the act will still not satisfy those who saw it as a big step towards abolishing the leasehold system altogether. Indeed, Charles Boston, of surveyor Francis Russell, claims: 'The attractive option of a 90-year lease extension (as contained in the act) will perpetuate the system.' From November, though, many people will have the option to enfranchise - the official term for acquiring the freehold of your house or flat. For complete details, the act can be obtained from Her Majesty's Stationery Office for Pounds 19.65, while the department of the environment has prepared a booklet for libraries and citizens' advice bureaux. The DoE also is planning an advisory agency to help with more complex matters, such as when capital gains tax applies. Liability could arise, for example, when enfranchised owners sell a lease to a third party who was not an original member of the group enfranchising. The main aims of the act are: To give long leaseholders the right to take a full share - financially and in management - in the ownership of where they live. This will be done by giving them a right to buy their freehold or extend their leases, so improving immediately the chances of around 750,000 leasehold flat-owners in England and Wales to get a mortgage for what have been, until now, diminishing assets. The lease extension alternative will be equally effective in improving the scope for getting a mortgage. To improve the quality of management. This often is woeful, especially in outer London and the south-east. On the great central London estates, complaints about the expense of management are heard regularly. For enfranchising houses, the act extends the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as modified by the Housing Act 1974) and keeps its residency test. Thus, the property must have been the owner's main residence for the past three years or three of the past 10. The original lease must be over 21 years and the ground rent low. The old test of a rateable value limit of Pounds 1,500 in London, or Pounds 750 elsewhere, is scrapped. The new criterion is that the ground rent must have been two-thirds or less of the rateable value when the lease was granted (or of the letting value if that was before April 1 1963), or not over Pounds 1,000 in London (Pounds 250 elsewhere) for a lease granted after March 31 1990. Thus, leasehold houses with high ground rents (which applies to many new leases) have no chance of enfranchising until there is another change of law. The alternative of a 50-year lease extension beyond the original date of expiry is still available - but only for houses that satisfy the rateable value limits of the 1967/1974 rules, not for those that now meet the 1993 low rent rules for enfranchising. There is no capital cost for an extension but it does involve a 'modern' (high) ground rent which can be reviewed after 25 years. Any right to buy the freehold is lost. While mews dwellings, with a separately-let garage underneath, cannot be enfranchised, they could qualify for lease extensions. Houses in cathedral closes will be enfranchiseable if they qualify. With flats, the the new rules for enfranchisement say: The building cannot have more than 10 per cent of its private floor space used commercially. This means that if the ground floor is all shops, the block must be more than 10 floors high to qualify. (If it does, the leaseholders' company - which must be formed in any case to acquire the freehold - will have to buy out the commercial interest, too. This could be very costly). The building must be a vertical unit. This excludes some flat conversions which spread across what were originally two or more houses. There must be two or more flats. In addition, two-thirds or more of them must be let on qualifying leases (more than over 21 years) and at a low ground rent (as for houses). At least two-thirds of the qualifying leaseholders must give notice of wanting to buy the freehold, and they must own at least half the total number of flats in the building. Likewise, at least half of these qualifying leaseholders must have occupied their flats as their only or main home for the previous year (not three years, as for houses) or for three of the past 10. Excluded from enfranchising are business tenants; tenants with three or more flats in the building (none qualifies); and cases where two-thirds of the qualifying leases end in the next five years and the landlord intends to re-develop. Converted houses with up to four flats and a resident landlord (or adult members of his family) do not qualify, either. There is a blanket exclusion for National Trust and Crown property, although the Crown might not always enforce this. Also excluded are buildings owned by trusts and associations providing charitable housing (this does not include Smith's Charity in South Kensington, London) and buildings exempted by the Treasury from inheritance tax, such as (leased) dower houses forming part of a stately home. There may be only 80-100 such cases in England and Wales. There is also an exclusion under the 1967 act for houses where the landlord intends to move in and had an interest before April 1966 - meaning that, if he bought it after that date, he should have known he could face enfranchisement. Flat leaseholders will have an individual right to a 90-year lease extension at a peppercorn rent (whether or not they qualify for collective enfranchisement) if they have occupied the flat as a main or principal home for three years (or three of the past 10). This does not apply to corporate leaseholders, who cannot extend their leases compulsorily in this way. It can apply to people owning two or more flats in the building, but it could be hard to pass the residency test. Such extensions are renewable - and may still qualify for enfranchisement. The price for extensions is calculated like that for enfranchising and will include an element of 'injurious affection' to compensate the freeholder for the compulsory purchase and loss of development potential, or decline of value in adjacent land he owns. But the landlord can counter the purchase with a proposal to re-develop. However, the price for enfranchising could be daunting. It includes the freeholder's interest (the ground rent discounted over the remaining period of the lease), plus at least 50 per cent of the 'marriage value' (MV) - the increase in property value by combining the freehold and leasehold interests) - plus buying out intermediate interests such as head leases, plus injurious affection, plus the landlord's costs, plus the leaseholders' own costs. On leases near expiry which are approaching a freehold status, the 50 per cent minimum of the MV could rise to 80-90 per cent or more. And, in blocks of flats, the total price depends partly on how many leaseholders take part. 'It will incorporate MV in respect of participants and possible 'hope value' (of a better deal some time later) for those not participating,' says Boston. 'The corollary is that it is not just a matter of dividing a cake of set size. The cake will vary in size.' To enfranchise, it is wise to seek professional advice from the start. And it is essential to go through the steps by the times specified in the act, or the effort will fail. The strict timetable for both sides cuts to a minimum the grey period when a group of leaseholders starts the process, affecting the sale value of flats that are not joining in. The act also allows tenants to appoint their own auditor if the management is not doing its job or is charging too much. The environment secretary can approve codes of management. While these will not be binding legally, infringing them can be used as evidence. 'Tenants will benefit most when the open market value of their leases is about half of the freehold vacant possession value,' Boston says. In London, that means leases with 20-25 years left. In view of the cost and fuss of enfranchising, lease extensions could end up as the most popular option. In the future, as present 80-90 year leases run down, ever more leaseholders will be glad they are no longer pariahs to the mortgage companies but can show evidence of a continuing asset. The new act extends the 1967 act's system for compulsory purchase of property for reasons other than the public good. Landlords have attacked this as a denial of contracts made freely (although that principle fell in 1967) and leaseholders feel it has too many traps. All will watch the first cases attentively. Enfranchising should not, however, affect the look of the great London estates. Amendments to the original bill tightened the rules for estate management schemes after enfranchisement. They allow English Heritage (or the local authority) to run a scheme as a last resort in a conservation area; or for the landlord to transfer it - say, to the association of new freeholders - when he does not own enough freeholds to keep his interest. That is well into the next century, though. In the meantime, if you live in a flat and want to enfranchise, make sure you get on with your neighbours. * For further information, try Leasehold Reform (Pounds 10), available from the law firm of Macfarlanes (071-831 9222) or Property Vision (071-602 8788); and Understanding Leasehold Enfranchisement, from Francis Russell (071-225 3344).</p>

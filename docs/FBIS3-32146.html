			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] We talked to National Baseball Commissioner  (Domingo Sabala), who leaves for Japan tomorrow. We are going to  hear an excerpt of our conversation. Our first question to him  was: What are the fundamental objectives of this trip?    [Begin (Sabala) recording] The fundamental objectives of the  trip are to analyze with the Japanese Amateur Federation the  1994 agreement it has with Cuba, which is a very broad  agreement. We (?plan to go there, in) June, with amateurs and  professionals, with our team. And (?we will be in Japan again)  in September-October, with professional teams.    There are plans for Japan to come to Cuba in February, with  the national team, and a university team from Sendai to come to  Cuba, in February. They are also interested in [words  indistinct] Cuban technicians to work with their university  team; and there is also a juvenile program established, for  youths 16-18 years of age from the Cuban team to go to Japan for  15 days beginning in 1994 -- because there is an annual plan for  the relations between our teams for the youth world championship.    These are, broadly speaking, the things that we are going to  discuss in Japan, and from that will emerge other talks. They  want exchanges with our technicians, which are taking place now.  Pedro Medina and Calzadilla will be traveling with me. They are  going to work with the Dragons, in (Denagoya); the following  week, Miguelito and Chinea from Villa Clara will go to work with  the Tokyo Giants [words indistinct] give some 15-day courses,  for our improvement. And they are also interested in learning  the technical (?elements) of our baseball. (end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

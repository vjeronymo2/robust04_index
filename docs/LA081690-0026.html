			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAD MAKES THE DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> A good loaf of bread is harder to come by than a great sandwich filling.  Whether you are serving a humble peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a  sophisticated lobster club, the quality of the bread is important.  </P> <P> So is freshness: The best breads have no preservatives and a low proportion of  fat, causing them to stale quickly.  </P> <P> Whether you make your own bread or search out the best in bakeries, you can  count on the freezer to keep your loaf in good shape until you're ready to use  it. Freezing bread properly is easy to do once you know the specifics. Here's  how:  </P> <P> * Freeze bread while very fresh but completely cool.  </P> <P> * Place a loaf of bread in the freezer, unwrapped, until just frozen solid  (waiting to wrap the bread until it's frozen reduces, if not prevents, the  formation of ice crystals).  </P> <P> * Once frozen, it is necessary to double wrap the loaf of bread in two  separately tied plastic bags to prevent freezer burn and off-freezer odors.  Place the loaf of bread in a plastic bag, squeeze out all the air and twist the  top of the bag into a tight coil. Fold coiled part over itself; seal tightly  with a twist tie. Repeat the bagging a second time. This package is airtight,  making it possible to successfully freeze the loaf for as long as six months.  </P> <P> * For the best thawing results, thaw at room temperature, keeping the loaf of  bread in its wrappings.

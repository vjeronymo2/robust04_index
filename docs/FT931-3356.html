			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (20): On different tracks JANE'S WORLD RAILWAYS 1992-93 edited by Geoffrey Freeman Allen Jane's Data Division, Pounds 135/Dollars 225,826 pages SHIPPING LINES do not own ports, nor do they control the sea lanes; airlines do not own airports, nor do they control the air corridors; bus companies do not own the roads, nor do they control the traffic lights; so why should train operators need to own the railway tracks and control the signals? The answer, of course, is that they needn't. But do not try telling that to a railwayman or his friends. For as long as anyone can remember, railways have been run as vertically integrated operations; and that, as far as the railwayman is concerned, is the way they should stay. Thus Geoffrey Freeman Allen, as good a friend as the railways ever had, gets fired up to boiling point over Britain's plan to separate track from trains as part of the privatisation of British Rail. 'It will be astonishing . . . if any Continental European government, let alone its railway, views this as better than a dogma-driven exercise, utterly irrelevant to national need of a well-balanced multi-modal transport system, and a damper of any further technological exploration of rail transport's potential,' he says in his foreword to Jane's World Railways. It is a forlorn cry, and one that scarcely rings true: for as Mr Freeman Allen is obliged to acknowledge, the reality is that separating tracks from trains is catching on all over Europe. The Swedes, the Swiss and the Austrians have already done it, and the Germans, the Dutch and the Italians are planning it. For many (as for Britain), the long-term intention is to open up the tracks to private sector train operators in an attempt to inject competition, enterprise, innovation and investment into the industry. Huffing and puffing apart, however, this volume remains an indispensably handy guide to the world's railway industry. Perhaps what is really worrying Mr Freeman Allen is how long it will remain so; for if European governments' plans really do succeed in creating a golden age for the railways, the proliferation of entries for new track and train operators may lead to the need for a wheelbarrow to carry it around.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Government investigates possible abuses THE Italian government has begun an inquiry into whether Milan magistrates had behaved correctly in denying Mr Cagliari bail on five occasions and keeping him in prison for 133 days, writes Robert Graham. Mr Cagliari was found dead in his Milan prison cell on Tuesday. An autopsy carried out yesterday confirmed he had committed suicide. A formal announcement on the cause of death must wait 60 days; but officials said after the brief autopsy carried out in the presence of one of the Milan magistrates that Mr Cagliari had taken his life. The Milan magistrates themselves, clearly shaken by the suicide, were reported to be keen to have the inquiry - convinced they will be vindicated. This was the ninth suicide among those under investigation in the nationwide corruptions scandals. Mr Cagliari had been arrested on March 9 on charges of corruption, falsifying accounts and illicit financing of political parties and two other sets of similar charges were subsequently pressed relating to ENI. He admitted ENI had been used for illicit funding of political parties but refused to incriminate friends and colleagues. Press comment yesterday highlighted Mr Cagliari's suicide as a gesture of protest. 'It is appalling that in a civilised country one chooses to speak out using such a gesture,' commented La Stampa. Suicide in prison, the paper said, is a terrible gesture when it derives 'not from desperation but a rational decision'.</p>

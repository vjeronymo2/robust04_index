			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] According to Japan's KYODO on 12 April, North Korea  has turned its attention to Southeast Asia and the Middle East  and is making efforts to explore new markets in these areas.    Citing the Workers' Party of Korea's organ NODONG SINMUN  dated 7 April, KYODO reported: In his report delivered at the  seventh session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of North  Korea held on 6 April, Yi Song-tae, chairman of the External  Economic Committee, said, "We should concentrate efforts on  exploring markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, which  are close to our country, and whose trade conditions are  favorable to us, to firmly turn these regions into major markets  for our country's trade."    KYODO explained: Chairman Yi stressed the need to strengthen  relations with these two regions before mentioning trade  relations with China, Russia, and former East European  countries. This shows that North Korea has made a decision to  expand its trade with Southeast Asia and the Middle East as an  important strategy after adopting the new "trade-first" economic  policy.</p>

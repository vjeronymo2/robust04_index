			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR ROCK OF THE '90S IN L.A.;  </P> <P> RECORD PRODUCER RICK RUBIN LEFT N. Y. FOR A MORE VITAL SCENE  </P> <P> Heads turn as the large, imposing man with the long, unkempt hair and beard  steps from a car just before midnight on a seedy stretch of Hollywood  Boulevard.  </P> <P> The dozen or so people loitering around the entrance of a decaying building  don't appear the types to be easily intimidated. They're mostly men in their  20s who look at the world with expressionless gazes -- the epitome of L.A.  street cool.  </P> <P> But they clear a path for this visitor and whisper anxiously to each other as  he walks past them into the building, which houses rows of ragged, low-budget  rock 'n' roll rehearsal rooms.  </P> <P> While Rick Rubin may convey the menacing aura of a character in an urban  psycho-killer film, it's his reputation, not his appearance, that causes this  late-night buzz.  </P> <P> The guys who stepped back for Rubin are musicians, and they know a nod from  this man could lead to the break they've dreamed about for years.  </P> <P> At 26, the Long Island native is the patron saint of rock 'n' roll extremists:  a record producer who thinks bands should challenge, provoke and even offend.  </P> <P> Rubin was in the studio three years ago with the Beastie Boys when the  Manhattan rap trio combined the three styles that parents love to hate most --  punk, rap and heavy metal -- in "Licensed to Ill," as rowdy and irreverent an  album as ever made the national Top 10. Sales to date: more than 4 million  copies.  </P> <P> Rubin's name is also attached to Slayer's "Reign in Blood," a 1986 album so  outrageous that Columbia Records refused to release it. The L.A. speed-metal  band's collection -- reverberating with such themes as satanism, sadism and  death -- was finally released by Geffen Records.  </P> <P> "Who said rock 'n' roll was supposed to be nice?" Rubin said forcefully. "Rock  'n' roll is about going against the rules."  </P> <P> Among the other controversial and/or trailblazing acts that have been blessed  by the Rubin touch: rap stars Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J and Public Enemy.  </P> <P> But those credits go back to Rubin's New York days when, in addition to his  role as a free-lance producer, he was co-owner of Def Jam Records, easily the  hippest source of street-oriented pop in the '80s.  </P> <P> However, he left the East Coast last summer to concentrate on the hard rock  that was his first love. He has since launched his own Def American Records,  which is distributed by Geffen Records. To underscore his starting-over spirit,  he settled in Los Angeles, which he feels is a better rock 'n' roll town. It's  here that he hopes to make his new label, Def American, the cutting-edge record  company of the '90s.  </P> <P> "Rock 'n' roll doesn't exist in New York anymore," said Rubin, who lives in a  two-story, Mediterranean-style house just above the Sunset Strip. "When you  make a rock 'n' roll record in Manhattan, there is nowhere you can hear it on  the radio the way you can here on KNAC. There are also no good venues, no real  club scene happening.  </P> <P> "The 'in' places in New York are these upscale discos, where you see older  people in suits, drinking champagne. I hate that."  </P> <P> He finds L.A.'s dance clubs and bars more his speed. "Here, I like Bordello on  Thursday nights, the Cathouse on Tuesday nights. I love going to the Rainbow  and hanging out there because there's a real rock 'n' roll feel to the place."  </P> <P> Despite the move west, Rubin shows little evidence of tempering his radical  rock 'n' roll vision.  </P> <P> He still works with Slayer, and his other new bands -- including Danzig and  Masters of Reality -- are equally against the grain. (See related stories on  Page 77).  </P> <P> Despite his infatuation with the energy of the local scene, Rubin doesn't  expect to actually find many new bands for Def American in L.A. clubs. Two of  his most recent signings are from Chicago and England.  </P> <P> "The problem is that most of the musicians in L.A. are so aware of what's going  on in the music industry that they put a band together to get signed . . . a  band that reflects just what they think record companies are looking for," he  said. "That takes the adventure out of a band because they are more into making  a million dollars rather than into loving what they are doing or trying to  truly express themselves."  </P> <P> Rubin, however, is a fan of the controversial outlaw rap sounds coming out of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Passing the rehearsal building's broken elevator, Rubin headed for the stairs  and began the climb to the fourth floor, where one of his new Def American  signings was rehearsing.  </P> <P> "Let me tell you about Frank Starr, the singer in the band," he said. "I was at  the Rainbow bar one night and this guy Starr comes in. He had been in a fight  in the parking lot and his whole face and hands were covered with blood.  </P> <P> "He walks in and everybody's looking at him. So what does he do? He walks over  to the bar and started drinking like nothing had happened. Is that cool or not?  I knew this guy belonged on stage."  </P> <P> Rubin is one of the few people in rock who have become stars without stepping  on a stage. Or at least he hasn't been on stage since his Long Island high  school days when he fronted a band and did a few gigs at New York's legendary  punk palace, CBGB's.  </P> <P> Yet he has an image almost as menacing as Slayer itself.  </P> <P> "The Bloody Reign of Rick Rubin," declares the headline of a recent cover story  in Sounds, a British journal that leans toward hard rock. The accompanying  photo shows a grim-faced Rubin, his eyes covered by the trademark dark glasses  that he favors for photos.  </P> <P> The article itself suggests that no pop figure in this decade has "demonstrated  so complete or innate an understanding of contemporary black and white street  (ie., youth) musics."  </P> <P> Beneath the "beast on the loose" image, however, Rubin proves surprisingly  soft-spoken, with a gentle smile and soft eyes behind those shades.  </P> <P> Before the band rehearsal, he sat down for dinner at a modest Italian  restaurant in the Fairfax area and talked about the image. "I'm a fan of the  whole outlaw image of rock 'n' roll. I try to make outlaw records and I like to  act the part. It's part of the entertainment of it all, seeing all these  characters and living out fantasies.  </P> <P> "I live the life style. I even bought a dumb Dodge Charger because it's a '60s  muscle car -- complete with a magnum 440 engine, the biggest you can get for  it. At the bottom of it all, rock 'n' roll is saying 'screw you' to all the  rules that no one likes but most people end up following."  </P> <P> But what about the outlaw implications of heavy metal and rap, the two music  forms with which Rubin has been most closely identified? What about parents who  worry that all the emphasis on sex and violence will warp their kids?  </P> <P> "Art reflects culture, not the other way around," he said sharply. "Go through  the ages and you'll find the great works of art were always rooted in what was  going on at the time.  </P> <P> "Take N.W.A," he said of the rap band whose controversial "Straight Outta  Compton" album chronicles the gangbanger life style. "People point a finger at  the records, but what they don't like is Compton. When you start being scared  to let art reflect society, then something's wrong in the world, not in the  music."  </P> <P> Rubin wasn't born a rebel. He was raised in an upper-middle-class Long Island  family and was encouraged by his parents to be a lawyer. And he followed their  wishes all the way to New York University, where he majored in film.  </P> <P> But along the way he picked up a love for hard rock (particularly Aerosmith and  AC/DC) and the raw new rap sound that surfaced in New York in the late '70s.  </P> <P> While still in college, he started producing his own rap records -- and he did  well enough, critically and commercially, to have Columbia Records give him and  his partner, Russell Simmons, a seven-figure distribution deal for their Def  Jam label.  </P> <P> Rubin broke the news to his parents that he was going into the record business  by sending them a photostat of the first check he and Simmons received under  the Columbia agreement. It was a way of telling them that they shouldn't feel  he was throwing his life away just because he was skipping law school. The  amount of the check: a cool $600,000.  </P> <P> For the past four years, Def Jam has been a symbol of adventure and  independence in the record world. And Rubin, in the spirit of Phil Spector in  the '60s,established himself as one of the few producers whose name on a record  was a virtual guarantee of quality.  </P> <P> But Rubin and Simmons drifted in different directions and last year agreed to  dissolve their partnership -- a move that led to a series of rumors about bad  feelings between the two. Both, however, have since denied any ill will.  </P> <P> In starting over, Rubin has to prove himself again -- always a tricky matter in  the fast-changing pop world. When neither the Danzig nor Masters of Reality  albums exploded onto the charts (they have sold around 100,000 and 50,000  respectively), you could already pick up whispers that maybe Rubin was just  another of yesterday's heroes.  </P> <P> On the issue of pressure, Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen Records, said,  "(Rubin) has created an incredibly (high level) benchmark for himself with the  success he has had in the past. It doesn't mean he is going to (match that  level) on every record, but -- with someone who has this much talent and vision  at such a young age, there is no reason he won't do even better."  </P> <P> Inside the Hollywood Boulevard rehearsal hall, Rubin listened to Starr's band,  the Four Horsemen, a name suggested by Rubin in honor of some stars of pro  wrestling, one of his passions. The tiny room was filled with amplifiers, all  turned so loud that it was virtually impossible to hear Starr's vocals.  </P> <P> But Rubin heard enough to make some suggestions about the arrangements. He  spoke in a low-key way, but the musicians listened intently, knowing how often  he has been right before.  </P> <P> After three songs, Rubin said good night and headed back down the stairs,  ignoring the curious glances of the musicians still standing by the entrance.  </P> <P> He got in the car and headed to another Hollywood rehearsal hall to check on  the progress of Trouble, also part of his Def American stable. It's a Christian  rock band, but nothing like Stryper, which offers a wholesome image and tosses  Bibles to the crowd.  </P> <P> "These guys don't preach at all," Rubin said. "Their roots are more Black  Sabbath than anything else. If you read their lyrics, they're all about  suicide. It's not an optimistic view. The songs are about being confused and  not knowing if 'I can make it on any more, but when I die, I know I'll find my  way.' That's heavy."  </P> <P> Before going into the studio, Rubin paused and reflected again on the the  pressure on him at Def American.  </P> <P> "Every time I think about this business, I realize the important thing for me  is to keep remembering what has worked for me until now," he said.  </P> <P> "It's not trying to figure out what other people are going to like. I don't  think anyone is that smart, though everyone in this business spends most of  their time doing that. My success has always been based on making records that  I like. The bottom line has to be flipping in a cassette, turning it up and  loving it . . . and counting on enough other people to think the same way I  do."  </P></p>

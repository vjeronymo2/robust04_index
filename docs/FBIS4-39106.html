			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" daily), 06/04/94  -- A CSCE delegation, consisting of Colonel Heikki Happonen  (Finland) and Piotr Iwaszkiewicz (Poland) arrived to Idzhevan on  June 3.    Head of the delegation Happonen declared during the meeting  with the Chairman of the Idzhevan District Council that the CSCE  is ready to station observers in the conflict zone within a  short period of time.    An observers point will be created in Idzhevan, and the  delegation arrived to Ijevan to resolve corresponding technical  problems.    According to Happonen, thanks to the efforts of CSCE, Russia  and all other countries interested in peaceful regulation of the  Karabakh conflict, the peace has never been as close as today.  And failing its implementation today would mean causing a  disaster to the whole region.    Colonel also declared that a similar delegation is currently  working in Azerbaijan and, hopefully, the CSCE observers and CIS  disengagement forces will be stationed along the whole Karabakh-  Azeri front line.</p>

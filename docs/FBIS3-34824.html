In his speech during the debate on Bonsia,  which began at the UN Security Council last night, Pakistan's  deputy ambassador at the United Nations, Sher Afghan, said in  effective terms that those who do not fulfill their  responsibility to prevent the aggression against Bosnia will be  remembered in history as supporters of the aggressive Serb  forces. He said only by complete use of force, especially by  air strikes, can the Serbs be forced to implement the Security  Council resolutions. In this regard, significant moral,  political, and legal responsibility rest with those powers, who  have the necessary resources to get the relevant Security  Council resolutions implemented.    Sher Afghan said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish  Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller visited Sarajevo on 2  February, which reflects their concern about the struggle of the  people and the government in Bosnia. On this occasion, both the  prime ministers urged the international community to protect the  sovereignty, solidarity, regional security, and political  independence of Bosnia and to take effective steps to prevent  genocide. He said Pakistan strongly believes that inaction  against the aggressors is tantamount to justifying aggression  and hence in Pakistan's view, the establishment of peace in the  besieged country is the combined responsibility of the entire  international community. The Pakistani representative said the  massacres and annihilation, along with the destruction and  devastation committed by the Serbian forces in Bosnia has  reached such an extent that now, there is no other choice than  to take joint action at a global level. The Pakistani  representative added that the arms embargo against Bosnia is  against the UN Charter which has deprived the country, which has  been the victim of aggression, of its legitimate right to its  own defense.    Sher Afghan expressed the hope that the international  tribunal will soon begin its hearing on the cases against the  perpetrators of brutal crimes in the former Yugoslavia.  Pakistan's Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has already  pledged $1 million for the expenses of the tribunal. Sher  Afghan said the international community should pay similar  attention to the security of the civilian population in all the  safe havens declared by the United Nations and other cities and  towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Voicing full support once again  for the principled stand of the Bosnian Government, the  Pakistani representative said its constructive and flexible  tendency at the talks are praiseworthy.</p>

"If the democrats had been united and had run the election  campaign better, the president would be in a better position  now," he said.    Gaydar, who intends to concentrate on parliamentary work  now,  emphasized that Russia's Choice had to formulate a clear-cut  position for itself. "There was uncertainty about the position  of our parliamentary group when it could not be said for sure if  we are in power or in opposition and we were held responsible  for decisions which we did not make," he said. Now, he said,  the group was in constructive opposition and could criticize the  cabinet.    Gaydar dismissed rumors of a split in the group. Only two  men, Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, left for the December 12  Union, a group "which votes almost the way we do." He thought  that for a group of 78 this did not amount to a split.    Commenting on the latest Duma decisions Gaydar said: "It is  funny that the Duma discussed so thoroughly the well-being of  the deputies and 'lavish' provisions for them were advocated by  the communists and other left-wing parties. Despite the  resistance mounted by Russia's Choice and my own speeches they  secured a resounding victory in this issue."</p>

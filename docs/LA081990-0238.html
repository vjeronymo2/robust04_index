			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELL TV TIMES: HOW DO YOU RATE DAYTIME'S TALK SHOWS?  </P> <P> Daytime talkshows survive when they generate loyalty among viewers. So we want  to know which shows strike your fancy, day after day. From Oprah to Geraldo  (below), Phil to Sally, Joan to Regis, what talk-show hosts do you tune in and  which ones turn you off -- and why?  </P> <P> Here are the responses to the July 29 question: What films would you like to  see on television?  </P> <P> I would like to see "Hold Back the Dawn." It was a 3-star picture made in 1941  starring Olivia de Havilland, Charles Boyer and Paulette Goddard.  </P> <P> It's a love story that was shown often on TV during the late U50s and early  '60s. It is one of my all-time favorite movies.  </P> <P> I'd also like to see uncut versions of "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment."  Mary Woldum, Buena Park  </P> <P> Hold Back the Dawn" occasionally is shown in late-late time slots on KTLA  Channel 5.  </P> <P> Older is better.  </P> <P> The films I'd like to see, in order, are: "The Three Faces of Eve" (Joanne  Woodward); "Imitation of Life" (Claudette Colbert); "Green Dolphin Street"  (Lana Turner); "Lillian Russell" (Alice Faye); "Devotion" (Olivia de  Havilland); "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" (Daniel Day Lewis); "In This  House of Brede" (Diana Rigg), and "The Winter's Tale" (Laurence Harvey).  </P> <P> Dick Vaughn, San Clemente  </P> <P> Mark your calendar. KCAL has scheduled "The Three Faces of Eve" on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Innumerable times, old movies with a World War II theme have been shown with  William Holden, but the romantic themes seem to be ignored on TV.  </P> <P> Nancy Kwan's interpretation of the sad little Hong Kong prostitute who  fantasized that she came from a different world was very touching in "The World  of Suzie Wong" with Holden.  </P> <P> I would love to see it again and so would friends and acquaintances.  </P> <P> Irys Strange, Morro Bay  </P> <P> Here are some movies I can't get on video and would love to see: "Othello"  (Laurence Olivier); "Interlude" (Oskar Werner); "Three Sisters" (Olivier); "The  Hunchback of Notre Dame" (Anthony Hopkins), and "The Secret Garden" (Gennie  James).  </P> <P> Barbara Bonfield, Laguna Beach  </P> <P> What films would I like to see on television? Old science-fiction, anything  made before 1950. I live in Newport Beach and while we have a couple of  shopping channels, we don't get (Rcan't" get, the cable company assures me)  American Movie Classics or The Movie Channel, which invariably have the best  old science-fiction movies.  </P> <P> Last Halloween there were 14 movies I was aching to see and the cable networks  available to me carried one of them. I was not pleased!  </P> <P> Michael Wagner, Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on statements made by Nikolay Petrovich Shmelev, </F> corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, by  Viktor Mironov: "Russia Is at a Dead End. And For a Long time"]    [Text] Frankly speaking, I had planned at first to  interview Nikolay Petrovich Shmelev. But after listening to the  first "chords" of his impassioned and emotional speech and  seeing how he painstakingly wiped the drops of perspiration from  his forehead with a handkerchief, I changed my mind. Let the  corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences express  his views on the painful problems of our society. But I have  assumed responsibility for systematizing the opinions of the  noted Russian economist and presenting them for your attention.  Now then!    No Illusions. As strange as it seems, I now hold a  cautiously optimistic view of the situation in Russia. I think  we reached the bottom of our national political crisis last  fall. The threat of a total catastrophe now is less real than it  was before, it seems to me. Nevertheless, our leaders and  society as a whole have to become used to the idea that the  current crisis in Russia will continue not for years or even  decades, but for two or three generations. That is, we are  doomed to live under conditions of permanent crisis for the  present.    What is most tragic is that we are beginning to realize the  uselessness and inviability of a substantial part of the vast  economic potential which we accumulated over the past seven  decades. According to various assessments, from one-third to  two-thirds of this potential should be either dismantled or  drastically modernized. This will require a lot of time, a  tremendous amount of patience, and a pile of money, but it  cannot be helped. As regrettable as it seems, for example,  Vorkuta, which has 85 percent of its expenses covered by the  budget, should be shut down. This same fate awaits the Moscow  Coal Basin and the lion's share of our ferrous metallurgy and  defense industry. The most favorable predictions indicate that  in agriculture, a minimum of 75 percent of the kolkhozes and  sovkhozes are doomed to a slow death.    For this reason, I support those allegedly conservative  circles of economists who are repeatedly mentioning the vital  necessity of a well-thought-out industrial policy. Simply  stated, someone in our country should decide whom to support for  a year, whom to support for 5 years, and someone must be helped  to die tomorrow.    Between the Hammer and the Anvil. No government  today, no matter whether it is headed by Chernomyrdin, Zyuganov,  Zhirinovskiy, or Gaydar, will be able to provide for the  classic, normal choice between inflation and unemployment. After  all, no one knows where this acceptable level of inflation is.  It is clear that the less inflation the better, but we cannot  get along without it now; otherwise, it is impossible to  maintain the vast unprofitable sector of our economy. Unless we  begin the process of bankruptcy, of shutting down entire sectors  of industry and even cities, there can be no discussion about  any normalization of the Russian economy. But such measures will  lead to an avalanche of unemployment. A paradox!    I have only sympathy for Chernomyrdin. He stated that this  dilemma should be resolved. However, this is tantamount to  walking on a razor blade. A step to the left means  hyperinflation, and a step to the right means a social explosion  because of unacceptable unemployment. It is at the level of 5 to  6 percent at present, but it should climb at least to 12  percent. How will the public react to this increase?    For this reason, in my view, the question is as follows:  what  level of unemployment can the Russian society withstand, and  what level of inflation can it forgive the government for?    "Veneer." Our monetary system must be normalized  without delay. No economy can function normally with a sick  currency. Gaydar managed to cure the financial system somewhat  at the price of "eating up" all the public's savings, but this  was obviously inadequate.    First of all, we have to restore incentives to save our  Russian rubles so that they are competitive and constantly in  circulation. I was in a group of economists which at one time  suggested that we repeat the successful experiment of the 1920's  and issue hard convertible currency at the same time. Over a  period of 1.5 to 2 years, it would completely force the  compromised "veneer" out of the market. Then we would be able to  normalize the monetary system naturally.    And one more problem associated with this--the universal  dollarization of the Russian economy. Such a thing can only be  imagined in an insane asylum, when a foreign currency is used in  practically all trade and economic operations. Dollars make up  more than half of what is now in circulation. They make up over  50 percent of all the cash in the country. Crazy!    Where Are the Property Owners? I am very skeptical  about the current privatization strategy. Vouchers have played  their role, that is, they brought down the social tension, but  only that. They simply palmed off some illusion on the people in  the form of the notorious voucher.    A more difficult problem is linked with our industrial  monsters. As an example, in order to privatize 10 large  companies, M. Thatcher needed 10 years. But what is to be done  with our industrial facilities, which are probably a little  tougher than the English ones? Will 10 decades be needed?    But many of my colleagues and I are worried about something  else. In the sphere of classic business and private initiative,  nothing has actually changed. Where are the private industrial  enterprises in the cities, and where are the large farms in  rural areas? Opening a small candle works today is just as hard  as it was 60 years ago. The government of democrats, with their  loud declarations about liberalism, the market, and free  enterprise, have done nothing to alleviate the situation. They  have simply driven private initiative to trade on the corners  and in Luzhniki.    So they are pushing private capital out of industry and they  are not giving it any space or any protection from the criminal  and state rackets. Plus the taxation in the stratosphere. Well,  think of it: a law-abiding private entrepreneur must give the  state up to 90 percent of all his income. With such an  apportionment in the world, no one will ever work.    One Blanket for a Pair. I have not believed in  Tatar separatism or Sverdlovsk or Yakutsk separatism for a  single day. The passions surrounding the division are nothing  but political games based on a simple question: how do we divide  the money (taxes) between the center and subjects of the  federation? Moscow has traditionally taken 85 to 90 percent of  the taxes, leaving crumbs for the localities. For this reason,  we are also doomed to resolve this problem in a civilized  manner, as in other normal countries, roughly in this manner: 40  percent to Moscow and the rest to the regions. But this has not  been constituted yet and it paves the way for various local  conflicts, from which separatism springs up. I assure you that  when the question of taxes is settled sensibly, we will forget  all our fears about the Far Eastern, Urals, and Yakutsk  republics.    Back in the USSR. Economic reintegration and  restoration of the former Soviet Union in the sense of an  economic alliance is a matter of time, and very little time, I  fear. Experience has shown that without the subsidies which the  former Soviet republics received regularly for decades from  Russia, they simply would not be able to survive. These  subsidies were roughly equivalent to an average $50 billion  annually . Kazakhstan received 11 billion of the "green,"  Ukraine 7 billion, and Lithuania $3.5 billion. And there is no  kind uncle who will pay the deficit in their balance of payments  to Russia. Even the Armenians are having no success in this  direction, although they have the largest and most sympathetic  diaspora in the world. For this reason, the CIS countries are  doomed to establish a common economic space similar to the  Common Market in Europe.    But does Russia need this? Are Russians in a position to  bear  the return of this burden of subsidies? Even our radical leaders  are not prepared now for restoration of the previous integrated  system.    Protectionism Or Competition.    We have proclaimed the opening of the Russian economy. But  this gesture showed that we are not standing up to world  competition in the market. At the same time, only foreign  competition will be able to force the wheels of our economy to  turn. We can understand those who demand protection from it and  those who categorically speak out on its behalf. For example,  our electronics industry has already been stifled by Japanese  products, and there are innumerable cases such as this. In this  connection, it is very important to find the golden mean which  applies to the Russian economy.    In our time, no one dares to shut down our economic system  completely, and a degree of protectionism is part of the  political boldness of our leaders and political groups for this  reason.    [Mironov] This was the "cheerful" conversation with Nikolay  Shmelev. Our life was depicted in such pessimistic shades that I  could not help but ask:    "Nikolay Petrovich, there is still hope for us to overcome  this crisis faster, all the same. Perhaps some strong  personality is in a position to do this? After all, don't we  have obvious examples in Chile, Turkey, and South Korea?"    [Shmelev] Well, some general with his sword drawn will come  along on his white horse. They will begin chopping off heads and  military tribunals and all kinds of punitive actions will begin.  Well, what good will he be able to do for the country? Except to  crush organized crime, and that is possible. But he will not be  able to solve those problems which we have been talking about.  No, we do not need this...</p>

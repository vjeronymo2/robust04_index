			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany leads European turnover gains - A look at the continued upsurge in bourse activity Reflecting a 6.4 per cent advance by the FT-Actuaries Europe index in July, turnover in Europe's top eight equity markets rose strongly for the second month in succession. A rise of 20.8 per cent for the month follows one of 20.3 per cent in June, and a fall of 2.5 per cent in May against April, when markets seemed shaken by their sheer ebullience in the early months of this year. Turnover on Seaq International, the London-based screen dealing system, rose by 21.8 per cent for the seven Contental markets, notes Mr James Cornish, a strategist with NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures. This, he says, means that London activity rose slightly as a percentage of the domestic markets, underlining the strong interest of international investors. Germany was the headline performer in volume terms over the month, a 43.2 per cent rise in turnover comparing with a share price gain for the market which was slightly below average, at 5.8 per cent in local currency terms. France, which showed a 5.6 per cent gain, saw slightly lower turnover on the month, the clear inference for Germany being that share price appreciation was less important to buyers, short-term, than other considerations. The German equities team at Kleinwort Benson Research says as much. 'Liquidity has pushed the market ever higher,' it says, but the DAX index has yet to revisit its all-time high and this sets Germany apart from many other major European markets.' In Frankfurt, the month started with key interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank, but turnover did not start to motor until almost a week later as it became widely perceived that US and UK investors, underweight in German stocks, had changed their asset allocation policies. In the end, the month came out 61 per cent higher than the previous three-month average, and only 2.8 per cent below the record level of January, 1990 in the euphoria following the opening of the Berlin wall. There were strong performances elsewhere. The Netherlands saw a gain of 27.8 per cent, 31 per cent over the previous three months, as the market rushed to buy cyclical stocks; trading in Dutch stocks in London continued to rise as a share of domestic volume, notes Mr Cornish. In Belgium, with the market up 3.6 per cent, turnover rose 23.6 per cent to a level not seen since March. Italian turnover climbed 15.6 per cent to a record high, 31.2 per cent on its three-month average as the share price index reocred after a fall in June. UK activity rose on interest rate hopes, and its Swiss counterpart on this year's phenomenal interest in bank shares. Spain joined France on the downtrend as economic uncertainty put stock markets in the shade.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Apr         May         Jun         Jul       US                      1993        1993        1993        1993  dollars                                                                     bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium             58.18       40.98       50.65       59.86     1.63 France             117.45      122.95      154.32      151.18    25.39 Germany            113.50      104.40      131.80      188.75   108.41 Italy            31,098.4    19,665.6    30,864.8    35,687.2    22.12 Netherlands         16.80       15.70       16.90       21.60    11.01 Spain              598.87    1,116.74      844.84      806.04     5.56 Switzerland         14.00       16.70       24.80       26.90    17.68 UK                  38.79       40.62       41.86       45.99    68.26  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

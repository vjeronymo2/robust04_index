			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons completes sale Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, will this week inform the Stock Exchange of the completion of its plans to sell three of its drinks businesses to management in a Pounds 140m deal, writes Christopher Price. Plans for the sale were first announced by the company in November as part of a restructuring exercise which involved a refocusing of Allied's strategy around its international brands. The deal involves Showerings, the UK's third largest cider business, being sold to its management headed by managing director Mr John Wilkinson. VPW, which produces British wines, and Warninks, Dutch manufacturer of advocaat, are also included in the buy-out.</p>

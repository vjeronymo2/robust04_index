			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided to announce--jointly  with Indonesia and Australia--a proposal on setting up a "PKO  [Peacekeeping Operations] Center" in the Asia-Pacific region at  the "ASEAN region forum" to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in  late July. The PKO Center will enable the ASEAN forum  participating nations to conduct joint exercises on UN-required  PKO, and exchange information relating to them.    The government will present this concept first at the  high-level working meeting for the ASEAN expanded foreign  ministers' conference to be held in Bangkok 22 May.    Explaining the decision to propose the inauguration of the  PKO Center, a Foreign Ministry source noted: "With the Cold War  ended, the international community is now in quest of a new  world order. Meanwhile, there are increasing conflicts and  confrontations over territorial, ethnic, or religious issues,  and there is a growing need for PKO."    What the PKO Center is hoped to achieve is: 1) to enable PKO  personnel to improve mutual communications by conducting joint  exercises, thus enabling them to have smooth relations with each  other at the PKO sites; 2) to enable the Asian nations to have a  better understanding on the Japanese Self-Defense Forces'  participation in PKO; 3) and to enable the Japanese Government  to gain information on the areas where PKO are ongoing or are  expected to be undertaken, thus providing useful information to  Japan--which has to meet five conditions to participate in PKO  under law--in making decisions as to whether it should or should  not take part in certain operations.    As far as the government is concerned, it also hopes to get  public agreement domestically on the question of the country  participating more actively in PKO, and thus hopes to use this  opportunity as an stimulus in getting the current PKO Law  revised next year. The law bans the country's participation in  UN peacekeeping forces (PKF).    The forthcoming ASEAN forum will turn out to be the first  security talks in the Asia-Pacific region, and member nations of  the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference and other  countries, such as China, Russia, and Vietnam, are expected to  attend. The holding of the forum was agreed on at the last  session of the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference.  The most important purpose for the forum is for the  participating nations to exchange views on security situations,  and to gain mutual trust among these nations. As a specific way  to build up trust among the nations, the Japanese Government  wants to propose setting up the PKO Center, and also to discuss  the topics of ensuring transparancy in defense policies by  requiring the nations to issue defense white papers, and holding  meetings of defense-related personnel and conducting mutual  exchanges. Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa at the forum.</p>

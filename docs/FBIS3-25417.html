Addressing a media briefing at ANC headquarters, Mr Ramaphosa  disclosed that the ANC met government negotiators on Thursday  and will meet them again on Friday to thrash out a reformulation  of provincial powers.    Parliament would sit in 10 days time to pass the amendments  as well as an amendment to the electoral act which will give  parties another opportunity to register for the April elections.    Mr Ramaphosa said an ANC delegation was meeting a delegation  of the Bophuthatswana government in Rustenburg on Friday to  discuss concessions announced by ANC President Nelson Mandela  this week.    Another ANC delegation is meeting the Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front] on Friday. And an ANC delegation headed by  Deputy Secretary General Jacob Zuma would shortly meet a  delegation of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    Mr Ramaphosa again warned that attempts to disrupt the  elections would not be tolerated.</p>

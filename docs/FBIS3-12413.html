This massacre falls within the framework and development of  the settlement policy. Most important, it took place as a  result of the decision of the Israeli Government and army to  give the green light to the settlers to persecute our  defenseless people.    Anyone who reminds himself of past events will be able to  recall ugly scenes similar to the one that took place yesterday  in full view of the world. Thus, it is wrong to wonder if the  Israeli Government is responsible for the terrible massacre  yesterday. The Israeli Government is not only responsible for  the massacre, it was involved in it, proven by the pictures that  have been beamed by international media organs, pictures that  remind people of despicable Nazism. These are pictures of the  Israeli Army protecting the settlers who, in civilian clothes,  were hitting Palestinians with sticks, kicking them, opening  fire on them, and attacking their vehicles.    Thus, it is important to view the massacre as an official  Israeli massacre for it was conducted on the one hand under the  protection of the Israeli Army and police, which do not leave  the Ibrahimi shrine unprotected [as heard]; on the other hand,  it was a natural development of the policy of using the settlers  as a means of terrorism and spreading fear among Palestinians as  well as to intimidate them. The settlers were thereby able to  do what the Israeli officials could not do publicly.    Furthermore, the martyrs who fell at the Ibrahimi shrine  were  not the only victims of yesterday, a black day in the holy month  of Ramadan. What about those who were killed or injured in  front of hospitals and those who fell during the confrontation  between the Israeli Army and police and those who went out to  express their outrage? The Israeli Army and police killed them  deliberately and clearly in front of the cameras.    Thus, the problem of settlement should become the most  important topic on the agenda of the talks as no negotiations  will proceed in the right diretion without first resolving such  a problem. No progress or development in negotiations will take  place as long as such a problem is not resolved in a way that  will prevent the Israeli Government from using the settlements  to carry out more massacres for political aims.    Some people believed, however, that disarming the settlers  would be enough; such a view would not resolve the core of the  problem because settlements were set up as military projects  with a number of functions: to intervene by using terror and  repression. Therefore, disarming them cannot be guaranteed by  anyone, and we cannot be assured that yesterday's atrocity will  not be repeated.    Therefore, the removal of all settlements is the most  correct  and the most urgent matter, particularly given the fact that  negotiations will be taking place later about the future of the  settlements. However, in negotiations there are usually  problems and developments that will make their progress  dependent on whether there is a need to continue with the  negotiations themselves or not. [sentence as heard]    Nevetheless, if removing the settlements is hard to achieve,  then an agreement should at least be reached on the protection  of our people--by an international force sent by the United  Nations to protect our people from these wanton, terrible, and  racist aggressions that have been carried out by the settlers  with the Rabin government's protection and participation--until  talks about the future of the settlement are held in accordance  with the timetable agreed upon between the PLO and the Israelis.    This could be a price that our people might accept, given  the  amount of killing, savagery, racism, and religious fanaticism,  which is focused on the annihilation of the Palestinian people  by killing them while they were praying their god.    A fanatic Israeli organization announced responsibility for  the massacre shortly after it was committed. This means that  the massacre was also plotted by the settlers and not the  government alone. This should lead us to a very interesting  question about the nature of Israel and how we should deal with  the Israeli Government: Should we deal with it as a state or  merely as a party, a faction, or an organization for as long as  the settlers hold tens of thousands of weapons which can be used  at any time for public and premeditated killing, by an  individual or by a group, of our defenseless Palestinian people.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN DRUG SALES HELD AFTER BANG-UP CHASE  </P> <P> A man described as a "significant" drug trafficker has been arrested after he  attempted to run down two federal agents in the Fairfax District during a vain  bid for escape in which his car rammed eight other vehicles, authorities said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Investigators said that Dario DiCesare, 46, "managed to injure himself in the  process," suffering a scalp cut, but other than a bump on one federal agent's  head, no other injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Mike Holm, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, said  DiCesare, an Italian citizen who has been living in a $1-million home on Hidden  Valley Place in the Hollywood Hills, had been under surveillance for about six  months when agents saw him apparently buy some cocaine from three men in the  Beverly Hills area at about 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  </P> <P> After a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter team joined in the  surveillance, DiCesare realized that he was being followed, dumped the cocaine  in a trash dumpster and took off at high speed, followed by DEA agents in  federal cars, Holm said.  </P> <P> "He saw us attempting to make an arrest," Holm said. "He had a big Lincoln, and  he just started banging into our cars -- he totaled one of our cars. I guess he  didn't want to be taken into custody."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lincoln Disabled  </P> <P> Officials said the collisions with two federal cars and six other vehicles  disabled the Lincoln enough to discourage DiCesare, and he came to a halt at  Waring and Orange Grove avenues, where he was arrested.  </P> <P> Holm said the agents DiCesare tried to run down were in one of the federal cars  that he rammed.  </P> <P> Twelve kilos of cocaine, valued at about $180,000, were recovered from the  dumpster, Holm said.  </P> <P> After treatment for the cut, DiCesare was being held in federal custody.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multiple Charges  </P> <P> Steve Bushendorf, a DEA group supervisor, said Wednesday that charges of drug  trafficking, cocaine possession and assault on federal officers were being  prepared against the suspect.  </P> <P> DiCesare was arrested in 1983 at a hotel room in Glendale, where police  confiscated 36 pounds of cocaine. Investigators said DiCesare arrived as  detectives were searching the room, and he was released without charge because  of insufficient evidence.  </P></p>

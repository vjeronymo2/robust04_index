			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Emess hit by interest and exceptional charges EMESS, the lighting and electrical accessories company, yesterday reported a 43.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to end-December because of higher interest charges and exceptional charges from relocating its US consumer lighting company. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 4.2m on sales of Pounds 160m (Pounds 165m). Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 2.2p (3.5p) while the final dividend was cut from 2.2p to 0.35p making a total of 1p (3.5p). Net debt at the year-end was Pounds 33m, resulting in gearing of 58 per cent which the group plans to reduce through non-core disposals. Interest charges rose from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 4.2m. A profit of Pounds 3.3m from the sale of the UK's graphics business was not enough to offset Pounds 2.9m of costs from the closure of the UK consumer business; Pounds 300,000 loss on the sale of a long-term investment in the UK and Pounds 2.2m of costs from restructuring and relocating the US consumer business. The overall losses were taken as an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.1m. The disposal of Imperial Graphics to Kolon of Korea in December for Pounds 7m was too late to affect last year's results. Mr Michael Meyer, the chairman, said it had been a 'dreadful year' for Alsy, the US lighting company, but said the group had taken determined action to improve performance by moving the manufacturing facilities to Pennsylvania.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family Guaranteed equity investment  - At a glance Shearson Lehman Brothers launched a new guaranteed equity investment this week. Using FT-SE futures and zero-coupon bonds, it offers investors a 3 per cent annual yield, plus the full gain in the FT-SE over five years. If the FT-SE falls, investors will receive their original capital back. The FT-SE Fixed Assured Note (FAN) allows investors to choose to be repaid at a certain level, if they feel the FT-SE has peaked, and there will also be a secondary market in the notes which should give investors another option if they wish to sell early. A number of 'guaranteed' equity products have been launched recently, and a free guide to them is available from advisers Brooks Macdonald Gayer, based in London W1.</p>
